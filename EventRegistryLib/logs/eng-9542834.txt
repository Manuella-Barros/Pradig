More than 100 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green were arrested last month, and similar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC early Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages.

Pro-Palestinian demonstrators, numbering over 100, were arrested last month after camping out on Columbia's green. Similar protests have erupted at universities across the US, as institutions grapple with balancing free expression and campus safety.\n\nThe move by Columbia mirrors actions taken by the University of Southern California (USC), which recently canceled its main graduation ceremony due to similar protests. USC students vacated their encampment early Sunday under threat of arrest after being surrounded by law enforcement.\n\nThe protests have been sparked by the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, which began on October 7. Hamas militants' attacks on southern Israel led to Israeli retaliatory strikes in Gaza.

But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nColumbia's decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president, Minouche Shafik, from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week.\n\nNoting that the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said in its announcement that it made the decision after discussions with students.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" officials said. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers.\"\n\nMost of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 5 miles north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.\n\nSpeakers at some of Columbia's still-scheduled graduation ceremonies include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames, former CNN anchor Poppy Harlow, political scientist Ian Bremmer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nAlso, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia's Teachers College.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks.\n\nSimilar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC on Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday, while in Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags as Northeastern University held its commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, disruptions continued Monday following the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian encampment and some 200 arrests last week. Police detained numerous people in a parking structure. The university also said classes in one building, Monroe Hall, would move online \"due to ongoing disruptions\" but did not provide details.\n\nAlso Monday, police cleared a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of California, San Diego, and arrested more than 30 people, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nHamas announced Monday that it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal to halt the war in Gaza, but Israel did not immediately comment.

Our Deans and other colleagues who work directly with our students have been discussing plans with student leaders, and, most importantly, listening. Based on their feedback, we have decided to make the centerpiece of our Commencement activities our Class Days and school-level ceremonies, where students are honored individually alongside their peers, rather than the University-wide ceremony that is scheduled for May 15.\n\nOur students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families. They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers. As a result, we will focus our resources on those school ceremonies and on keeping them safe, respectful, and running smoothly.\n\nThe announcement also stated:\n\nThese past few weeks have been incredibly difficult for our community. Just as we are focused on making our graduation experience truly special, we continue to solicit student feedback and are looking at the possibility of a festive event on May 15 to take the place of the large, formal ceremony.\n\nPro-Palestine protests at Columbia University resulted in a fraught, sometimes toxic environment for students as the pitch of the tone became more and more heightened and the threat of police action loomed. Encampments on campus were eventually cleared by law enforcement on April 30 after protestors -- some students, some not -- occupied Hamilton Hall. Over 100 arrests were made related to the protests.", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (music)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24123572829061-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 113, "textEnd": 119, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1790, "textEnd": 1798}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its campus quadrangle in Atlanta to a suburban arena. But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nColumbia's decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president, Nemat Shafik, from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week.\n\nNoting that the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said in its announcement that it made the decision after discussions with students.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" officials said. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers.\"\n\nMost of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.\n\nSpeakers at some of Columbia's still-scheduled graduation ceremonies include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames, former CNN anchor Poppy Harlow, political scientist Ian Bremmer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health. Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia's Teachers College.\n\nColumbia had already cancelled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks, and similar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC early Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday, while in Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags as Northeastern University held its commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, disruptions continued Monday following the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian encampment and some 200 arrests last week. Police detained numerous people in a parking structure. The university also said classes held in one building, Monroe Hall, would move online \"due to ongoing disruptions\" but did not provide details.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nHamas announced Monday that it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari proposal for a cease-fire to halt the war in Gaza. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the deal, and details of the proposal have not yet been released.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the quad on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members.

The majority of the ceremonies, which had been set to take place on its upper Manhattan campus, where most of the protests have taken place, will take place at the main athletic complex about five miles (8 km) away.\n\nThe demonstrations have emerged as a political flashpoint during a contentious U.S. election year as Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican former U.S President Donald Trump face off in rematch for the White House. Republican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson -- who\n\ncondemned Columbia's administrators, accusing them of being too lenient on demonstrators during a campus visit in April -- blasted them again on Monday, saying the decision to cancel commencement denied thousands of graduates the recognition they deserved.\n\nJohnson also called on the school's board of trustees to remove university President Nemat Minouche Shafik, adding that the cancellation showed she would rather \"cede control to Hamas supporters than restore order.\" New York City police cleared a Columbia building last week that had been barricaded by pro-Palestinian protesters, arresting more than 100 people in and around the campus and dismantling an encampment.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, where pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian protesters clashed last week and where police arrested more than 200 people while clearing a pro-Palestinian encampment on Thursday, Chancellor Gene Block on Sunday announced a new Office of Campus Safety. A former Sacramento, California, police chief, Rick Braziel, will lead the office and report directly to Block.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its Atlanta campus to a suburban arena. But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nColumbia's decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president, Minouche Shafik, from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week.\n\nNoting that the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said it made the decision after discussions with students.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" officials said. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers.\"\n\nMost of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.\n\nSpeakers at some of Columbia's still-scheduled graduation ceremonies include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames, former CNN anchor Poppy Harlow, political scientist Ian Bremmer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health. Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia's Teachers College.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks.\n\nSimilar encampments sprouted up elsewhere as universities struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities. Students abandoned their camp at USC on Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday. In Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags at Northeastern University's commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nThe University of California, Los Angeles, alerted students Monday that all classes were moving online due to ongoing disruptions following the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian encampment last week. The university police force reported 44 arrests but there were no specific details, UCLA spokesperson Eddie North-Hager said in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nAlso Monday, police cleared a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of California, San Diego, and arrested more than 30 people, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nHamas announced Monday that it accepted an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal to halt the war in Gaza, but there was no immediate word from Israel, leaving it uncertain whether a deal had been sealed.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the campus quadrangle on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members. Police used pepper balls and electric stun guns to subdue some of the people who were arrested. Fenves later apologized.\n\nProtests have continued on the campus since then, including some additional arrests.\n\nSchools are trying various tactics from appeasement to threat of disciplinary action to get protestors to take down encampments or move to campus areas where demonstrations would be less intrusive.\n\nThe School of the Art Institute of Chicago said in a Facebook post Sunday that it offered protesters \"amnesty from academic sanction and trespassing charges\" if they moved.\n\n\"Many protesters left the premises of their own accord after being notified by the police that they were trespassing and subject to arrest,\" the school said. \"Those that remained were arrested after multiple warnings to leave, including some of whom we recognized as SAIC students.\"\n\nA group of faculty and staff members at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill asked the administration for amnesty for any students who were arrested and suspended during recent protests. UNC Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine said in a media advisory that it would deliver a letter on behalf of more than 500 faculty who support the student activists.\n\nOther universities took a different approach.\n\nHarvard University's interim president, Alan Garber, warned student's Monday that those participating in a pro-Palestinian encampment in Harvard Yard could face \"involuntary leave.\" That means they may would not be allowed on campus, could lose their student housing and may not be able to take exams, Garber said.\n\nAt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, police restricted access to an encampment after a school deadline for them to leave had passed.

Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its Atlanta campus to a suburban arena. Others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nColumbia's decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president, Minouche Shafik, from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week. The Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said it made the decision after discussions with students.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" officials said. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers.\"\n\nMost of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.\n\nSpeakers at some of Columbia's still-scheduled graduation ceremonies include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames, former CNN anchor Poppy Harlow, political scientist Ian Bremmer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health. Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia's Teachers College.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks.\n\nSimilar encampments sprouted up elsewhere as universities struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony. Students abandoned their camp at USC on Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday. In Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags at Northeastern University's commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nHamas on Monday announced its acceptance of an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal, but Israel later approved a military operation in the southern Gaza town of Rafah and began striking targets in the area. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would send negotiators to continue talks.\n\nThe University of California, Los Angeles, alerted students Monday that all classes were moving online due to ongoing disruptions following the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian encampment last week. The university police force reported 44 arrests but there were no specific details, UCLA spokesperson Eddie North-Hager said in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nAt the University of California, San Diego, police cleared a pro-Palestinian encampment and arrested more than 30 people, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.\n\nSchools are trying various tactics from appeasement to threats of disciplinary action to get protestors to take down encampments or move to campus areas where demonstrations would be less intrusive.\n\nThe School of the Art Institute of Chicago said in a Facebook post Sunday that it offered protesters \"amnesty from academic sanction and trespassing charges\" if they moved.\n\n\"Many protesters left the premises of their own accord after being notified by the police that they were trespassing and subject to arrest,\" the school said. \"Those that remained were arrested after multiple warnings to leave, including some of whom we recognized as SAIC students.\"\n\nA group of faculty and staff members at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill asked the administration for amnesty for any students who were arrested and suspended during recent protests. UNC Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine said in a media advisory that it would deliver a letter on behalf of more than 500 faculty who support the student activists.\n\nOther universities took a different approach.\n\nHarvard University's interim president, Alan Garber, warned student's that those participating in a pro-Palestinian encampment in Harvard Yard could face \"involuntary leave.\" That means they may would not be allowed on campus, could lose their student housing and may not be able to take exams, Garber said.\n\nAt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, police restricted access to an encampment after a school deadline for them to leave had passed.

Pro-Palestinian protesters have dominated university quads in the last two weeks, shutting down colleges and clashing with riot police. But there's been a notable scarcity of student rallies in solidarity with Israelis. (AP [...]\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Columbia University canceled its large university-wide commencement ceremony Monday following weeks of pro-Palestinian protests that have roiled its campus and others across the U.S., but said students will still be able to celebrate at a series of smaller, school-based ceremonies this week and next.\n\nThe decision comes as universities around the country are wranging with how to handle commencements. Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its campus quadrangle in Atlanta to a suburban arena. But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nColumbia's decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president, Nemat Shafik, from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week.\n\nNoting that the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said in its announcement that it made the decision after discussions with students.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" officials said. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers.\"\n\nMost of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.\n\nSpeakers at some of Columbia's still-scheduled graduation ceremonies include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames, former CNN anchor Poppy Harlow, political scientist Ian Bremmer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health. Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal from Columbia's Teachers College for distinguished service.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks, and similar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC early Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday, while in Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags as Northeastern University held its commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. The student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the quad on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members. Police used pepper balls and electric stun guns to subdue some of the people who were arrested.

The demonstrations, however, continued.\n\nWhile the organizers claim their protests are peaceful, participants have been heard calling for an intifada, a term used to refer to two past massive waves of terrorist attacks in Israel, and \"another 10,000 October 7\" attacks on Israel like the one that sparked the war in Gaza in which Hamas terrorists murdered some 1,200 people and took 252 hostages, among other anti-Israel slogans.\n\nLast week one of the protest leaders, Khymani James, was suspended after a January video resurfaced in which he said repeatedly that Zionists \"don't deserve to live\" and should be killed, adding that people should be grateful that he wasn't \"just going out and murdering Zionists.\"\n\nFollowing his suspension, James issued an apology in which he said he \"misspoke.\"\n\nThe atmosphere at the university led many Jewish and Israeli students to feel unsafe on campus, with classes being moved online so that they could continue participating in their courses without having to come to campus.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of Israel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningside_Heights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morningside Heights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second Intifada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/04/AP24121577695577-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 95, "textEnd": 101, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2269, "textEnd": 2278}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its campus quadrangle in Atlanta to a suburban arena. But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nColumbia's decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president, Nemat Shafik, from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week.\n\nNoting that the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said in its announcement that it made the decision after discussions with students.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" officials said. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers.\"\n\nMost of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.\n\nSpeakers at some of Columbia's still-scheduled graduation ceremonies include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames, former CNN anchor Poppy Harlow, political scientist Ian Bremmer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health. Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia's Teachers College.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks, and similar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC early Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday, while in Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags as Northeastern University held its commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, disruptions continued Monday following the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian encampment and some 200 arrests last week. Police detained numerous people in a parking structure. The university also said classes held in one building, Monroe Hall, would move online \"due to ongoing disruptions\" but did not provide details.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nHamas announced Monday that it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari proposal for a cease-fire to halt the war in Gaza. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the deal, and details of the proposal have not yet been released.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the quad on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members. Police used pepper balls and electric stun guns to subdue some of the people who were arrested. Fenves later apologized.\n\nProtests have continued on the campus since then, including some additional arrests.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Fenves later apologized.\n\nProtests have continued on the campus since then, including some additional arrests.\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin", "source": {"uri": "wccbcharlotte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCCB Charlotte's CW"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_hale@wccbcharlotte.com", "name": "Jack Hale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Upper Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commencement_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commencement speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emory University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppy_Harlow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poppy Harlow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrangle_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quadrangle (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bremmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ian Bremmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Fox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael J.

As a result, we will focus our resources on those school ceremonies and on keeping them safe, respectful, and running smoothly.\"\n\nThe university acknowledged that the \"past few weeks have been incredibly difficult for our community,\" referring to last week's arrests of 119 protesters, 32 of whom had no affiliation to the campus, who set up a sprawling encampment and took over Hamilton Hall.\n\nColumbia's decision to hold nearly 30 smaller graduation ceremonies at a host of venues has strategic benefits.\n\nIt removes the primary target for pro-Palestinian protesters intent on disrupting graduation before a large-scale audience, as they did last weekend at the University of Michigan's spring commencement ceremony.\n\nAt the same time, the cancellation was seen by critics as the latest capitulation by Columbia President Minouche Shafik, who has been blasted from both the left and right for her handling of the protest crisis.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump told reporters that \"Columbia just canceled their commencement. That shouldn't happen.\"\n\nHe also cited a Politico report showing that some of President Biden's biggest donors are affiliated with major philanthropic organizations funding anti-Israel groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace.\n\n\"I hope you're listening, Israel. I hope you're getting smart,\" Mr. Trump said outside the Manhattan courtroom where his hush-money trial is taking place. \"That's where the money's coming from.\"\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, posted on X that the \"[p]ro-Hamas lunatics forcing Columbia to cancel graduation is a disgrace and an insult to their fellow graduates and their families.\"\n\nColumbia previously had moved to mainly remote hybrid learning and shut down its main campus to all but residential students and essential staff as it struggled to restore order on campus.\n\nThe conservative Media Research Center posted on X that Columbia \"lets the terrorists win and cancels their main graduation ceremony due to pro-Hamas agitators.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said that Columbia administrators \"have displayed a shocking unwillingness to control their campus.\"\n\n\"They've allowed outside agitators and terrorist-sympathizing students and faculty to rewrite campus rules and spew vile, anti-Jewish aggression,\" Mr. Johnson, Louisiana Republican, said in a statement. \"Now, thousands of students who've worked hard to achieve their degrees will not get the recognition they deserve.\"\n\nHe reiterated his call for Ms. Shafik to resign or be removed by the Columbia Board of Trustees: \"It is abundantly clear that President Shafik would rather cede control to Hamas supporters than restore order.\"\n\nMs. Shafik had repeatedly urged protesters to disband by citing the threat to graduation, noting that many in the Class of 2024 had their high-school commencement ceremonies canceled due to the pandemic.\n\nColumbia said it decided to abandon the main ceremony after speaking with student leaders about their graduation preferences.\n\n\"Based on their feedback, we have decided to make the centerpiece of our Commencement activities our Class Days and school-level ceremonies, where students are honored individually alongside their peers, rather than the University-wide ceremony that is scheduled for May 15,\" the statement said.\n\nColumbia isn't the first major university to cancel its large-scale graduation in response to protest threats.\n\nThe University of Southern California pulled the plug on its \"main stage\" ceremony slated for May 10 over pro-Palestinian unrest, that it would host a \"Trojan Family Graduate Celebration\" at the Los Angeles Coliseum on that date instead.\n\nColumbia also held out the possibility of holding \"a festive event on May 15 to take the place of the large, formal ceremony.\"\n\n\"We are eager to all come together for our graduates and celebrate our fellow Columbians as they, and we, look ahead to the future,\" the university said.\n\nLos Angeles police cleared Sunday the USC encampment in Alumni Park at the heart of the campus amid rising concerns about safety and outside agitators, but made no arrests, according to USC President Carol Folt.", "source":

Students have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and have demanded their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nSome universities, including Columbia, called in riot police wielding batons and flash-bang grenades to disperse and arrest hundreds of protesters, citing a paramount need for campus safety. Civil rights groups have decried such tactics as unnecessarily violent infringements on free speech.\n\nMore than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military operations in Gaza, according to health officials in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian enclave. The war began when Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and abducting 252 others, of whom 133 are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nThe turmoil on campuses has prompted several colleges and universities across the country to relocate, modify, or cancel commencement ceremonies altogether.\n\nIn April, the University of Southern California also called off its main-stage ceremony, one week after canceling the valedictorian speech by a Muslim student who said she was silenced by anti-Palestinian hatred.\n\nColumbia said on Monday it had consulted with student leaders in deciding how to handle graduation.

Civil rights groups have decried such tactics as unnecessarily violent infringements on free speech.\n\nMore than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military operations in Gaza, according to health officials in Gaza. The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and abducting 252 others, of whom 133 are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nThe turmoil on campuses has prompted several colleges and universities across the United States to relocate, modify, or cancel commencement ceremonies altogether.\n\nIn April, the University of Southern California also called off its main-stage ceremony, one week after cancelling the valedictorian speech by a Muslim student who said she was silenced by anti-Palestinian hatred.\n\nColumbia said on Monday it had consulted with student leaders in deciding how to handle graduation. The majority of the ceremonies, which had been set to take place on its upper Manhattan campus, where most of the protests have taken place, will take place at the main athletic complex about 8km away.\n\nThe demonstrations have emerged as a political flashpoint during a contentious US election year as President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump face off in rematch for the White House.\n\nUS House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson - who condemned Columbia's administrators, accusing them of being too lenient on demonstrators during a campus visit in April - criticised them again on Monday, saying the decision to cancel commencement denied thousands of graduates the recognition they deserved.\n\nJohnson also called on the school's board of trustees to remove university President Nemat Minouche Shafik, adding that the cancellation showed she would rather \"cede control to Hamas supporters than restore order.\"\n\nNew York City police cleared a Columbia building last week that had been barricaded by pro-Palestinian protesters, arresting more than 100 people in and around the campus and dismantling an encampment.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, where pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian protesters clashed last week and where police arrested more than 200 people while clearing a pro-Palestinian encampment on Thursday, Chancellor Gene Block on Sunday announced a new Office of Campus Safety.\n\nALSO READ:", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

As a result, we will focus our resources on those school ceremonies and on keeping them safe, respectful, and running smoothly.\"\n\nOnline, in the hours after the announcement was made, many claimed that the University had not emailed the student body to inform them of the change.\n\n\"How am i hearing about this from phil before the university WHEN I GO HERE?????\" posted one student in response to a post on X by Phillip Lewis, Deputy Editor of Huffington Post, sharing the decision.\n\n\"Well...Twitter was a wild way to find this news,\" said one law student.\n\n\"It's been five hours and students have yet to receive any communication from @Columbia about commencement.\" said another X user.\n\nMariam Jallow, a junior at Columbia College and the incoming president of the Columbia College Student Council, told TIME that the decision has eroded the student body's trust in university administration. \"A lot of the communications we got about taking down the encampment and the police raid into Hamilton Hall was all done under the excuse of the senior class and that [they] didn't have a high school graduation due to COVID,\" says Jallow. \"Now a lot of seniors, and those in the classes below feel like they were being lied to because the university commencement is not happening and the Class Days are happening on our football stadium. For a lot of students, the trust that was hardly there throughout all of this has now been totally destroyed.\"\n\nColumbia University's media relations team did not reply to TIME's request for comment ahead of publication.\n\nRead More: Police Officer Fired Gun While Clearing Protesters From Columbia Building, Prosecutors Say\n\nMany of the ceremonies that were scheduled to take place on the Morningside campus's South Lawn -- where pro-Palestine protesters set up encampments on April 17 in protest of the war in Gaza and the university's investment ties to Israel -- are being relocated to Baker Athletics Complex, the University's outdoor sports venue located 5.4 miles away from the main campus (at the very tip of Inwood in Manhattan). The university-wide commencement was also meant to take place on the Morningside campus.\n\nThe university has been at the center of international attention in the wake of the protests and the response from Columbia's administration and police. On the evening of April 30, the New York Police Department (NYPD) arrived on campus to clear the encampments and remove pro-Palestinian protesters who had occupied Hamilton Hall, an administrative building on the Morningside campus, the evening prior. It was the second time that month that Columbia University called upon the NYPD to arrest pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nThe University's president, Minouche Shafik, requested last week that the NYPD remain on campus through at least May 17 \"to maintain order and ensure encampments are not reestablished,\" according to a letter Shafik wrote to the department.\n\nIn canceling commencement, Columbia follows the University of Southern California (USC) which also moved to cancel its university-wide ceremony following outcry over the cancellation of Muslim student Asna Tabassum's valedictorian speech. (USC said it canceled the ceremony due to \"substantial risks relating to security and disruption.\")\n\n\"These past few weeks have been incredibly difficult for our community. Just as we are focused on making our graduation experience truly special, we continue to solicit student feedback and are looking at the possibility of a festive event on May 15 to take the place of the large, formal ceremony,\" the university shared in its statement. \"We will share more in the coming days.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningside_University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morningside University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HuffPost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HuffPost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer-specific_stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soccer-specific stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Complex Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valedictorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valedictorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inwood,_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inwood, Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inwood, Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/columbia-commencement.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 241, "textEnd": 247, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 687, "textEnd": 692}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 2621, "textEnd": 2629}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 3143, "textEnd": 3151}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 3609, "textEnd": 3615}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Other school-based ceremonies will take place throughout next week, as well.\n\nPro-Palestinian protests sprouted on campus April 17 when students pitched about 50 tents while demanding a cease-fire in Gaza and insisting the university divest from companies that they say could be profiting from the war.\n\nOn the evening of April 30, New York City police officers clad in riot gear arrived on campus at the request of university administrators and forced their way into the barricaded Hamilton Hall, which protesters had taken over and renamed Hind's Hall, after a 6-year-old Palestinian girl who was killed in Gaza. The encampment was cleared and more than 100 people were arrested.\n\nThe arrests have shaken confidence in university President Minouche Shafik among some students and faculty at Columbia. In a letter to the New York City Police Department asking for its assistance to clear Hamilton Hall, she said the occupation there \"left us no choice.\"\n\nIn its request for police assistance, Columbia asked the NYPD to stay on campus until at least May 17, two days after commencement.\n\nA source at the university previously said Columbia was rethinking its commencement ceremony. After a meeting with top university leaders Friday, two members of student government said administrators indicated they are not sure they can hold a commencement ceremony on the main Morningside Heights campus in Manhattan because of security concerns.\n\nProtests similar to the one seen in Columbia quickly appeared at college campuses across the country, concerning administrations about their commencement ceremonies as well.\n\nOn Saturday, students waved Palestinian flags during the University of Michigan's commencement. Banners in the sky displayed messages such as \"DIVEST FROM ISRAEL NOW! FREE PALESTINE!\" and \"WE STAND WITH ISRAEL JEWISH LIVES MATTER.\"\n\nIn a statement issued following commencement, University of Michigan's assistant vice president for public affairs, Colleen Mastony, said approximately 75 protesters staged a demonstration at the beginning of the program by walking up to the main aisle and chanting. They were escorted by public safety personnel to the rear of the stadium, where they stayed until commencement ended. There were no arrests, Mastony said in a statement following commencement.\n\nLast month, the University of Southern California in Los Angeles said it was canceling its main commencement ceremony, scheduled for May 10, that was set to include a keynote address from alumnus Jon M. Chu, director of \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" and a presentation of honorary degrees to tennis star Billie Jean King and others.\n\nThe university previously canceled a commencement speech by a Muslim valedictorian following controversy over her social media posts about Israel's war in Gaza.

Civil rights groups have decried such tactics as unnecessarily violent infringements on free speech.\n\nMore than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military operations in Gaza, according to health officials in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian enclave. The war began when Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and abducting 252 others, of whom 133 are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nThe turmoil on campuses has prompted several colleges and universities across the United States to relocate, modify, or cancel commencement ceremonies altogether.\n\nIn April, the University of Southern California also called off its main-stage ceremony, one week after canceling the valedictorian speech by a Muslim student who said she was silenced by anti-Palestinian hatred.\n\nColumbia said on Monday it had consulted with student leaders in deciding how to handle graduation. The majority of the ceremonies, which had been set to take place on its upper Manhattan campus, where most of the protests have taken place, will take place at the main athletic complex about five miles (8 km) away.\n\nThe demonstrations have emerged as a political flashpoint during a contentious U.S. election year as Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican former U.S President Donald Trump face off in rematch for the White House.\n\nRepublican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson -- who condemned Columbia's administrators, accusing them of being too lenient on demonstrators during a campus visit in April -- blasted them again on Monday, saying the decision to cancel commencement denied thousands of graduates the recognition they deserved.\n\nJohnson also called on the school's board of trustees to remove university President Nemat Minouche Shafik, adding that the cancellation showed she would rather \"cede control to Hamas supporters than restore order.\"\n\nNew York City police cleared a Columbia building last week that had been barricaded by pro-Palestinian protesters, arresting more than 100 people in and around the campus and dismantling an encampment.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, where pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian protesters clashed last week and where police arrested more than 200 people while clearing a pro-Palestinian encampment on Thursday, Chancellor Gene Block on Sunday announced a new Office of Campus Safety.\n\nA former Sacramento, California, police chief, Rick Braziel, will lead the office and report directly to Block.", "source": {"uri": "dtnext.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "dtNext.in"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@dtnext.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency":

We are as well. We are determined to give our students the celebration they deserve, and that they want,\" the announcement said. \"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families. As a result, we will focus our resources on those school ceremonies and on keeping them safe, respectful, and running smoothly.\"\n\nThe action was taken less than a week after Morningside Heights police officers invaded the school to drive out a pro-terror mob that had illegally taken over the university's landmark Hamilton Hall building. The protests had unlawfully been raging on the campus since last month, but this move marked a drastic escalation.\n\nDuring the ordeal, about 100 demonstrators were handcuffed and transported away. It was also the second occurrence in as many weeks that the New York Police Department (NYPD) had been called to the campus to clear out the protests.\n\nColumbia previously canceled in-person classes due to the expanding encampment and asked that the NYPD officers remain on campus until at least May 17, which is two days after the postponed commencement.\n\nStay informed!

will be deeply disappointing to many of you.\"\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" he added. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors, and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding Commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nHe also congratulated the \"like no other\" Class of 2024, noting the pandemic interrupted may of their high school graduations and forced them to begin college online.\n\n\"You will have your moment together, in person, alongside the people who matter to you the most,\" he added.\n\nThe announcement comes after more than a week of student protests against the Israel-Hamas war and the construction of a controversial public safety training center, dubbed \"Cop City.\"\n\nDemonstrations intensified as university, city and state law enforcement officers clashed with and forcibly arrested some two dozen protesters on April 25, including students and faculty members.\n\nEmory's arts and science faculty have since passed a no-confidence vote against Fenves, and undergraduate students are holding a vote of their own Monday into Tuesday.\n\nAs campus protests continue, Emory officials are urging graduates to heed security warnings for commencement activities.\n\nGas South District venues have various requirements for security screening, event safety, and guest conduct, according to its website, including prohibiting backpacks and \"signs on sticks or oversized signs (no larger than 8 1/2\" x 11\").\"\n\nAn FAQ on Emory's commencement webpage also outlines the school's expression-related protocols for commencement, which it says are \"similar to events that are held on campus.\"", "source": {"uri": "kpbs.org", "dataType": "news",

Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its campus quadrangle in Atlanta to a suburban arena. But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nColumbia's decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president, Nemat Shafik, from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week.\n\nNoting that the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said in its announcement that it made the decision after discussions with students.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" officials said. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers.\"\n\nMost of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.\n\nSpeakers at some of Columbia's still-scheduled graduation ceremonies include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames, former CNN anchor Poppy Harlow, political scientist Ian Bremmer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health. Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal from Columbia's Teachers College for distinguished service.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks, and similar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC early Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday, while in Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags as Northeastern University held its commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. The student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the quad on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members. Police used pepper balls and electric stun guns to subdue some of the people who were arrested. Fenves later apologized.\n\nProtests have continued on the campus since then, including some additional arrests.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "kurv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "710 KURV - The Valley's News/Talk Station"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Upper Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commencement_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commencement speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrangle_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quadrangle (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emory University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppy_Harlow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poppy Harlow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bremmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ian Bremmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Fox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael J.

As a result, we will focus our resources on those school ceremonies and on keeping them safe, respectful, and running smoothly.\"\n\nAs a result, students will be \"honored individually alongside their peers\" in the smaller ceremonies. \"Class Days\" and school ceremonies scheduled at the South Lawn of Morningside campus have also been relocated to Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex.\n\n\"These past few weeks have been incredibly difficult for our community. Just as we are focused on making our graduation experience truly special, we continue to solicit student feedback and are looking at the possibility of a festive event on May 15 to take the place of the large, formal ceremony,\" university officials said.\n\n\"We are eager to all come together for our graduates and celebrate our fellow Columbians as they, and we, look ahead to the future.\"\n\nCome May 15, graduation ceremonies for the journalism school, college of physicians and surgeons, Barnard College, and the school of arts will take place at different times at different locations, according to a schedule released by Columbia. Other school-based ceremonies will take place throughout next week as well.\n\nPro-Palestinian protests sprouted on campus April 17 when students pitched about 50 tents while demanding a cease-fire in Gaza and insisting the university divest from companies that they say could be profiting from the war.\n\nOn the evening of April 30, New York City police officers clad in riot gear arrived on campus at the request of university administrators and forced their way into the barricaded Hamilton Hall, which protesters had taken over and renamed Hind's Hall, after a 6-year-old Palestinian girl who was killed in Gaza. The encampment was cleared and more than 100 people were arrested.\n\nThe arrests have shaken confidence in the university's president Minouche Shafik among some students and faculty at Columbia. In a letter to the New York Police Department asking for its assistance to clear Hamilton Hall, the university president said the occupation there \"left us no choice.\"\n\nIn its request for police assistance, Columbia asked the NYPD to stay on campus until at least May 17, two days after commencement.\n\nA source at the university previously said Columbia was rethinking its commencement ceremony. After a meeting with top university leaders Friday, two members of student government said administrators indicated they are not sure they can hold a commencement ceremony on the main Morningside Heights campus in Manhattan because of security concerns.\n\nProtests similar to the one seen in Columbia quickly appeared at college campuses across the country, concerning administrations about their commencement ceremonies as well.\n\nOn Saturday, students waved Palestinian flags during the University of Michigan's commencement. Banners in the sky displayed messages such as \"DIVEST FROM ISRAEL NOW! FREE PALESTINE!\" and \"WE STAND WITH ISRAEL JEWISH LIVES MATTER.\"\n\nIn a statement issued following commencement, University of Michigan assistant vice president for public affairs Colleen Mastony said approximately 75 protesters staged a demonstration at the beginning of the program by walking up to the main aisle and chanting. They were escorted by public safety personnel to the rear of the stadium, where they stayed until commencement ended. There were no arrests, Mastony said in a statement following commencement.\n\nLast month, the University of Southern California in Los Angeles said it was canceling its main commencement ceremony, scheduled for May 10, that was set to include a keynote address from alumnus Jon M.

The school later suspended protesters who didn't leave, and called New York City police to arrest those who occupied a building on campus.\n\nAfter a tumultuous few weeks on campus, Columbia University is changing its graduation plans, canceling its main ceremony to focus on multiple school-specific celebrations instead.\n\nOfficials at the New York City institution said in their Monday announcement that based on feedback from students, they will prioritize Class Days and school-level ceremonies, \"where students are honored individually alongside their peers,\" rather than the universitywide ceremony that had been scheduled for May 15.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" the announcement reads. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers. As a result, we will focus our resources on those school ceremonies and on keeping them safe, respectful, and running smoothly.\"\n\nAs part of that effort, the university is relocating those ceremonies, which were originally scheduled to take place on the South Lawn -- where protesters picketed and camped out in tents for two weeks, calling for an end to war in Gaza and university investment in Israel, until police cleared out campus last Wednesday.\n\nThose ceremonies will move to the Baker Athletics Complex, Columbia's main venue for outdoor sports. The events will run from May 10-16, with tickets required. Columbia College will hold its ceremony on the morning of May 14, followed by the affiliated Barnard College the next day.\n\nColumbia President Minouche Shafik had previously requested a New York Police Department presence on campus through at least May 17, \"to maintain order and ensure encampments are not reestablished.\"\n\nShe wrote to the NYPD on April 30, as police arrived to remove pro-Palestinian protesters who had occupied a building on campus earlier that day. It was the second time that month that Shafik called in city police to break up protests on campus.\n\nPolice broke up the \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" and arrested more than 100 people on April 18, the day after it was first set up. Demonstrators regrouped, forming another encampment that continued to grow even as administrators negotiated with student activists over an agreement that would result in its removal.\n\nOn April 29, after negotiations stalled, Columbia began suspending students who did not heed its warning to leave the encampment by 2 p.m. The next day, dozens of students began occupying Hamilton Hall -- in an echo of the school's 1968 protests -- and barricading themselves inside.\n\nThe university -- which had already shifted to hybrid learning for the rest of the semester -- was essentially under lockdown. Police entered Hamilton Hall, arresting 112 protesters. New York City officials said over the weekend that 29% of them were not affiliated with the school.\n\nShafik has faced widespread criticism and calls to resign from both sides of the aisle over her handling of the protest, though maintains the backing of Columbia's board of trustees.\n\nOfficials acknowledged on Monday that \"these past few weeks have been incredibly difficult for our community.\"\n\nAnd they said they are continuing to solicit student feedback about the possibility of a \"festive event on May 15 to take the place of a large, formal ceremony.\"\n\nColumbia is the second major university to cancel part of its graduation ceremony. The University of Southern California announced in late April that it would cancel its main graduation ceremony, several days and considerable backlash after it scrapped its valedictorian speech over security concerns.\n\nOther schools are forging ahead with graduation as planned, but expecting -- and for some, already experiencing -- protests during the day. Over the weekend, students and faculty at Indiana University held an alternate graduation ceremony, while dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters waving flags and banners briefly disrupted the University of Michigan's graduation.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_treisman@npr.org", "name": "Rachel Treisman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Picketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solidarity (Polish trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barnard College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valedictorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valedictorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2024/05/06/gettyimages-2150007365_wide-4ba89e29cefbc4bb3ba575baf3e32bdf4e810043.jpg?s=1400&c=100&f=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "dateEnd": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 1556, "textEnd": 1565}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 60, "textEnd": 68}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 701, "textEnd": 707, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 1648, "textEnd": 1654}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1839, "textEnd": 1845}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1939, "textEnd": 1947}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-18", "textStart": 2247, "textEnd": 2255}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 2480, "textEnd": 2488}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its campus quadrangle in Atlanta to a suburban arena. But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia's Teachers College.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks, and similar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC early Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday, while in Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags as Northeastern University held its commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, disruptions continued Monday following the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian encampment and some 200 arrests last week. Police detained numerous people in a parking structure. The university also said classes held in one building, Monroe Hall, would move online \"due to ongoing disruptions\" but did not provide details.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nHamas announced Monday that it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari proposal for a cease-fire to halt the war in Gaza. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the deal, and details of the proposal have not yet been released.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the quad on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members. Police used pepper balls and electric stun guns to subdue some of the people who were arrested. Fenves later apologized.\n\nProtests have continued on the campus since then, including some additional arrests.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. -- after dozens of tents had been pitched at the center of campus.\n\nLast week, university President Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik had written that officials were still working at plans for graduation the day before hundreds of New York Police Department officers wearing riot gear had swarmed Columbia's campus and entered Hamilton Hall where they cleared the building and arrested dozens of protesters at the university's request.\n\nHamilton Hall stands in distinction for being taken over during anti-Vietnam demonstrations on campus in 1968.\n\nIn her email last week to the university, Shafik invoked memories of the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that Columbia officials \"do not want to deprive thousands of students and their families and friends of a graduation celebration\" as many did not attend in-person high school graduations.\n\n\"Please recall that many in this graduating class did not get a celebration when graduating from high school because of the pandemic, and many of them are the first in their families to earn a university degree. We owe it to all of our graduates and their loved ones to honor their achievement,\" she wrote.\n\nThe protesters had called for the university to end its relationship with Israeli academic institutions and a \"complete divestment\" of funds from pro-Israel entities.\n\nThe University of Southern California in Los Angeles also canceled its May 10 graduation ceremony -- citing new safety measures on processing people who come to campus -- amid scores of other pro-Palestinian protests on American college campuses.\n\nShafik took over the university presidency in 2023, and this would be her first graduation as the head of campus but student leaders had sought to dissuade her.\n\n\"We were like, 'We don't want you there, and if you are there, people will use that as an opportunity to try to get you to listen to them, which is what these protests have always been,'\" Teji Vijayakumar, a graduating senior and the Columbia College student body president, told Politico.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if she still planned to speak.\n\nMonday on social media, a senior administration official under former President George W. Bush was critical of Columbia's decision, calling it \"awful\" and \"a leadership failure\" by Columbia administrators.\n\n\"It's a shame that fewer than 1% of the students can do this to 99% of their fellow students,\" former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer posted on X.\n\n\"The leaders of Columbia brought this on themselves through weakness,\" Fleischer wrote.\n\nThe university said Monday how \"these past few weeks have been incredibly difficult for our community.\"\n\n\"Just as we are focused on making our graduation experience truly special, we continue to solicit student feedback and are looking at the possibility of a festive event on May 15 to take the place of the large, formal ceremony,\" added Columbia University.", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_benson@sacbee.com", "name": "Chris Benson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nColumbia's decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president, Nemat Shafik, from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week.\n\nNoting that the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said in its announcement that it made the decision after discussions with students.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" officials said. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers.\"\n\nMost of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.\n\nSpeakers at some of Columbia's still-scheduled graduation ceremonies include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames, former CNN anchor Poppy Harlow, political scientist Ian Bremmer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health. Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia's Teachers College.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks, and similar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC early Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday, while in Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags as Northeastern University held its commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Rolls-Royce adding capacity at Graniteville plant to meet data center backup power demands Super fun: Kentucky Derby parties provide boost for charities Jackson resident finds purpose, fulfillment as foster parent Business roundup: New Japanese restaurant opens, La Parisienne has new co-owner Today's events for May 6 MEDICAL INSIGHTS: Limit your consumption of ultra processed foods 2 men arrested in connection with shooting near Hitchcock Animal Hospital Shakes and shouts: Greenville, Dorman's Ruth win titles on tense final day at Southern Cross Beautification and preservation: Garden Club of Aiken celebrates a century USC Aiken Eventing teams finish in top 10 at USEA Intercollegiate Championship, reflect on growth of club\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. The student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the quad on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members. Police used pepper balls and electric stun guns to subdue some of the people who were arrested. Fenves later apologized.\n\nProtests have continued on the campus since then, including some additional arrests.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@postandcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Upper Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commencement_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commencement speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrangle_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quadrangle (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemat_Shafik", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nemat Shafik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emory University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Bertagnolli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monica Bertagnolli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ijames", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Ijames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppy_Harlow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poppy Harlow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bremmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ian Bremmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Fox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael J.

Students will still be able to celebrate at a series of smaller, school-based graduation ceremonies this week and next.\n\nThe protest movement connected to the Israel-Hamas war began nearly three weeks ago at the Ivy League university in New York City. It has since swept college campuses nationwide, with more than 2,500 people arrested.\n\nThe university's large graduation ceremony was scheduled for May 15 on the college's main lawn, which is where a protest encampment was based until authorities dismantled it last week. University officials said the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, and that they decided to cancel the ceremony after discussing it with students.\n\nA timeline illustrating how Columbia University became the driving force behind protests on college campuses across the country:\n\nStudents set up an encampment at Columbia University the same day university president Nemat Shafik is called for questioning before Congress. Shafik is heavily criticized by Republicans who accuse her of not doing enough to combat concerns about antisemitism on Columbia's campus. Allegations of antisemitism arose during pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's actions in the war in Gaza.\n\nThe public grilling session comes four months after a similarly contentious congressional hearing led to the resignations of two Ivy League presidents. Unlike her counterparts, who focused their responses on protecting free speech, Shafik strongly denounced antisemitism, saying it \"has no place on our campus.\"\n\nAPRIL 18\n\nNew York City police are called to Columbia's campus to disband the protest encampment and arrest more than 100 protesters. Those detained include the daughter of Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who a day earlier had questioned Shafik about the school's treatment of pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nThe arrests, which New York Mayor Eric Adams says were requested by Columbia officials, garner national attention and inflame college protests nationwide. A day later, the University of Southern California announces that it has canceled the keynote commencement speech by filmmaker Jon M. Chu. USC had already disallowed its student valedictorian, who is Muslim, from speaking at the May 10 commencement.\n\nIn the coming days, pro-Palestinian encampments will be set up at the University of Michigan, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina.\n\nAPRIL 22\n\nColumbia cancels in-person classes, and an encampment at New York University swells to hundreds of protesters. NYU officials call in police after warning the crowd to leave and says the scene has become disorderly. Police arrest dozens of protesters at NYU and at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The gates to Harvard Yard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are closed to the public.\n\nPresident Joe Biden addresses the unrest and seeks to find a narrow middle ground by condemning \"antisemitic protests,\" adding that he also condemns \"those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians.\"\n\nAPRIL 24\n\nColumbia administrators set a new midnight deadline for protesters to clear the encampment. While some leave, others dig in and refuse to disband until the school agrees to stop doing business with Israel or any companies that support the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nElsewhere, police make more arrests on other university campuses. At the University of Texas at Austin, hundreds of local and state police -- including some on horseback and holding batons -- aggressively clash with protesters, pushing them off campus grounds, and arresting more than 30 people. At the University of Southern California, police peacefully arrest student protesters.\n\nAPRIL 26\n\nColumbia University students say they're at an impasse after exhaustive negotiations with administrators and they intend to continue their encampment until their divestment demands are met. That comes after hundreds of protesters have been arrested nationwide over the previous nine days. The school sends students an email saying that bringing back police \"at this time\" would be counterproductive.\n\nMeanwhile, schools across the country where protests have taken root prepare to shut down encampments over reports of antisemitic activity and concerns the protests will mar upcoming commencement ceremonies.\n\nAPRIL 29\n\nColumbia makes good on its promise to suspend students who defy a 2 p.m. deadline to leave the encampment of more than 100 tents. Instead of vacating, hundreds of protesters remain, marching around the quad and weaving around piles of temporary flooring and green carpeting meant for graduation ceremonies that are scheduled to begin next week.\n\nAround the country, the number of arrests at campuses nationwide approaches 1,000 as the final days of class wrap up.\n\nAPRIL 30\n\nDozens of protesters take over Hamilton Hall on Columbia's campus, barricading entrances and hanging a \"Free Palestine\" banner from a window as administrators warn that they face expulsion for doing so. Protesters insist they will remain at the hall until the university agrees to three demands: divestment from Israel and companies supporting the war in Gaza, financial transparency and amnesty for protesters.\n\nHours later, New York City police carrying riot shields storm the building and clear dozens of people from it, sweeping the encampment on the campus as well. The action from city police came at the request of the university, according to a police statement.\n\nMAY 6\n\nColumbia cancels its university-wide commencement ceremony.

Most of the events will be shifted from the main lawn of the Morningside campus, which became the epicenter of students protests calling for the university to divest from Israel, and moved to an athletics center further north in Manhattan.\n\n\"These past few weeks have been incredibly difficult for our community,\" the university said in a statement. The new focus would be on \"class days and school-level ceremonies, where students are honored individually alongside their peers\", it said.\n\nThe disruption to the annual graduation festivity is an indication of the extent to which the student protests, and the university's response to them by calling in the New York police department, have shaken the institution. Commencements have been held at Columbia since 1758, and have been located on the lawn of the Morningside campus where this year's ceremony had been scheduled for 15 May every year since 1926.\n\nThe announcement came less than a week after more than 100 students were arrested after the NYPD were sent in to clear an occupied academic building, Hamilton Hall, using flash bangs. The Gaza Solidarity protest encampment on the main lawn, where students sleeping in tents were calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and divestment from companies linked to Israel, sparking similar student protests across the country, was also raided and removed.\n\nEric Adams, New York's mayor, claimed that the harsh police action was prompted by \"outside agitators\" but has been under pressure to back up the claim with details. The university government, including it's president, Minouche Shafik, have also come under heavy criticism from students and some faculty.\n\nA poll of 719 students and professors conducted by the Columbia Daily Spectator and New York magazine found that 57% thought Shafik's decision to call in the NYPD to arrest protesters was a \"totally unwarranted\" aggression, and 50% thought she should resign.\n\nThe university said it had based the decision to suspend the university-wide commencement ceremony on discussions with student leaders. It said that students were \"eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers\".\n\nThe statement added that university authorities were looking at the possibility of a different kind of \"festive event\" still being held on 15 May.\n\nLast month, the University of Southern California in Los Angeles cancelled its commencement ceremony, also citing safety worries.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_pilkington@theguardian.com", "name": "Ed Pilkington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningside_University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morningside University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solidarity (Polish trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stun_grenade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stun grenade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Daily_Spectator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia Daily Spectator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Adams_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Adams (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ba637f1dbdfc862c215ddde243b70d2adb05332/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=733f909dd063f961f5b60071054842d5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 1412, "textEnd": 1418, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Consequently, efforts will now be directed towards ensuring the safety and smooth execution of these smaller ceremonies.\n\n\"The decision reflects our commitment to prioritizing the safety and well-being of our students and community members,\" the university added.\n\nThe decision also comes in the wake of recent encampment-related damage to Morningside Heights' front lawn, prompting the relocation of ceremonies to Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex.

Commencement holds significant historical importance for Columbia, dating back to 1758 when the institution was known as King's College.\n\n\"The decision to cancel the university-wide commencement ceremonies is disappointing, but we understand the necessity given the current circumstances,\" said a graduating senior, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"I appreciate the university's efforts to prioritize our safety and well-being.\"\n\nThe protests at Columbia's upper Manhattan campus, which erupted on April 17, saw students pitching tents and demanding a cease-fire in Gaza while calling for the university to divest from companies allegedly profiting from the conflict.\n\nAlthough authorities cleared out the protesters initially, they later returned, leading to a series of encampments at college campuses across the nation. The situation escalated when NYPD officers in riot gear intervened, resulting in over 100 arrests during the reclaiming of Hamilton Hall.", "source": {"uri": "i24news.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "i24NEWS English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningside_Heights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morningside Heights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upper Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Upper Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Education", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic Departments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://cdn.i24news.tv/uploads/66/56/10/77/f9/92/f0/75/36/f4/51/6d/de/91/21/01/66561077f992f07536f4516dde912101.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 1533, "textEnd": 1539, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 2547, "textEnd": 2555}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

President Joe Biden weighed in, stressing that \"order must prevail\".\n\nThe Columbia University community has faced significant challenges in recent weeks, with over 100 pro-Palestinian demonstrators arrested last month.

Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its campus quadrangle in Atlanta to a suburban arena. But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia's Teachers College.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks.\n\nSimilar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC on Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday, while in Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags as Northeastern University held its commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, disruptions continued Monday following the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian encampment and some 200 arrests last week. Police detained numerous people in a parking structure. The university also said classes in one building, Monroe Hall, would move online \"due to ongoing disruptions\" but did not provide details.\n\nAlso Monday, police cleared a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of California, San Diego, and arrested more than 30 people, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nHamas announced Monday that it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal to halt the war in Gaza, but Israel did not immediately comment. Details have not yet been released.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the quad on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members. Police used pepper balls and electric stun guns to subdue some of the people who were arrested. Fenves later apologized.\n\nProtests have continued on the campus since then, including some additional arrests.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Civil rights groups have decried such tactics as unnecessarily violent infringements on free speech.\n\nMore than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military operations in Gaza, according to health officials in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian enclave. The war began when Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and abducting 252 others, of whom 133 are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nThe turmoil on campuses has prompted several colleges and universities across the United States to relocate, modify, or cancel commencement ceremonies altogether.\n\nIn April, the University of Southern California also called off its main-stage ceremony, one week after canceling the valedictorian speech by a Muslim student who said she was silenced by anti-Palestinian hatred.\n\nColumbia said on Monday it had consulted with student leaders in deciding how to handle graduation. The majority of the ceremonies, which had been set to take place on its upper Manhattan campus, where most of the protests have taken place, will take place at the main athletic complex about five miles (8 km) away.\n\nThe demonstrations have emerged as a political flashpoint during a contentious U.S. election year as Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican former U.S President Donald Trump face off in rematch for the White House.\n\nRepublican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson -- who condemned Columbia's administrators, accusing them of being too lenient on demonstrators during a campus visit in April -- blasted them again on Monday, saying the decision to cancel commencement denied thousands of graduates the recognition they deserved.\n\nJohnson also called on the school's board of trustees to remove university President Nemat Minouche Shafik, adding that the cancellation showed she would rather \"cede control to Hamas supporters than restore order.\"\n\nNew York City police cleared a Columbia building last week that had been barricaded by pro-Palestinian protesters, arresting more than 100 people in and around the campus and dismantling an encampment.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, where pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian protesters clashed last week and where police arrested more than 200 people while clearing a pro-Palestinian encampment on Thursday, Chancellor Gene Block on Sunday announced a new Office of Campus Safety.\n\nA former Sacramento, California, police chief, Rick Braziel, will lead the office and report directly to Block.\n\n(Reporting by Julia Harte, Doina Chiacu and Joseph Ax; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

A university official told NBC News security concerns were the primary reason for the shift.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families.

A great deal of effort is already underway to reach that goal, and we understand the Deans and school teams are looking forward to working with their students to incorporate the most creative and meaningful ideas to celebrate this extraordinary moment.\"\n\nThe ceremonies will be relocated from Morningside Heights' encampment-damaged front lawn. Most will be hosted at Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex. See the full revised schedule below. Tickets are still required.\n\nAnd Columbia is still considering some sort of university-wide celebration.\n\n\"These past few weeks have been incredibly difficult for our community.

Students will still be able to celebrate at a series of smaller, school-based graduation ceremonies this week and next.\n\nThe protest movement connected to the Israel-Hamas war began nearly three weeks ago at the Ivy League university in New York City. It has since swept college campuses nationwide, with more than 2,500 people arrested.\n\nThe university's large graduation ceremony was scheduled for May 15 on the college's main lawn, which is where a protest encampment was based until authorities dismantled it last week. University officials said the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, and that they decided to cancel the ceremony after discussing it with students.\n\nA timeline illustrating how Columbia University became the driving force behind protests on college campuses across the country:\n\nAPRIL 17\n\nStudents set up an encampment at Columbia University the same day university president Nemat Shafik is called for questioning before Congress. Shafik is heavily criticized by Republicans who accuse her of not doing enough to combat concerns about antisemitism on Columbia's campus. Allegations of antisemitism arose during pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's actions in the war in Gaza.\n\nThe public grilling session comes four months after a similarly contentious congressional hearing led to the resignations of two Ivy League presidents. Unlike her counterparts, who focused their responses on protecting free speech, Shafik strongly denounced antisemitism, saying it \"has no place on our campus.\"\n\nAPRIL 18\n\nNew York City police are called to Columbia's campus to disband the protest encampment and arrest more than 100 protesters. Those detained include the daughter of Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who a day earlier had questioned Shafik about the school's treatment of pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nThe arrests, which New York Mayor Eric Adams says were requested by Columbia officials, garner national attention and inflame college protests nationwide. A day later, the University of Southern California announces that it has canceled the keynote commencement speech by filmmaker Jon M. Chu. USC had already disallowed its student valedictorian, who is Muslim, from speaking at the May 10 commencement.\n\nIn the coming days, pro-Palestinian encampments will be set up at the University of Michigan, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina.\n\nAPRIL 22\n\nColumbia cancels in-person classes, and an encampment at New York University swells to hundreds of protesters. NYU officials call in police after warning the crowd to leave and says the scene has become disorderly. Police arrest dozens of protesters at NYU and at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The gates to Harvard Yard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are closed to the public.\n\nPresident Joe Biden addresses the unrest and seeks to find a narrow middle ground by condemning \"antisemitic protests,\" adding that he also condemns \"those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians.\"\n\nAPRIL 24\n\nColumbia administrators set a new midnight deadline for protesters to clear the encampment. While some leave, others dig in and refuse to disband until the school agrees to stop doing business with Israel or any companies that support the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nElsewhere, police make more arrests on other university campuses. At the University of Texas at Austin, hundreds of local and state police -- including some on horseback and holding batons -- aggressively clash with protesters, pushing them off campus grounds, and arresting more than 30 people. At the University of Southern California, police peacefully arrest student protesters.\n\nAPRIL 26\n\nColumbia University students say they're at an impasse after exhaustive negotiations with administrators and they intend to continue their encampment until their divestment demands are met. That comes after hundreds of protesters have been arrested nationwide over the previous nine days. The school sends students an email saying that bringing back police \"at this time\" would be counterproductive.\n\nMeanwhile, schools across the country where protests have taken root prepare to shut down encampments over reports of antisemitic activity and concerns the protests will mar upcoming commencement ceremonies.\n\nAPRIL 29\n\nColumbia makes good on its promise to suspend students who defy a 2 p.m. deadline to leave the encampment of more than 100 tents. Instead of vacating, hundreds of protesters remain, marching around the quad and weaving around piles of temporary flooring and green carpeting meant for graduation ceremonies that are scheduled to begin next week.\n\nAround the country, the number of arrests at campuses nationwide approaches 1,000 as the final days of class wrap up.\n\nAPRIL 30\n\nDozens of protesters take over Hamilton Hall on Columbia's campus, barricading entrances and hanging a \"Free Palestine\" banner from a window as administrators warn that they face expulsion for doing so. Protesters insist they will remain at the hall until the university agrees to three demands: divestment from Israel and companies supporting the war in Gaza, financial transparency and amnesty for protesters.\n\nHours later, New York City police carrying riot shields storm the building and clear dozens of people from it, sweeping the encampment on the campus as well. The action from city police came at the request of the university, according to a police statement.\n\nMAY 6\n\nColumbia cancels its university-wide commencement ceremony.

Further, Columbia said it plans to share details in the coming days about a \"festive event\" on May 15 that would allow graduates to come together to celebrate.\n\n\"Our students emphasised that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families. They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers,\" the university statement said. \"As a result, we will focus our resources on those school ceremonies and on keeping them safe, respectful, and running smoothly.\"\n\nThe decision comes nearly a week after New York police arrested more than 200 protesters on campus last week.\n\nAfter the arrests, Columbia said law enforcement will stay on campus to ensure safety through at least May 17.\n\nAccording to CNN, Columbia University President Minouche Shafik said the university did not \"want to deprive thousands of students and their families and friends of a graduation celebration.\"\n\n\"Please recall that many in this graduating class did not get a celebration when graduating from high school because of the pandemic, and many of them are the first in their families to earn a university degree,\" Shafik said.\n\nFollowing this, University of Southern California was the first to cancel its main commencement ceremony at the end of April, citing \"new safety measures in place.\" As arrests unfolded and escalated across campus encampments last week, other universities are following suit.\n\nDemands vary for these pro-Palestinian protests that have swept university campuses in recent weeks, but most demonstrators are calling for their schools to divest from companies and other entities that they say support or benefit from Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nHarvard University warned protesters on Monday that those involved in the pro-Palestinian encampment on campus face \"involuntary leave\" and may not be able to sit for exams.\n\n\"I write today with this simple message: The continuation of the encampment presents a significant risk to the educational environment of the University,\" Alan Garber, Harvard's interim president, wrote in an email to the Harvard community.\n\n\"Those who participate in or perpetuate its continuation will be referred for involuntary leave from their schools,\" Garber said.\n\nStudents placed on involuntary leave may not be able to sit for exams, may not reside in Harvard housing and \"must cease to be present on campus until reinstated,\" the Harvard interim president said.

Instead of the universitywide graduation, which was set to take place on May 15, the institution will hold \"smaller-scale, school-based celebrations\" for its nearly 15,000 graduates starting on Friday and running through May 16.\n\nThe decision comes days after New York police raided the university's main campus and arrested more than 100 protesters. Columbia's president, Minouche Shafik, had previously said her desire to host the commencement ceremony played a role in her decision to request the NYPD's help in clearing Hamilton Hall, which demonstrators had occupied, and two of the student encampments on the campus's main lawn. She also requested that officers remain on campus until at least May 17.\n\nThe smaller-scale graduation events will be held outside Columbia's main campus, including at the university's athletics complex, officials said. \"These past few weeks have been incredibly difficult for our community,\" they said in their announcement. \"Just as we are focused on making our graduation experience truly special, we continue to solicit student feedback and are looking at the possibility of a festive event on May 15 to take the place of the large, formal ceremony.\"\n\nOver the past month, a growing number of college students across the country have joined the protests against the war in Gaza, setting up pro-Palestine encampments on campus and demanding that their schools divest from Israel. The protests' possible impact on commencement ceremonies has caused concern among university administrators. In late April, the University of Southern California canceled its graduation, originally set for May 10. The decision came days after the university was criticized for preventing its pro-Palestine valedictorian from speaking at the ceremony due to unspecified security concerns. On Saturday, around 75 graduates at the University of Michigan briefly interrupted the school's commencement ceremony and walked out holding Palestinian flags.

Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its campus quadrangle in Atlanta to a suburban arena. But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia's Teachers College.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks, and similar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC early Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday, while in Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags as Northeastern University held its commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, disruptions continued Monday following the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian encampment and some 200 arrests last week. Police detained numerous people in a parking structure. The university also said classes held in one building, Monroe Hall, would move online \"due to ongoing disruptions\" but did not provide details.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nHamas announced Monday that it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari proposal for a cease-fire to halt the war in Gaza. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the deal, and details of the proposal have not yet been released.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the quad on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members. Police used pepper balls and electric stun guns to subdue some of the people who were arrested. Fenves later apologized.\n\nProtests have continued on the campus since then, including some additional arrests.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Graduation had been scheduled for May 15.\n\nColumbia in a statement called the past few weeks \"incredibly difficult for our community.\"\n\nThe protests at Columbia, which drew national attention, have inspired similar demonstrations at dozens of universities around the US Students have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and have demanded their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nOn Monday, Hamas said it agreed to a ceasefire proposal with Israel in Gaza. Israel said it was a \"softened\" Egyptian proposal that was not acceptable to Israel.\n\nDuring the seven-month-old war more than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military operations in Gaza, according to health officials in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian enclave. The war began when Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct 7, killing about 1,200 people and abducting 252 others, of whom 133 are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nAs protests gathered steam at US colleges, some universities, including Columbia, called in riot police wielding batons and flash-bang grenades to disperse and arrest hundreds of protesters, citing a paramount need for campus safety. Civil rights groups have decried such tactics as unnecessarily violent infringements on free speech.\n\nThe turmoil on campuses has promptedcolleges across the United States to relocate, modify or cancel commencement ceremonies altogether.\n\nIn April, the University of Southern California also called off its main-stage ceremony, one week after canceling the valedictorian speech by a Muslim student who said she was silenced by anti-Palestinian hatred.\n\nColumbia said on Monday it had consulted with student leaders in deciding how to handle graduation. The majority of the smaller ceremonies, which had been set to take place on its upper Manhattan campus, where most of the protests have taken place, will take place at the main athletic complex about five miles (8 km) away.\n\nThe demonstrations have emerged as a political flashpoint during a contentious US election year as Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican former US President Donald Trump face off in a rematch for the White House.\n\nRALLY FOR ISRAEL, JEWISH STUDENTS\n\nRepublican US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson -- who condemned Columbia's administrators, accusing them of being too lenient on demonstrators during a campus visit in April -- blasted them again on Monday, saying the decision to cancel commencement denied thousands of graduates the recognition they deserved.\n\nJohnson also called on the school's board of trustees to remove university President Nemat Minouche Shafik, adding that the cancellation showed she would rather \"cede control to Hamas supporters than restore order.\"\n\nA rally to support Jewish, Israeli-American and Israeli students was planned for Monday evening near Columbia's campus by an Israel advocacy group, the Israeli-American Council, which called the campus protests \"anti-Israel and antisemitic\".\n\nNew York City police cleared a Columbia building last week that had been barricaded by pro-Palestinian protesters, arresting more than 100 people in and around the campus and dismantling an encampment.\n\nOther US universities have continued grappling this week with how to clear their campuses of protesters.\n\nAt Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, interim President Alan Garber said on Monday that protesters who continued participating in a two-week-old encampment would be referred for \"involuntary leave,\" meaning they may not be able to sit for exams, reside in Harvard housing or be on campus until reinstated.\n\n\"As we begin our extensive preparations for Commencement, this ongoing violation of our policies becomes more consequential,\" said Garber, citing reports from some students that the camp disrupted their ability to sleep, study and move freely about the campus.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, where pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian protesters clashed last week and where police arrested more than 200 people while clearing a pro-Palestinian encampment on Thursday, Chancellor Gene Block on Sunday announced a new Office of Campus Safety.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bdnews24.com"},

Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its campus quadrangle in Atlanta to a suburban arena. But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Suspended Sioux City inclusion liaison accuses human rights director of harassment, defamation\n\nColumbia's decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president, Nemat Shafik, from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week.\n\nNoting that the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said in its announcement that it made the decision after discussions with students.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" officials said. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers.\"\n\nMost of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.\n\nSpeakers at some of Columbia's still-scheduled graduation ceremonies include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames, former CNN anchor Poppy Harlow, political scientist Ian Bremmer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health. Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia's Teachers College.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks, and similar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC early Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday, while in Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags as Northeastern University held its commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, disruptions continued Monday following the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian encampment and some 200 arrests last week. Police detained numerous people in a parking structure. The university also said classes held in one building, Monroe Hall, would move online \"due to ongoing disruptions\" but did not provide details.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nHamas announced Monday that it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari proposal for a cease-fire to halt the war in Gaza. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the deal, and details of the proposal have not yet been released.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the quad on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members. Police used pepper balls and electric stun guns to subdue some of the people who were arrested. Fenves later apologized.\n\nProtests have continued on the campus since then, including some additional arrests.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

What does that mean for Penn's commencement?", "body": "Penn's commencement is scheduled for May 20, but could be impacted by ongoing protests of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nColumbia University is canceling its two main commencement ceremonies following week-long protests of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nInstead of a traditional commencement ceremony, Columbia will focus on \"Class Days and school-level ceremonies, where students are honored individually alongside their peers,\" the university announced Monday.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families. They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers,\" Columbia said in a statement. \"As a result, we will focus our resources on those school ceremonies and on keeping them safe, respectful, and running smoothly.\"\n\nThe smaller events won't take place on Columbia's South lawn, where pro-Palestinian demonstrators set up an encampment that was taken down last week. Students that refused to leave were suspended by the school, and protesters who barricaded themselves into a building on campus were dispersed by police. Two hundred and eighty two people were arrested, according to the New York Police Department.\n\nIt's unclear what impact Columbia's commencement cancellation will have on other schools and universities where protests of the Israel-Hamas war continue.\n\nAt Penn, an encampment of protesters nears its third week, despite interim President J. Larry Jameson reiterating in a Monday morning email that the demonstration must come down. Unlike incidents at Columbia and UCLA, there have only been minor arrests connected to the protests at the University of Pennsylvania, which have remained peaceful.\n\nPenn's commencement is scheduled for Monday, May 20 at Franklin Field. The university did not return a request for comment about any changes to commencement.\n\nThe protesters are calling for Penn to disclose its financial holdings, divest from any investments in the war, and provide amnesty for pro-Palestinian students facing discipline over past protests.\n\nUniversity leaders have met with the protesters, but have referred to a 2016 law that prohibits Pennsylvania from signing contracts with entities that boycott or divest from Israel.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_tornoe@inquirer.com", "name": "Rob Tornoe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pennsylvania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franklin Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/YljujNj1jFF7rYS4LDwzLdTJhrA=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/PYHVED2UWVBP5KDHMNP6ADMVSI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 37, "textEnd": 43, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

This could pave the way for even more colleges to scrap their traditional graduation festivities this year.\n\nColumbia, situated in Manhattan's Morningside Heights neighborhood, will instead host smaller ceremonies for each of its schools. The ceremonies are being relocated to new venues, including the school's athletic complex roughly 100 blocks north and away from the Morningside campus's iconic south lawn, which had been the site of a pro-Palestinian tent encampment for two weeks until the police disbanded it last week.\n\n\"We have decided to make the centerpiece of our Commencement activities our Class Days and school-level ceremonies, where students are honored individually alongside their peers, rather than the University-wide ceremony that is scheduled for May 15,\" the university said in a statement on Monday. The full commencement events will run between May 10 and May 16.\n\nTickets are required to attend the ceremonies, though that might not necessarily stop people without tickets from trying to disrupt the celebrations. Outside agitators accounted for nearly a third of the 112 protestors who were arrested by the New York Police Department for breaking into Hamilton Hall last week.\n\nBefore calling in the police on April 30, Columbia's president, Nemat Shafik, made clear her desire to host graduation on campus. While pleading with the students to disperse from the encampment on the campus's central lawn, she asserted, \"We also do not want to deprive thousands of students and their families and friends of a graduation celebration.\"\n\nFor many members of the class of 2024, this marks the second graduation blow after their high school graduation ceremonies in 2020 were derailed by the Covid-19 pandemic. As Ms. Shafik reminded students in her statement last week, \"many in this graduating class did not get a celebration when graduating from high school because of the pandemic, and many of them are the first in their families to earn a University degree.\"\n\nLast week, the University of Southern California, a prestigious private university at Los Angeles, also announced plans to cancel its main commencement, citing \"safety measures\" as student protests intensified over the war in Gaza. Tensions rose on campus after the university chose to ban its valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, from speaking at the commencement. Pro-Israeli groups charged that Ms. Tabassum had liked and shared anti-Israel posts on her Instagram page.\n\nIn place of a traditional ceremony, USC will now host a \"Trojan Family\" graduation event on Thursday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, featuring a drone show, fireworks, and surprise performances. New security measures have also been put in place.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "m_j_koch@nysun.com", "name": "M.J.

So once again, the bad actors get their way and disrupt things\n\nThe school said they were considering some \"festive event\" instead for the students on May 15. You mean kind of like...a graduation? And how would that be different and avoid being disrupted by these characters? And if you were to hold that, then why not the regular graduation? Some other commencements at other schools have been disrupted by these characters, like at the University of Michigan, where the police carted them out, and the ceremony continued. Mayor Eric Adams had said he would have police to protect graduations, but Columbia apparently decided they didn't want to go that route.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) blasted the Columbia president for this decision and called for her to be removed.\n\n\"President Shafik and Columbia University administrators have displayed a shocking unwillingness to control their campus. They've allowed outside agitators and terrorist-sympathizing students and faculty to rewrite campus rules and spew vile, anti-Jewish aggression. Now, thousands of students who've worked hard to achieve their degrees will not get the recognition they deserve,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Because it is abundantly clear that President Shafik would rather cede control to Hamas supporters than restore order, Columbia's Board of Trustees should immediately remove her and appoint a new president who will. Our once great universities desperately need strong moral leadership, now more than ever,\" he added.\n\nPeople busted the University for their weakness.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nThe Next Target for the Pro-Hamas Zealots -- Graduations\n\nJonathan Turley Lays Some Reality on New Laughable Demand From Columbia Law Students\n\nNew: Columbia University Hands the Reins Back to Woke Students in Stunning Display of Cowardice", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_arama@redstate.com", "name": "Nick Arama", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lawn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Lawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(John_Lennon_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imagine (John Lennon song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealots", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zealots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Adams_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Adams (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Turley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Turley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/113/70d55d1b-150b-4858-90d7-c26871085461.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 445, "textEnd": 451, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its campus quadrangle in Atlanta to a suburban arena. But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia's Teachers College.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks, and similar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC early Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday, while in Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags as Northeastern University held its commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, disruptions continued Monday following the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian encampment and some 200 arrests last week. Police detained numerous people in a parking structure. The university also said classes held in one building, Monroe Hall, would move online \"due to ongoing disruptions\" but did not provide details.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nHamas announced Monday that it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari proposal for a cease-fire to halt the war in Gaza. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the deal, and details of the proposal have not yet been released.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the quad on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members. Police used pepper balls and electric stun guns to subdue some of the people who were arrested. Fenves later apologized.\n\nProtests have continued on the campus since then, including some additional arrests.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Based on their feedback, we have decided to make the centerpiece of our Commencement activities our Class Days and school-level ceremonies, where students are honored individually alongside their peers, rather than the University-wide ceremony that is scheduled for May 15...\n\nTo ensure we will have the best conditions and resources for a meaningful experience, we have decided to relocate our Class Days and school ceremonies scheduled for the South Lawn of Morningside campus. The majority of these ceremonies will be hosted at Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex, the timing will remain the same (with the exception of the Columbia College Class Day and Columbia Climate School), and there is no need for a change in travel plans for families. Please see below for the full list of school ceremonies, times and locations.\n\nThe athletics complex where the graduations will be moved is about five miles away from the main campus. It's probably going to be inconvenient but at least the graduations can take place on the dates originally scheduled, meaning parents and families, some of whom fly in from other countries, won't have to rearrange their entire schedules at the last minute. Still it's disappointing that the campus extremists have created this disruption. The school admitted as much.\n\nThe university's main campus has been in a state of near lockdown since last Tuesday, when hundreds of police officers swarmed Hamilton Hall to remove some 46 pro-Palestinian protesters who had occupied the building and arrested more than 100 people protesting in and around the campus.\n\nColumbia has repeatedly said Hamilton Hall remains a crime scene, leaving questions as to how some 15,000 graduates and their guests could easily be admitted to the area around it for the May 15 commencement. Dozens of police officers still surround the campus...\n\n\"Holding a large commencement ceremony on our campus presented security concerns that unfortunately proved insurmountable,\" Ben Chang, a university spokesman, said. He added that the school had made extensive efforts to identify an alternative venue and was unable to locate one that could host such a large event. \"Like our students, we are deeply disappointed with this outcome.\"\n\nI'm not sure this is such a good decision. The school is framing this as a security issue but even if a bunch of protesters got into the graduation, they could be removed and the school would have one more reason to expel them. Cancelling the main graduation gives the protesters a win they don't deserve.\n\nSeveral reports have touched on the fact that ceding this particular territory in the center of campus may be about avoiding having President Shafik give a graducation speech at the site of the former encampment. There is concern that having her do so would rile up the activists. And maybe it would, but backing down also has the potential to rile up the activists because it suggests they are still in charge somehow. Former President Trump said of the decision \"that shouldn't happen\" and he's right.\n\nThis guy is a professor at UPenn. Today he posted his idea of what Columbia's President Shafik should have said to preserve the main graduation.\n\nColumbia went through all of the trouble to clear the campus twice in order to hold graduation there. President Shafik should have held the ceremony and made a point of having restored order to the campus. Instead, she's afraid that declaring victory will be a bad look and is throwing the protesters a lifeline. It's a mistake but I can't say I'm surprised.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_sexton@hotair.com", "name": "John Sexton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Climate_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbia Climate School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningside_University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morningside University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lawn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Lawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Pennsylvania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/113/42fd2fe5-43d0-4bdc-bbbb-d4fde5f947fe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 902, "textEnd": 908, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Smaller ceremonies that were supposed to be held outside on the university's campus will be moved indoors. Meanwhile, replacement \"class-day\" events will take place primarily off-campus at the Baker Athletic Complex, roughly five miles north of Columbia University's main campus.\n\nThe university cited its desire to \"keep students safe\" as the motive for cancelling the school's main commencement event.\n\nFor nearly three weeks, university students have been amassing in the hundreds at a growing number of schools, taking over sections of campuses by setting up \"Gaza Solidarity Encampments\" and refusing to leave unless administrators condemn and boycott Israel. Footage of the protests has shown demonstrators chanting in support of Hamas, calling for the destruction of Israel, and even threatening to harm members of the Jewish community on campus. In many cases, activists have also lambasted the US and Western civilization more broadly.\n\nThe protests initially erupted across the US but have since spread to university campuses around the world, primarily in the West.\n\nAmid the disruptions, several schools have canceled their spring-time graduation ceremonies, fearing the demonstrations could fuel unrest at large gatherings.\n\nStill, New York politicians have encouraged universities to continue with regularly scheduled graduations.\n\n\"We will do our job, and if the institutions decide to graduate their students and celebrate a beautiful experience with their families, we'll make sure it's done in a peaceful manner,\" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a recent interview before Columbia's decision.\n\nIn a public letter to university presidents, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul wrote, \"It is my expectation that every college and university in New York will celebrate commencement safely in person.\"\n\nColumbia has been the center of the recent wave of anti-Israel protests on campus, with activists setting up an encampment last month. As a result of the demonstrations, Columbia closed its main campus during the Jewish holiday of Passover, holding only virtual classes. Meanwhile, a prominent Orthodox rabbi at the school urged Jewish students to leave the campus and \"return home as soon as possible\" for their safety.\n\nOn April 30, protestors occupied Hamilton Hall, an administrative building on campus, leading to a standoff between protestors and the New York City Police Department (NYPD). Eventually, hundreds of NYPD officers swept the building, arresting dozens of protesters including university students and professors. NYPD officials said they found signs that read \"death to America\" and \"death to Israel\" in the building.\n\nColumbia was hardly the first school to decide to cancel its commencement ceremony amid the ongoing protests. Last month, University of Southern California (USC) provost Andrew Guzman announced that commencement had been cancelled there, after a string of pro-Hamas protests and the formation of encampments. The university said that \"tradition must give way to safety\" in its rationale for the cancellation. USC instead opted for smaller graduation events by school like Columbia, with a strict policy for bringing bags and a limited number of non-transferable tickets available to each graduate.\n\nWashington University in St. Louis, similarly rocked by anti-Israel protests on campus, decided to stick with the regular commencement schedule. On April 27, over a hundred protesters including professors and former presidential candidate Jill Stein were arrested while protesting on campus. In response, the university placed fences around the borders of campus in the hopes of deterring future protests and to protect graduation festivities. The university issued guidelines for its commencement on May 13, including that graduates are forbidden from bringing bags, tickets are required, and guests are only permitted to bring a clear plastic bag.\n\n\"We're hopeful that everyone in the WashU community will do their part to help ensure that these students in particular are able to have at least one graduation that is memorable for the right reasons,\" Chancellor Andrew Martin wrote in an email to students.\n\nColumbia's cancellation came only days after commencement events at the University of Michigan were interrupted by pro-Hamas protesters waving Palestinian flags and chanting slogans about the university supporting genocide. Police prevented the protesters from reaching the main podium to the applause of most in attendance.\n\nDemonstrators across the US and Europe have called for universities to condemn Israel's ongoing war against the Hamas terror group in Gaza and to divest from any entities linked to the Jewish state.", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Algemeiner"}, "authors":

Graduation had been scheduled for May 15.\n\nColumbia in a statement called the past few weeks \"incredibly difficult for our community.\" The protests at Columbia, which drew national attention, have inspired similar demonstrations at dozens of universities around the U.S. Students have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and have demanded their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nOn Monday, Hamas said it agreed to a ceasefire proposal with Israel in Gaza. Israel said it was a \"softened\" Egyptian proposal that was not acceptable to Israel. During the seven-month-old war more than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military operations in Gaza, according to health officials in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian enclave. The war began when Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and abducting 252 others, of whom 133 are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nAs protests gathered steam at U.S. colleges, some universities, including Columbia, called in riot police wielding batons and flash-bang grenades to disperse and arrest hundreds of protesters, citing a paramount need for campus safety. Civil rights groups have decried such tactics as unnecessarily violent infringements on free speech. The turmoil on campuses has prompted colleges across the United States to relocate, modify or cancel commencement ceremonies altogether.\n\nIn April, the University of Southern California also called off its main-stage ceremony, one week after canceling the valedictorian speech by a Muslim student who said she was silenced by anti-Palestinian hatred. Columbia said on Monday it had consulted with student leaders in deciding how to handle graduation. The majority of the smaller ceremonies, which had been set to take place on its upper Manhattan campus, where most of the protests have taken place, will take place at the main athletic complex about five miles (8 km) away.\n\nThe demonstrations have emerged as a political flashpoint during a contentious U.S. election year as Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican former U.S President Donald Trump face off in a rematch for the White House. RALLY FOR ISRAEL, JEWISH STUDENTS\n\nRepublican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson -- who condemned Columbia's administrators, accusing them of being too lenient on demonstrators during a campus visit in April -- blasted them again on Monday, saying the decision to cancel commencement denied thousands of graduates the recognition they deserved. Johnson also called on the school's board of trustees to remove university President Nemat Minouche Shafik, adding that the cancellation showed she would rather \"cede control to Hamas supporters than restore order.\"\n\nA rally to support Jewish, Israeli-American and Israeli students was planned for Monday evening near Columbia's campus by an Israel advocacy group, the Israeli-American Council, which called the campus protests \"anti-Israel and antisemitic\". New York City police cleared a Columbia building last week that had been barricaded by pro-Palestinian protesters, arresting more than 100 people in and around the campus and dismantling an encampment.\n\nOther U.S. universities have continued grappling this week with how to clear their campuses of protesters. At Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, interim President Alan Garber said on Monday that protesters who continued participating in a two-week-old encampment would be referred for \"involuntary leave,\" meaning they may not be able to sit for exams, reside in Harvard housing or be on campus until reinstated.\n\n\"As we begin our extensive preparations for Commencement, this ongoing violation of our policies becomes more consequential,\" said Garber, citing reports from some students that the camp disrupted their ability to sleep, study and move freely about the campus.

The university will still hold smaller, school-based events.\n\nThe protests at Columbia have inspired similar demonstrations at dozens of universities across the United States and the world. Students have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and demanded their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nOn Monday, Hamas said it had agreed to a ceasefire proposal with Israel in Gaza. However, Israel said it was a \"softened\" Egyptian proposal that was not acceptable.\n\nDuring the six-month war more than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military operations in Gaza, according to health officials in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory. Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct 7 2023, killing about 1,200 people and abducting 252 others, of whom 133 are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza.\n\nAs protests gathered steam some universities, including Columbia, called in riot police wielding batons and flash-bang grenades to disperse and arrest hundreds of protesters, citing the need for campus safety.

The majority of the smaller ceremonies, which had been set to take place on its upper Manhattan campus where most of the protests have occurred, have been moved to the main athletic complex about five miles away.\n\nThe demonstrations have emerged as a political flashpoint during a contentious election year as Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican former US president Donald Trump look set to face off in a rematch for the White House.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valedictorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valedictorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stun_grenade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stun grenade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baton (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/i4Oy2rbBHdZeLGZuZeETqg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NDk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/be83ebb373d1ac8657cae3e6fa86101f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 401, "textEnd": 407}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Buy a Day Pass or just this story using our new Digital Wallet\n\nColumbia University announced on Monday that it has canceled its university-wide commencement ceremony because of disruptions caused by recent pro-Palestinian protests. Students will still be able to celebrate at a series of smaller, school-based graduation ceremonies this week and next.\n\nThe protest movement connected to the Israel-Hamas war began nearly three weeks ago at the Ivy League university in New York City. It has since swept college campuses nationwide, with more than 2,500 people arrested.\n\nThe university's large graduation ceremony was scheduled for May 15 on the college's main lawn, which is where a protest encampment was based until authorities dismantled it last week. University officials said the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, and that they decided to cancel the ceremony after discussing it with students.\n\nA timeline illustrating how Columbia University became the driving force behind protests on college campuses across the country:\n\nAPRIL 17\n\nStudents set up an encampment at Columbia University the same day university president Nemat Shafik is called for questioning before Congress. Shafik is heavily criticized by Republicans who accuse her of not doing enough to combat concerns about antisemitism on Columbia's campus. Allegations of antisemitism arose during pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's actions in the war in Gaza.\n\nThe public grilling session comes four months after a similarly contentious congressional hearing led to the resignations of two Ivy League presidents. Unlike her counterparts, who focused their responses on protecting free speech, Shafik strongly denounced antisemitism, saying it \"has no place on our campus.\"\n\nAPRIL 18\n\nNew York City police are called to Columbia's campus to disband the protest encampment and arrest more than 100 protesters. Those detained include the daughter of Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who a day earlier had questioned Shafik about the school's treatment of pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nThe arrests, which New York Mayor Eric Adams says were requested by Columbia officials, garner national attention and inflame college protests nationwide. A day later, the University of Southern California announces that it has canceled the keynote commencement speech by filmmaker Jon M. Chu. USC had already disallowed its student valedictorian, who is Muslim, from speaking at the May 10 commencement.\n\nIn the coming days, pro-Palestinian encampments will be set up at the University of Michigan, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina.\n\nAPRIL 22\n\nColumbia cancels in-person classes, and an encampment at New York University swells to hundreds of protesters. NYU officials call in police after warning the crowd to leave and says the scene has become disorderly. Police arrest dozens of protesters at NYU and at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The gates to Harvard Yard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are closed to the public.\n\nPresident Joe Biden addresses the unrest and seeks to find a narrow middle ground by condemning \"antisemitic protests,\" adding that he also condemns \"those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians.\"\n\nAPRIL 24\n\nColumbia administrators set a new midnight deadline for protesters to clear the encampment. While some leave, others dig in and refuse to disband until the school agrees to stop doing business with Israel or any companies that support the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nElsewhere, police make more arrests on other university campuses. At the University of Texas at Austin, hundreds of local and state police -- including some on horseback and holding batons -- aggressively clash with protesters, pushing them off campus grounds, and arresting more than 30 people. At the University of Southern California, police peacefully arrest student protesters.\n\nAPRIL 26\n\nColumbia University students say they're at an impasse after exhaustive negotiations with administrators and they intend to continue their encampment until their divestment demands are met. That comes after hundreds of protesters have been arrested nationwide over the previous nine days. The school sends students an email saying that bringing back police \"at this time\" would be counterproductive.\n\nMeanwhile, schools across the country where protests have taken root prepare to shut down encampments over reports of antisemitic activity and concerns the protests will mar upcoming commencement ceremonies.\n\nAPRIL 29\n\nColumbia makes good on its promise to suspend students who defy a 2 p.m. deadline to leave the encampment of more than 100 tents. Instead of vacating, hundreds of protesters remain, marching around the quad and weaving around piles of temporary flooring and green carpeting meant for graduation ceremonies that are scheduled to begin next week.\n\nAround the country, the number of arrests at campuses nationwide approaches 1,000 as the final days of class wrap up.\n\nAPRIL 30\n\nDozens of protesters take over Hamilton Hall on Columbia's campus, barricading entrances and hanging a \"Free Palestine\" banner from a window as administrators warn that they face expulsion for doing so. Protesters insist they will remain at the hall until the university agrees to three demands: divestment from Israel and companies supporting the war in Gaza, financial transparency and amnesty for protesters.\n\nHours later, New York City police carrying riot shields storm the building and clear dozens of people from it, sweeping the encampment on the campus as well. The action from city police came at the request of the university, according to a police statement.\n\nMAY 6\n\nColumbia cancels its university-wide commencement ceremony. The ceremony had been scheduled for May 15 on the south lawn of the Manhattan campus, where protest encampments were based for about three weeks before authorities dismantled them last week. Students will still be able to celebrate at a series of smaller, school-based graduation ceremonies this week and next. Those ceremonies will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.", "source": {"uri": "news-gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@news-gazette.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemat_Shafik", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nemat Shafik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Yard", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Yard"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_M._Chu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon M.

Pro-Palestinian protesters have dominated university quads in the last two weeks, shutting down colleges and clashing with riot police. But there's been a notable scarcity of student rallies in solidarity with Israelis.\n\nColumbia University announced on Monday that it has canceled its university-wide commencement ceremony because of disruptions caused by recent pro-Palestinian protests. Students will still be able to celebrate at a series of smaller, school-based graduation ceremonies this week and next.\n\nThe protest movement connected to the Israel-Hamas war began nearly three weeks ago at the Ivy League university in New York City. It has since swept college campuses nationwide, with more than 2,500 people arrested.\n\nThe university's large graduation ceremony was scheduled for May 15 on the college's main lawn, which is where a protest encampment was based until authorities dismantled it last week. University officials said the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, and that they decided to cancel the ceremony after discussing it with students.\n\nA timeline illustrating how Columbia University became the driving force behind protests on college campuses across the country:\n\nAPRIL 17\n\nStudents set up an encampment at Columbia University the same day university president Nemat Shafik is called for questioning before Congress. Shafik is heavily criticized by Republicans who accuse her of not doing enough to combat concerns about antisemitism on Columbia's campus. Allegations of antisemitism arose during pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's actions in the war in Gaza.\n\nThe public grilling session comes four months after a similarly contentious congressional hearing led to the resignations of two Ivy League presidents. Unlike her counterparts, who focused their responses on protecting free speech, Shafik strongly denounced antisemitism, saying it \"has no place on our campus.\"\n\nAPRIL 18\n\nNew York City police are called to Columbia's campus to disband the protest encampment and arrest more than 100 protesters. Those detained include the daughter of Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who a day earlier had questioned Shafik about the school's treatment of pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nThe arrests, which New York Mayor Eric Adams says were requested by Columbia officials, garner national attention and inflame college protests nationwide. A day later, the University of Southern California announces that it has canceled the keynote commencement speech by filmmaker Jon M. Chu. USC had already disallowed its student valedictorian, who is Muslim, from speaking at the May 10 commencement.\n\nIn the coming days, pro-Palestinian encampments will be set up at the University of Michigan, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina.\n\nAPRIL 22\n\nColumbia cancels in-person classes, and an encampment at New York University swells to hundreds of protesters. NYU officials call in police after warning the crowd to leave and says the scene has become disorderly. Police arrest dozens of protesters at NYU and at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The gates to Harvard Yard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are closed to the public.\n\nPresident Joe Biden addresses the unrest and seeks to find a narrow middle ground by condemning \"antisemitic protests,\" adding that he also condemns \"those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians.\"\n\nAPRIL 24\n\nColumbia administrators set a new midnight deadline for protesters to clear the encampment. While some leave, others dig in and refuse to disband until the school agrees to stop doing business with Israel or any companies that support the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nElsewhere, police make more arrests on other university campuses. At the University of Texas at Austin, hundreds of local and state police -- including some on horseback and holding batons -- aggressively clash with protesters, pushing them off campus grounds, and arresting more than 30 people. At the University of Southern California, police peacefully arrest student protesters.\n\nAPRIL 26\n\nColumbia University students say they're at an impasse after exhaustive negotiations with administrators and they intend to continue their encampment until their divestment demands are met. That comes after hundreds of protesters have been arrested nationwide over the previous nine days. The school sends students an email saying that bringing back police \"at this time\" would be counterproductive.\n\nMeanwhile, schools across the country where protests have taken root prepare to shut down encampments over reports of antisemitic activity and concerns the protests will mar upcoming commencement ceremonies.\n\nAPRIL 29\n\nColumbia makes good on its promise to suspend students who defy a 2 p.m. deadline to leave the encampment of more than 100 tents. Instead of vacating, hundreds of protesters remain, marching around the quad and weaving around piles of temporary flooring and green carpeting meant for graduation ceremonies that are scheduled to begin next week.\n\nAround the country, the number of arrests at campuses nationwide approaches 1,000 as the final days of class wrap up.\n\nAPRIL 30\n\nDozens of protesters take over Hamilton Hall on Columbia's campus, barricading entrances and hanging a \"Free Palestine\" banner from a window as administrators warn that they face expulsion for doing so. Protesters insist they will remain at the hall until the university agrees to three demands: divestment from Israel and companies supporting the war in Gaza, financial transparency and amnesty for protesters.\n\nHours later, New York City police carrying riot shields storm the building and clear dozens of people from it, sweeping the encampment on the campus as well. The action from city police came at the request of the university, according to a police statement.\n\nMAY 6\n\nColumbia cancels its university-wide commencement ceremony. The ceremony had been scheduled for May 15 on the south lawn of the Manhattan campus, where protest encampments were based for about three weeks before authorities dismantled them last week. Students will still be able to celebrate at a series of smaller, school-based graduation ceremonies this week and next. Those ceremonies will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@ktbs.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemat_Shafik", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nemat Shafik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Yard", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Yard"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_M._Chu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon M.

Students had pitched tents in the heart of the Morningside Heights campus, demanding the school divest from all financial ties to Israel.

anti-Semitism.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump -- Biden's competitor in November's presidential election -- has accused him of being soft by failing to condemn the pro-Palestinian supporters.\n\nTrump

She has been working at PEOPLE since 2022. Her work previously appeared in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, The Dallas Morning News, Eater and other publications.\n\nColumbia University has canceled its main commencement ceremony following weeks of protests over the Israel-Hamas war, officials said Monday.\n\nThe ceremony, originally scheduled for May 15, will be replaced by \"school-level ceremonies, where students are honored individually alongside their peers,\" the university said in a news release on May 6.\n\n\"Our graduating students, their families, and their loved ones are very focused on our upcoming Commencement celebrations,\" the school said in the release. \"We are as well. We are determined to give our students the celebration they deserve, and that they want.\"\n\nMost of the ceremonies will occur at Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex, the school said. The athletics complex is about 100 blocks away from the campus, located on 218th Street in Manhattan.\n\nA similar decision was recently made at the University of Southern California (USC). \"With the new safety measures in place this year, the time needed to process the large number of guests coming to campus will increase substantially,\" the school said in a statement. \"As a result, we will not be able to host the main stage ceremony that traditionally brings 65,000 students, families, and friends to our campus all at the same time.\"\n\nColumbia's decision comes weeks into continued controversy at the Ivy League school.\n\nMore than 100 people have been arrested during the protests on campus, and police swarmed Hamilton Hall on April 30, where pro-Palestinian protestors were removed from the building at the request of school administrators, The New York Times reported.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThe ongoing controversy was also front and center on Saturday Night Live, which featured a cold open where members of the cast played parents concerned about their kids' involvement in the protests.\n\nFor students, many of whom missed out on a normal high school graduation four years ago due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are mixed emotions about missing out on another commencement.\n\nColumbia senior Henry Sears told NBC News last week that \"the top concern that I've been thinking about is what will happen with commencement, especially since our first year of college was online.\"\n\nHowever, another graduating Columbia student expressed solidarity with the protests.\n\n\"I think that what's most important right now is that we stick together and put up a united front against the administration and if that means sacrificing my graduation, then I'm willing to do that, Rachel Burns told The New York Times.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type":

On April 18, dozens of students were arrested after University President Nemat Shafik requested the NYPD clear a student encampment protesting Columbia's investment in Israeli companies and defense contractors amid the ongoing war in Gaza. Shafik once again requested the NYPD on Thursday to clear the re-establishment of the encampment and remove students from Hamilton Hall, a campus building occupied by protesters. Law enforcement showed up heavily armed and clad in riot gear The NYPD arrested112 people in a night of violent action during which one officer fired his gun inside Hamilton Hall.\n\nColumbia's crackdown on protesters sparked a nationwide student movement against U.S. support for Israel's ongoing siege against Gaza, which has led to the deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinians. Across the country, protesters on university campuses have been met with similarly violent police responses.\n\nOver the weekend, students protested at the University of Michigan's commencement ceremony. Dozens of students clad in their academic regalia marched toward the stage at Michigan Stadium. \"Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest,\" they chanted, adding: \"Israel bombs, U of M pays, how many kids have you killed today?\" Several other schools, including the University of Vermont and the University of Southern California, have canceled their central commencement events in response to on-campus protests.\n\nWith Columbia serving as a focal point for the nationwide protest movement, students and faculty remain embittered by Shafik and the administration's response to protesters. A poll of students, faculty, and other Columbia staff conducted by The Columbia Spectator and New York Magazine found that 77 percent of the more than 700 individuals polled think Shafik's administration has not handled the demonstrations well, and 57 percent felt the use of the NYPD to clear the protesters was \"totally unwarranted.\"\n\nFifty percent of those polled felt Shafik should resign from her leadership of the college.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_mccann_ramirez@rollingstone.com", "name": "Nikki McCann Ramirez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_(U.S._TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Access (U.S. TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Daily_Spectator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia Daily Spectator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vermont", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Vermont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/columbia-cancels-graduation.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 520, "textEnd": 526}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-18", "textStart": 1079, "textEnd": 1087}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Pro-Palestinian protesters have dominated university quads in the last two weeks, shutting down colleges and clashing with riot police. But there's been a notable scarcity of student rallies in solidarity with Israelis.\n\nBy The Associated Press\n\nColumbia University announced on Monday that it has canceled its university-wide commencement ceremony because of disruptions caused by recent pro-Palestinian protests. Students will still be able to celebrate at a series of smaller, school-based graduation ceremonies this week and next.\n\nThe protest movement connected to the Israel-Hamas war began nearly three weeks ago at the Ivy League university in New York City. It has since swept college campuses nationwide, with more than 2,500 people arrested.\n\nThe university's large graduation ceremony was scheduled for May 15 on the college's main lawn, which is where a protest encampment was based until authorities dismantled it last week. University officials said the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, and that they decided to cancel the ceremony after discussing it with students.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Shafik is heavily criticized by Republicans who accuse her of not doing enough to combat concerns about antisemitism on Columbia's campus. Allegations of antisemitism arose during pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's actions in the war in Gaza.\n\nThe public grilling session comes four months after a similarly contentious congressional hearing led to the resignations of two Ivy League presidents. Unlike her counterparts, who focused their responses on protecting free speech, Shafik strongly denounced antisemitism, saying it \"has no place on our campus.\"\n\nAPRIL 18\n\nNew York City police are called to Columbia's campus to disband the protest encampment and arrest more than 100 protesters. Those detained include the daughter of Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who a day earlier had questioned Shafik about the school's treatment of pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nThe arrests, which New York Mayor Eric Adams says were requested by Columbia officials, garner national attention and inflame college protests nationwide. A day later, the University of Southern California announces that it has canceled the keynote commencement speech by filmmaker Jon M. Chu. USC had already disallowed its student valedictorian, who is Muslim, from speaking at the May 10 commencement.\n\nIn the coming days, pro-Palestinian encampments will be set up at the University of Michigan, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina.\n\nAPRIL 22\n\nColumbia cancels in-person classes, and an encampment at New York University swells to hundreds of protesters. NYU officials call in police after warning the crowd to leave and says the scene has become disorderly. Police arrest dozens of protesters at NYU and at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The gates to Harvard Yard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are closed to the public.\n\nPresident Joe Biden addresses the unrest and seeks to find a narrow middle ground by condemning \"antisemitic protests,\" adding that he also condemns \"those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians.\"\n\nAPRIL 24\n\nColumbia administrators set a new midnight deadline for protesters to clear the encampment. While some leave, others dig in and refuse to disband until the school agrees to stop doing business with Israel or any companies that support the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nElsewhere, police make more arrests on other university campuses. At the University of Texas at Austin, hundreds of local and state police -- including some on horseback and holding batons -- aggressively clash with protesters, pushing them off campus grounds, and arresting more than 30 people. At the University of Southern California, police peacefully arrest student protesters.\n\nAPRIL 26\n\nColumbia University students say they're at an impasse after exhaustive negotiations with administrators and they intend to continue their encampment until their divestment demands are met. That comes after hundreds of protesters have been arrested nationwide over the previous nine days. The school sends students an email saying that bringing back police \"at this time\" would be counterproductive.\n\nMeanwhile, schools across the country where protests have taken root prepare to shut down encampments over reports of antisemitic activity and concerns the protests will mar upcoming commencement ceremonies.\n\nAPRIL 29\n\nColumbia makes good on its promise to suspend students who defy a 2 p.m. deadline to leave the encampment of more than 100 tents. Instead of vacating, hundreds of protesters remain, marching around the quad and weaving around piles of temporary flooring and green carpeting meant for graduation ceremonies that are scheduled to begin next week.\n\nAround the country, the number of arrests at campuses nationwide approaches 1,000 as the final days of class wrap up.\n\nAPRIL 30\n\nDozens of protesters take over Hamilton Hall on Columbia's campus, barricading entrances and hanging a \"Free Palestine\" banner from a window as administrators warn that they face expulsion for doing so. Protesters insist they will remain at the hall until the university agrees to three demands: divestment from Israel and companies supporting the war in Gaza, financial transparency and amnesty for protesters.\n\nHours later, New York City police carrying riot shields storm the building and clear dozens of people from it, sweeping the encampment on the campus as well. The action from city police came at the request of the university, according to a police statement.\n\nMAY 6\n\nColumbia cancels its university-wide commencement ceremony. The ceremony had been scheduled for May 15 on the south lawn of the Manhattan campus, where protest encampments were based for about three weeks before authorities dismantled them last week. Students will still be able to celebrate at a series of smaller, school-based graduation ceremonies this week and next.

The Ivy League school, like other colleges, has struggled to contain the demonstrators.\n\n\"These past few weeks have been incredibly difficult for our community,\" Columbia said in a statement Monday that announced it would instead hold a number of smaller ceremonies. Most of those ceremonies are slated to take place in an athletic facility 100 blocks away from the school's main Morningside Heights campus, where commencement has typically been held.\n\nThe school said it would also explore \"the possibility of a festive event\" to be held on Wednesday, May 15, the same day as the planned commencement, \"to take the place of the large, formal ceremony.\"\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get must-read New York stories each day\n\nBy submitting, I agree to the JTA/New York Jewish Week privacy policy & terms of use.\n\nPlease accept the JTA Privacy Policy\n\nBy submitting the above I agree to the privacy policy and terms of use of JTA.org\n\nStudent protests have already started spilling over into graduation ceremonies at other schools. Over the weekend, schools including the University of Michigan and Northeastern University saw their own commencements briefly disrupted by pro-Palestinian students, while the University of Virginia ordered its own encampment disbanded and arrested dozens of protesters before holding its own ceremony.\n\nThe University of Southern California, which erupted in controversy after barring its pro-Palestinian valedictorian from delivering a speech, also canceled its commencement ceremony. Emory University in Atlanta, where dozens of protesters (including at least one professor) have been arrested in recent weeks, announced Monday that it would be relocating its own commencement ceremony off-campus.\n\nThe move was Columbia's latest attempt to put a lid on the influence of its encampment, which like others is demanding that the school divest from Israel. The administration previously called in the NYPD on two separate occasions -- including when protesters occupied a building last week -- and shut down the campus amid violations of school policy and reports of antisemitic harassment and incitement.\n\nMinouche Shafik, the school's president, said in a video message on Friday that Columbia's attempt to reach a deal with protesters -- a strategy recently embraced by other schools including Brown University and Northwestern University -- failed after protesters occupied the campus building, Hamilton Hall. Many encampments have sought to use commencement as leverage for negotiations.\n\nThe Hamilton Hall occupation \"crossed a new line\" and \"was a violent act that put our students at risk,\" Shafik said. She did not mention commencement in the video. Only days earlier, Shafik had assured the campus community in an email that \"we will indeed hold a commencement.\"\n\nThe move was criticized by some pro-Israel voices who had previously put pressure on the university to more forcefully deal with the encampments, including outspoken Israeli Columbia professor Shai Davidai, who himself received criticism after suggesting the school should call in the National Guard to deal with the protesters.\n\n\"The administration capitulated to a small and violent minority. They much rather appease the pro-Hamas mob than the thousands of peaceful students who just want a normal graduation,\" Davidai wrote on the social network X. Republican New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who has been a vocal critic of universities' handling of the protests, said the cancellation \"is an unbelievable failure of leadership.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, called on Columbia's trustees to remove Shafik.\n\nColumbia's commencement announcement came hours before its own journalism school prepared to announce the winners of this year's Pulitzer Prizes, the prestigious journalism and literature prize. The awards are expected to include several reports on Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks, the Israel-Hamas war and their impact.\n\nSupport the New York Jewish Week\n\nOur nonprofit newsroom depends on readers like you.

Pro-Palestinian protesters have dominated university quads in the last two weeks, shutting down colleges and clashing with riot police. But there's been a notable scarcity of student rallies in solidarity with Israelis.\n\nBy The Associated Press\n\nColumbia University announced on Monday that it has canceled its university-wide commencement ceremony because of disruptions caused by recent pro-Palestinian protests. Students will still be able to celebrate at a series of smaller, school-based graduation ceremonies this week and next.\n\nThe protest movement connected to the Israel-Hamas war began nearly three weeks ago at the Ivy League university in New York City. It has since swept college campuses nationwide, with more than 2,500 people arrested.\n\nThe university's large graduation ceremony was scheduled for May 15 on the college's main lawn, which is where a protest encampment was based until authorities dismantled it last week. University officials said the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, and that they decided to cancel the ceremony after discussing it with students.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Shafik is heavily criticized by Republicans who accuse her of not doing enough to combat concerns about antisemitism on Columbia's campus. Allegations of antisemitism arose during pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's actions in the war in Gaza.\n\nThe public grilling session comes four months after a similarly contentious congressional hearing led to the resignations of two Ivy League presidents. Unlike her counterparts, who focused their responses on protecting free speech, Shafik strongly denounced antisemitism, saying it \"has no place on our campus.\"\n\nAPRIL 18\n\nNew York City police are called to Columbia's campus to disband the protest encampment and arrest more than 100 protesters. Those detained include the daughter of Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who a day earlier had questioned Shafik about the school's treatment of pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nThe arrests, which New York Mayor Eric Adams says were requested by Columbia officials, garner national attention and inflame college protests nationwide. A day later, the University of Southern California announces that it has canceled the keynote commencement speech by filmmaker Jon M. Chu. USC had already disallowed its student valedictorian, who is Muslim, from speaking at the May 10 commencement.\n\nIn the coming days, pro-Palestinian encampments will be set up at the University of Michigan, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina.\n\nAPRIL 22\n\nColumbia cancels in-person classes, and an encampment at New York University swells to hundreds of protesters. NYU officials call in police after warning the crowd to leave and says the scene has become disorderly. Police arrest dozens of protesters at NYU and at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The gates to Harvard Yard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are closed to the public.\n\nPresident Joe Biden addresses the unrest and seeks to find a narrow middle ground by condemning \"antisemitic protests,\" adding that he also condemns \"those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians.\"\n\nAPRIL 24\n\nColumbia administrators set a new midnight deadline for protesters to clear the encampment. While some leave, others dig in and refuse to disband until the school agrees to stop doing business with Israel or any companies that support the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nElsewhere, police make more arrests on other university campuses. At the University of Texas at Austin, hundreds of local and state police -- including some on horseback and holding batons -- aggressively clash with protesters, pushing them off campus grounds, and arresting more than 30 people. At the University of Southern California, police peacefully arrest student protesters.\n\nAPRIL 26\n\nColumbia University students say they're at an impasse after exhaustive negotiations with administrators and they intend to continue their encampment until their divestment demands are met. That comes after hundreds of protesters have been arrested nationwide over the previous nine days. The school sends students an email saying that bringing back police \"at this time\" would be counterproductive.\n\nMeanwhile, schools across the country where protests have taken root prepare to shut down encampments over reports of antisemitic activity and concerns the protests will mar upcoming commencement ceremonies.\n\nAPRIL 29\n\nColumbia makes good on its promise to suspend students who defy a 2 p.m. deadline to leave the encampment of more than 100 tents. Instead of vacating, hundreds of protesters remain, marching around the quad and weaving around piles of temporary flooring and green carpeting meant for graduation ceremonies that are scheduled to begin next week.\n\nAround the country, the number of arrests at campuses nationwide approaches 1,000 as the final days of class wrap up.\n\nAPRIL 30\n\nDozens of protesters take over Hamilton Hall on Columbia's campus, barricading entrances and hanging a \"Free Palestine\" banner from a window as administrators warn that they face expulsion for doing so. Protesters insist they will remain at the hall until the university agrees to three demands: divestment from Israel and companies supporting the war in Gaza, financial transparency and amnesty for protesters.\n\nHours later, New York City police carrying riot shields storm the building and clear dozens of people from it, sweeping the encampment on the campus as well. The action from city police came at the request of the university, according to a police statement.\n\nMAY 6\n\nColumbia cancels its university-wide commencement ceremony. The ceremony had been scheduled for May 15 on the south lawn of the Manhattan campus, where protest encampments were based for about three weeks before authorities dismantled them last week. Students will still be able to celebrate at a series of smaller, school-based graduation ceremonies this week and next. Those ceremonies will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Moving forward, the 2024 year will be celebrated with smaller-scale graduations.\n\nSafety concerns were cited as the reason for this change. Originally, the main ceremony was scheduled to take place on May 15 outdoors on the university's New York City campus. The exact location that would have been used for the ceremony was the same site as a pro-Palestinian encampment that set up by students, which was taken down last week by police.\n\nThe smaller ceremonies will be for each of Columbia's different schools, including nursing, journalism and teaching. Events that were previously scheduled to take place outdoors will now be held indoors, the university said. This news comes as the University of Southern California announced in late April is was canceling its main commencement ceremony over similar concerns.\n\nMore than 2,000 people participating in pro-Palestine demonstrations have been arrested across the U.S., according to NBC News. Columbia has stood as a center for these college protests for weeks. Last Tuesday, NYPD, dressed in what was described at the time as \"riot gear,\" entered the college's Hamilton Hall, which was occupied by roughly 60 students for most of the day. During the protest, the students renamed the building to Hind's Hall in honor of six-year-old Hind Rajab, who was killed under Israeli fire.\n\nThe passion and fervor around the protests even led to New York Magazine enlisting the help of students from the university's independent student newspaper, Columbia Daily Spectator, for its cover story.\n\n\"On the morning of Wednesday, April 17, Columbia University President Minouche Shafik was scheduled to address Congress about antisemitism on campus,\" a post about the collaboration reads. \"Hours earlier, in the dead of night, pro-Palestinian students began executing plans to occupy the school's South Lawn. The events that unfolded over the next 14 days -- protests, counter-protests, the takeover of Hamilton Hall, and an NYPD crackdown authorized by Shafik herself -- convulsed the Columbia community and college campuses nationwide.\"", "source": {"uri": "thewrap.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheWrap"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kayla_cobb@thewrap.com", "name": "Kayla Cobb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Daily_Spectator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia Daily Spectator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/columbia-protests.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 474, "textEnd": 480}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 1842, "textEnd": 1850}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

We will share more in the coming days,\" the university released in a statement Monday morning.\n\nThe move is not being received well and is being categorized as yet another failure of Columbia \"leadership\" to put down the mob on behalf of a majority of students.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_pavlich@townhall.com", "name": "Katie Pavlich", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lawn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Lawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Daily_Spectator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia Daily Spectator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dean (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Academic Departments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/113/6232f62d-81fc-4c7f-92d0-e8d54cd911af.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 278, "textEnd": 284, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 795, "textEnd": 803}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-18", "textStart": 1153, "textEnd": 1161}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

They were left without high school graduation in 2020 due to the pandemic closure. Classes began with a course or more of zoom classes. And now they are also left without a university graduation party, due to the protests on campuses in favor of Palestine.\n\nAt least this is what will happen to the 15,000 graduating students at the elite Columbia University, after last week's serious incidents, when police stormed the campus in a military-style operation and evicted those occupying a building and were camped on campus. The party was scheduled for May 15.\n\nThe university, included in the prestigious Ivy League group, said it chose to hold small meetings instead of massive ones. Columbia officials indicated this Monday that the decision was made after meetings with student leaders and in view of concerns about security issues, a spokesperson said.\n\nColumbia wants to avoid a situation of massive protest, especially after the severe criticism it has received for authorizing the entry of the police with an apparently disproportionate operation: several hundred uniformed officers and their technology to detain, between inside and outside, a total of 119 people. The mayor of New York, Eric Adams, continues to defend the action due to the presence of \"foreign intruders\" to the institution although, almost a week later, this has not been proven.\n\nThe announcement of the cancellation was also preceded by various incidents recorded this weekend in Virginia and Chicago, with dozens of people arrested, due to anti-Israel protests during graduation ceremonies. The University of Southern California (USC) took a similar suspension measure a few days ago.\n\n\"Our students have stressed that these small-scale celebrations are best for them and their families,\" insisted the spokesperson for Columbia, whose campus is located northwest of Manhattan. \"They are eager to go on stage to applause and the pride of their family and listen to the speakers invited to the event,\" he reiterated.\n\nThe university will try to concentrate on the resources necessary to carry out these smaller festivities and ensure that there are as many as possible for those honored. \"We are going to try to make the graduation experience very special,\" stressed the spokesperson.\n\nIn reality, the suspension of the general celebration is a new challenge for the rector Minouche Shafik, in the political spotlight and also from students and teachers. A group of members of the academic team have already requested a vote of no confidence for giving way to the police in a center known for its history of supporting protest movements against war, racism or apartheid. Shafik requested that the police presence be extended until May 17. The area remains under strict surveillance.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Adams_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Adams (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemat_Shafik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nemat Shafik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Research_Funding", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Research Funding", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_014ad.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 597, "textEnd": 603}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 2755, "textEnd": 2761}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its campus quadrangle in Atlanta to a suburban arena. But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Washington University faculty placed on leave, students 'houseless' after Gaza protest Busch Stadium needs renovations.

'It's my university's turn.'\n\nColumbia's decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president, Nemat Shafik, from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week.\n\nNoting that the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said in its announcement that it made the decision after discussions with students.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" officials said. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers.\"\n\nMost of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.\n\nSpeakers at some of Columbia's still-scheduled graduation ceremonies include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames, former CNN anchor Poppy Harlow, political scientist Ian Bremmer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health. Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia's Teachers College.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks.\n\nSimilar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC on Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday, while in Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags as Northeastern University held its commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, disruptions continued Monday following the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian encampment and some 200 arrests last week. Police detained numerous people in a parking structure. The university also said classes in one building, Monroe Hall, would move online \"due to ongoing disruptions\" but did not provide details.\n\nAlso Monday, police cleared a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of California, San Diego, and arrested more than 30 people, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nHamas announced Monday that it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal to halt the war in Gaza, but Israel did not immediately comment. Details have not yet been released.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the quad on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members. Police used pepper balls and electric stun guns to subdue some of the people who were arrested. Fenves later apologized.\n\nProtests have continued on the campus since then, including some additional arrests.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its campus quadrangle in Atlanta to a suburban arena. But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Washington University faculty placed on leave, students 'houseless' after Gaza protest Busch Stadium needs renovations.

'It's my university's turn.'\n\nColumbia's decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president, Nemat Shafik, from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week.\n\nNoting that the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said in its announcement that it made the decision after discussions with students.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" officials said. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers.\"\n\nMost of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.\n\nSpeakers at some of Columbia's still-scheduled graduation ceremonies include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames, former CNN anchor Poppy Harlow, political scientist Ian Bremmer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health. Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia's Teachers College.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks.\n\nSimilar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC on Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday, while in Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags as Northeastern University held its commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, disruptions continued Monday following the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian encampment and some 200 arrests last week. Police detained numerous people in a parking structure. The university also said classes in one building, Monroe Hall, would move online \"due to ongoing disruptions\" but did not provide details.\n\nAlso Monday, police cleared a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of California, San Diego, and arrested more than 30 people, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nHamas announced Monday that it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal to halt the war in Gaza, but Israel did not immediately comment. Details have not yet been released.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the quad on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members. Police used pepper balls and electric stun guns to subdue some of the people who were arrested. Fenves later apologized.\n\nProtests have continued on the campus since then, including some additional arrests.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its campus quadrangle in Atlanta to a suburban arena. But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Washington University faculty placed on leave, students 'houseless' after Gaza protest Busch Stadium needs renovations.

'It's my university's turn.'\n\nColumbia's decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president, Nemat Shafik, from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week.\n\nNoting that the past few weeks have been \"incredibly difficult\" for the community, the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said in its announcement that it made the decision after discussions with students.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" officials said. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers.\"\n\nMost of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.\n\nSpeakers at some of Columbia's still-scheduled graduation ceremonies include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames, former CNN anchor Poppy Harlow, political scientist Ian Bremmer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health. Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia's Teachers College.\n\nColumbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks.\n\nSimilar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.\n\nThe University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC on Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.\n\nOther universities have held their graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday, while in Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags as Northeastern University held its commencement in Fenway Park.\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, disruptions continued Monday following the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian encampment and some 200 arrests last week. Police detained numerous people in a parking structure. The university also said classes in one building, Monroe Hall, would move online \"due to ongoing disruptions\" but did not provide details.\n\nAlso Monday, police cleared a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of California, San Diego, and arrested more than 30 people, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.\n\nThe protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.\n\nHamas announced Monday that it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal to halt the war in Gaza, but Israel did not immediately comment. Details have not yet been released.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.\n\nEmory's 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.\n\nCeremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.\n\n\"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" Fenves wrote. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies -- each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.\"\n\nThe university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the quad on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members. Police used pepper balls and electric stun guns to subdue some of the people who were arrested. Fenves later apologized.\n\nProtests have continued on the campus since then, including some additional arrests.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The institution shared that the decision was made following discussions with student representatives and comes shortly after weeks of pro-Palestinian and opposing protests on campus, which raised security concerns.\n\n\"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" the Ivy League university said. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers. As a result, we will focus our resources on those school ceremonies and on keeping them safe, respectful, and running smoothly.\"\n\nThe school added, \"These past few weeks have been incredibly difficult for our community. Just as we are focused on making our graduation experience truly special, we continue to solicit student feedback and are looking at the possibility of a festive event on May 15 to take the place of the large, formal ceremony. We are eager to all come together for our graduates and celebrate our fellow Columbians as they, and we, look ahead to the future.\"\n\nUnfortunately, students will now be recognized \" individually alongside their peers\" in smaller ceremonies. However, the graduation ceremony is not the only thing affected by the protests. \"Class Days\" and school ceremonies originally scheduled to take place at the south lawn of the Morningside campus, have been moved to Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex.\n\nIf you're unaware, Pro-Palestinian protests popped up on campus last month after students set up roughly 50 tents, calling for a Gaza cease-fire and for the university to end their partnership with companies profiting from the war. On April 30th, New York City police officers arrived on campus in full riot gear and forced their way into Hamilton Hall, where protesters had barricaded themselves. Not long after, about 100 arrests were made, which stirred up some tension, leading Columbia President Minouche Shafik to request police assistance on the campus until May 17th.", "source": {"uri": "balleralert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baller Alert"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemat_Shafik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nemat Shafik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://balleralert.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iStock-136402696-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542834", "eventUri": "eng-9542834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 1126, "textEnd": 1132}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1910, "textEnd": 1920}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 2241, "textEnd": 2249}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 452726821, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 196, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 196}}}

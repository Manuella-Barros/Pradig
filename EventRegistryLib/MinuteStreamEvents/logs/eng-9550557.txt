They consequently sacked manager Cristiano Bergodi, with an interim coach, Bogdan Lobon\u021b taking charge of the final four games of the season. This weekend marks the final round of fixtures, after which Rapid hope to announce Bergodi's permanent successor.\n\nAccording to reports in Romania, that successor could be 72-year-old O'Neill, who hasn't worked since he was fired by Nottingham Forest in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nO'Neill is reportedly in the picture for the job, along with other contenders Marius Sumudica - a former player and assistant coach at Rapid - and the veteran former Romania boss Mircea Lucescu, who has twice managed the club before, most recently in 2000. Lucescu is now 78, and his most recent job was with Dynamo Kyiv, whom he left last year.\n\nTaking the job would mark a major departure for O'Neill, as all of his club management jobs have been in Britain. He is also shortly due to take up the role as chairman of the League Managers Association, succeeding long-serving Howard Wilkinson.\n\nO'Neill was elected to the position ahead of a rival seven candidates, and will take over on 21 May. Wilkinson has been in situ since 1992, having been a founding member. The role did not preclude Wilkinson from working in management: he was Leeds boss at the time of the LMA's foundation, and remained in that job until 1996, later going on to coach England U21s, Sunderland, and Shanghai Shenhua.\n\nO'Neill, however, has hinted that his management career is over, recently telling the Telegraph that the Forest job was his final job.\n\n\"I had no idea when I left Forest that it would be my last job in management\", said O'Neill, who also complained at being perceived as an outsider while Ireland manager.\n\n\"I never won over the media\", said O'Neill. \"I don't know why, but I said in my book I was made to feel like an outsider. I was called the Ulsterman, I've tried to explain this... just recently I heard an Irish commentator saying we have had outsiders as managers, we had [Giovanni] Trapattoni and we had O'Neill.\n\n\"I'm definitely an Irishman.

However, his hiatus from the game has not dampened interest from abroad.\n\nEuropean reports, spearheaded by Fanatik, suggest that O'Neill was thought to have hung up his managerial boots until Bucharest showed interest. It is claimed that the seasoned manager, who has also led the Republic of Ireland national team, could be in position before the week is out.\n\nREAD MORE: Emi Martinez injury update as Aston Villa handed boost for Olympiacos clash\n\nREAD MORE: Douglas Luiz speaks out on Aston Villa gratitude, semi-final belief and his penalty plan\n\nWith only a few games left in the Romanian Liga 1 season, O'Neill would need to make an immediate impact. Rapid Bucharest ended the league in second place but lost seven of their eight play-off matches, reports the Mirror.\n\nRecently appointed as the head of the League Managers Association, O'Neill won two European Cups during his playing days with Nottingham Forest, but his tenure there as a manager lasted just six months.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Telegraph, he expressed regret over accepting the job, hinting that it was likely his last role in professional football.\n\n\"I had no idea when I left Forest that it would be my last job in management. I had turned it down a number of times previously and felt like I had to take it when it was offered again. I took it far too personally, in the sense I was angry about it. I took it too seriously.\n\n\"Instead of going on [in management], I've never been much of a networker, I've never been part of an agency, someone going out there looking for jobs for me. And of course, people start to look at your age too.\n\n\"In an industry, the changes that I've noticed taking place, the owners and CEOs want to run the show. I was a manager of football clubs. I wasn't a head coach and that is what people are looking for now. They can dictate to the head coach who comes in and who might not, to a large extent.\n\n\"Do I regret going to Forest? Yes, absolutely. If I'd known we would win the last three games of the season and I would be called in a week into pre-season training to be told the way I was running the football club was not the way they wanted to run it which is how they put it I wouldn't have taken the job in the first place.\"\n\nWould this be a good fit for O'Neill?

Things did not work out as planned for the pair, and O'Neill was sacked just six months later.\n\nHe has been out of work as a manager since that 2019 spell at the City Ground, but reports on the continent suggest that he could soon be named manager of Rapid Bucharest, in a thoroughly surprising move.\n\nREAD HERE: Richie Sadlier Rips Into Toxic Culture At PSG After Another UCL Exit\n\nREAD HERE: Carragher Says Palace Humiliation Should End Manchester United Star's Top-Level Career\n\nFanatik report that Rapid Bucharest are working hard to secure Martin O'Neill's signature as their next manager.\n\nHolding less of a presence than their local rivals Steaua and Dinamo, Rapid have nonetheless won the Romanian Liga I on three occasions, most recently in 2002-03. Their most recent silverware came in the 2006-07 Cupa Romaniei.\n\nThis season saw Rapid finish an impressive second in the regular season behind Steaua, their highest finish after being resurrected from administration in 2021. They have, however, endured a wretched run of form in the play-offs, losing seven of their eight games, leading to manager Cristiano Bergodi being sacked in mid-April.\n\nFormer Romania international Bogdan Lobont is currently in charge as a caretaker, but reports suggest that Rapid are hoping to have a decision made on bringing in Martin O'Neill by the end of next week.\n\nIt would certainly be a surprise to see former Celtic and Aston Villa boss O'Neill come out of exile as a manager, especially in such an unexpected destination. Time will tell if there is any truth to these rumours.\n\nEarlier this week, Aiden McGeady spoke about how O'Neill's unchanging managerial methods had met some initial resistance when he took over as

His period out of the game, though, has not deterred interest in his services from overseas.\n\nAccording to reports in Europe, led by Fanatik, the Northern Irishman was thought to be done with management before interest from Bucharest emerged.\n\nAnd there is even now a suggestion that the veteran, who has also managed the Republic of Ireland national team and Aston Villa, could yet be in the post by the end of the work.\n\nThe Romanian Liga 1 campaign still has a couple of games before it concludes, meaning O'Neill would have to hit the ground running. Rapid Bucharest finished second in the league before going on to lose seven of their eight play-off games.\n\nO'Neill, who has just become the head of the League Managers Association, won two European Cups during his playing heyday with Nottingham Forest but lasted just six months before being sacked.\n\nHe recently admitted in an interview with The Telegraph that he regretted taking the job, alluding to the fact that it was highly likely to be his final role in professional football.\n\nJoin the debate!

I had turned it down a number of times previously and felt like I had to take it when it was offered again. I took it far too personally, in the sense I was angry about it. I took it too seriously.\n\n\"Instead of going on [in management], I've never been much of a networker, I've never been part of an agency, someone going out there looking for jobs for me. And of course, people start to look at your age too.\n\n\"In an industry, the changes that I've noticed taking place, the owners and CEOs want to run the show. I was a manager of football clubs. I wasn't a head coach and that is what people are looking for now. They can dictate to the head coach who comes in and who might not, to a large extent.\n\n\"Do I regret going to Forest? Yes, absolutely. If I'd known we would win the last three games of the season and I would be called in a week into pre-season training to be told the way I was running the football club was not the way they wanted to run it - which is how they put it - I wouldn't have taken the job in the first place.\"\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!

On Thursday night, the New York Yankees broadcaster revealed he still receives residual checks from that appearance of about $57.\n\nO'Neill was featured on the Season 7 episode \"The Wink,\" which aired on October 12, 1995. At one point in the episode, Kramer promises a hospitalized boy that O'Neill will hit two home runs in a game for him. Kramer then meets with the All-Star in the clubhouse to tell him he has to do so, which is where O'Neill makes his appearance. He tells Kramer that promising two home runs is crazy, especially because he is not a power hitter.\n\nDuring the fictitious game, which takes place off-screen, O'Neill hits a first-inning home run, then has an inside-the-park homer in the eighth. But the second home run is ruled a triple because of a fielding error. Kramer then convinces the boy that O'Neill will catch a ball in his hat the next day to make up for it.\n\nOn Thursday night, broadcaster David Cone asked O'Neill if he still gets residual checks, and he said, \"Yeah, you know what they are? They're like 57 bucks. It's not big time. It's a good reminder though that you were on the show. It's kind of cool.\"\n\nSeinfeld wasn't the only on-screen appearance O'Neill made. He also played himself in Little Big League.\n\nO'Neill was a five-time All-Star and won five World Series titles as a player, four with the Yankees and one with the Cincinnati Reds. He won the American League batting title during the strike-shortened 1994 season, and his No. 21 jersey has been retired by the Yankees.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_O'Neill_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul O'Neill (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmo_Kramer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cosmo Kramer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wink_(Seinfeld)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wink (Seinfeld)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seinfeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside-the-park_home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inside-the-park home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Cone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Error (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2684,h_1509,x_0,y_127/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01hxfr43paqnx9dexhz7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550557", "eventUri": "eng-9550557", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1995-10-12", "textStart": 436, "textEnd": 452}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

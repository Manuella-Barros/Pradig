Kennedy Jr. announced on May 8 that his campaign had gathered enough valid signatures to appear on Ohio's ballot.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump won Ohio by eight points in the 2020 election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden considers Delaware his home state. He prevailed there in 2020 by almost 20 points.\n\nMr. Kennedy is officially on the ballot in California, Delaware, Michigan, and Utah.\n\nThe campaign collected enough signatures for ballot access in Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Nevada before adding Ohio, Mr. Kennedy's press secretary Stefanie Spear said in a statement.\n\nMr. Kennedy entered the 2024 presidential race in April 2023, when he declared his intent to challenge President Joe Biden for the Democratic Party nomination.\n\nClaiming that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was \"rigging the primary\" and not allowing candidates to oppose President Biden, Mr. Kennedy chose to run as an independent last October.\n\nSince making that announcement, Mr. Kennedy has focused on gaining ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, a feat he told The Epoch Times he expects to achieve in July.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention and pro-Biden groups have directed significant resources to thwarting Mr. Kennedy's bid to get on the ballot in all states and the District of Columbia.\n\nEarlier this year, they formed a group to address Mr. Kennedy and third-party challengers such as independent Cornel West and Green Party nominee Jill Stein.\n\n\"Their [Democrats] only strategy is to try to keep me off the ballot and then to make everybody terrified of Donald Trump. On the other side, they do the same thing,\" Mr. Kennedy said at a campaign stop last month.\n\n\"When somebody is telling you to vote out of fear, they are trying to manipulate you into abandoning your values,\" he added.\n\nMr. Kennedy is currently working to get on the ballot in New York, which poses one of the most significant challenges, he acknowledged.\n\nNew York has a 42-day window for collecting signatures, the smallest time frame of any state. The petition gathering process started on April 16 and ends on May 28.\n\nCandidates must gather and submit at least 45,000 valid signatures to qualify for ballot access.\n\nAt a May 1 press conference in Brooklyn, Mr. Kennedy said the campaign had reached the 45,000 mark, but would continue to gather signatures until it reached 90,000, in case an opposing party challenged the petitions.\n\nMr. Kennedy's campaign is collecting double the number of signatures required understanding that some could be disqualified, Ms. Spear told The Epoch Times.\n\nDuring a voter rally in Long Island on April 28, Mr. Kennedy encouraged Americans to \"vote out of hope and not out of fear.\"\n\nAt the May 1 press conference in Brooklyn, he urged President Joe Biden to drop out of the race, citing a Zogby Strategies poll that showed the current president would lose to former President Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup in Electoral College votes, 294-244.\n\nIn a race between Mr. Kennedy and President Biden, the challenger would win in a landslide of 367-171.\n\nThe survey included 26,408 respondents from 50 states polled between April 13 and April 21, and featured a 0.6 percent margin of error.\n\nIf President Biden does not step aside, Mr. Kennedy challenged him to sign a \"no-spoiler pledge.\"\n\nUnder the pledge, the DNC and the Kennedy campaign would agree to co-fund a 50-state poll with 30,000 or more likely voters in mid-October.\n\nThe survey would once again pit the current president and the former president in a two-way race, and Mr. Kennedy and President Trump in a head-to-head contest.\n\nThe candidate who performs the worst against President Trump would drop out, according to the pledge.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Mr. Kennedy's announcement.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Kennedy said that he believes his campaign already has enough signatures to qualify for the New York ballot.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign will continue to gather signatures until it surpasses 90,000, he said.\n\nIn recent months, the DNC and pro-Biden groups have called Mr. Kennedy a \"spoiler\" and have urged him to drop out to prevent President Trump from returning to the White House.\n\nEarlier this year, speculation mounted that Mr. Kennedy could seek and gain the Libertarian Party's 2024 presidential nomination.\n\nHe met with Libertarian National Committee Chair Angela McArdle, and they expressed mutual interest, but after a campaign stop in Iowa last month, Mr. Kennedy told The Epoch Times that he would continue his campaign as an independent.\n\n\"It will become obvious quickly [that] we will get ballot access,\" Mr. Kennedy replied when asked whether he is still talking to the Libertarian Party about its nomination.\n\nMr. Kennedy told The Epoch Times that he would gain ballot access in \"two to three states every week,\" and he would be on the ballot in \"every state\" by the end of July.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType":

Kennedy Jr. has made it on the ballot in a handful of states. Despite saying he does not belong to any party, some have helped him get there.\n\nAs he embarks on his quest to get on the ballot in all 50 states, Kennedy will appear on the ballot in California, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, and Utah so far. The PAC supporting Kennedy also said it had gathered enough signatures to place him on the ballot in Arizona, Georgia, and South Carolina.\n\nIn some states, however, Kennedy has partnered with little-known parties in order to bypass signature gathering to get on the ballot.\n\nIn California and Michigan, he was nominated by parties that already had placements on the ballot: Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party of California. According to ABC News, his campaign has been in contact with similar small parties in six other states.\n\n\"As the campaign sees and recognizes that these are very convenient vessels out there, it's a clever move, and it's not a surprise they do it,\" Derek Muller, a University of Notre Dame professor who specializes in election law, told ABC News.\n\nCourting other parties hasn't completely worked for the Kennedy campaign. The Unity Party of Colorado chose to nominate Cornel West, another third-party presidential candidate, over Kennedy.\n\nThe Alliance Party, which has ballot access in South Carolina, is seemingly receptive to taking on Kennedy as its nominee.\n\n\"National Alliance Party leadership has begun early conversations with the campaign for potential mutual support,\" Phil Feuhrer, the party's national co-vice chair said.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nHe said the conversations are \"young and still ongoing\" but could reach Minnesota as well.\n\n\"If we reach full agreement with the campaign and our internal statewide leadership teams, it would include placement onto the South Carolina ballot as well as the Minnesota Independence-Alliance taking lead on placing the campaign onto the Minnesota ballot,\" Feuhrer said.\n\nIt's a tricky line to walk as sometimes smaller parties have questionable histories or ideology that doesn't completely align with Kennedy's positions. The American Independent Party of California endorsed George Wallace, the former governor of Alabama and well-known segregationist. In a campaign video, Kennedy acknowledged the party's past.\n\n\"It's been reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred but rather compassion, unity, idealism and common sense,\" Kennedy said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nIn Alaska, the Alaskan Independence Party, whose goal was to have Alaska secede from the U.S., ultimately chose not to nominate Kennedy after its convention meeting.\n\n\"Our liberty and prosperity must come from within ourselves,\" Bob Bird, the former chairman of the Alaskan Independence Party, said, \"not from a knight galloping in from the Lower 48.\"\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Kennedy Jr. has been compelled to expend in his push for ballot status:\n\nThe effort has already cost his campaign hundreds of thousands of dollars, and a supporting super PAC at least $2.4 million more, federal campaign finance records show. It has involved a number of professionals who specialize in getting people on the ground with clipboards and petitions and helping candidates navigate the complicated process. Their success is what will make or break Mr. Kennedy's campaign.\n\nKennedy has paid a single firm with expertise in ballot access, Texas-based Accelevate2020, $689,000 for \"campaign consulting,\" and the campaign is advertising for full-time petition signature collectors in New York state, offering $40 an hour on Craigslist.\n\nWhile Kennedy himself is a multi-millionaire, his campaign is being financed by billionaire Timothy Mellon, heir to a banking fortune, and his running mate Nicole Shanahan, the ex-wife of Google founder Sergei Brin, one of the 10 richest Americans.\n\nThe politics of his campaign are thoroughly reactionary, a combination of right-wing demagogy about slashing the federal deficit and eliminating corporate corruption of the Democrats and Republicans, all-out support for the Israeli genocide in Gaza, coupled with opposition to the war in Ukraine, and support for cutting military spending overall. Add to this Kennedy's signature preoccupation with denouncing vaccination, including essential protections for children, as well as the vaccines against COVID-19 that have saved millions of lives.\n\nNeither his right-wing nostrums nor his famous name have protected Kennedy from attack by both the Democrats and more recently Trump, with both sides in the capitalist political duopoly fearing any outlet for popular discontent outside the two-party system.\n\nA follow-up report in the Times Tuesday outlined the many obstacles created by the Democrats and the Republicans to make it more difficult -- and in some states nearly impossible -- for candidates outside the two-party system to run against them.\n\nSome states have rules against people coming in from out of state to help a campaign procure signatures; others have rules that restrict a campaign's ability to hire paid canvassers instead of relying solely on volunteers. Some states allow months for independent candidates to gather signatures, while others have short windows. Some states require a vice presidential nominee on the petition. The work of actually gathering thousands of signatures, and ensuring that all these rules are met, is grueling and often costly.\n\nThe Politico report, published May 3, gives considerable detail about the internal discussions among Democratic-aligned super PACs after their success in pushing the \"No Labels\" group of conservative Democrats out of the election. The right-wing group, financed by billionaires Harlan Crow (real estate) and Michael Smith (LNG gas), recently declared that it would not nominate a candidate for president, largely because it had failed to convince any prominent corporate politician to challenge Biden and Trump.\n\nThe coalition of pro-Biden fundraisers \"is now turning its sights on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,\" Politico wrote, \"message-testing\" anti-Kennedy advertising and monitoring Kennedy campaign events in order to collect negative information on his campaign. This could include a multimillion-dollar ad campaign, depending on where Kennedy obtains ballot status, particularly in the so-called \"battleground\" states.\n\nThe effort to suppress any challenge to the two-party monopoly already involves considerable resources. According to Politico:\n\nTo date, the campaign against Kennedy has largely focused on research and legal challenges. The Democratic National Committee hired veteran staffers to coordinate their push back against Kennedy, particularly through media stories about Kennedy. They've also filed Federal Elections Commission complaints against Kennedy's allies. The outside groups, like Clear Choice PAC and American Bridge, are diving into opposition research and messaging. MoveOn, a 10 million-member organization, reassigned staffers from No Labels-focused efforts toward Kennedy, as well as bringing on additional staff.\n\nKennedy has ballot status in Michigan after gaining the nomination of the Natural Law Party, a political formation established by the transcendental meditation religious cult. The party was largely disbanded in 2004 but retains a ballot line, only in Michigan, by means of third-party campaigns for minor offices where it was the only alternative to the Democrats and Republicans on the ballot.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign claims it has obtained and filed enough petition signatures to get on the ballot in Nevada, New Hampshire and North Carolina. It is currently petitioning in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania, and has announced plans to do the same in Wisconsin. All these states are expected to be closely contested in November, and in all these states the Democrats will challenge Kennedy's petitions.\n\nThe Democratic Party campaign to deny ballot status to third parties and independent candidates is by no means limited to Kennedy, the Politico report notes. It includes Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent Cornel West, a former \"left\" Democrat and supporter of Biden against Trump in 2020.\n\nIn March, it was widely reported that the Democratic National Committee had set up a special unit with a sizeable budget to coordinate efforts to force third-party candidates to \"play by the rules,\" which means making use of various anti-democratic legal technicalities to prevent political opponents from obtaining ballot status.\n\nMost of the legal challenges to Kennedy, and presumably to Jill Stein and Cornel West, are likely to fail. But they have the additional benefit, from the standpoint of the Democrats, of diverting time and resources which these independent efforts would otherwise devote to campaigning.\n\nSimilar methods have been employed by the Democrats against the Socialist Equality Party in previous election campaigns, notably in Midwestern states like Ohio, Michigan and Illinois, where Democrats mobilized lawyers to check nominating petitions and seek to invalidate thousands of signatures on spurious grounds.\n\nBoth the Democrats and Republicans have already engaged in such sordid tactics this year in two congressional campaigns in Michigan. In one case, the Republicans challenged petitions by Democrat Curtis Hertel in the district which includes Lansing. In the other, Democratic incumbent Shri Thanedar challenged a prospective primary opponent, fellow Democrat Adam Hollier, in the district that covers much of Detroit and the Downriver suburbs.\n\nBoth challenges are anti-democratic, seizing on supposed errors in paperwork. The Republicans claim that Hertel made \"fatal errors\" in his candidate affidavit and nominating petitions by listing the office he is seeking as \"US Congress\" rather than \"US House of Representatives.\"\n\nThanedar challenged 791 of the 1,555 signatures filed by Hollier to meet a requirement of 1,000 valid signatures, claiming that the signers are not registered or registered at a different address, are duplicates, or live outside the district or the signatures are forged (based on claimed similarities in handwriting).\n\nRead moreThe Democrats' \"all-out war\" on third parties and independent candidates22 March 2024The arrest of Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein is an attack on democratic rights29 April 2024Contact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these topics:US PoliticsUnited StatesNorth America", "source": {"uri": "wsws.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Socialist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy's campaign says he has enough signatures to make Ohio's 2024 presidential ballot", "body": "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign says it has collected more than enough voter signatures for him to make the Ohio ballot this November.\n\nKennedy, who's aiming to run for the White House as an independent candidate, has so far collected more than 8,000 signatures from Ohio voters, according to campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear.\n\nOhio law requires independent presidential candidates to turn in a minimum of 5,000 voter signatures to qualify for the statewide ballot. In practice, though, campaigns have to turn in well over than amount as elections officials always find that a significant portion of submitted signatures are invalid.\n\nKennedy's campaign will turn in the signatures closer to Ohio's Aug. 7 deadline for presidential hopefuls to make the Nov. 5 ballot, Spear said in a statement.\n\nKennedy -- along with his running mate, California lawyer and philanthropist Nicole Shanahan -- is already officially on the ballot in Utah, Michigan, California, and Delaware. His campaign states it has also collected enough signatures to make the ballot in an additional eight states, including Ohio.\n\nLike his father and his uncle, ex-President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. initially sought the Democratic nomination for president, bringing on ex-U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, a Cleveland Democrat, as his campaign manager. However, last fall Kennedy announced he would run instead as an independent and dropped Kucinich from running his campaign.\n\nKennedy, a longtime environmental lawyer, has an eclectic medley of liberal, conservative and libertarian stances on major issues. He is best known for his skepticism toward vaccines and has also been a sharp critic of corporations -- particularly in the pharmaceutical, tech, and media industries.\n\nWhile Kennedy is not expected to win the presidency this year, political prognosticators have said he could influence whether Democratic President Joe Biden or Republican ex-President Donald Trump wins. It's not yet clear, though, whether Kennedy's candidacy would hurt Biden or Trump more.\n\nIn Ohio, where Trump is expected to win for the third presidential election in a row, limited polling has shown Kennedy polling around 5%. An Ohio Northern/SurveyUSA poll from March found Kennedy pulled roughly the same number of Buckeye State voters away from Biden and Trump.\n\nAnother potential wrinkle is that Biden is in danger of not making Ohio's general-election ballot, as he won't formally become his party's presidential nominee until the Democratic National Convention, set to be held in Chicago about two weeks after the state's Aug. 7 candidate deadline.\n\nWhile both Republicans and Democrats have said they're confident Biden will end up on the Ohio ballot, the state legislature has so far been unable to pass legislation that would allow Biden to avoid the administrative pitfall.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

As Kettmann argues, \"You don't want roid rage to be an issue if, say, China invades Taiwan.\"\n\nKettmann's article comes on the heels of The New York Times report that Kennedy admitted \"I have cognitive problems,\" in a 2012 deposition during divorce proceedings, as a result of mercury poisoning and a dead worm in his brain.\n\nAs faithful newsletter readers know, I have argued Kennedy does not yet deserve inclusion in polls, because \"including independent or third-party candidates with embryonic campaigns in polls sends a falsely legitimizing message to voters that such candidates are of similar stature and viability to the major party candidates.\"\n\nOnly when such candidates are clearly on track to be on most state ballots and available to be selected by most voters -- like Ross Perot was at this point in 1992, with an explosive signature-gathering effort well underway -- should their national support be gauged.\n\nOf course, Kennedy is being included in some polls these days. And recent news developments about Kennedy -- and others I will share below -- won't necessarily affect those numbers.\n\nBut the revelations further raise the question of whether Kennedy will secure ballot access in most states and whether he merits mention in future national polling.\n\nBefore Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Brain Worm, There Was the Steroid Question: Steve Kettmann makes the case that Kennedy is juicing. Click here for the full story.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, Bowed But Not Broken: Contributing Writer Margaret Carlson analyzes the Georgian's failed attempt to oust the Speaker of the House. Click here for the full story.\n\nMy argument has always been that candidates should have \"proved they are poised to be on the ballot in most of the country\" to merit inclusion in polls. For benchmarks, we can use Perot's successful 50-state effort in 1992, which hit 25 states by July and 40 by September.\n\nCNN reported on May 8 that Kennedy is only officially on the ballot in five states so far. The Kennedy campaign website classifies seven others as \"petitioning completed.\" They appear to be states with either low signature thresholds or states where he circumvented the need for signature gathering by snagging a ballot line from a pre-existing party.\n\nKennedy has time to boost those numbers, but other reports about the inner-workings of his campaign do not instill confidence he has assembled a team capable of completing the job.\n\nMost devastating is last week's Wall Street Journal investigation about all sorts of strange and unsettling behavior on the Kennedy campaign, including a former staffer concluding the campaign is full of \"grifters and opportunists,\" a director of messaging who decamped to Costa Rica for five weeks and called some of Kennedy's ideas \"actually repugnant,\" and a female ballot access director who found her contract terminated after expressing discomfort with her male supervisor because three years ago he was accused of sexual harassment.\n\nOn top of that, a paid consultant to the signature gathering effort was arrested two weeks ago for assault and criminal obstruction of breathing.\n\nAgain, Kennedy still has time. But we are far from the point at where we are obligated to call this anything more than a two-person presidential race.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Monthly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_scher@washingtonmonthly.com", "name": "Bill Scher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

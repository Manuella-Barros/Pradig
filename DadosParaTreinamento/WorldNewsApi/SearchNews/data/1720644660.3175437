Top 2024 Toyota/Save Mart 350 DFS picks, lineup advice One of McClure's top NASCAR at Sonoma DFS picks is Chase Elliott ($9,300 on DraftKings and $11,000 on FanDuel). Elliott is third in the NASCAR Cup Series standings as he's been one of the most consistent drivers in the NASCAR DFS driver pool this season. He's finished no worse than 15th in any of his last 10 races with seven top-10 results, including five top-five finishes during that span. Elliott also won the Autotrader EchoPark Automotive 400 on April 14. Elliott finished fifth at last year's Toyota/Save Mart 350 as he's excelled on the road course track over recent years. Outside of an engine issue causing him to finish 37th in 2019, the 28-year-old has finished eighth or better in five straight NASCAR at Sonoma runs. He finished second in the NASCAR at Indianapolis road course race and ninth in the NASCAR at Charlotte road course events last year as his strong performances on road courses extend even outside of Sonoma. Due to his strong history on road courses and consistency this season, McClure loves Elliott for NASCAR DFS lineups. You can see the rest of McClure's Toyota/Save Mart 350 DFS picks at SportsLine. Top 2024 Toyota/Save Mart 350 Fantasy NASCAR rankings, projections One sleeper McClure is targeting in his 2024 Toyota/Save Mart 350 Fantasy lineups is Daniel Suarez. He is a 25-1 longshot to win the 2024 Toyota/Save Mart 350, but the model projects him to make a run at the title. Suarez has a victory already this season, winning NASCAR at Atlanta in the second race of the season. He's finished outside the top 20 in four of his last five races but a road course race is where Suarez typically excels. The 32-year-old won the 2022 Toyota/Save Mart 350 and has finished in the top 15 in three of his last five NASCAR at Sonoma events. Suarez finished third in Indianapolis on a road course last season and finished fifth in two road courses in 2022 (Watkins Glen and Road America). Given his lack of recent success and that Suarez is currently 19th in the NASCAR Cup Series standings, he's a candidate to fly under the radar when making 2024 Toyota/Save Mart 350 Fantasy lineups, but he has the potential to return strong value.

His counsel, Femi Ate, senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), informed James Omotosho, the ruling judge, of Mamman's condition as the case was called.\n\nWhen the session resumed, Mamman entered the courtroom with his clothes partially soaked.

He requested the court to read the fresh charge to Mamman, but Justice Omotosho declined.\n\nThe judge inquired if Mamman was fit to proceed with the arraignment, to which Mamman affirmed. Mamman explained that his collapse was due to taking medication on an empty stomach, which caused his blood pressure to drop while waiting outside the courtroom.\n\nMamman informed the court about the error in the name on the charge served to him. Justice Omotosho then postponed the arraignment until 1 PM on the same day.\n\nAccording to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the EFCC has charged Mamman with 12 counts of money laundering, alleging that he was involved in laundering N33 billion.\n\nRead also: TCN takes delivery of two new 60MVA power transformers\n\nMamman served as Minister of Power from 2019 to 2021. He was detained by the EFCC on May 10, 2021, following his removal from office by President Buhari on September 1, 2021, in a cabinet reshuffle.\n\nMamman is accused of collaborating with ministry staff to divert around N22 billion from the Zungeru and Mambilla Hydro Electric Power projects.

charges relate to an alleged \u20a633 billion fraud linked to the misappropriation of funds designated for the Zungeru and Mambilla Hydro Electric Power projects.\n\nAccording to the EFCC, the former minister is accused of diverting about \u20a622 billion meant for these projects to acquire assets illegally within and outside Nigeria.\n\nMamman, who served under the administration of former President Muhammadu Buhari, was arrested four months after his dismissal from the ministerial position in 2021.\n\nHis arraignment in court was dramatic as he collapsed in the court premises before the session and was revived by medical personnel present.\n\nFollowing the incident, the counsel to the former minister, Femi Ate requested a delay in proceedings from the EFCC counsel, Adeyinka Olumide-Fusika to ensure the arraignment could take place on Monday, when his client would be in a better state.\n\nHowever, the judge informed them that the court was so busy with cases that the arraignment could only be rescheduled for the end of September.\n\nFollowing this, Olumide-Fusika decided to cancel the request for a delay.\n\nDespite his frail appearance and the preceding medical emergency, Mamman affirmed his fitness to proceed, attributing his collapse to an adverse reaction from taking medication without food.\n\nAfter his plea, the court adjourned to hear his bail

the anti-graft agency in Abuja.\n\nBuhari had September 1, 2021, sacked Mamman and the then Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Sabo Nanono, in what was called a cabinet restructuring.\n\nMamman was accused of conspiring with staff of the ministry in charge of the accounts of the Zungeru and Mambilla Hydro Electric Power projects to divert about N22 billion.\n\nThe

"body": "sitting in Abuja, on Thursday, ordered the remand of the immediate past Minister of Power, Saleh Mamman, in Kuje prison.\n\nThe ex-Minister was remanded after pleading not guilty to a 12-count money laundering charge the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, preferred against him.\n\nAccording to the trial judge, Justice James Omotosho, the former minister should remain in custody till Friday, when his bail application will be heard.\n\nMamman, who served in the administration of former President Muhammadu Buhari, is facing trial over his alleged complicity in a N33 billion fraud.\n\nHe was arrested in 2021, about four months after he was removed from office by ex-President Buhari.\n\nAmong other things, the EFCC alleged that he conspired with staff members of the ministry to divert about N22bn that was meant for the Zungeru and Mambilla Hydro Electric Power projects.\n\nThe Commission said its investigations revealed that the suspects used the funds to acquire choice assets, both within and outside the country.\n\nThe defendant had earlier before he was arraigned on Thursday, slumped within the court premises.\n\nIt took the help of both lawyers and a team of medical personnel from the court, to revive him.\n\nEventually, the defendant, who looked frail and ill, walked into the courtroom and entered the dock with part of his clothes drenched.\n\nThe trial judge, who was not aware of what transpired outside the courtroom, queried the defendant to ascertain if he was exposed to rain.\n\nResponding from the dock, Mamman, explained that water was poured on him after he collapsed.\n\nHis lawyer, Mr Femi Ate, SAN, confirmed the development after the prosecution counsel, Mr Adeyinka Olumide-Fusika, SAN, told the court that his attention was also drawn to the situation.\n\nNarrating what happened, Mamman's lawyer, Ate, SAN, said: \"My lord, upon being brought into the premises of the court, the defendant collapsed and had to be resuscitated and treated by the medical personnel of the Federal High Court.\"\n\nHe said his client was, however, served with a copy of the charge against him after he was resuscitated, adding that he had already discussed with EFCC's lawyer for the arraignment to be deferred.\n\nOn his part, the prosecution counsel told the court that what was served on the defendant was an amended charge.\n\nHe said the amendment was effected to correct an error in the name of the defendant.\n\nOlumide-Fusika, SAN, urged the court to compel the defendant to enter his plea to the charge.\n\nAfter he had listened to both sides, Justice Omotosho said he could only adjourn the matter till September in view of the heavy workload the court is faced with.\n\nFollowing the position of the court, Ake withdrew his oral application for an adjournment.\n\nThe defendant also confirmed to the court that he was fit and ready to take his plea, explaining that he collapsed as a result of a medication he took without food.\n\nThe court, after standing the matter down for about an hour, resumed sitting and took the defendant's plea.", "source": {"uri": "dailypost.ng", "dataType":

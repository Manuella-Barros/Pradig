[+] Sheep Tour\" on August 13, 1982, in Detroit. Getty Images From Eddie Van Halen to Brian May to Prince, these are just some of the names that come to mind when talking about some of the greatest rock guitarists of all time. These are gifted musicians who not only mastered the instrument, but took it to new levels, defining or influencing the genre in their own unique way. One thing they all have in common is their own distinctly identifiable sound. When you hear Jimmy Page play \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d Eric Clapton play \u201cLayla\u201d or Prince play \u201cPurple Rain,\u201d you immediately recognize the song, and the virtuoso holding the guitar. Top Rock Guitarists Here are ten of the top rock guitarists of all time, noting a couple of songs throughout each of their careers that highlight what makes them so special. 10. Randy Rhoads He died far too young but left an incredible music legacy. The son of a California music teacher, Randy Rhoads developed an interest in music early, picking up the guitar before the age of 10. He co-founded Quiet Riot as a teenager and later helped revive Ozzie Osbourne\u2019s career when he joined Ozzie\u2019s band as a guitarist. His work, specifically, on Osbourne\u2019s Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman made him a rising star in the rock guitar world. His astounding hype speed solos on \u201cMr. Crowley\u201d and \u201cCrazy Train\u201d are unmatched and serve as an inspiration to younger guitarists still today. Sadly, Rhoads died in a plane crash in 1982 at the age of 25.

David Gilmour He joined Pink Floyd, becoming their lead guitarist the year co-founder Syd Barrett left the band. In the years that followed, David Gilmour took the band to new heights with his bluesy electric guitar solos. His playing shines on landmark albums including 1973\u2019s Dark Side of the Moon and 1979\u2019s The Wall. Gilmour\u2019s most famous solo is the power ballad on \u201cComfortably Numb,\u201d a song Gilmour co-wrote. In later years, he branched out on his own solo projects, and has collaborated with other well-known artists and musicians on their projects. Gilmour is still creating new music and touring as a solo act. 8. Pete Townsend He\u2019s a British born musician who was the lead guitarist and primary songwriter/composer for the Who. Pete Townsend was an innovator and one of the earliest rock guitarists to use amp feedback for musical purposes. His vast body of work on songs like \u201cPinball Wizard,\u201d \u201cI Can See for Miles,\u201d \u201cMy Generation\u201d and others, shows his varied range and flexibility from power strumming to striking power chords. Queen guitarist Brian May says he can\u2019t imagine rock guitar without him. \u201cTownshend brought to the scene a blistering clang of super-amplified but not over-saturated chords \u2014 razor-edged monoliths crashing angrily through our brains, biting rhythmic hammer blows which would change the likes of me forever. If you want to feel what I\u2019m talking about \u2014 put on \u2018My Generation\u2019 at full volume,\u201d May said. Townend has won multiple awards for the rock opera Tommy which started as a theme album, then became a film, and later a Broadway musical. 7. Eric Clapton One of the greatest guitarists of all-time, Eric Clapton is the only person inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame three times. (First as a member of the Yardbirds in 1992, with Cream in 1993, then as a solo artist in 2000.) Heavily influenced by the blues, the British-born Clapton, who is also a gifted songwriter, has always blended heart and soul in his music. His rock classic \u201cLayla\u201d was inspired by his forbidden love for the wife of his best friend, George Harrison. And he wrote \u201cTears in Heaven\u201d after the tragic death of his 4-year-old son. The first public recognition for his guitar skills came during his Yardbird days when someone spray painted \u201cClapton is God\u201d on a wall in London. Religious references aside, he\u2019s an accomplished musician whose work continues to inspire fellow and aspiring musicians. In addition to his own well-known hits, Clapton played the iconic solo on the Beatles song \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps.\u201d 6. Prince Aside from his extraordinary ability to play it, when Prince picked up a guitar, you knew things were about to get entertaining. He was a true showman who could do it all. He was a singer, songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist whose talent knew no bounds. Prince blended rock, pop, funk, rhythm & blues and \u201clived\u201d to play music. His guitar seemed an extension of himself whether he was rocking audiences with \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d or playing the dynamic power ballad solo on \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d He was truly one of the most talented musicians of his time, and when it came to the guitar, no one, before or since, has played it like Prince. 5. Keith Richards He\u2019s a singer/songwriter and guitarist for the legendary British group the Rolling Stones. Keith Richard cites Chuck Berry and the Everly Brothers among his early influences, but Richards would soon carve out his own place in music history. He\u2019s known for his chord-heavy playing style, rooted in blues music. His career with the Stones spans more than six decades, giving him a massive catalogue of songs with legendary riffs. From \u201cI Can\u2019t Get No Satisfaction\u201d to \u201cJumpin\u2019 Jack Flash\u201d to \u201cStart Me Up\u201d to many others. Although he\u2019s widely recognized for his skills as a guitarist, his strong songwriting partnership with Mick Jagger is also a huge part of the band\u2019s lengthy success. The Rolling Stones remains one of the most enduring rock bands in history. 4. Jimmy Page He played with the Yardbirds and worked as a London session player, adding guitar to recordings by the Who, the Kinks, Marianne Faithful and others, before founding one of the greatest rock bands ever. It\u2019s the songs and diverse sounds Jimmy Page created with Led Zeppelin that makes him one of the most respected guitarists in music history. He was one of the driving forces behind the heavy rock sound of the early seventies, but he contributed so much more. He drew from a vast array of musical influences and blended both acoustic and electric guitar elements. As Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry noted during Led Zeppelin\u2019s Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction, \u201cZeppelin would change gears six times in one hour. They played blues, funk, rock, reggae and ballads with equal ease. I think it\u2019s laughable some people consider them just a heavy metal band since at least half of their best songs were acoustic.\u201d Page was prolific in creating guitar riffs and often played with a cello bow to alter the sound. His riff in \u201cWhole Lotta Love\u201d is considered one of the best of all time, and his solo in \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d is also regarded as one of the greatest. 3. Brian May He\u2019s one of the most identifiable guitarists in rock music. Within the first few seconds of hearing him play, you know it\u2019s Brian May. His unique approach to tone and sound began when he was a young boy, and he and his father designed and built his Red Special guitar. May would go on to use that Red Special for many of Queen\u2019s biggest hits, some of which he also wrote. May always likened the sound of the guitar to \u201csinging,\u201d saying he strived to find the instrument\u2019s \u201cvoice.\u201d Since he made so much music with one of rock\u2019s greatest voices ever, Freddie Mercury, it\u2019s easy to see the two were well-paired. May has always experimented with sound, determined to showcase each song in the best way possible whether that meant spectacular solos, timeless riffs or beautiful melodies. His work in \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d is absolute magic. The song, which many predicted would never connect with rock fans, has become one of the genres best-known and much-loved songs. May continues to tour with Queen with Adam Lambert handling vocals. In addition to being a guitar virtuoso, May is also an astrophysicist. 2. Eddie Van Halen One of the most influential rock guitarists of all time, Eddie Van Halen was an electric guitar virtuoso who loved the instrument and practiced constantly. He was a Dutch-born American songwriter and guitarist who emerged onto the music scene in the 1970s as part of the group, Van Halen, which he cofounded with his brother, Alex. Eddie helped reshape the sound of the electric guitar. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame describes him this way: \u201cWith blistering speed, and melodic feel, he perfected the art of shredding, unleashing two-handed finger tapping, dramatic whammy-bar moves, and other astonishing never-before-seen techniques.\u201d Van Halen\u2019s nearly two-minute guitar solo on \u201cEruption,\u201d a song featured on the band\u2019s self-titled debut album, is as mesmerizing today as it was when he recorded it almost 50 years ago. He was also the master behind the guitar solo on Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBeat It,\u201d doing it as a favor to Quincy Jones, for free. Although the music world lost him on October 6, 2020, to cancer at the age of 65, Eddie Van Halen continues to influence up-and-coming guitarists, as he has for decades. Before we note the No. 1 Top Guitarist, we\u2019d like to share some honorable mentions. Honorable Mention: Chuck Berry When it comes to rock and roll guitar, many have helped develop and revolutionize the sound through the years, but it all started with Chuck Berry. He paved the way for what rock n\u2019 roll would become with \u201cMaybeline,\u201d \u201cRoll Over Beethoven,\u201d and others. And his 18-second intro to \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d opened the doors for just what the electric guitar could do for music.

Although he\u2019s known for creating the \u201cNashville Sound\u201d which helped give country music a commercial boost, and his distinctive finger picking style, he had a broader range and reach which influenced other genres, as well. Atkins played on Elvis Presley\u2019s \u201cHeartbreak Hotel,\u201d the Everly Brothers \u201cWake Up Little Susie\u201d and others.

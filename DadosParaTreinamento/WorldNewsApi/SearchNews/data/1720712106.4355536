Scottie Scheffler, the No. 1 golfer, extended his lead to 4 shots after the third round of the Memorial with a 1-under 71 at Muirfield Village, despite facing several challenges. His round included hitting a bunker shot into a creek, a tee shot out of bounds and a three-putt bogey on the 18th hole. Scheffler\u2019s play kept him at 10-under 206, with Collin Morikawa and Adam Hadwin trailing at 210. He regained his lead with birdies on the 10th, 12th, and 15th holes. Despite his struggles, Scheffler remained satisfied with his performance, acknowledging the course\u2019s difficulty and his ability to bounce back with crucial birdies. Hadwin and defending champion Viktor Hovland remained in contention but faced their own difficulties, while Rory McIlroy ended the day 8 shots back after a 73. Scheffler, having won his last four times with the 54-hole lead, aims for another victory. A win Sunday would not only mark his fifth overall this season but also his third signature event win, adding to his victories at the Players Championship and the Masters. Scheffler is aiming to join an elite group of players who have achieved five victories in a season, including Justin Thomas (2017), Jason Day (2015) and Jordan Spieth (2015). Scheffler could threaten the all-time PGA Tour record of nine wins in a season held by Tiger Woods (2000) and Vijay Singh (2004).

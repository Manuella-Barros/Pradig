Right off the bat, Maher noted how Fetterman speaks \u201cso freely. You speak like (the politicians) out of office, and it\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u201d Fetterman had suffered a stroke before his election and has previously shared his personal experience with depression. Maher asked if the publicized nature of the events had anything to do with his willingness to speak so openly. The senator responded saying he feels like it does. \u201cThat\u2019s not reckless. It\u2019s freeing. I think after all that, I have to say the things I really believe in and not worry about if there\u2019s any kind of blowback.\u201d Fetterman explained that he aims to help others who are dealing with depression. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to have that conversation. I want to say something to help someone in that situation.\u201d Regarding the 2024 presidential race, Fetterman contended that \u201cPennsylvania picks the winner\u201d and that Joe Biden will win again. When asked if Biden is the best choice, Fetterman noted the current president\u2019s winning track record. Later in the conversation, the topic of legal marijuana came up. Maher, an avid weed smoker, also asked Fetterman about his support for legalizing weed. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that about you, too,\u201d Fetterman interjected. \u201cIt\u2019s just a character I play on TV,\u201d Maher quipped. The HBO host also asked Fetterman about his attire which ultimately influenced a more relaxed dress code for the Senate. The Pennsylvania Senator has been known to sport a hoodie, shorts, and sneakers on the Senate floor. Fetterman joked with Maher about a previous joke he made on the show about how he dresses like a guy whom the airlines lost his luggage. \u201cI\u2019m not making a statement,\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cI am into comfort, and I don\u2019t have to iron, and it\u2019s hard to find suits,\u201d referencing his 6-foot, eight-inch frame. \u201cI never understood why anyone thought that was interesting.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think he had much to do with the dress code change, however, he noted, \u201cMore people seemed concerned about me wearing a hoodie on the floor than Senators taking bribes.\u201d Head over to Max to watch last night\u2019s episode and catch new episodes of Real Time with Bill Maher on Fridays at 10 p.m. ET on HBO.", "summary": "\"I want to say something to help someone in that situation.\"", "url": "https://decider.com/2024/06/08/bill-maher-prods-senator-john-fetterman-to-talk-about-his-depression-on-real-time/", "image": "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bill-maher-john-fetterman.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1156", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/IYJJZ5tx-QVS3bn7S.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:55:26", "author": "Michael Haskoor,mliss1578", "authors": ["Michael Haskoor", "mliss1578"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.116}

face.\n\n\"Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavour to prevent disorder.\n\n\"The actions in Southport tonight will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\n\n\"Our officers should not have to face this, but we will be there tonight to ensure the safety of the local community who have suffered enough, and will arrest those involved in criminal behaviour.\"", "source": {"uri":

rioting followed a frenzied stabbing attack in Southport on Monday at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nA 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart Street.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain says Islamaphobic backlash began with a false rumour on the internet which was then stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims.\n\nThe MCB paid tribute to the three young girls killed in Southport on Monday, before

A police van was blazing behind them, with black smoke filling the air.\n\nMasked men were seen scouring the ground for bricks littering the floor to throw at the officers while heavy thuds were heard as the vans took hits and police raised their shields against incoming projectiles. Fires were also started down the streets and in wheelie bins. A police helicopter was also flying overhead.\n\nHome secretary Yvette Cooper described the violence as \"a total disgrace\", adding that it was \"appalling\" that police officers, some of whom had responded to Monday's attack, were now combating \"thugs on the streets who have no respect for a grieving community\".\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were all fatally stabbed at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Southport, Merseyside, on Monday.\n\nEight other children suffered stab wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured, police said.\n\nHundreds of people took part in a peaceful vigil on Tuesday evening outside Southport's Atkinson arts venue, with many in tears as they laid flowers and cards of remembrance.\n\nBut the vigil was followed by a separate protest outside a local mosque as demonstrators chanting far-right slogans clashed with police in St Luke's Road.\n\nMerseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items towards the mosque at around 7.45pm.\n\nOfficers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them and police vehicles were damaged and set on fire.\n\nMerseyside Police said an officer suffered a suspected broken nose during the chaotic scenes.\n\nA 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart Street.\n\nAfter the boy's arrest a fake name has been circulated on social media alongside a number of other untrue accusations.\n\nIn a post on social media, Chief Constable Kennedy said: \"I am incredibly proud of my officers and staff who have worked so hard to save the lives of children, investigate the horrific incident from yesterday, working with partners to provide reassurance to our communities and now they are facing this level of violence from these thugs.\n\n\"Over 1,000 residents from Southport came together this evening to remember the little girls who have died, those who are still critical in hospital and all those who witnessed and are traumatised by the events from yesterday.\n\n\"This is where all of our focus should be.\"\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss of Merseyside Police said it was \"sickening\" to see the disorder \"happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives\".\n\nIn a statement, Assistant Chief Constable Goss added: \"Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face.

More info\n\nNearly 40 police officers sustained injuries at the scene of violent disorder in Southport following Monday's knife attack, North West Ambulance Service said.\n\nThe rioting followed a mass stabbing in Southport at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club which claimed the lives of three young girls: Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven. A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart Street.\n\nThe ambulance service said 27 police officers were taken to hospital following the \"shocking\" scenes of violence as riots erupted on the streets of Southport on Tuesday evening. Other officers suffered head injuries and serious facial injuries, and one was knocked unconscious, the PA news agency reports.\n\nREAD MORE: Hero teacher fighting for life after saving children during Southport stabbing\n\nKeep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter\n\nA statement on X said: \"We treated 39 patients in total, all of which were police officers. 27 were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene.\" Merseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose, and a concussion.\n\nThree police dogs were also injured in the chaos, with Zoe and Ike suffering leg injuries from bricks thrown at them. A third dog, Quga - who was bitten, strangled and kicked by an offender at the beginning of this month - suffered burns to her back leg, the force said.\n\nMerseyside Police said those involved in the unrest - who they believe included supporters of the English Defence League - set alight cars belonging to members of the public, threw bricks at the local mosque, damaged a local convenience store, and set wheelie bins on fire. Extra police will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities.\n\nA 24-hour Section 60 Order was introduced in the area running from 7.54pm on Tuesday, which gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals and is designed to minimise serious violence. A Section 34 Order has also been introduced, giving police the power to direct people engaging in antisocial behaviour or are likely to become involved in such incidents.\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Goss, said: \"Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\n\n\"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support. Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the mosque car park.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer said the rioters had \"hijacked\" a vigil for victims and would \"feel the full force of the law\". Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting outside a mosque in Southport as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", which she branded \"appalling\".\n\nHundreds of people took part in a peaceful vigil for the stabbing victims on Tuesday evening outside Southport's Atkinson arts venue, with many in tears as they laid flowers and cards of remembrance. The vigil was followed by a separate protest outside a local mosque as demonstrators chanted far-right slogans and clashed with police in St Luke's Road.\n\nEight other children were also stabbed in Monday's attack, with five children and two adults left in a critical condition.

It comes after three girls were killed in a knife attack.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were all fatally stabbed at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Southport, Merseyside, on Monday (July 29). Eight other children suffered stab wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured, police said.\n\nMerseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said officers had faced violence from \"thugs\" on Tuesday evening. Hundreds of people took part in a peaceful vigil on Tuesday evening outside Southport's Atkinson arts venue, with many in tears as they laid flowers and cards of remembrance, PA reports.\n\nThe vigil was followed by a separate protest outside a local mosque as demonstrators chanting far-right slogans clashed with police in St Luke's Road. Merseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items towards the mosque at around 7.45pm.\n\nOfficers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them and police vehicles were damaged and set on fire. Merseyside Police said an officer suffered a suspected broken nose during the chaotic scenes.\n\nA 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart Street. In a post on social media, Chief Constable Kennedy said: \"I am incredibly proud of my officers and staff who have worked so hard to save the lives of children, investigate the horrific incident from yesterday, working with partners to provide reassurance to our communities and now they are facing this level of violence from these thugs.\n\n\"Over 1,000 residents from Southport came together this evening to remember the little girls who have died, those who are still critical in hospital and all those who witnessed and are traumatised by the events from yesterday. This is where all of our focus should be.\"\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss of Merseyside Police said it was \"sickening\" to see the disorder \"happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives\".\n\nIn a statement, Assistant Chief Constable Goss added: \"Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face. Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavour to prevent disorder.\n\n\"The actions in Southport tonight will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside. There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time. Our officers should not have to face this, but we will be there tonight to ensure the safety of the local community who have suffered enough, and will arrest those involved in criminal behaviour.\"\n\nA 32-year-old man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possession of a flick knife on Eastbank Street near where the vigil took place on Tuesday evening. The man was taken into custody and there were no reports that anyone was injured during the incident, Merseyside Police said.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer visited the seaside town on Tuesday and thanked emergency service workers, telling them: \"I hope you feel proud of the part that you played in the most difficult circumstances, to do what you could for those young lives.\"\n\nHe laid down his wreath and stood momentarily in silence, but more than one person shouted: \"How many more, Starmer? When are you going to do something?\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper updated MPs on the attack in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening, where she described it as an \"unspeakable tragedy\". She told the Commons: \"These were young children, dancing to Taylor Swift and celebrating the start of the school holidays.\n\n\"What should have been a joyful start to the summer turned into an unspeakable tragedy.\"\n\nPolice have said that, although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA riot in Southport saw almost 40 police officers injured and 27 taken to hospital after scenes of violent disorder outside a mosque. The riots flared just over 24 hours after a fatal stabbing spree in the town which saw three young girls killed and others injured on Monday, July 29.\n\nThe trouble on Tuesday night flared at around 7.45pm when what Merseyside Police described as a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League - began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road, which is just around the corner from the scene of the knife attack on Hart Street.\n\nThe force said bottles and wheelie bins were being thrown and one officer had suffered a suspected broken nose as a result. By around 9.45pm, the violence had calmed down with numbers on the street having dwindled as darkness descended, the PA news agency reported.\n\nREAD MORE: Nearly 40 police officers injured in riots after Southport stabbings\n\nREAD MORE: Huw Edwards to appear in court charged with making indecent images of children\n\nThe violence happened just after hundreds of people attended a vigil to remember the three girls killed in the mass stabbing at a Taylor Swift-themed event held in a nursery. Police confirmed they had arrested a man and seized a flick knife just around the corner from the site of the vigil at 6.55pm.\n\nPolice are continuing to question a 17-year-old boy following the horrendous incident. Emergency services were called to reports of a stabbing in Hart Street at around 11.50am on Monday, July 29. Armed police arrested a male and seized a knife. The 17-year-old boy from Banks in Lancashire, who was born in Cardiff, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder, Merseyside Police said.\n\nCatch up on our live coverage of the devastating stabbings and the aftermath here. This is everything we know about the violent disturbance in Southport on Tuesday, July 30.\n\nWhy were people rioting?\n\nThe riots happened after a mass stabbing incident at a Taylor Swift-themed summer holiday class which killed three children on Monday. Tuesday's violence happened just after hundreds of people attended a vigil to remember the three girls who list their lives.\n\nThe victims of the stabbing have been named as Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Merseyside Police confirmed on Tuesday, July 30. Eight other children remain in hospital, with five in a critical condition. Two adults are also in hospital with severe injuries.\n\nThe trouble flared at around 7.45pm when what Merseyside Police described as a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League - began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road, which is just around the corner from the scene of the knife attack on Hart Street.\n\nIt is believed they gathered after what police have called \"speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody\", with the force saying that \"some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said those involved in the unrest set alight cars belonging to members of the public, threw bricks at the local mosque, damaged a local convenience store, and set wheelie bins on fire.\n\nThe Mirror reports that local residents were up all night trying to clear their streets after rioters turned them into a \"war zone.\" After calm was finally restored the extent of the chaos could be seen with rubbish burnt out vehicles and smashed windows. One local said: \"At least the bin men don't have to empty the bins today - they've all been burnt.\"\n\nWho was injured in the riots?\n\nNearly 40 police officers sustained injuries at the scene of violent disorder in Southport, North West Ambulance Service said. The service said 27 officers were taken to hospital.\n\nA statement on X said: \"We treated 39 patients in total, all of which were police officers. 27 were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene.\" Merseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose, and a concussion.\n\nOther officers suffered head injuries, and serious facial injuries, and one was knocked unconscious. Three police dogs were also injured in the chaos, with Zoe and Ike suffering leg injuries from bricks thrown at them.\n\nA third dog, Quga - who was bitten, strangled and kicked by an offender at the beginning of this month - suffered burns to her back leg, the force said.\n\nWhat have police said about the riots?\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, we have seen overwhelming support and sympathy from the community and wider Merseyside communities for the families who are currently trying to deal with their loss and care for victims injured during the major incident. Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face. Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavour to prevent disorder.\n\n\"The actions in Southport tonight will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside. There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time. Our officers should not have to face this, but we will be there tonight to ensure the safety of the local community who have suffered enough, and will arrest those involved in criminal behaviour.\"\n\nPolice said an incorrect name for the alleged Southport attacker, along with false details about his past, had been widely shared online. A Merseyside Police statement said: \"A name has been shared on social media in connection with the suspect in the incident in Southport. This name is incorrect and we would urge people not to speculate on details of the incident while the investigation is ongoing.\" Join our WhatsApp news community here for the latest breaking news",

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nViolence erupted between protesters and police outside a Southport mosque following the tragic stabbing of three young girls.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were all tragically killed in a knife attack in Southport, Merseyside, on Monday. In addition to the fatalities, eight other children sustained stab wounds, with five currently in critical condition. Two adults were also critically injured in the incident, according to police reports.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, hundreds gathered for a vigil outside Southport's Atkinson arts venue, many visibly upset as they laid flowers and cards in memory of the young victims. The peaceful vigil was followed by a protest outside a local mosque, where demonstrators chanting far-right slogans clashed with police on St Luke's Road.\n\nRead more: Police name three young victims as families release heartbreaking statements Keep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter\n\nMerseyside Police reported that \"a large group of people believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" began hurling items towards the mosque around 7.45pm.\n\nPolice officers donned helmets and riot gear as stones and bottles were thrown at them, resulting in damage to police vehicles and some being set alight.\n\nAn officer suffered a suspected broken nose amidst the chaos outside the mosque, as projectiles continued to be launched at the police.\n\nA 17 year old boy, who cannot be named due to legal reasons, is currently in custody, facing charges of murder and attempted murder in relation to the incident at the Hart Street dance studio.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss remarked: \"It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.\"\n\nHe further noted, \"In the last 24 hours, we have seen overwhelming support and sympathy from the community and wider Merseyside communities for the families who are currently trying to deal with their loss and care for victims injured during the major incident.\"\n\nReflecting on the challenges faced by emergency services, he said, \"Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face. Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavour to prevent disorder.\"\n\nACC Goss also pointed out, \"The actions in Southport tonight will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside.\"\n\nAddressing the spread of misinformation, he stated, \"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\"\n\nHe made it clear by saying, \"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nConcluding his statement, ACC Goss affirmed, \"Our officers should not have to face this, but we will be there tonight to ensure the safety of the local community who have suffered enough, and will arrest those involved in criminal behaviour.\"", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

"\"Thugs\" were to blame for the violence that saw 39 police officers injured in Southport, the town's MP has said.\n\nUnrest broke out in the Merseyside town hours after a vigil to remember the victims of Monday's knife attack at a dance school in which three young girls were killed.\n\nOfficers were pelted with bricks, a police van was set on fire, and eight officers were seriously hurt, Merseyside Police said.\n\nMP Patrick Hurley described the violence - close to a mosque - as \"horrific\".\n\nHurley told BBC's Radio 4 Today programme that the \"riot\" was \"led by people from outside the town\".\n\nPolice said the violence was believed to have involved English Defence League supporters.\n\nHurley condemned \"thugs who had got the train in\" who were using the \"deaths of three little kiddies for their own political purposes\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Merseyside Police named the three girls who were killed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop at the Hart Space studio in Hart Street.\n\nThey were six-year-old Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine.\n\nAt about 6pm local time, a peaceful vigil was held outside the Atkinson gallery in Lord Street, with more than 1000 people estimated to have attended.\n\nThroughout the day, though, there had been rumours circulating online of a planned demonstration near to a mosque on St Luke's Road.\n\nAt about 19:45, demonstrators began to gather and engaged in a stand-off with police officers.\n\nAs the disorder escalated, officers donned protective gear and used riot shields to defend themselves from bricks, wheelie bins and other objects being hurled towards them.\n\nA police vehicle was also set on fire.\n\nHurley said it was \"reprehensible\" that police officers who had, the day before been attending to injured victims, were finding themselves \"being pelted with bricks by these thugs\".\n\nThe MP said they had \"hijacked the grief\" of the town and families.\n\nHe said: \"These people are utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured and totally disrespecting the town.\"\n\nIn total, 27 officers were taken to hospital, and 12 were treated and discharged at the scene, the ambulance service said.\n\nA 24-hour Section 60 Order has been put in place, giving police extra stop and search powers.\n\nA Section 34 Order has also been introduced, allowing police to direct people who are engaging in antisocial behaviour or are \"likely to become involved in such behaviour\" away from the area.\n\nMerseyside Police said extra officers would remain in the area \"to provide a visible presence and reassure communities\".\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said it was \"sickening\" that this was happening within a \"devastated\" community.\n\nHe said the force has faced \"serious violence\" and was \"so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\"\n\nACC Goss also thanked officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police for providing mutual aid and support.\n\nHe added the disorder involved many people \"who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside\".\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park,\" he said.\n\n\"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nA 17-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder after Monday's attack.\n\nACC Goss said: \"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK, and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nPM Sir Keir Starmer said on X that the people of Southport were \"reeling\" after the \"horror inflicted on them yesterday\".\n\nHe said that those who had \"hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery\" had insulted the community and would \"feel the full force of the law\".\n\nFamilies living nearby told the BBC they feared for their safety as stones flew past and police officers rushed to put on riot gear and pick up shields.\n\n\"I can't believe this is happening in Southport,\" one young woman shouted from the front of her car as she tried to drive her young daughter away.\n\nThe disorder began after hundreds of people gathered near a local mosque attacking the front of it, throwing bricks, bottles, fireworks and rocks, many with hoods up and scarves hiding their faces.\n\nMerseyside Police said those behind the violence had been fired up by social media posts which incorrectly suggested an Islamist link to Monday's stabbings.\n\nThe Home Secretary Yvette Cooper had earlier warned about disinformation linked to the attack.\n\nThe suspect has no known links to Islam.\n\nCooper later said it was \"appalling\" that police officers in Southport were facing attacks from \"thugs on the streets who have no respect for a grieving community\".\n\n\"I think everyone should be showing some respect for the community that is grieving and also for the police who are pursuing an urgent criminal investigation now, and who showed such heroism and bravery yesterday in the face of these horrific attacks,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement on X, Merseyside Police and Crime Commissioner Emily Spurrell also said she was \"absolutely appalled by the disgraceful scenes of violence\".\n\n\"This is a community which has faced unimaginable tragedy, and it is grieving.\n\n\"Such behaviour is abhorrent and only causes further harm and suffering,\" she added.\n\nMerseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy posted on X that more than 1000 residents from Southport had come together at the vigil to remember the little girls who had died, those who were still critical in hospital and all those who witnessed and were traumatised by the events from yesterday.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"},

The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nElsie, seven, Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, and Bebe King, six, were fatally stabbed in Southport on Monday. Eight other children suffered stab wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured, police said.\n\nA 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody.\n\nNorth West Ambulance service said 27 officers were taken to hospital, with 12 others being treated and discharged at the scene of the rioting. Merseyside police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion. Three police dogs were also injured.\n\nHurley said the violence was the result of \"propaganda and lies\" circulated on social media about the identity of the attacker within minutes of Monday's tragic incident.\n\nThe MP condemned \"beered-up thugs\" who threw bricks, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"These were thugs who got the train in, these were not the people from Southport.\n\n\"They were using the horrific incident on Monday, the deaths of three little kiddies, for their own political purposes and actually to attack the very same first responders and the very same police, who had been on the scene on Monday, were then being pelted with bricks the day after by these thugs.\"\n\nHe hit out at the \"swirling morass\" of social media \"lies and propaganda\", saying they had fuelled rumours about the attacker's identity as well as criticism of politicians. False claims had spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nHe told Times Radio: \"We'd had all sorts of lies being spread and misinformation being spread about the alleged perpetrator and some people with the best of intentions then they tried to rebut this, they tried to argue back, but all that happens is you're just amplifying people's false messaging.\"\n\nHe added: \"This misinformation doesn't just exist on people's internet browsers and on people's phones. It has real world impact.\"\n\nDozens of local residents turned up outside Southport mosque on Wednesday morning with brushes and shovels to help with the clean-up operation.\n\nWriting on X, Keir Starmer, the prime minister, said on Tuesday night: \"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and our respect. Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves.\"\n\nThe home secretary, Yvette Cooper, described the rioting as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", which she branded \"appalling\".\n\nIn a post on social media, Merseyside police said shops had been broken into and looted, adding that \"those responsible will be brought to justice\".\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"The actions in Southport tonight will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nThe suspect, who was born in Cardiff, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport. A road in the area was cordoned off by detectives on Monday afternoon.\n\nPolice have said that, although the motive for the attack was unclear, it was not believed to be terror-related.\n\nA

Whittingham, Marc Waddington & Ian Shoesmith - BBC News\n\n\"Thugs\" were to blame for the violence that saw 39 police officers injured in Southport, the town's MP has said.\n\nUnrest broke out in the Merseyside town hours after a vigil to remember the victims of Monday's knife attack at a dance school in which three young girls were killed.\n\nOfficers were pelted with bricks, a police van was set on fire, and eight officers were seriously hurt, Merseyside Police said.\n\nMP Patrick Hurley described the violence - close to a mosque - as \"horrific\".\n\nMr Hurley told BBC's Radio 4 Today programme that the \"riot\" was \"led by people from outside the town\".\n\nPolice said the violence was believed to have involved English Defence League supporters.\n\nMr Hurley condemned \"thugs who had got the train in\" who were using the \"deaths of three little kiddies for their own political purposes\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Merseyside Police named the three girls who were killed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop at the Hart Space studio in Hart Street.\n\nThey were six-year-old Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine.\n\nAt about 18:00 BST, a peaceful vigil was held outside the Atkinson gallery in Lord Street, with more than 1,000 people estimated to have attended.\n\nThroughout the day, though, there had been rumours circulating online of a planned demonstration near to a mosque on St Luke's Road.\n\nAt about 19:45, demonstrators began to gather and engaged in a stand-off with police officers.\n\nAs the disorder escalated, officers donned protective gear and used riot shields to defend themselves from bricks, wheelie bins and other objects being hurled towards them.\n\nA police vehicle was also set on fire.\n\nMr Hurley said it was \"reprehensible\" that police officers who had, the day before been attending to injured victims, were finding themselves \"being pelted with bricks by these thugs\".\n\nThe MP said they had \"hijacked the grief\" of the town and families.\n\nHe said: \"These people are utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured and totally disrespecting the town.\"\n\nIn total, 27 officers were taken to hospital, and 12 were treated and discharged at the scene, the ambulance service said.\n\nA 24-hour Section 60 Order has been put in place, giving police extra stop and search powers.\n\nA Section 34 Order has also been introduced, allowing police to direct people who are engaging in antisocial behaviour or are \"likely to become involved in such behaviour\" away from the area.\n\nMerseyside Police said extra officers would remain in the area \"to provide a visible presence and reassure communities\".\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said it was \"sickening\" that this was happening within a \"devastated\" community.\n\nHe said the force has faced \"serious violence\" and was \"so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\"\n\nACC Goss also thanked officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police for providing mutual aid and support.\n\nHe added the disorder involved many people \"who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside\".\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park,\" he said.\n\n\"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nA 17-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder after Monday's attack.\n\nACC Goss said: \"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK, and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nPM Sir Keir Starmer said on X that the people of Southport were \"reeling\" after the \"horror inflicted on them yesterday\".\n\nHe said that those who had \"hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery\" had insulted the community and would \"feel the full force of the law\".\n\nFamilies living nearby told the BBC they feared for their safety as stones flew past and police officers rushed to put on riot gear and pick up shields.\n\n\"I can't believe this is happening in Southport,\" one young woman shouted from the front of her car as she tried to drive her young daughter away.\n\nThe disorder began after hundreds of people gathered near a local mosque attacking the front of it, throwing bricks, bottles, fireworks and rocks, many with hoods up and scarves hiding their faces.\n\nMerseyside Police said those behind the violence had been fired up by social media posts which incorrectly suggested an Islamist link to Monday's stabbings.\n\nThe Home Secretary Yvette Cooper had earlier warned about disinformation linked to the attack.\n\nThe suspect has no known links to Islam.\n\nMs Cooper later said it was \"appalling\" that police officers in Southport were facing attacks from \"thugs on the streets who have no respect for a grieving community\".\n\n\"I think everyone should be showing some respect for the community that is grieving and also for the police who are pursuing an urgent criminal investigation now, and who showed such heroism and bravery yesterday in the face of these horrific attacks,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement on X, Merseyside Police and Crime Commissioner Emily Spurrell also said she was \"absolutely appalled by the disgraceful scenes of violence\".\n\n\"This is a community which has faced unimaginable tragedy, and it is grieving.\n\n\"Such behaviour is abhorrent and only causes further harm and suffering,\" she added.\n\nMerseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy posted on X that more than 1,000 residents from Southport had come together at the vigil to remember the little girls who had died, those who were still critical in hospital and all those who witnessed and were traumatised by the events from yesterday.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Will we ever get over this.\"\n\nThe violence appears to have been linked to several false accusations spread online.\n\nThe area is around a five-minute walk from the scene of Monday's stabbing attack.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss says: \"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\n\n\"It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.\"\n\nIt comes after hundreds of people rallied together in solidarity outside The Aktinson Art Gallery in Merseyside to pay their respects at a separate peaceful vigil.\n\nSome lit candles while others lay flowers and reflected on the tragedy.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said anyone involved in the disorder in Southport will \"feel the full force of the law\".\n\nHe added: \"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said it was \"appalling\" police officers in Southport were facing attacks from \"thugs on the streets who have no respect for a grieving community\".\n\nThe MP for Southport says she was \"deeply concerned\" by the violent protest and has urged people to \"stay safe\".\n\nIn a statement on X, Patrick Hurley says he \"fully condemns any attack\" on emergency services, pointing out that these are the same services that responded to the tragic stabbing attack.\n\nHe added: \"I appeal to local people to avoid the area and stay safe, to allow the police to do their job. I want to thank our community for pulling together and supporting every person who has been affected by Monday's tragic attack.\"\n\nThe MP also thanked those who attended a vigil earlier to remember the three children - Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice Dasilva Aguiar - who were killed in the attack, and the 10 other people who were injured.\n\n\"I was deeply saddened to hear the news today of the death of a third child. Bebe, Elsie and Alice are in all of our thoughts and hearts today,\" he adds.\n\nMeanwhile, a man \"wearing a balaclava\" and carrying a knife was arrested in Southport last night - just yards from the vigil.\n\nMerseyside Police confirmed they had arrested a 32-year-old on suspicion of possessing a bladed article - while the force's Detective Inspector condemned knife crime in the aftermath of the \"swift arrest\".\n\nIt comes as Bebe and Elsie, aged six and seven, were identified as the first victims in the attack on Tuesday .\n\nArmed police were called to the scene on Hart Street, Southport, at 11.47am on Monday.\n\nA 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio.\n\nMerseyside Police said the motive is currently unclear but it was not suspected to be terror-related.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast

have been injured and a police van set on fire during a protest just hours after a vigil took place to remember the victims of a knife attack in which three children were killed.\n\nThe protest, which police said was believed to involve English Defence League supporters, began only a few streets away from the vigil location, near to a mosque on St Luke's Road in Southport.\n\nMerseyside Police said a number of officers had been injured, police vehicles had been damaged and set alight, and a shop had been looted in the disturbances which began at about 19:45 BST.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said it was \"sickening\" that this was happening within a \"devastated\" community.\n\nACC Goss added: \"Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face.\n\n\"Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavour to prevent disorder.\"\n\nACC Goss said the protest involved many people \"who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside\".\n\nA 17-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder after Monday's attack on a children's dance club in Hart Street.\n\nHe added: \"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK, and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nFamilies living nearby told the BBC they feared for their safety as stones flew past and police officers rushed to put on riot gear and pick up shields.\n\n\"I can't believe this is happening in Southport,\" one young woman shouted from the front of her car as she tried to drive her young daughter away.\n\nThe riot began after hundreds of protesters gathered near a local mosque attacking the front of it, throwing bricks, bottles, fireworks and rocks, many with hoods up and scarves hiding their faces.\n\nMerseyside Police said those behind the violence had been fired up by social media posts which incorrectly suggested an Islamist link to Monday's stabbings.\n\nThe Home Secretary Yvette Cooper had earlier warned about disinformation linked to the attack.\n\nThe suspect has no known links to Islam.\n\nMs Cooper later said it was \"appalling\" that police officers in Southport were facing attacks from \"thugs on the streets who have no respect for a grieving community\".\n\n\"I think everyone should be showing some respect for the community that is grieving and also for the police who are pursuing an urgent criminal investigation now, and who showed such heroism and bravery yesterday in the face of these horrific attacks,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement on X, Merseyside Police and Crime Commissioner Emily Spurrell also said she was \"absolutely appalled by the disgraceful scenes of violence\".\n\n\"This is a community which has faced unimaginable tragedy, and it is grieving.\n\n\"Such behaviour is abhorrent and only causes further harm and suffering,\" she added.\n\nMerseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy posted on X that more than 1,000 residents from Southport had come together at the vigil to remember the little girls who had died, those who were still critical in hospital and all those who witnessed and were traumatised by the events from yesterday.\n\n\"This is where all of our focus should be,\" she said.\n\nThe Liverpool Region Mosque Network said the violent scenes were \"causing further fear and anxiety within our communities\".\n\nIt added: \"We must all unite and stand together against all forms of hate, violence and division.\"\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley said he was \"deeply concerned about reports of violent protests tonight\".\n\nHe said the protests involved \"people from outside our Southport community attacking our police and local people\".",

People from out of town just causing absolute mayhem.\n\n\"People in hoods climbing up lampposts, throwing bricks, they set a police car on fire.\n\n\"But none of those people were the people of Southport. The people of Southport are the ones here today cleaning the mess up.\n\n\"Those people from out of town - they came in in buses and cars and had a change of clothes. They just started to riot and do this.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items such as bricks towards the mosque in the seaside town at about 7.45pm.\n\nOfficers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them and police vehicles were damaged and set on fire.\n\nIn a post on social media, the force said shops had been \"broken into and looted\", adding that \"those responsible will be brought to justice\".\n\nElsie's mother, Jenni Stancombe, wrote on Facebook: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\n\n\"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nThe troubling scenes saw 27 officers taken to hospital, with 12 others being treated and discharged at the scene, North West Ambulance Service said.\n\nMerseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion.\n\nChief Constable Serena Kennedy said the officers injured in Tuesday's protests will \"now be unavailable for duty in what is an incredibly busy time for the force\".\n\nVideos posted on social media showed people throwing wheelie bins and bricks at officers who held riot shields to push the crowds back.\n\nThe chairman of Merseyside Police Federation, Chris McGlade, said more than 50 officers had been hurt in a \"sustained and vicious attack\".\n\nHe added: \"Police officers are not robots. We are mothers and fathers. Sons and daughters. Husbands, wives and partners.\n\n\"We should be going home at the end of our shifts. Not to hospital.\"\n\nThe violent protests followed hundreds of people taking part in a peaceful vigil for the stabbing victims outside Southport's Atkinson arts venue, with many in tears as they laid flowers and cards of remembrance.\n\nAs well as the three children who died, eight other youngsters suffered stab wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured, police said.\n\nThe vigil was followed by the protest outside the mosque as demonstrators chanted far-right slogans and clashed with police in St Luke's Road.\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley, speaking on Wednesday, said rioters must face the \"full force of the law\", saying they were \"utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children\".\n\nHe condemned \"beered-up thugs\" who threw bricks, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all.\"\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said rioters had \"hijacked\" a vigil for victims and will \"feel the full force of the law\", while Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", which she branded \"appalling\".\n\nThe suspect, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport, and a road in the area was cordoned off by detectives on Monday afternoon.\n\nPolice have said that although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.\n\nA 32-year-old man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possession of a flick knife in Eastbank Street, near where the vigil took place on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe was taken into custody and there were no reports that anyone was injured during the incident, Merseyside Police said.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

the community and would \"feel the full force of the law\".\n\nFamilies living nearby told the BBC they feared for their safety as stones flew past and police officers rushed to put on riot gear and pick up shields.\n\n\"I can't believe this is happening in Southport,\" one young woman shouted from the front of her car as she tried to drive her young daughter away.\n\nThe riot began after hundreds of protesters gathered near a local mosque attacking the front of it, throwing bricks, bottles, fireworks and rocks, many with hoods up and scarves hiding their faces.\n\nMerseyside Police said those behind the violence had been fired up by social media posts which incorrectly suggested an Islamist link to Monday's stabbings.\n\nThe Home Secretary Yvette Cooper had earlier warned about disinformation linked to the attack.\n\nThe suspect has no known links to Islam.\n\nCooper later said it was \"appalling\" that police officers in Southport were facing attacks from \"thugs on the streets who have no respect for a grieving community\".\n\n\"I think everyone should be showing some respect for the community that is grieving and also for the police who are pursuing an urgent criminal investigation now, and who showed such heroism and bravery yesterday in the face of these horrific attacks,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement on X, Merseyside Police and Crime Commissioner Emily Spurrell also said she was \"absolutely appalled by the disgraceful scenes of violence\".\n\n\"This is a community which has faced unimaginable tragedy, and it is grieving.\n\n\"Such behaviour is abhorrent and only causes further harm and suffering,\" she added.\n\nMerseyside Police chief constable Serena Kennedy posted on X that more than 1000 residents from Southport had come together at the vigil to remember the little girls who had died, those who were still critical in hospital and all those who witnessed and were traumatised by the events from yesterday.\n\n\"This is where all of our focus should be,\" she said.\n\nThe Liverpool Region Mosque Network said the violent scenes were \"causing further fear and anxiety within our communities\".\n\nIt added: \"We must all unite and stand together against all forms of hate, violence and division.\"\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley said he was \"deeply concerned about reports of violent protests tonight\".\n\nHe said the protests involved \"people from outside our Southport community attacking our police and local people\".", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

People from out of town just causing absolute mayhem.\n\n\"People in hoods climbing up lampposts, throwing bricks, they set a police car on fire.\n\n\"But none of those people were the people of Southport. The people of Southport are the ones here today cleaning the mess up.\n\n\"Those people from out of town - they came in in buses and cars and had a change of clothes. They just started to riot and do this.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items such as bricks towards the mosque in the seaside town at about 7.45pm.\n\nOfficers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them and police vehicles were damaged and set on fire.\n\nIn a post on social media, the force said shops had been \"broken into and looted\", adding that \"those responsible will be brought to justice\".\n\nElsie's mother, Jenni Stancombe, wrote on Facebook: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\n\n\"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nThe troubling scenes saw 27 officers taken to hospital, with 12 others being treated and discharged at the scene, North West Ambulance Service said.\n\nMerseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion.\n\nChief Constable Serena Kennedy said the officers injured in Tuesday's protests will \"now be unavailable for duty in what is an incredibly busy time for the force\".\n\nVideos posted on social media showed people throwing wheelie bins and bricks at officers who held riot shields to push the crowds back.\n\nThe chairman of Merseyside Police Federation, Chris McGlade, said more than 50 officers had been hurt in a \"sustained and vicious attack\".\n\nHe added: \"Police officers are not robots. We are mothers and fathers. Sons and daughters. Husbands, wives and partners.\n\n\"We should be going home at the end of our shifts. Not to hospital.\"\n\nThe violent protests followed hundreds of people taking part in a peaceful vigil for the stabbing victims outside Southport's Atkinson arts venue, with many in tears as they laid flowers and cards of remembrance.\n\nAs well as the three children who died, eight other youngsters suffered stab wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured, police said.\n\nThe vigil was followed by the protest outside the mosque as demonstrators chanted far-right slogans and clashed with police in St Luke's Road.\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley, speaking on Wednesday, said rioters must face the \"full force of the law\", saying they were \"utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children\".\n\nHe condemned \"beered-up thugs\" who threw bricks, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all.\"\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said rioters had \"hijacked\" a vigil for victims and will \"feel the full force of the law\", while Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", which she branded \"appalling\".\n\nThe suspect, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport, and a road in the area was cordoned off by detectives on Monday afternoon.\n\nPolice have said that although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.\n\nA 32-year-old man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possession of a flick knife in Eastbank Street, near where the vigil took place on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe was taken into custody and there were no reports that anyone was injured during the incident, Merseyside Police said.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki",

But a violent and islamophobic-charged protest took place outside a mosque, with bricks being thrown at police and towards the place of worship.\n\nNow Jenni Stancome, mother of seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, has taken to social media to make a powerful appeal for the violence to stop, the Liverpool Echo reported. Little Elsie was killed alongside nine-year-old Alice Aguiar and six-year-old Bebe King, as they enjoyed themselves at a Taylor Swift dance party in Hart Street on Monday lunchtime. Two adults and five other children are in critical conditions in hospital.\n\nWith Southport continuing to try to come to terms with this appalling tragedy, hundreds of people made their way to a vigil in the town centre yesterday evening, which was respectfully observed. However, nearby, trouble was brewing. Police raced to a disturbance taking place during a protest outside a mosque on St Luke's Road in the town.\n\nIn what have been described as 'sickening' scenes, dozens of officers were injured and a major incident declared. Bricks taken from garden walls were used to attack officers and cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire. Eight police officers sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion. Other officers suffered head injuries and serious facial injuries. One was knocked unconscious.\n\nThe violence started when a large group of people, who police said are believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road on Tuesday evening. Cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire and bricks were thrown at a local mosque. Damage was also caused to a local convenience store and wheelie bins were set on fire, police said. Three police dogs have also been injured. Photos and videos shared online show large groups hurling rocks at police officers, climbing on police vans and attempting to smash the vehicles' windows.\n\nThe violence has been widely condemned - including by the Prime Minister and Home Secretary - but there will be no more powerful voice in this than of the mother of one of the three little girls so tragically killed in Southport on Monday. In a message widely shared on social media, Jenni Stancombe said: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\"\n\nSpeaking about the police, Ms Stancombe added: \"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\" Last night, Merseyside Police assistant chief constable Alex Goss said: \"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\n\n\"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support. Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park.\"\n\nPrime Minister SIr Keir Starmer said : \"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and our respect. Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_thorp@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Liam Thorp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "benjamin_roberts_haslam@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Benjamin Roberts-Haslam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alex_croft@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Alex Croft", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Echo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool Echo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Wales Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assistant chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33363380.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Southport-incident.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Merseyside Police said 22 of its officers were injured after clashes broke out in the seaside town, near the scene where three girls were killed in a horrific knife rampage on Monday. The Prime Minister and Home Secretary joined police chiefs in condemning the 'sickening' violence, which started barely an hour after thousands of mourners had gathered for a vigil to remember the victims who lost their lives.\n\nTributes have poured in for the three girls killed who police yesterday named as six-year-old Bebe King (Pictured right), seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe (pictured center) and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar (pictured left). Eight other children suffered stab wounds at the Taylor Swift -themed summer holiday dance workshop. Five are in a critical condition, alongside two women who were also critically injured as they bravely tried to save the children. Just yards away from the emotional vigil, a 32-year-old man, dressed in all black with a hat on the joint-hottest day of the year, was separately arrested after being caught carrying a flick knife on Eastbank Street at 6.55pm. On nearby St Luke's Street, rioters chanting 'English till I die' surrounded the Southport Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre and began hurling rubble at police officers who had formed a protective line around the building.\n\nThe violence appears to have been fuelled by false claims online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat. The 17-year-old boy, who remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder, is originally from Cardiff but now lives in the nearby Lancashire village of Banks. Merseyside Police has issued a warning over an 'incorrect' name being widely circulated online, adding: 'We would urge people not to speculate on details of the incident while the investigation is ongoing.' The angry mob - who police 'believed to be supporters of the English Defence League' - started targeting the Muslim place of worship at around 7.45pm. Eight police officers suffered serious injuries, including one who was knocked unconscious. Protesters also torched cars and wheelie bins belonging to members of the public, shattered the mosque windows with bricks and looted shops.\n\nOne Southport resident living near the mosque told how he, his partner and their young daughter fled for the evening, not wanting her to see the sickening violence. The man said: 'We just couldn't stay while this was going on and allow our daughter to witness it. 'This doesn't represent Southport - they're EDL thugs who are from Manchester and Liverpool who have just come here to cause trouble. They have no respect for a town that's grieving.' The Prime Minister said rioters had 'hijacked' a vigil for victims and would 'feel the full force of the law'. Writing on X, Sir Keir said: 'The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. 'They deserve our support and our respect. Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves.' Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said 'scenes of thuggery' on the streets of Southport 'bear no relation' to the community which had been coming together. She told broadcasters: 'I think everyone should be showing some respect for the community that is grieving and also for the police who are pursuing an urgent criminal investigation now, and who showed such heroism and bravery yesterday in the face of these horrific attacks. 'I think everyone needs to support the police in that work, and frankly the scenes of thuggery that we have seen on the streets of Southport this evening bear no relation to the way in which the Southport community has been coming together to support each other and to support grieving families. 'We need to see some respect for the grieving community and for the police in their urgent work.'\n\nPolice have introduced a 24-hour Section 60 Order in the area where the riots took place and extra officers will remain in the area. Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: 'Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.' He added: 'Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park. 'This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.' Local mosque groups condemned the violence aimed towards Muslims, adding: 'W e must not let those who seek to divide us and spread hatred use this as an opportunity.' And Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool city region, wrote: 'There are families just coming to terms with yesterday's events, parents grieving for their murdered children and survivors still trying to process what they witnessed. 'The violent scenes in Southport tonight will only further traumatise a community that is already struggling to come to terms with this attack. 'Mindless violence directed at the very people who ran towards the danger yesterday, and outright Islamaphobia, only distract from the work of delivering justice. 'The real story tonight is of the thousands who gathered at the vigil in Southport in memory of Bebe, Elsie and Alice. For the sake of their loved ones, this disorder needs to stop so the police do their jobs.'\n\nPolice said that a number of officers were injured, while cars were set alight and shops were broken into and looted during the disorder. In a desperate bid to protect themselves, officers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them. One officer has suffered a suspected broken nose and police vehicles have been damaged and set on fire as around 400 people gathered to watch. The three girls who died were among 11 children stabbed during a 'ferocious' knife attack which left mothers picking up their children screaming in horror. Five further children, aged between six and 11, are in a critical condition alongside two female adults, among them hero yoga teacher Leanne Lucas, who 'bravely tried to protect them'. One source told The Sun that she needed an eight-hour operation and remains seriously ill in hospital. Dance tutor Heidi Liddle and window cleaner Joel Verite have also been hailed for their bravery during the attack. As thousands of mourners attended an emotional vigil in Southport on Tuesday evening, protests broke out on the streets surrounding Hart Street, where the attack took place. Furious demonstrators tore down garden walls to use as missiles to pelt at police, with wheelie bins also thrown during the mayhem. A police van was set on fire by protesters. Angry mobs chanted 'Stop the boats' and kicked out at police vans sent to restore order. Some threw smoke bombs, with men wearing caps and shorts charging at outnumbered police.\n\nScores of riot vans and patrol cars raced to the scene as a police helicopter hovered overhead as the violence spread out of control. Huge crowds of men, many masked and wearing hoodies, were seen clashing with police - as stones, bottles, bricks and fireworks were launched. Demonstrators could be heard shouting 'No surrender' and 'English till I die'. One police officer was seen being helped into a van by his colleagues with blood streaming down his face and a heavily bandaged head. A female officer was also seen with a cut cheek. By 8pm, around 500 rioters had massed in two streets outside the mosque - Sussex Road and St Luke's Road - trapping around 40 police officers in the middle. Missiles were hurled at riot officers and dog handlers from both sides. Bottles, bricks, fireworks and lumps of concrete were thrown to cheers from the rioters, who goaded police and eyes each other on. At about 8.15pm a crowd surrounded three riot vans and began rocking one to try and flip it over. Moments later a small explosion was heard and a mini-fireball erupted in the air as the van went up in flames. One man shouted: 'We're doing this for our girls!' as officers drove the other vans away from the fire to stop them also being set alight. In a desperate attempt to quell the disorder, a charge from riot police brandishing batons sent around 300 of the rioters fleeing down the street as reinforcements flooded the area. But violence continued into the night, with rioters forming a burning barricade of wheelie bins as they hurled bricks and lumps of concrete at riot police.\n\nMobs chanting 'save our girls' clashed with police until 10.30pm outside the Southport Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre. A nearby corner shop looked to have been broken into and looted. Rioters set alight at least five wheelie bins in the middle of Sussex Road sending flames and toxic black plumes of smoke shooting up into the night's sky. With officers unable to charge due to the burning barricade, a volley of missiles was hurled from behind the makeshift bonfire. At one point the ferocity of the violence sent the line of police retreating slightly. Officers in a Merseyside Police helicopter continued to monitor events from the air. The crowd began to thin out around 11pm with reports of disturbances - including cars being torched - breaking out across Southport. During the demonstration, several people carried placards with slogans about stopping the boats. One read: 'Stop the boats! Send them back! Fight for our kids! Let's stand together! One woman carrying a placard said the disorder was because the knife man who attacked the children 'was a Muslim.' She said: 'We are saying enough is enough. Why are they not stopping the migrants coming in? 'How many more children will be killed because they are letting them all in? They should be at the borders stopping them.'\n\nHer comments came after inaccurate posts by social media sleuths about the identity of the perpetrator have received millions of views and engagements. Sunder Katwala, director of the think-tank British Future, said a bogus news channel seemed to have invented a fake name for the suspect and run a false story that was shared online. Assistant Chief Constable Goss said: 'There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets. 'We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time. 'It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.' Also on Tuesday evening, officers were called to reports of a man carrying a weapon at around 6.50pm, during which time the vigil was taking place at the Atkinson venue. Police swooped on the scene and detained the man minutes later before seizing the flick knife. A 32-year-old man dressed in all black, from Standish, was arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article, and taken into custody. There were no reports of any injuries during the incident.\n\nDetective Inspector Gavin Mulcahy said: 'We know too well the devastating impact knife crime can have for victims, their families and friends, and those who carry them. 'This week has seen an unspeakable tragedy unfold in Southport, and this incident occurred a short distance from where a vigil had been happening where the community was paying their respects to all those affected. 'Officers made a swift arrest and have seized a knife that could have been used to cause harm in our communities. 'Those offenders who carry them have no place whatsoever in our communities. 'Every day we are carrying out stop checks, warrants and land searches to take knives off our streets, but as this incident shows, the assistance of members of the public in telling us where they are stored and who is carrying them is vital to ensure the safety of families and residents.' At the vigil, tearful locals laid flowers outside the Merseyside town's grand Atkinson building after falling silent to remember Bebe, Elsie and nine-year-old Alice. In the first week of the summer holidays, the seaside town should be bustling with happy families and tourists. But at 6pm on Tuesday, more than 5,000 people stood in silence outside the Atkinson building amid an outpouring of grief and shock. In front of the Grade II-listed building, which comprises a theatre, museum and library, is the Town Hall Gardens, where a sea of floral tributes built up. One heartbreaking poster surrounded by candles and flowers said 'never stop dancing'. The children had been enjoying a summer holiday dance workshop when a knifeman entered the studio and launched a frenzied attack. Among the bouquets, there were also a number of Taylor Swift-style friendship bracelets. 'Thinking of you all,' a row of four of them spelt out.\n\nAhead of the vigil, the families and schools of the innocent girls who were fatally attacked by a crazed knifeman also released tributes. In a statement, Bebe's family said: 'No words can describe the devastation that has hit our family as try to deal with the loss of our little girl Bebe.' The family of Alice Dasilva Aguiar added: 'Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our Princess, like we said before to you, you're always our princess and no one would change that. Love from Your Hero Daddy and Mummy.' And the headteacher of Farnborough Road Infant School said they were 'heartbroken and devastated' by the death of pupil Elsie. Jennifer Sephton said: 'Elsie has been a loving and bright member of our wonderful community since first being brought here on her father's shoulders, and even at her early age she was such a caring and charismatic young lady who loved to please. 'Elsie was a kind and caring friend to all who met her and was adored by everyone in our community. Our hearts and most deeply-felt sympathies go out to Elsie's family, friends and our Farnborough community who have been left numb by what has happened. 'It is immensely difficult to put into words how amazing Elsie was and the impact she had on those around her. We will miss you dearly Elsie. You were one of a kind.'\n\nAlder Hey Children's hospital this afternoon released a statement confirming that seven children had been taken to the site for treatment. One of those was Alice, and of the others, two remain in a critical condition, a spokesperson said. The head of the school trust attended by Alice and Bebe said the girls 'will be in our hearts forever'. Endeavour Learning Trust chief executive David Clayton said 'no words can do justice to what has happened here in Southport. The trust contains Churchtown Primary School in Southport, which Alice and Bebe had both attended. Churchtown Primary headteacher Jinnie Payne said the school had heard the 'tragic news' with 'great sadness', describing the stabbings as an 'atrocity'. In a statement, Mr Clayton said: 'No words can do justice to what has happened here in Southport - and our hearts are broken for the families who have lost their children. 'No one should ever have to experience horror like this. 'Our immediate focus now is on providing support to the community as we start to understand what has happened. The death of a child is always a desperate tragedy for a school, and particularly so under such circumstances. 'We will come together as a community, offering each other support and care as we work through this difficult time. 'Alice and Bebe will be in our hearts forever.' Ms Payne said Alice, a Year 4 pupil at Churchtown, was the 'happiest of souls, a true ray of sunshine'.\n\nThe Churchtown Primary headteacher added: 'She was known and loved by everyone in our school community of 700 children, a testament to her unique ability to connect with others. 'Alice's radiant smile brightened our days, and she embraced every aspect of school life with enthusiasm and joy. 'Her kindness, playful nature, and zest for trying new things will forever be remembered. Alice, you will always hold a special place in our hearts at Churchtown.' Ms Payne said Bebe, a former pupil at the school, was a 'joyful girl' whose 'kindness radiated through the entire Churchtown community'. The headteacher added: 'During her time at the school, Bebe's considerate nature and her love of learning shone through in everything that she did. 'Each day, she would come into school ready to grasp every opportunity available to her and fun and laughter were never far away whenever Bebe was involved. 'Her considerate nature meant that she had many friends and she always ensured all children felt included, whether that was through play or working together in the classroom. 'Bebe's memory will live on in the hearts of all who knew her.' The headteacher added: 'We know that a number of other children from Churchtown were also involved in the attack, along with much-loved colleagues. 'We extend our heartfelt wishes to all those families affected by this horrific incident, including those currently in hospital or continuing to receive treatment.' Devastated relatives of Alice said she had been taken by a 'despicable human being.'\n\nHer mother Alexandra Aguiar is understood to be originally from Caracas in Venezuela and her dad David Aguiar is from the Portuguese island of Madeira. Relative Carina Aguiar, a hotel worker who lives in Camara de Lobos in Madeira, posted a link on her social media to news Merseyside Police had confirmed a third child' had died following the attack and wrote tear emojis beside it. Earlier she posted a photo of a black ribbon on her Facebook alongside Alice's name after writing in an emotional tribute: 'Princess Alice. In this moment of great pain my soul hurts, my body hurts, my mind hurts. I have a lump in my throat. 'You were just an innocent child, a happy smiley girl with a bright life ahead of you which a despicable human being took away from you, without pity, for no reason.' Reacting to the riots, Merseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy posted on X: 'I am incredibly proud of my officers and staff who have worked so hard to save the lives of children, investigate the horrific incident from yesterday, working with partners to provide reassurance to our communities and now they are facing this level of violence from these thugs 'Over 1000 residents from Southport came together this evening to remember the little girls who have died, those who are still critical in hospital and all those who witnessed & are traumatised by the events from yesterday. This is where all of our focus should be.'\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley said: 'It's distressing to see people from outside our Southport community attacking our police and local people. 'I want to make it clear that I fully condemn any attack on our emergency services, these are the same services that responded to the tragic attack yesterday. 'I appeal to local people to avoid the area and stay safe, to allow the police to do their job.' Mr Hurley continued: 'I want to thank our community for pulling together and supporting every person who has been affected by Monday's tragic attack. 'Nowhere was this more evident than the solidarity, remembrance and sympathy heard at today's vigil. 'To those who laid flowers, candles, toys, thank you. I was deeply saddened to hear the news today of the death or a third child. Bebe, Elsie and Alice are in all of our thoughts and hearts today.' The Southport Mosque said it was 'truly shocked and saddened to hear about the events that unfolded today'. They added: 'We extend our deepest sympathy to the families of all affected. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all.' The Liverpool Region Mosque Network said it was 'shocked and horrified' by the knife rampage on Monday. But it added: 'A minority of people are attempting to portray that this inhumane act is somehow related to the Muslim community. Frankly it is not, and we must not let those who seek to divide us and spread hatred use this as an opportunity.\n\n'This evening, we have seen distressing scenes outside Southport Mosque with angry protesters, gathering outside. This is causing further fear and anxiety within our communities. We must all unite and stand together against all forms of hate, violence and division.' And the The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) condemned 'shocking scenes of far-right rioters running amok outside a mosque'. The MCB says Islamaphobic backlash began with a false rumour on the internet which was then stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims. MCB secretary-general Zara Mohammed said: 'At a time of great tragedy, loss, and mourning, we must stand firm against the cynical forces of hatred and division. This does not represent our diverse Britain and the people of Southport. 'The Government must address the increasing rise of violent far-right extremism targeting Muslim communities. More must be done to tackle Islamophobia and offer reassurance at this time.' She added: 'We commend the authorities for their swift action, and our prayers are with the mosque, the families of the victims of yesterday's attack, and the local community.' Downing Street also warned against 'unhelpful' speculation amid concerns that misreporting online could inflame community tensions. Officers should be given the space to probe the case without people guessing at the possible motive or circumstances, No 10 said. Earlier on Tuesday, the Prime Minister was repeatedly asked 'how many more children will die?' as he placed flowers at the scene of the attack.\n\nSir Keir's brief visit, which lasted around two minutes, was interrupted by some members of the public heckling him. As the Prime Minister walked past, one man declared: 'Here's your photo opportunity.' Another shouted: 'How many more children? Our kids are dead and you're leaving already?' Other furious onlookers shouted 'scumbag', 'time for change' and 'go away, you're not wanted'. Another woman said: 'I've just found out my friend's nine-year-old daughter was killed, the person I've held as a child, and you can't do s***.' And a different man shouted: 'Get the truth out!' Ms Cooper has said social media companies 'need to take some responsibility' for some activity in the aftermath of the attack. Responding to shadow home secretary James Cleverly, she said: 'I agree with him too about the responsibility on every one of us. The police do need to be able to pursue this investigation. 'There will be wider questions for other days, but the most important thing is that every one of us supports the police in their investigation now. 'I agree with him too about the responsibility on social media companies, because we do need to recognise there are things that are taking place on social media that go against their terms and conditions, and their commitments as well. They need to take some responsibility for that. 'Above all, this is about young children. This is about children and their families who will be grieving, and the many other children who were involved yesterday who will be facing great trauma as well.'\n\nHer counterpart Mr Cleverly called for people not to 'get involved in the grief of others' by sharing misinformation relating to the Southport attack on social media. 'Enough people are already distressed without their distress being amplified by speculation and gossip online,' he added. Ahead of fears mounting over a far-right rally, Sir Keir's official spokesman said: 'Of course, people should listen the police, they should not do anything that is going to make the police's job harder to manage the situation, to conduct their investigations. 'It is unhelpful to speculate on things like the motive and the circumstance around this.' Police have said that, although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Police were initially called to St Luke's Road after a nearby mosque was targeted following a vigil.\n\nThe North West Ambulance Service declared a major incident as the chaotic scenes unfolded, with 27 police officers taken to hospital from the scene. 39 police officers in total were injured.\n\nREAD NEXT: Riot police subjected to relentless and 'sickening' attack with vans set alight in night of chaos in Southport\n\nIn a statement on X in the early hours of this morning, the service said: \"We treated 39 patients in total, all of which were police officers. 27 were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose, and a concussion. Other officers suffered head injuries, and serious facial injuries, and one was knocked unconscious.\n\nThree police dogs were also injured in the chaos, with Zoe and Ike suffering leg injuries from bricks thrown at them. A third dog, Quga - who was bitten, strangled and kicked by an offender at the beginning of this month - suffered burns to her back leg, the force said.\n\nMerseyside Police said some of those involved in the riots were believed to be supporters of the English Defence League. Officers were first called to the scene after crowds began hurling various items towards the mosque.\n\nCrowds grew in number and violent scenes escalated, leaving officers outnumbered. Worshippers were also said to be inside the mosque when flames began climbing up the building's fence.\n\nRiot vans and officers swarmed the area amid chants of \"No surrender\" and \"English till I die\" from sections of the crowd. Hundreds of youths and men continued to gather in streets surrounding Hart Street, where the fatal attack took place.\n\nFirecrackers were set off, as wheelie bins, bricks and glass bottles were launched at officers, clad in body armour, before a police van was set alight. Huge plumes of smoke could be seen billowing overhead above the escalating scenes of violence.\n\nA 24-hour Section 60 Order was introduced in the area running from 7.54pm on Tuesday, which gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals and is designed to minimise serious violence. A Section 34 Order has also been introduced, giving police the power to direct people engaging in antisocial behaviour or are likely to become involved in such incidents.\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Goss, said: \"Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\n\n\"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support. Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the mosque car park.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister said rioters will 'feel the full force of the law'. Writing on X, Sir Keir Starmer said: \"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and our respect.\n\n\"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law.\"\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said Islamaphobic backlash began with a false rumour on the internet which was then stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims. The MCB paid tribute to the three young girls killed in Southport on Monday, before condemning 'shocking scenes of far-right rioters running amok outside a mosque'.\n\nThe rioting followed the stabbing of a number of children and adults at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party on Monday morning. Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, all died in the horror attack after a knifeman began targeting young children enjoying the music event.\n\nEight other children were also stabbed, with five children and two adults left in a critical condition. A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder.\n\nRead more of today's top stories here", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashlie_blakey@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Ashlie Blakey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Van"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Ambulance_Service", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North West Ambulance Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_and_search", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stop and search"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_armor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body armor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_van", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police van"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-social behaviour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Council_of_Britain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslim Council of Britain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Wales Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29646576.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Police-dealing-with-trouble-on-St-Lukess-RoadSouthport.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Eight other children suffered stab wounds and five are still in a critical condition in hospital, along with two adults who were also critically injured.\n\nHundreds of people took part in a peaceful vigil to remember the young victims outside a town art centre. But a separate protest outside a nearby mosque erupted into violence as far-right thugs clashed with police, throwing bricks and setting vehicles on fire.\n\nMerseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items towards the mosque at around 7.45pm, leading to violent clashes where 22 officers were hurt. The force said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion.\n\nIn a statement on X, the Prime Minister said the rioters had \"insulted the community as it grieves\". He said: \"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and our respect.\n\n\"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper, who visited the town yesterday to meet officers and emergency service workers, also condemned the violence. Speaking last night, she said: \"These disgraceful scenes of violence and disorder we are witnessing this evening, with attacks on the Merseyside Police and a local mosque, are completely appalling. Those responsible will face the full force of the law.\n\n\"The community of Southport are reeling from a horrifying ordeal and families are grieving. This violent thuggery, which has overshadowed a peaceful vigil for three little girls, is an insult to the community and to all those who need the space to process what has happened and to heal.\n\n\"It is appalling that the local police, who have already dealt with extraordinarily difficult circumstances this week, and are undertaking an urgent criminal investigation, should be on the receiving end of violence and abuse. Our focus must remain on supporting the police in their urgent criminal investigation into yesterday's attack and on supporting the families and community who have faced such tragedy and deserve everyone's prayers tonight.\"\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"The actions in Southport tonight will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.

People from out of town just causing absolute mayhem.\n\n\"People in hoods climbing up lampposts, throwing bricks, they set a police car on fire.\n\n\"But none of those people were the people of Southport. The people of Southport are the ones here today cleaning the mess up.\n\n\"Those people from out of town - they came in in buses and cars and had a change of clothes. They just started to riot and do this.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items such as bricks towards the mosque in the seaside town at about 7.45pm.\n\nScotland's former first minister Humza Yousaf called for the EDL to be banned under terror laws in the wake of the unrest, despite former leader Tommy Robinson's insistence that the group no longer exists.\n\nOfficers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them and police vehicles were damaged and set on fire.\n\nIn a post on social media, the force said shops had been \"broken into and looted\", adding that \"those responsible will be brought to justice\".\n\nElsie's mother, Jenni Stancombe, wrote on Facebook: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\n\n\"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nThe troubling scenes saw 27 officers taken to hospital, with 12 others being treated and discharged at the scene, North West Ambulance Service said.\n\nMerseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion.\n\nChief Constable Serena Kennedy said the officers injured in Tuesday's protests will \"now be unavailable for duty in what is an incredibly busy time for the force\".\n\nVideos posted on social media showed people throwing wheelie bins and bricks at officers who held riot shields to push the crowds back.\n\nThe chairman of Merseyside Police Federation, Chris McGlade, said more than 50 officers had been hurt in a \"sustained and vicious attack\".\n\nHe added: \"Police officers are not robots. We are mothers and fathers. Sons and daughters. Husbands, wives and partners.\n\n\"We should be going home at the end of our shifts. Not to hospital.\"\n\nThe violent protests followed hundreds of people taking part in a peaceful vigil for the stabbing victims outside Southport's Atkinson arts venue, with many in tears as they laid flowers and cards of remembrance.\n\nAs well as the three children who died, eight other youngsters suffered stab wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured, police said.\n\nThe vigil was followed by the protest outside the mosque as demonstrators chanted far-right slogans and clashed with police in St Luke's Road.\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley, speaking on Wednesday, said rioters must face the \"full force of the law\", saying they were \"utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children\".\n\nHe condemned \"beered-up thugs\" who threw bricks, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all.\"\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said rioters had \"hijacked\" a vigil for victims and will \"feel the full force of the law\", while Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", which she branded \"appalling\".\n\nThe suspect, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport, and a road in the area was cordoned off by detectives on Monday afternoon.\n\nPolice have said that although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.\n\nA 32-year-old man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possession of a flick knife in Eastbank Street, near where the vigil took place on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe was taken into custody and there were no reports that anyone was injured during the incident, Merseyside Police said.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki",

A witness living nearby said: \"A man knocked on our door screaming for help, his head was split open and pouring with blood. He was asking for a towel to help stop the blood. Someone had thrown a brick towards police and it hit him in the face. It was terrifying, my young child was stood behind me and seen it.\"\n\nREAD MORE - Names and photos of all three Southport stabbing victims aged 6, 7 and 9 released by Merseyside Police\n\nREAD MORE - Chilling moment masked man paces outside Southport home minutes before mass stabbing\n\nAn angry mob of men, many of them masked, clashed with officers outside the mosque as more armed police arrived. Some officers were injured in the chaos, including one female officer seen with blood running down her face, and the building is thought to have had its windows smashed, with rioters having thrown stones, bottles and bricks.\n\nPolice have also reportedly made an arrest after a balaclava-clad man was spotted carrying a knife in Southport town centre just moment from the vigil. Eyewitnesses described seeing a balaclava-clad man being apprehended by police and arrested after showing a flick knife in public. One local person wrote on Facebook: \"Flicking the knife in front of us, the stupid man!\"\n\nMerseyside Police this evening condemned the violence. A statement from the force read: \"We can confirm officers are dealing with a disturbance during a protest in Southport this evening . At around 7.45pm, a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League - began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road in Southport.\n\n\"Officers who are deployed are currently dealing with criminal behaviour and violence with bottles and wheelie bins being thrown at them. As a result, an officer has suffered a suspected broken nose and police vehicles have been damaged and set alight. Additional patrols are now in attendance, including the Dog Section.\"\n\nWhile Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss added: \"It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives. In the last 24 hours, we have seen overwhelming support and sympathy from the community and wider Merseyside communities for the families who are currently trying to deal with their loss and care for victims injured during the major incident.\n\n\"Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face. Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavour to prevent disorder.\n\n\"The actions in Southport tonight will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside. There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time. Our officers should not have to face this, but we will be there tonight to ensure the safety of the local community who have suffered enough, and will arrest those involved in criminal behaviour.\"\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

I would love to make it better but there's nothing I can do about it.\n\n\"But I would like to thank them for their support because at one point we thought they [the rioters] were coming in and they were going to burn the place down.\"\n\nMr Hussein said the Muslim community still felt vulnerable and that the mosque was open, adding: \"I will pray for the whole of Southport, I will pray for the victims of the awful attack on Monday, I will pray for the police and I will pray for the whole community to stay as beautiful as it has always been.\"\n\nHe described the attack on the dance class as \"absolutely heartbreaking\".\n\nLocals have brought flowers to the mosque and are helping organise repairs to the building, which Mr Hussein said was \"humbling\".\n\nThe Southport community has also been rallying around a shop owner whose store was looted during the disorder on Tuesday night, he said.\n\nChanaka Balasuryla said he called 999 after spotting men trying to smash their way in on the CCTV camera from his home five minutes away.\n\nHe was \"terrified\" when he thought they would set fire to the premises because there is a woman and her daughter living in a flat above.\n\nHe added he later found out that the woman confronted the raiders, telling them it was her shop in an attempt to stop them.\n\n\"I got a couple of hours' sleep and then got a phone call saying 'You need to come down, there's lots of people waiting to help',\" Mr Balasuryla said.\n\n\"It was terrifying last night [but] I feel safe again because people are here to protect us.\"\n\nEven children have been involved in repairing the streets by sweeping the debris away. Locals have come together as they hope to restore a sense of community.\n\nVolunteers came out to the junction of Sussex Road and St Luke's Road partly in response to a social media plea Mr Wallis put out.\n\nHe said: \"It's horrendous what those hooligans have done last night.\n\n\"It was like a war scene. People from out of town just causing absolute mayhem.\n\n\"People in hoods climbing up lampposts, throwing bricks, they set a police car on fire.\n\n\"But none of those people were the people of Southport. The people of Southport are the ones here today cleaning the mess up.\n\n\"Those people from out of town - they came in in buses and cars and had a change of clothes. They just started to riot and do this.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items such as bricks towards the mosque in the seaside town at about 7.45pm.\n\nScotland's former first minister Humza Yousaf called for the EDL to be banned under terror laws in the wake of the unrest, despite former leader Tommy Robinson's insistence that the group no longer exists.\n\nOfficers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them and police vehicles were damaged and set on fire.\n\nIn a post on social media, the force said shops had been \"broken into and looted\", adding that \"those responsible will be brought to justice\".\n\nElsie's mother, Jenni Stancombe, wrote on Facebook: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\n\n\"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nThe troubling scenes saw 27 officers taken to hospital, with 12 others being treated and discharged at the scene, North West Ambulance Service said.\n\nMerseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion.\n\nChief Constable Serena Kennedy said the officers injured in Tuesday's protests will \"now be unavailable for duty in what is an incredibly busy time for the force\".\n\nVideos posted on social media showed people throwing wheelie bins and bricks at officers who held riot shields to push the crowds back.\n\nThe chairman of Merseyside Police Federation, Chris McGlade, said more than 50 officers had been hurt in a \"sustained and vicious attack\".\n\nHe added: \"Police officers are not robots. We are mothers and fathers. Sons and daughters. Husbands, wives and partners.\n\n\"We should be going home at the end of our shifts. Not to hospital.\"\n\nThe violent protests followed hundreds of people taking part in a peaceful vigil for the stabbing victims outside Southport's Atkinson arts venue, with many in tears as they laid flowers and cards of remembrance.\n\nAs well as the three children who died, eight other youngsters suffered stab wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured, police said.\n\nThe vigil was followed by the protest outside the mosque as demonstrators chanted far-right slogans and clashed with police in St Luke's Road.\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley, speaking on Wednesday, said rioters must face the \"full force of the law\", saying they were \"utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children\".\n\nHe condemned \"beered-up thugs\" who threw bricks, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all.\"\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said rioters had \"hijacked\" a vigil for victims and will \"feel the full force of the law\", while Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", which she branded \"appalling\".\n\nThe suspect, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport, and a road in the area was cordoned off by detectives on Monday afternoon.\n\nPolice have said that although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.\n\nA 32-year-old man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possession of a flick knife in Eastbank Street, near where the vigil took place on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe was taken into custody and there were no reports that anyone was injured during the incident, Merseyside Police said.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/0f0c15332b4201063f2eaadce937d2da", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,\" said Merseyside Police assistant chief constable Alex Goss.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said that one officer had suffered from a suspected broken nose during the protest on Tuesday night, while a 32-year-old man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article.\n\n\"A

recovered.\n\n\"There are no reports anyone was injured during the incident.\n\n\"A 32-year-old man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article, and taken into custody.\"\n\nHome secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the \"thuggery\" and violent clashes in Southport, urging everyone to \"show some respect for the community that is grieving\".\n\nShe said: \"I think everyone should be showing some respect for the community that is grieving and also for the police who are pursuing an urgent criminal investigation now, and who showed such heroism and bravery yesterday in the face of these horrific attacks.\n\n\"I think everyone needs to support the police in that work, and frankly the scenes of thuggery that we have seen on the streets of Southport this evening bear no relation to the way in which the Southport community has been coming together to support each other and to support grieving families.\n\n\"We need to see some respect for the grieving

People from out of town just causing absolute mayhem.\n\n\"People in hoods climbing up lampposts, throwing bricks, they set a police car on fire.\n\n\"But none of those people were the people of Southport.

We are mothers and fathers. Sons and daughters. Husbands, wives and partners.\n\n\"We should be going home at the end of our shifts. Not to hospital.\"\n\nA police van set alight as trouble flares during a protest in Southport (Pat Hurst/PA)\n\nThe violent protests followed hundreds of people taking part in a peaceful vigil for the stabbing victims outside Southport's Atkinson arts venue, with many in tears as they laid flowers and cards of remembrance.\n\nAs well as the three children who died, eight other youngsters suffered stab wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured, police said.\n\nThe vigil was followed by the protest outside the mosque as demonstrators chanted far-right slogans and clashed with police in St Luke's Road.\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley, speaking on Wednesday, said rioters must face the \"full force of the law\", saying they were \"utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children\".\n\nHe condemned \"beered-up thugs\" who threw bricks, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all.\"\n\nMembers of the public take part in a vigil near the scene of the attack in Hart Street, Southport (James Speakman/PA)\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said rioters had \"hijacked\" a vigil for victims and will \"feel the full force of the law\", while Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", which she branded \"appalling\".\n\nThe suspect, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport, and a road in the area was cordoned off by detectives on Monday afternoon.\n\nPolice have said that although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.\n\nA 32-year-old man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possession of a flick knife in Eastbank Street, near where the vigil took place on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe was taken into custody and there were no reports that anyone was injured during the incident, Merseyside

I want to thank our community for pulling together and supporting every person who has been affected by Monday's tragic attack.\"\n\nHe also thanked those who attended the vigil to remember the three children who were killed in the attack, and the 10 other people who were injured.\n\n\"I was deeply saddened to hear the news today of the death of a third child. Bebe, Elsie and Alice are in all of our thoughts and hearts today,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a man \"wearing a balaclava\" and carrying a knife was arrested in Southport just yards from the vigil.\n\nMerseyside Police confirmed they had arrested a 32-year-old on suspicion of possessing a bladed article - while the force's Detective Inspector condemned knife crime in the aftermath of the \"swift arrest\".\n\nA police statement said: \"We have arrested a man and seized a flick knife following an incident in Southport this evening.\n\n\"A report was received at 6.50pm that a man had been seen with a knife on Eastbank Street. Officers attended and a man was detained at around 6.55pm, and a flick knife recovered. There are no reports anyone was injured during the incident.\n\n\"A 32-year-old man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article, and taken into custody.\"\n\nIt comes as Bebe and Elsie, aged six and seven, were identified as the first victims in the attack just before midday.\n\nHeartbroken friends and family then paid tribute to Alice, saying she was killed by a \"despicable human being\".\n\nA 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart

Some protesters are heard spouting Islamophobic chants.\n\nAt least eight officers suffered serious injuries, fractures, lacerations and concussion. At least one was knocked unconscious, Merseyside Police said.\n\nThree police dogs were also injured, one sustaining leg injuries from thrown bricks and another suffering burns to its back legs.\n\nThe disorder prompted authorities to issue a 24-hour Section 60 Order, which gives officers enhanced stop and search powers in the designated area.\n\nThe cause of the revolt was not entirely clear, but Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss suggested in a statement that it was in connection to \"speculation and hypothesis\" surrounding the 17-year-old boy police arrested on suspicion of being responsible for Monday's knife attack.\n\nThe three children stabbed to death in Southport a day prior while attending a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop have been identified as 9-year-old Alice Aguiar, 7-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and 6-year-old Bebe King. Five other children and two adults were also critically injured in the attack.\n\nPolice arrested the 17-year-old from Lancashire, Britain, who has been charged with suspicion of murder and attempted murder charges.\n\nGoss reiterated Tuesday: \"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the U.K. and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nHe added that many of those involved in the Tuesday violence do not live in the area \"or care about the people of Merseyside.\"\n\n\"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport,\" Goss said in an early Wednesday update.\n\n\"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nThe violence erupted after a vigil was held in the town for the children that was attended by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Prime Minister Keir Starmer who lay flowers during the ceremony.\n\nStarmer accused the protesters of having \"hijacked\" the vigil \"with violence and thuggery\" that insults the community in grieving.\n\n\"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and respect,\" he said in a statement, vowing that those responsible for the violence that followed the vigil \"will feel the full force of the law.\"", "source": {"uri":

A major incident was declared by North West Ambulance Service as a 'high number of resources' including 10 ambulances, on-call doctors, and a hazardous area response team (HART) attended the scene on St Luke's Road.\n\nA statement on X said: \"We treated 39 patients in total, all of which were police officers. 27 were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Southport protest sees 'sickening' scenes as police officer hurt and van on fire\n\nMerseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose, and a concussion. Other officers suffered head injuries, and serious facial injuries, and one was knocked unconscious.\n\nThree police dogs were also injured in the chaos, with Zoe and Ike suffering leg injuries from bricks thrown at them. A third dog, Quga - who was bitten, strangled and kicked by an offender at the beginning of this month - suffered burns to her back leg, the force said.\n\nMerseyside Police said those involved in the unrest - who they believe included supporters of the English Defence League - set alight cars belonging to members of the public, threw bricks at the local mosque, damaged a local convenience store, and set wheelie bins on fire. Extra police will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities.\n\nA 24-hour Section 60 Order was introduced in the area running from 7.54pm on Tuesday, which gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals and is designed to minimise serious violence. A Section 34 Order has also been introduced, giving police the power to direct people engaging in antisocial behaviour or are likely to become involved in such incidents.\n\nMerseyside police said these powers would not be used for anyone visiting the area and going about their daily business. Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Goss, said: \"Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\n\n\"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support. Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the mosque car park.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nMerseyside Police urged anyone with information on the disorder or who has video footage of those involved to contact the force. The rioting followed a frenzied stabbing attack in Southport on Monday at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nThe attack saw Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, fatally stabbed at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club. Eight other children were also stabbed, with five children and two adults left in a critical condition.\n\nA 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart Street. The Muslim Council of Britain says Islamaphobic backlash began with a false rumour on the internet which was then stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims.\n\nThe MCB paid tribute to the three young girls killed in Southport on Monday, before condemning \"shocking scenes of far-right rioters running amok outside a mosque\".\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter LANCS LIVE NEWS and get all the biggest stories from across Lancashire direct to your inbox", "source": {"uri": "lancs.live", "dataType": "news",

Some protesters are heard spouting Islamophobic chants.\n\nAt least eight officers suffered serious injuries, fractures, lacerations and concussion. At least one was knocked unconscious, Merseyside Police said.\n\nThree police dogs were also injured, one sustaining leg injuries from thrown bricks and another suffering burns to its back legs.\n\nThe disorder prompted authorities to issue a 24-hour Section 60 Order, which gives officers enhanced stop and search powers in the designated area.\n\nThe cause of the revolt was not entirely clear, but Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss suggested in a statement that it was in connection to \"speculation and hypothesis\" surrounding the 17-year-old boy police arrested on suspicion of being responsible for Monday's knife attack.\n\nThe three children stabbed to death in Southport a day prior while attending a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop have been identified as 9-year-old Alice Aguiar, 7-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and 6-year-old Bebe King. Five other children and two adults were also critically injured in the attack.\n\nPolice arrested the 17-year-old from Lancashire, Britain, who has been charged with suspicion of murder and attempted murder charges.\n\nGoss reiterated Tuesday: \"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the U.K. and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nHe added that many of those involved in the Tuesday violence do not live in the area \"or care about the people of Merseyside.\"\n\n\"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport,\" Goss said in an early Wednesday update.\n\n\"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nThe violence erupted after a vigil was held in the town for the children that was attended by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Prime Minister Keir Starmer who lay flowers during the ceremony.\n\nStarmer accused the protesters of having \"hijacked\" the vigil \"with violence and thuggery\" that insults the community in grieving.\n\n\"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and respect,\" he said in a statement, vowing that those responsible for the violence that followed the vigil \"will feel the full force of the law.\"\n\nFollowing Monday's devastating incident at Hart Street, Southport, today we were joined by Home Secretary @YvetteCooperMP and Prime Minister @Keir_Starmer to lay flowers for those who very sadly lost their lives.",

Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves.'\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said 'scenes of thuggery' on the streets of Southport 'bear no relation' to the community which had been coming together.\n\nRead More Sir Keir Starmer is heckled on his visit to Southport and asked 'how many more children will die?\n\nShe told broadcasters: 'I think everyone should be showing some respect for the community that is grieving and also for the police who are pursuing an urgent criminal investigation now, and who showed such heroism and bravery yesterday in the face of these horrific attacks.\n\n'I think everyone needs to support the police in that work, and frankly the scenes of thuggery that we have seen on the streets of Southport this evening bear no relation to the way in which the Southport community has been coming together to support each other and to support grieving families.\n\n'We need to see some respect for the grieving community and for the police in their urgent work.'\n\nPolice have introduced a 24-hour Section 60 Order in the area where the riots took place and extra officers will remain in the area.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: 'Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.'\n\nHe added: 'Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park.\n\n'This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.'\n\nThe violence was condemned by Sir Keir Starmer, Mayor Steve Rotheram and the Liverpool Region Mosque Network on Tuesday night\n\nHundreds of protesters, many masked, battled with riot police officers\n\nEngland flags were on display at the anti-Muslim demonstration in Southport\n\nSmoke is seen billowing from a police van which was set ablaze. The mosque is seen on the right\n\nTensions flared in Southport last night, with police saying supporters of the EDL were targeting the mosque\n\nLocal mosque groups condemned the violence aimed towards Muslims, adding: 'We must not let those who seek to divide us and spread hatred use this as an opportunity.'\n\nAnd Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool city region, wrote: 'There are families just coming to terms with yesterday's events, parents grieving for their murdered children and survivors still trying to process what they witnessed.\n\n'The violent scenes in Southport tonight will only further traumatise a community that is already struggling to come to terms with this attack.\n\n'Mindless violence directed at the very people who ran towards the danger yesterday, and outright Islamaphobia, only distract from the work of delivering justice.\n\n'The real story tonight is of the thousands who gathered at the vigil in Southport in memory of Bebe, Elsie and Alice. For the sake of their loved ones, this disorder needs to stop so the police do their jobs.'\n\nPolice said that a number of officers were injured, while cars were set alight and shops were broken into and looted during the disorder.\n\nIn a desperate bid to protect themselves, officers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them. One officer has suffered a suspected broken nose and police vehicles have been damaged and set on fire as around 400 people gathered to watch.\n\nThe three girls who died were among 11 children stabbed during a 'ferocious' knife attack which left mothers picking up their children screaming in horror.\n\nChaotic scenes erupted near to where the knife rampage took place in Southport yesterday\n\nThe aftermath of the riots, where police vans were burnt and rocks were launched\n\nRioters wearing masks launch missiles towards police officers in Southport\n\nRiot police with shields and helmets hold back protesters after disorder broke out\n\nProtesters cheer as they launch bins at riot police vans amid ugly scenes in Southport\n\nRioters were seen jumping on police vans as things got out of control\n\nSmoke billows behind riot police officers amid riots in the seaside town\n\nA traffic cone is hurled by a masked man at a police officer near to a mosque in Southport\n\nA wounded police officer with blood pouring down his head after being caught up in the riots\n\nRiot police try to control the angry mob who have taken to the streets of Southport\n\nFive further children, aged between six and 11, are in a critical condition alongside two female adults, among them hero yoga teacher Leanne Lucas, who 'bravely tried to protect them'.\n\nOne source told The Sun that she needed an eight-hour operation and remains seriously ill in hospital. Dance tutor Heidi Liddle and window cleaner Joel Verite have also been hailed for their bravery during the attack.\n\nAs thousands of mourners attended an emotional vigil in Southport on Tuesday evening, protests broke out on the streets surrounding Hart Street, where the attack took place.\n\nFurious demonstrators tore down garden walls to use as missiles to pelt at police, with wheelie bins also thrown during the mayhem.\n\nA police van was set on fire by protesters. Angry mobs chanted 'Stop the boats' and kicked out at police vans sent to restore order.\n\nRead More Moment Southport rioter gets hit in the head with a brick... and then again where it REALLY hurts\n\nSome threw smoke bombs, with men wearing caps and shorts charging at outnumbered police.\n\nScores of riot vans and patrol cars raced to the scene as a police helicopter hovered overhead as the violence spread out of control.\n\nHuge crowds of men, many masked and wearing hoodies, were seen clashing with police - as stones, bottles, bricks and fireworks were launched.\n\nDemonstrators could be heard shouting 'No surrender' and 'English till I die'.\n\nOne police officer was seen being helped into a van by his colleagues with blood streaming down his face and a heavily bandaged head. A female officer was also seen with a cut cheek.\n\nBy 8pm, around 500 rioters had massed in two streets outside the mosque - Sussex Road and St Luke's Road - trapping around 40 police officers in the middle.\n\nMissiles were hurled at riot officers and dog handlers from both sides. Bottles, bricks, fireworks and lumps of concrete were thrown to cheers from the rioters, who goaded police and eyes each other on.\n\nAt about 8.15pm a crowd surrounded three riot vans and began rocking one to try and flip it over.\n\nMoments later a small explosion was heard and a mini-fireball erupted in the air as the van went up in flames.\n\nOne man shouted: 'We're doing this for our girls!' as officers drove the other vans away from the fire to stop them also being set alight.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to quell the disorder, a charge from riot police brandishing batons sent around 300 of the rioters fleeing down the street as reinforcements flooded the area.\n\nBut violence continued into the night, with rioters forming a burning barricade of wheelie bins as they hurled bricks and lumps of concrete at riot police.\n\nMobs chanting 'save our girls' clashed with police until 10.30pm outside the Southport Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre.\n\nA nearby corner shop looked to have been broken into and looted. Rioters set alight at least five wheelie bins in the middle of Sussex Road sending flames and toxic black plumes of smoke shooting up into the night's sky.\n\nWith officers unable to charge due to the burning barricade, a volley of missiles was hurled from behind the makeshift bonfire.\n\nAt one point the ferocity of the violence sent the line of police retreating slightly. Officers in a Merseyside Police helicopter continued to monitor events from the air.\n\nThe crowd began to thin out around 11pm with reports of disturbances - including cars being torched - breaking out across Southport.\n\nDuring the demonstration, several people carried placards with slogans about stopping the boats. One read: 'Stop the boats! Send them back! Fight for our kids! Let's stand together!\n\nRiot police hold back protesters near a burning police vehicle\n\nA police officer holding a baton with a cut on her face after rioters stormed the area near the mosque\n\nRiot police intervene as activists cause chaos in Southend as rumours circulate over the suspect's identity\n\nA protester walks away holding his head as activists clashed with police on Tuesday\n\nClashes between protesters and police can be seen breaking out in the far distance\n\nSome held placards saying 'stop the boats'. This is despite police issuing a warning after an 'incorrect' name for the alleged attacker was widely circulated online\n\nWheelie bins and bricks were thrown at police, while a police van went up in flames - as police warned people not to speculate about the identity of the suspect\n\nHuge crowds have clashed with police in Southport as tensions boil over following the knife rampage\n\nActivists were seen launching missiles at police and attempting to damage riot vans\n\nOne woman carrying a placard said the disorder was because the knife man who attacked the children 'was a Muslim.'\n\nShe said: 'We are saying enough is enough. Why are they not stopping the migrants coming in?\n\n'How many more children will be killed because they are letting them all in? They should be at the borders stopping them.'\n\nHer comments came after inaccurate posts by social media sleuths about the identity of the perpetrator have received millions of views and engagements.\n\nSunder Katwala, director of the think-tank British Future, said a bogus news channel seemed to have invented a fake name for the suspect and run a false story that was shared online.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Goss said: 'There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n'We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\n\n'It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.'\n\nThe riots went on late into the evening, with police officers desperately trying to regain control\n\nRiot police wearing helmets and shields try to defend themselves near the mosque\n\nRiot police officers storm into the area to try and disperse the growing crowd\n\nAlso on Tuesday evening, officers were called to reports of a man carrying a weapon at around 6.50pm, during which time the vigil was taking place at the Atkinson venue.\n\nPolice swooped on the scene and detained the man minutes later before seizing the flick knife.\n\nA 32-year-old man dressed in all black, from Standish, was arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article, and taken into custody. There were no reports of any injuries during the incident.\n\nDetective Inspector Gavin Mulcahy said: 'We know too well the devastating impact knife crime can have for victims, their families and friends, and those who carry them.\n\n'This week has seen an unspeakable tragedy unfold in Southport, and this incident occurred a short distance from where a vigil had been happening where the community was paying their respects to all those affected.\n\n'Officers made a swift arrest and have seized a knife that could have been used to cause harm in our communities.\n\n'Those offenders who carry them have no place whatsoever in our communities.\n\n'Every day we are carrying out stop checks, warrants and land searches to take knives off our streets, but as this incident shows, the assistance of members of the public in telling us where they are stored and who is carrying them is vital to ensure the safety of families and residents.'\n\nAt the vigil, tearful locals laid flowers outside the Merseyside town's grand Atkinson building after falling silent to remember Bebe, Elsie and nine-year-old Alice.\n\nIn the first week of the summer holidays, the seaside town should be bustling with happy families and tourists. But at 6pm on Tuesday, more than 5,000 people stood in silence outside the Atkinson building amid an outpouring of grief and shock.\n\nIn front of the Grade II-listed building, which comprises a theatre, museum and library, is the Town Hall Gardens, where a sea of floral tributes built up.\n\nOne heartbreaking poster surrounded by candles and flowers said 'never stop dancing'. The children had been enjoying a summer holiday dance workshop when a knifeman entered the studio and launched a frenzied attack.\n\nAmong the bouquets, there were also a number of Taylor Swift-style friendship bracelets. 'Thinking of you all,' a row of four of them spelt out.\n\nAhead of the vigil, the families and schools of the innocent girls who were fatally attacked by a crazed knifeman also released tributes.\n\nIn a statement, Bebe's family said: 'No words can describe the devastation that has hit our family as try to deal with the loss of our little girl Bebe.'\n\nThe family of Alice Dasilva Aguiar added: 'Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our Princess, like we said before to you, you're always our princess and no one would change that. Love from Your Hero Daddy and Mummy.'\n\nAnd the headteacher of Farnborough Road Infant School said they were 'heartbroken and devastated' by the death of pupil Elsie.\n\nJennifer Sephton said: 'Elsie has been a loving and bright member of our wonderful community since first being brought here on her father's shoulders, and even at her early age she was such a caring and charismatic young lady who loved to please.\n\n'Elsie was a kind and caring friend to all who met her and was adored by everyone in our community. Our hearts and most deeply-felt sympathies go out to Elsie's family, friends and our Farnborough community who have been left numb by what has happened.\n\n'It is immensely difficult to put into words how amazing Elsie was and the impact she had on those around her. We will miss you dearly Elsie. You were one of a kind.'\n\nAlder Hey Children's hospital this afternoon released a statement confirming that seven children had been taken to the site for treatment. One of those was Alice, and of the others, two remain in a critical condition, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe head of the school trust attended by Alice and Bebe said the girls 'will be in our hearts forever'.\n\nEndeavour Learning Trust chief executive David Clayton said 'no words can do justice to what has happened here in Southport.\n\nThe trust contains Churchtown Primary School in Southport, which Alice and Bebe had both attended.\n\nChurchtown Primary headteacher Jinnie Payne said the school had heard the 'tragic news' with 'great sadness', describing the stabbings as an 'atrocity'.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Clayton said: 'No words can do justice to what has happened here in Southport - and our hearts are broken for the families who have lost their children.\n\n'No one should ever have to experience horror like this.\n\n'Our immediate focus now is on providing support to the community as we start to understand what has happened. The death of a child is always a desperate tragedy for a school, and particularly so under such circumstances.\n\n'We will come together as a community, offering each other support and care as we work through this difficult time.\n\n'Alice and Bebe will be in our hearts forever.'\n\nMs Payne said Alice, a Year 4 pupil at Churchtown, was the 'happiest of souls, a true ray of sunshine'.\n\nThe Churchtown Primary headteacher added: 'She was known and loved by everyone in our school community of 700 children, a testament to her unique ability to connect with others.\n\n'Alice's radiant smile brightened our days, and she embraced every aspect of school life with enthusiasm and joy.\n\n'Her kindness, playful nature, and zest for trying new things will forever be remembered. Alice, you will always hold a special place in our hearts at Churchtown.'\n\nMs Payne said Bebe, a former pupil at the school, was a 'joyful girl' whose 'kindness radiated through the entire Churchtown community'.\n\nThe headteacher added: 'During her time at the school, Bebe's considerate nature and her love of learning shone through in everything that she did.\n\n'Each day, she would come into school ready to grasp every opportunity available to her and fun and laughter were never far away whenever Bebe was involved.\n\n'Her considerate nature meant that she had many friends and she always ensured all children felt included, whether that was through play or working together in the classroom.\n\n'Bebe's memory will live on in the hearts of all who knew her.'\n\nThe headteacher added: 'We know that a number of other children from Churchtown were also involved in the attack, along with much-loved colleagues.\n\n'We extend our heartfelt wishes to all those families affected by this horrific incident, including those currently in hospital or continuing to receive treatment.'\n\nDevastated relatives of Alice said she had been taken by a 'despicable human being.'\n\nHer mother Alexandra Aguiar is understood to be originally from Caracas in Venezuela and her dad David Aguiar is from the Portuguese island of Madeira.\n\nRelative Carina Aguiar, a hotel worker who lives in Camara de Lobos in Madeira, posted a link on her social media to news Merseyside Police had confirmed a third child' had died following the attack and wrote tear emojis beside it.\n\nEarlier she posted a photo of a black ribbon on her Facebook alongside Alice's name after writing in an emotional tribute: 'Princess Alice. In this moment of great pain my soul hurts, my body hurts, my mind hurts. I have a lump in my throat.\n\n'You were just an innocent child, a happy smiley girl with a bright life ahead of you which a despicable human being took away from you, without pity, for no reason.'\n\nReacting to the riots, Merseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy posted on X: 'I am incredibly proud of my officers and staff who have worked so hard to save the lives of children, investigate the horrific incident from yesterday, working with partners to provide reassurance to our communities and now they are facing this level of violence from these thugs\n\n'Over 1000 residents from Southport came together this evening to remember the little girls who have died, those who are still critical in hospital and all those who witnessed & are traumatised by the events from yesterday. This is where all of our focus should be.'\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley said: 'It's distressing to see people from outside our Southport community attacking our police and local people.\n\n'I want to make it clear that I fully condemn any attack on our emergency services, these are the same services that responded to the tragic attack yesterday.\n\n'I appeal to local people to avoid the area and stay safe, to allow the police to do their job.'\n\nMr Hurley continued: 'I want to thank our community for pulling together and supporting every person who has been affected by Monday's tragic attack.\n\n'Nowhere was this more evident than the solidarity, remembrance and sympathy heard at today's vigil.\n\n'To those who laid flowers, candles, toys, thank you. I was deeply saddened to hear the news today of the death or a third child. Bebe, Elsie and Alice are in all of our thoughts and hearts today.'\n\nThe three girls stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class were yesterday named by police as nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and six-year-old Bebe King (L-R)\n\nAway from the protest, a vigil was being held for the three girls who died in the tragic incident\n\nIn stark contrast to the riots, there was a sense of tranquillity around the site of the vigil\n\nThe vigil was held at the Atkinson in Southport at around 6pm on Tuesday evening\n\nThe Southport Mosque said it was 'truly shocked and saddened to hear about the events that unfolded today'. They added: 'We extend our deepest sympathy to the families of all affected. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all.'\n\nThe Liverpool Region Mosque Network said it was 'shocked and horrified' by the knife rampage on Monday.\n\nBut it added: 'A minority of people are attempting to portray that this inhumane act is somehow related to the Muslim community. Frankly it is not, and we must not let those who seek to divide us and spread hatred use this as an opportunity.\n\n'This evening, we have seen distressing scenes outside Southport Mosque with angry protesters, gathering outside. This is causing further fear and anxiety within our communities. We must all unite and stand together against all forms of hate, violence and division.'\n\nAnd the The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) condemned 'shocking scenes of far-right rioters running amok outside a mosque'.\n\nThe MCB says Islamaphobic backlash began with a false rumour on the internet which was then stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims.\n\nMCB secretary-general Zara Mohammed said: 'At a time of great tragedy, loss, and mourning, we must stand firm against the cynical forces of hatred and division. This does not represent our diverse Britain and the people of Southport.\n\n'The Government must address the increasing rise of violent far-right extremism targeting Muslim communities. More must be done to tackle Islamophobia and offer reassurance at this time.'\n\nShe added: 'We commend the authorities for their swift action, and our prayers are with the mosque, the families of the victims of yesterday's attack, and the local community.'\n\nDowning Street also warned against 'unhelpful' speculation amid concerns that misreporting online could inflame community tensions.\n\nAn aerial view of Hart Street on Monday, where a horrifying knife attack took place just before midday\n\nOfficers should be given the space to probe the case without people guessing at the possible motive or circumstances, No 10 said.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Prime Minister was repeatedly asked 'how many more children will die?' as he placed flowers at the scene of the attack.\n\nSir Keir's brief visit, which lasted around two minutes, was interrupted by some members of the public heckling him.\n\nAs the Prime Minister walked past, one man declared: 'Here's your photo opportunity.'\n\nAnother shouted: 'How many more children? Our kids are dead and you're leaving already?'\n\nOther furious onlookers shouted 'scumbag', 'time for change' and 'go away, you're not wanted'.\n\nAnother woman said: 'I've just found out my friend's nine-year-old daughter was killed, the person I've held as a child, and you can't do s***.'\n\nAnd a different man shouted: 'Get the truth out!'\n\nMs Cooper has said social media companies 'need to take some responsibility' for some activity in the aftermath of the attack.\n\nResponding to shadow home secretary James Cleverly, she said: 'I agree with him too about the responsibility on every one of us. The police do need to be able to pursue this investigation.\n\n'There will be wider questions for other days, but the most important thing is that every one of us supports the police in their investigation now.\n\n'I agree with him too about the responsibility on social media companies, because we do need to recognise there are things that are taking place on social media that go against their terms and conditions, and their commitments as well. They need to take some responsibility for that.\n\n'Above all, this is about young children. This is about children and their families who will be grieving, and the many other children who were involved yesterday who will be facing great trauma as well.'\n\nHer counterpart Mr Cleverly called for people not to 'get involved in the grief of others' by sharing misinformation relating to the Southport attack on social media.\n\n'Enough people are already distressed without their distress being amplified by speculation and gossip online,' he added.\n\nAhead of fears mounting over a far-right rally, Sir Keir's official spokesman said: 'Of course, people should listen the police, they should not do anything that is going to make the police's job harder to manage the situation, to conduct their investigations.\n\n'It is unhelpful to speculate on things like the motive and the circumstance around this.'\n\nPolice have said that, although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

People from out of town just causing absolute mayhem.\n\n\"People in hoods climbing up lampposts, throwing bricks, they set a police car on fire.\n\n\"But none of those people were the people of Southport.

It was absolutely, awful, horrendous. We couldn't understand this viciousness that was going on.\"\n\nLocals have brought flowers to the mosque and are helping organise repairs to the building, which Mr Hussein said was \"humbling\".\n\n\"I know the people of Southport and I know how beautiful they are but this was still a moving experience to see all that,\" he said.\n\nShop owner Chanaka Balasuryla said the Southport community has rallied around him since his store was looted during the disorder on Tuesday night.\n\nHe called 999 after spotting men trying to smash their way in on the CCTV camera from his home five minutes away, and was \"terrified\" that they might set fire to the premises because a woman and her daughter live in the flat above.\n\nThe woman confronted the raiders, telling them it was her shop in an attempt to stop them, he said.\n\nMerseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items such as bricks towards the mosque in the seaside town at about 7.45pm.\n\nAngela Rayner said that Home Secretary Yvette Cooper will look at whether the EDL should be banned, despite former leader Tommy Robinson's insistence that the group no longer exists.\n\nThe troubling scenes saw 27 police officers taken to hospital, with 12 others being treated and discharged at the scene, North West Ambulance Service said.\n\nMerseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion.\n\nThe chairman of Merseyside Police Federation, Chris McGlade, said: \"Police officers are not robots.

In a statement issued last night, Merseyside Police said they believe this initial disorder was sparked by a number of supporters of the EDL - a far-right organisation known for its Islamophobia.\n\nREAD NEXT: Chaos in Southport as nearly 40 police officers injured during violent riots\n\n\"At around 7.45pm, a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League - began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road in Southport\", police said in a statement.

More info\n\nThe grieving mother of a seven year old victim in the Southport knife attack issued a touching plea to end the violence as chaos engulfed the town.\n\nJenni Stancombe, who lost her daughter Elsie Dot Stancombe in what has been described as an appalling crime at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party, turned to social media for her heartfelt call for peace. Monday's nightmarish event also claimed the lives of Alice Aguiar, aged nine, and six year old Bebe King, leaving two adults and five other children fighting for their lives in hospital.\n\nIn the wake of the tragedy, a large congregation held a vigil in the town centre last night which was initially marked by a solemn atmosphere. Despite the respectful tribute, a fracas ensued near the site, prompting law enforcement intervention outside a mosque on St Luke's Road, reports The Express.\n\nREAD MORE Brits heading to Spain warned over clothing rule 'no matter where you go'\n\nJenni Stancombe's widely circulated online message read: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\"\n\nShe further honoured the efforts of the police force with these words: \"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\" A major incident was declared after disturbances saw officers injured, walls stripped of bricks for use as missiles, and civilian vehicles torched.\n\nEight police officers have been left with serious injuries, including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose, and concussion. Other officers suffered head injuries and serious facial injuries, and one was even knocked unconscious. The violence broke out when a large group of people, believed by police to be supporters of the English Defence League, began hurling items at the local mosque on St Luke's Road on Tuesday evening.\n\nCars belonging to the public were torched, bricks were hurled at the mosque, and damage was inflicted on a local convenience store. Wheelie bins were also set alight, and three police dogs were injured. Photos and videos shared online depict large groups pelting rocks at police officers, clambering on police vans, and attempting to shatter the vehicles' windows.\n\nLast night, Merseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack. I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police, and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\"\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park.\"\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and our respect. Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law.\"\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley has also condemned the \"beered-up thugs\" who threw bricks towards a mosque. \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"Not least these beered-up thugs who have descended on the town last night intent on causing trouble.

Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were all fatally stabbed on Monday, while a 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons because of his age, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder.\n\nMerseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items such as bricks towards the mosque in the seaside town at around 7.45pm.

Elsie was described by her school as a 'one of a kind pupil' and a 'a caring and charismatic young lady who loved to please'.\n\nIn a message widely shared on social media, Ms Stancombe said: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\"\n\nSpeaking about the police, she added: \"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nThe troubling scenes saw 27 officers taken to hospital, with 12 others being treated and discharged at the scene, North West Ambulance Service said. The troubling scenes saw 27 officers taken to hospital, with 12 others being treated and discharged at the scene, North West Ambulance Service said.\n\nLancashire Constabulary officers were drafted in to support their Merseyside colleagues. Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said the officers injured in Tuesday's protests will \"now be unavailable for duty in what is an incredibly busy time for the force\".\n\nVideos posted on social media showed people throwing wheelie bins and bricks at officers who held riot shields to push the crowds back. Chairman of Merseyside Police Federation Chris McGlade said more than 50 officers had been hurt in a \"sustained and vicious attack\".\n\nHe added: \"Police officers are not robots. We are mothers and fathers. Sons and daughters. Husbands, wives and partners.\n\n\"We should be going home at the end of our shifts. Not to hospital.\"\n\nThe violent protests followed hundreds of people taking part in a peaceful vigil for the stabbing victims outside Southport's Atkinson arts venue, with many in tears as they laid flowers and cards of remembrance. As well as the three children who died, eight other youngsters suffered stab wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured, police said.\n\nThe vigil was followed by the protest outside the mosque as demonstrators chanted far-right slogans and clashed with police in St Luke's Road. Southport MP Patrick Hurley said on Wednesday that rioters must face the \"full force of the law\", saying they were \"utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children\".\n\nMr Hurley condemned \"beered-up thugs\" who threw bricks, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all.\"\n\nHe also hit out at the \"swirling morass\" of social media \"lies and propaganda\", saying they have fuelled rumours about the attacker's identity as well as criticism of politicians. False claims had spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nThe Prime Minister said rioters had \"hijacked\" a vigil for victims and will \"feel the full force of the law\". The suspect, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, is from the village of Banks in West Lancashire, and a road in the area was cordoned off by detectives on Monday afternoon.\n\nPolice have said that, although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related. A 32-year-old man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possession of a flick knife in Eastbank Street, near where the vigil took place on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe was taken into custody and there were no reports that anyone was injured during the incident, Merseyside Police said.\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter LANCS LIVE NEWS and get all the biggest stories from across Lancashire direct t o your inbox", "source": {"uri": "lancs.live", "dataType": "news", "title": "accrington"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_macpherson@lancs.live", "name": "Jon Macpherson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Ambulance_Service", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North West Ambulance Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seaside resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

North West Ambulance Service said of the injured police officers: \"We treated 39 patients in total, all of which were police officers. 27 were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene.\"\n\nA 24-hour Section 60 Order was introduced in the area running from 7.54pm on Tuesday, which gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals and is designed to minimise serious violence. A Section 34 Order has also been introduced, giving police the power to direct people engaging in antisocial behaviour or are likely to become involved in such incidents.\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Goss, said: \"Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\n\n\"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support. Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the mosque car park.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\" Merseyside Police urged anyone with information on the disorder or who has video footage of those involved to contact the force.\n\nThe violence followed the stabbings of Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, at the Taylor Swift-themed holiday club. Eight other children were also stabbed, with five children and two adults left in a critical condition. A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart Street.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucy_thornton@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lucy Thornton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tim_hanlon@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Tim Hanlon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_road_numbering_scheme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain road numbering scheme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_van", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police van"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Ambulance_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North West Ambulance Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strangling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Wales Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assistant chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33363484.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SDC_MDG_CHP_67511exc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5294117647058824, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

People from out of town just causing absolute mayhem.\n\n\"People in hoods climbing up lampposts, throwing bricks, they set a police car on fire.\n\n\"But none of those people were the people of Southport. The people of Southport are the ones here today cleaning the mess up.\n\n\"Those people from out of town - they came in in buses and cars and had a change of clothes. They just started to riot and do this.\"\n\nMosque chairman Ibrahim Hussein told reporters he was trapped in the mosque with about eight others as the violence erupted, and only escaped with a police guard.\n\nHe said: \"It was terrifying. It was absolutely, awful, horrendous. We couldn't understand this viciousness that was going on.\"\n\nLocals have brought flowers to the mosque and are helping organise repairs to the building, which Mr Hussein said was \"humbling\".\n\n\"I know the people of Southport and I know how beautiful they are but this was still a moving experience to see all that,\" he said.\n\nShop owner Chanaka Balasuryla said the Southport community has rallied around him since his store was looted during the disorder on Tuesday night.\n\nHe called 999 after spotting men trying to smash their way in on the CCTV camera from his home five minutes away, and was \"terrified\" that they might set fire to the premises because a woman and her daughter live in the flat above.\n\nThe woman confronted the raiders, telling them it was her shop in an attempt to stop them, he said.\n\nMerseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items such as bricks towards the mosque in the seaside town at about 7.45pm.\n\nScotland's former first minister Humza Yousaf called for the EDL to be banned under terror laws in the wake of the unrest, despite former leader Tommy Robinson's insistence that the group no longer exists.\n\nElsie's mother, Jenni Stancombe, wrote on Facebook: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\n\n\"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nThe troubling scenes saw 27 officers taken to hospital, with 12 others being treated and discharged at the scene, North West Ambulance Service said.\n\nMerseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion.\n\nThe chairman of Merseyside Police Federation, Chris McGlade, said: \"Police officers are not robots. We are mothers and fathers. Sons and daughters. Husbands, wives and partners.\n\n\"We should be going home at the end of our shifts. Not to hospital.\"\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley, speaking on Wednesday, said rioters must face the \"full force of the law\", saying they were \"utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children\".\n\nHe condemned \"beered-up thugs\" who threw bricks, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all.\"\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said rioters had \"hijacked\" a vigil for victims and will \"feel the full force of the law\", while Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", which she branded \"appalling\".\n\nThe suspect, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport.\n\nPolice have said that although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.", "source": {"uri":

Some protesters are heard spouting Islamophobic chants.\n\nAt least eight officers suffered serious injuries, fractures, lacerations and concussion. At least one was knocked unconscious, Merseyside Police said.\n\nThree police dogs were also injured, one sustaining leg injuries from thrown bricks and another suffering burns to its back legs.\n\nThe disorder prompted authorities to issue a 24-hour Section 60 Order, which gives officers enhanced stop and search powers in the designated area.\n\nThe cause of the revolt was not entirely clear, but Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss suggested in a statement that it was in connection to \"speculation and hypothesis\" surrounding the 17-year-old boy police arrested on suspicion of being responsible for Monday's knife attack.\n\nThe three children stabbed to death in Southport a day prior while attending a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop have been identified as 9-year-old Alice Aguiar, 7-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and 6-year-old Bebe King. Five other children and two adults were also critically injured in the attack.\n\nPolice arrested the 17-year-old from Lancashire, Britain, who has been charged with suspicion of murder and attempted murder charges.\n\nGoss reiterated Tuesday: \"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the U.K. and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nHe added that many of those involved in the Tuesday violence do not live in the area \"or care about the people of Merseyside.\"\n\n\"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport,\" Goss said in an early Wednesday update.\n\n\"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nThe violence erupted after a vigil was held in the town for the children that was attended by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Prime Minister Keir Starmer who lay flowers during the ceremony.\n\nStarmer accused the protesters of having \"hijacked\" the vigil \"with violence and thuggery\" that insults the community in grieving.\n\n\"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and respect,\" he said in a statement, vowing that those responsible for the violence that followed the vigil \"will feel the full force of the law.\"\n\nFollowing Monday's

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nNearly 40 police officers sustained injuries at the scene of violent disorder in Southport, North West Ambulance Service said. The service said 27 officers were taken to hospital.\n\nA statement on X said: \"We treated 39 patients in total, all of which were police officers. 27 were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene. Merseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose, and a concussion.\n\nOther officers suffered head injuries, and serious facial injuries, and one was knocked unconscious. Three police dogs were also injured in the chaos, with Zoe and Ike suffering leg injuries from bricks thrown at them.\n\nA third dog, Quga - who was bitten, strangled and kicked by an offender at the beginning of this month - suffered burns to her back leg, the force said. Merseyside Police said those involved in the unrest - who they believe included supporters of the English Defence League - set alight cars belonging to members of the public, threw bricks at the local mosque, damaged a local convenience store, and set wheelie bins on fire.\n\nExtra police will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities. A 24-hour Section 60 Order was introduced in the area running from 7.54pm on Tuesday, which gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals and is designed to minimise serious violence.\n\nA Section 34 Order has also been introduced, giving police the power to direct people engaging in antisocial behaviour or are likely to become involved in such incidents. Merseyside police said these powers would not be used for anyone visiting the area and going about their daily business.\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Goss, said: \"Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\n\n\"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support. \"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the mosque car park.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\" Merseyside Police urged anyone with information on the disorder or who has video footage of those involved to contact the force.\n\nThe rioting followed a frenzied stabbing attack in Southport on Monday at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club. The attack saw Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, fatally stabbed at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nEight other children were also stabbed, with five children and two adults left in a critical condition. A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart Street.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain says Islamaphobic backlash began with a false rumour on the internet which was then stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims.\n\nThe MCB paid tribute to the three young girls killed in Southport on Monday, before condemning \"shocking scenes of far-right rioters running amok outside a mosque\".", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_shaw@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Neil Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Violent disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Ambulance_Service", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North West Ambulance Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_and_search", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stop and search"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assistant chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-social behaviour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Council_of_Britain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslim Council of Britain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Wales Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29646580.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_277005063.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The law allows officers up to 96 hours, or four days, to hold a suspect in custody for serious crimes.\n\nThe 17-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder after the horror unfolded at a Taylor Swift-themed children's holiday club on Monday (July 29). Three girls - Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven - were fatally stabbed, while eight other children suffered knife wounds - five of whom are in a critical condition.\n\nREAD MORE: 'They destroyed our streets, now we're pulling together to clean up after night of chaos'\n\nTwo adults were also critically hurt. Right-wing rioters staged violent protests near Southport mosque on Tuesday, marring a night of remembrance for the little girls who lost their lives. Police officers suffered serious injuries when bricks, stones and bottles were thrown and cars were set alight during unrest that followed a vigil for the murdered children.\n\nBaseless rumours were spread on social media, misidentifying the suspect and falsely claiming that he was a refugee, when in fact he was born in Wales. In the wake of the violence, locals in Southport rallied together to support the Muslim community and clear up the mess left by rioters who it is claimed came from outside the area.\n\nDozens of residents were outside Southport mosque with brushes and shovels on Wednesday morning, clearing bricks from a wall that was knocked down during the rioting. Norman Wallis, chief executive of Southport Pleasureland, said people had travelled from out of town to wreak havoc, leaving locals to clean up the mess.\n\nHe said: \"It was like a war scene. People from out of town just causing absolute mayhem. People in hoods climbing up lampposts, throwing bricks, they set a police car on fire.\n\n\"But none of those people were the people of Southport. The people of Southport are the ones here today cleaning the mess up.\n\n\"Those people from out of town - they came in in buses and cars and had a change of clothes. They just started to riot and do this.\"\n\nMosque chairman Ibrahim Hussein told reporters he was trapped in the mosque with about eight others as the violence erupted, and only escaped with a police guard.\n\nHe said: \"It was terrifying. It was absolutely, awful, horrendous. We couldn't understand this viciousness that was going on.\"\n\nLocals have brought flowers to the mosque and are helping organise repairs to the building, which Mr Hussein said was \"humbling\".\n\n\"I know the people of Southport and I know how beautiful they are but this was still a moving experience to see all that,\" he said.\n\nShop owner Chanaka Balasuryla said the Southport community has rallied around him since his store was looted during the disorder on Tuesday night. He called 999 after spotting men trying to smash their way in on the CCTV camera from his home five minutes away, and was \"terrified\" that they might set fire to the premises because a woman and her daughter live in the flat above.\n\nThe woman confronted the raiders, telling them it was her shop in an attempt to stop them, he said. Merseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items such as bricks towards the mosque in the seaside town at about 7.45pm.\n\nScotland's former first minister Humza Yousaf called for the EDL to be banned under terror laws in the wake of the unrest, despite former leader Tommy Robinson's insistence that the group no longer exists.\n\nElsie's mother, Jenni Stancombe, wrote on Facebook: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please please stop the violence in Southport tonight. The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nThe troubling scenes saw 27 officers taken to hospital, with 12 others being treated and discharged at the scene, North West Ambulance Service said. Merseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion.\n\nThe chairman of Merseyside Police Federation, Chris McGlade, said: \"Police officers are not robots. We are mothers and fathers. Sons and daughters. Husbands, wives and partners. We should be going home at the end of our shifts. Not to hospital.\"\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley, speaking on Wednesday, said rioters must face the \"full force of the law\", saying they were \"utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children\".\n\nHe condemned \"beered-up thugs\" who threw bricks, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all.\"\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said rioters had \"hijacked\" a vigil for victims and will \"feel the full force of the law\", while Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", which she branded \"appalling\".\n\nThe suspect, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport. Police have said that although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter LANCS LIVE NEWS and get all the biggest stories from

They deserve our support and our respect,\" said Starmer.\n\n\"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law,\" he said.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Bebe King, 6, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, were named as the victims of the fatal stabbing. Eight others were seriously injured, five of whom remain in critical condition in hospital.\n\nMerseyside Police have said it was currently not treating the incident as terror-related.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets. We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time,\" said Alex Goss, Assistant Chief Constable of the force.\n\nThe police said 22 of its officers sustained serious injuries, including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion. The rioters set cars belonging to members of the public alight, threw bricks at the local mosque and damaged a local convenience store, and set large refuse bins on fire.\n\nAs a result, strict legal orders have been enforced in the area designed to minimise serious violence and giving additional powers to officers to tackle anti-social behaviour.\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park. This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday,\" said Goss, as he appealed for information to bring those involved to justice.\n\nThe police attracted strong support from the local community, who believed the English Defence League (EDL) supporting mob was whipped up largely from outside the town.\n\nThe disorder flared up after thousands gathered at the peace vigil to pay tribute to three girls killed and pray for those fighting for their lives in the knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club dance event at Hart Street community centre.\n\nMeanwhile, two adults who were critically injured in the attack have been named locally as yoga teacher Leanne Lucas, who co-organised the dance session for a group of six to 11-year-olds, and John Hayes, who works at the Hart Space where the stabbings took place.\n\n\"It is extremely important that people don't spread damaging misinformation online. False information has already been extensively shared in the last 24 hours,\" urged UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.\n\n\"In these dark and difficult moments, the police must be able to get on with their work and communities must be given the time and space to grieve and heal without outside voices seeking to use events to stir up division or advance their own views,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, more than GBP 2,15,000 has been raised by Taylor Swift fans via a \"Swifties for Southport\" Just Giving page for the funerals of the children who were killed and for the families of the injured.\n\nThe money will also go to Alder Hey Children's Hospital where some of the victims are being treated.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

The law allows officers up to 96 hours, or four days, to hold a suspect in custody for serious crimes.\n\nThe 17-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder after the carnage unfolded at a Taylor Swift-themed dance club on Monday. Three girls - Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven - all died after sustaining stab wounds.\n\nEight other children were left injured, five of whom are in a critical condition. Two adults were also critically hurt. The tragedy was followed by riots near Southport mosque on Tuesday by right-wing groups.\n\nPolice officers suffered serious injuries when bricks, stones and bottles were thrown and cars were set alight during unrest that followed a vigil for the murdered children. The violence was spurred on by baseless rumours on social media that misidentified the suspect.\n\nIn the wake of the turmoil, locals in Southport rallied together to support the Muslim community and clear up the mess left by rioters.\n\nDozens of residents were outside Southport mosque with brushes and shovels on Wednesday morning, clearing bricks from a wall that was knocked down during the rioting.\n\nNorman Wallis, chief executive of Southport Pleasureland, said people had travelled from other areas wreak havoc - leaving locals to clean up the mess.\n\nHe said: \"It was like a war scene. People from out of town just causing absolute mayhem. People in hoods climbing up lampposts, throwing bricks, they set a police car on fire. But none of those people were the people of Southport. The people of Southport are the ones here today cleaning the mess up. Those people from out of town - they came in in buses and cars and had a change of clothes. They just started to riot and do this.\"\n\nMosque chairman Ibrahim Hussein told reporters he was trapped in the mosque with about eight others as the violence erupted, and only escaped with a police guard. He said: \"It was terrifying. It was absolutely, awful, horrendous. We couldn't understand this viciousness that was going on.\" Locals have brought flowers to the mosque and are helping organise repairs to the building, which Mr Hussein said was \"humbling\".\n\n\"I know the people of Southport and I know how beautiful they are but this was still a moving experience to see all that,\" he said. Shop owner Chanaka Balasuryla said the Southport community has rallied around him since his store was looted during the disorder on Tuesday night. He called 999 after spotting men trying to smash their way in on the CCTV camera from his home five minutes away, and was \"terrified\" that they might set fire to the premises because a woman and her daughter live in the flat above.\n\nThe woman confronted the raiders, telling them it was her shop in an attempt to stop them, he said.\n\nMerseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League (EDL)\" - began to throw items such as bricks towards the mosque in the seaside town at about 7.45pm.\n\nFormer First Minister Humza Yousaf called for the EDL to be banned under terror laws in the wake of the unrest, despite former leader Tommy Robinson's insistence that the group no longer exists.\n\nElsie's mother, Jenni Stancombe, wrote on Facebook: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please please stop the violence in Southport tonight. The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nA total of 27 officers were taken to hospital while 12 others were treated and discharged at the scene. Eight cops suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion.\n\nThe chairman of Merseyside Police Federation, Chris McGlade, said: \"Police officers are not robots. We are mothers and fathers. Sons and daughters. Husbands, wives and partners. We should be going home at the end of our shifts. Not to hospital.\" Southport MP Patrick Hurley, speaking on Wednesday, said rioters must face the \"full force of the law\", saying they were \"utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children\".\n\nHe condemned \"beered-up thugs\" who threw bricks, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all.\" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said rioters had \"hijacked\" a vigil for victims and will \"feel the full force of the law\", while Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", which she branded \"appalling\".\n\nThe suspect, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport. Police have said that although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily

They deserve our support and our respect,\" said Starmer.\n\n\"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves.

Eight others were seriously injured, five of whom remain in critical condition in hospital.\n\nMerseyside Police have said it was currently not treating the incident as terror-related.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets. We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time,\" said Alex Goss, Assistant Chief Constable of the force.\n\nThe police said 22 of its officers sustained serious injuries, including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion. The rioters set cars belonging to members of the public alight, threw bricks at the local mosque and damaged a local convenience store, and set large refuse bins on fire.\n\nAs a result, strict legal orders have been enforced in the area designed to minimise serious violence and giving additional powers to officers to tackle anti-social behaviour.\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park. This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday,\" said Goss, as he appealed for information to bring those involved to justice.\n\nThe police attracted strong support from the local community, who believed the English Defence League (EDL) supporting mob was whipped up largely from outside the town.\n\nThe disorder flared up after thousands gathered at the peace vigil to pay tribute to three girls killed and pray for those fighting for their lives in the knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club dance event at Hart Street community centre.\n\nMeanwhile, two adults who were critically injured in the attack have been named locally as yoga teacher Leanne Lucas, who co-organised the dance session for a group of six to 11-year-olds, and John Hayes, who works at the Hart Space where the stabbings took place.\n\n\"It is extremely important that people don't spread damaging misinformation online. False information has already been extensively shared in the last 24 hours,\" urged UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.\n\n\"In these dark and difficult moments, the police must be able to get on with their work and communities must be given the time and space to grieve and heal without outside voices seeking to use events to stir up division or advance their own views,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, more than GBP 2,15,000 has been raised by Taylor Swift fans via a \"Swifties for Southport\" Just Giving page for the funerals of the children who were killed and for the families of the injured.\n\nThe money will also go to Alder Hey Children's Hospital where some of the victims are being treated.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"},

Protestors then began hurling various items at the building.\n\nPolice were called to the incident, before the crowds grew in number and violent scenes escalated, leaving officers outnumbered.

I'm feeling that I've been here 40 years and this isn't the British experience. This is something alien.\n\n\"This is not love, this is not humanity. This is sad. I just feel so bad for the parents having to deal with this too. They live here. This is all I can think of.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_holt@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "James Holt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_container", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Waste container"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Van"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_armor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body armor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assistant chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firecracker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firecracker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_van", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police van"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Angry mobs chanted 'Stop the boats' and kicked out at police vans sent to restore order.\n\nSome threw smoke bombs, with men wearing caps and shorts charging at outnumbered police.\n\nScores of riot vans and patrol cars raced to the scene as a police helicopter hovered overhead as the violence spread out of control.\n\nIt's understood a number of officers have suffered what looks to be minor injuries in the chaotic scenes outside of a mosque.\n\nHuge crowds of men, many masked and wearing hoodies, were seen clashing with police - as stones, bottles, bricks and fireworks were launched.\n\nDemonstrators could be heard shouting 'No surrender' and 'English till I die'.\n\nIt comes after inaccurate posts by social media sleuths about the identity of the perpetrator have received millions of views and engagements.\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss: 'There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n'We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\n\n'It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.'\n\nDowning Street also warned against 'unhelpful' speculation amid concerns that misreporting online could inflame community tensions.\n\nOfficers should be given the space to probe the case without people guessing at the possible motive or circumstances, No 10 said.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Prime Minister was repeatedly asked 'how many more children will die?' as he placed flowers at the scene of the attack.\n\nSir Keir Starmer's brief visit, which lasted around two minutes, was interrupted by some members of the public heckling him.\n\nAs the Prime Minister walked past, one man declared: 'Here's your photo opportunity.'\n\nAnother shouted: 'How many more children? Our kids are dead and you're leaving already?'\n\nOther furious onlookers shouted 'scumbag', 'time for change' and 'go away, you're not wanted'.\n\nAnother woman said: 'I've just found out my friend's nine-year-old daughter was killed, the person I've held as a child, and you can't do s***.'\n\nAnd a different man shouted: 'Get the truth out!'\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper has said social media companies 'need to take some responsibility' for some activity in the aftermath of the attack.\n\nResponding to shadow home secretary James Cleverly, she said: 'I agree with him too about the responsibility on every one of us. The police do need to be able to pursue this investigation.\n\n'There will be wider questions for other days, but the most important thing is that every one of us supports the police in their investigation now.\n\n'I agree with him too about the responsibility on social media companies, because we do need to recognise there are things that are taking place on social media that go against their terms and conditions, and their commitments as well. They need to take some responsibility for that.\n\n'Above all, this is about young children.

suffering leg injuries from bricks thrown at them.\n\nA third dog, Quga - who was bitten, strangled and kicked by an offender at the beginning of this month - suffered burns to her back leg, the force said.\n\nMerseyside Police said those involved in the unrest - who they believe included supporters of the English Defence League - set alight cars belonging to members of the public, threw bricks at the local mosque, damaged a local convenience store, and set wheelie bins on fire.\n\nExtra police will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities.\n\nA 24-hour Section 60 Order was introduced in the area running from 7.54pm on Tuesday, which gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals and is designed to minimise serious violence.\n\nA Section 34 Order has also been introduced, giving police the power to direct people engaging in antisocial behaviour or are likely to become involved in such incidents.\n\nMerseyside police said these powers would not be used for anyone visiting the area and going about their daily business.\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Goss, said: \"Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in

They just started to riot and do this.\"\n\nOfficers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them and police vehicles were damaged and set on fire.\n\nIn a post on social media, the force said shops had been \"broken into and looted\", adding that \"those responsible will be brought to justice\".\n\nElsie's mother, Jenni Stancombe, wrote on Facebook: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\n\n\"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nThe troubling scenes saw 27 officers taken to hospital, with 12 others being treated and discharged at the scene, North West Ambulance Service said.\n\nChief Constable Serena Kennedy said the officers injured in Tuesday's protests will \"now be unavailable for duty in what is an incredibly busy time for the force\".\n\nVideos posted on social media showed people throwing wheelie bins and bricks at officers who held riot shields to push the crowds back.\n\nThe chairman of Merseyside Police Federation, Chris McGlade, said more than 50 officers had been hurt in a \"sustained and vicious attack\".\n\nHe added: \"Police officers are not robots. We are mothers and fathers. Sons and daughters. Husbands, wives and partners.\n\n\"We should be going home at the end of our shifts. Not to hospital.\"\n\nAs well as the three children who died, eight other youngsters suffered stab wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured, police said.\n\nThe vigil was followed by the protest outside the mosque as demonstrators chanted far-right slogans and clashed with police in St Luke's Road.\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley, speaking on Wednesday, said rioters must face the \"full force of the law\", saying they were \"utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children\".\n\nHe condemned \"beered-up thugs\" who threw bricks, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all.\"\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said rioters had \"hijacked\" a vigil for victims and will \"feel the full force of the law\", while Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", which she branded \"appalling\".\n\nThe suspect, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport, and a road in the area was cordoned off by detectives on Monday afternoon.\n\nPolice have said that although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.\n\nA 32-year-old man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possession of a flick knife in Eastbank Street, near where the vigil took place on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe was taken into custody and there were no reports that anyone was injured during the incident, Merseyside Police said.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [],

Alice Aguiar, aged nine, and six-year-old Bebe King also lost their lives in the attack, while two adults and five other children are still fighting for their lives in hospital.\n\nAs Southport struggles to come to terms with this shocking tragedy, hundreds of locals attended a vigil in the town centre yesterday evening, which was observed respectfully. However, not far away, chaos was unfolding.\n\nRead more: 39 police officers injured as violence escalates with cars torched and mosque targeted Read more: Police name second man charged after stabbing at city centre bar\n\nPolice were called to a disturbance during a protest outside a mosque on St Luke's Road in the town. In what has been labelled as 'sickening' scenes, dozens of officers were injured and a major incident was declared. Bricks taken from garden walls were used to attack officers and cars belonging to members of the public were set ablaze, reports the Liverpool Echo.\n\nEight police officers sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion. Other officers suffered head injuries and serious facial injuries. One officer was knocked unconscious.\n\nViolence erupted in Southport when a group, believed to be English Defence League supporters, began attacking a local mosque on St Luke's Road and setting cars ablaze on Tuesday evening. The unrest saw damage to a convenience store, wheelie bins torched, and even three police dogs injured.\n\nSocial media has been flooded with images and footage of individuals throwing rocks at officers, climbing on police vans, and trying to break the windows. The outbreak of violence has drawn condemnation from figures including the Prime Minister and Home Secretary.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most poignant plea for peace comes from Jenni Stancombe, whose daughter was one of the three young girls tragically killed in Southport on Monday. In a heartfelt message that has gone viral on social media, she implored: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\"\n\nMs Stancombe praised the police, saying: \"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss expressed his pride in the force's response to violence in Southport: \"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack. I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\"\n\nHe continued, detailing the damage caused by offenders: \"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park.\"\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer commented on the incident: \"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday.

Angry mobs chanted 'Stop the boats' and kicked out at police vans sent to restore order.\n\nRead More Moment Southport rioter gets hit in the head with a brick... and then again where it REALLY hurts\n\nSome threw smoke bombs, with men wearing caps and shorts charging at outnumbered police.\n\nScores of riot vans and patrol cars raced to the scene as a police helicopter hovered overhead as the violence spread out of control.\n\nHuge crowds of men, many masked and wearing hoodies, were seen clashing with police - as stones, bottles, bricks and fireworks were launched.\n\nDemonstrators could be heard shouting 'No surrender' and 'English till I die'.\n\nOne police officer was seen being helped into a van by his colleagues with blood streaming down his face and a heavily bandaged head. A female officer was also seen with a cut cheek.\n\nBy 8pm, around 500 rioters had massed in two streets outside the mosque - Sussex Road and St Luke's Road - trapping around 40 police officers in the middle.\n\nMissiles were hurled at riot officers and dog handlers from both sides. Bottles, bricks, fireworks and lumps of concrete were thrown to cheers from the rioters, who goaded police and eyes each other on.\n\nAt about 8.15pm a crowd surrounded three riot vans and began rocking one to try and flip it over.\n\nMoments later a small explosion was heard and a mini-fireball erupted in the air as the van went up in flames.\n\nOne man shouted: 'We're doing this for our girls!' as officers drove the other vans away from the fire to stop them also being set alight.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to quell the disorder, a charge from riot police brandishing batons sent around 300 of the rioters fleeing down the street as reinforcements flooded the area.\n\nBut violence continued into the night, with rioters forming a burning barricade of wheelie bins as they hurled bricks and lumps of concrete at riot police.\n\nMobs chanting 'save our girls' clashed with police until 10.30pm outside the Southport Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre.\n\nA nearby corner shop looked to have been broken into and looted. Rioters set alight at least five wheelie bins in the middle of Sussex Road sending flames and toxic black plumes of smoke shooting up into the night's sky.\n\nWith officers unable to charge due to the burning barricade, a volley of missiles was hurled from behind the makeshift bonfire.\n\nAt one point the ferocity of the violence sent the line of police retreating slightly. Officers in a Merseyside Police helicopter continued to monitor events from the air.\n\nThe crowd began to thin out around 11pm with reports of disturbances - including cars being torched - breaking out across Southport.\n\nDuring the demonstration, several people carried placards with slogans about stopping the boats.

Why are they not stopping the migrants coming in?\n\n'How many more children will be killed because they are letting them all in? They should be at the borders stopping them.'\n\nHer comments came after inaccurate posts by social media sleuths about the identity of the perpetrator have received millions of views and engagements.\n\nSunder Katwala, director of the think-tank British Future, said a bogus news channel seemed to have invented a fake name for the suspect and run a false story that was shared online.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Goss said: 'There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n'We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\n\n'It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.'\n\nThe riots went on late into the evening, with police officers desperately trying to regain control\n\nRiot police wearing helmets and shields try to defend themselves near the mosque\n\nRiot police officers storm into the area to try and disperse the growing crowd\n\nAlso on Tuesday evening, officers were called to reports of a man carrying a weapon at around 6.50pm, during which time the vigil was taking place at the Atkinson venue.\n\nPolice swooped on the scene and detained the man minutes later before seizing the flick knife.\n\nA 32-year-old man dressed in all black, from Standish, was arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article, and taken into custody. There were no reports of any injuries during the incident.\n\nDetective Inspector Gavin Mulcahy said: 'We know too well the devastating impact knife crime can have for victims, their families and friends, and those who carry them.\n\n'This week has seen an unspeakable tragedy unfold in Southport, and this incident occurred a short distance from where a vigil had been happening where the community was paying their respects to all those affected.\n\n'Officers made a swift arrest and have seized a knife that could have been used to cause harm in our communities.\n\n'Those offenders who carry them have no place whatsoever in our communities.\n\n'Every day we are carrying out stop checks, warrants and land searches to take knives off our streets, but as this incident shows, the assistance of members of the public in telling us where they are stored and who is carrying them is vital to ensure the safety of families and residents.'\n\nAt the vigil, tearful locals laid flowers outside the Merseyside town's grand Atkinson building after falling silent to remember Bebe, Elsie and nine-year-old Alice.\n\nIn the first week of the summer holidays, the seaside town should be bustling with happy families and tourists. But at 6pm on Tuesday, more than 5,000 people stood in silence outside the Atkinson building amid an outpouring of grief and shock.\n\nIn front of the Grade II-listed building, which comprises a theatre, museum and library, is the Town Hall Gardens, where a sea of floral tributes built up.\n\nOne heartbreaking poster surrounded by candles and flowers said 'never stop dancing'. The children had been enjoying a summer holiday dance workshop when a knifeman entered the studio and launched a frenzied attack.\n\nAmong the bouquets, there were also a number of Taylor Swift-style friendship bracelets. 'Thinking of you all,' a row of four of them spelt out.\n\nAhead of the vigil, the families and schools of the innocent girls who were fatally attacked by a crazed knifeman also released tributes.\n\nIn a statement, Bebe's family said: 'No words can describe the devastation that has hit our family as try to deal with the loss of our little girl Bebe.'\n\nThe family of Alice Dasilva Aguiar added: 'Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our Princess, like we said before to you, you're always our princess and no one would change that. Love from Your Hero Daddy and Mummy.'\n\nAnd the headteacher of Farnborough Road Infant School said they were 'heartbroken and devastated' by the death of pupil Elsie.\n\nJennifer Sephton said: 'Elsie has been a loving and bright member of our wonderful community since first being brought here on her father's shoulders, and even at her early age she was such a caring and charismatic young lady who loved to please.\n\n'Elsie was a kind and caring friend to all who met her and was adored by everyone in our community. Our hearts and most deeply-felt sympathies go out to Elsie's family, friends and our Farnborough community who have been left numb by what has happened.\n\n'It is immensely difficult to put into words how amazing Elsie was and the impact she had on those around her. We will miss you dearly Elsie. You were one of a kind.'\n\nAlder Hey Children's hospital this afternoon released a statement confirming that seven children had been taken to the site for treatment. One of those was Alice, and of the others, two remain in a critical condition, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe head of the school trust attended by Alice and Bebe said the girls 'will be in our hearts forever'.\n\nEndeavour Learning Trust chief executive David Clayton said 'no words can do justice to what has happened here in Southport.\n\nThe trust contains Churchtown Primary School in Southport, which Alice and Bebe had both attended.\n\nChurchtown Primary headteacher Jinnie Payne said the school had heard the 'tragic news' with 'great sadness', describing the stabbings as an 'atrocity'.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Clayton said: 'No words can do justice to what has happened here in Southport - and our hearts are broken for the families who have lost their children.\n\n'No one should ever have to experience horror like this.\n\n'Our immediate focus now is on providing support to the community as we start to understand what has happened. The death of a child is always a desperate tragedy for a school, and particularly so under such circumstances.\n\n'We will come together as a community, offering each other support and care as we work through this difficult time.\n\n'Alice and Bebe will be in our hearts forever.'\n\nMs Payne said Alice, a Year 4 pupil at Churchtown, was the 'happiest of souls, a true ray of sunshine'.\n\nThe Churchtown Primary headteacher added: 'She was known and loved by everyone in our school community of 700 children, a testament to her unique ability to connect with others.\n\n'Alice's radiant smile brightened our days, and she embraced every aspect of school life with enthusiasm and joy.\n\n'Her kindness, playful nature, and zest for trying new things will forever be remembered. Alice, you will always hold a special place in our hearts at Churchtown.'\n\nMs Payne said Bebe, a former pupil at the school, was a 'joyful girl' whose 'kindness radiated through the entire Churchtown community'.\n\nThe headteacher added: 'During her time at the school, Bebe's considerate nature and her love of learning shone through in everything that she did.\n\n'Each day, she would come into school ready to grasp every opportunity available to her and fun and laughter were never far away whenever Bebe was involved.\n\n'Her considerate nature meant that she had many friends and she always ensured all children felt included, whether that was through play or working together in the classroom.\n\n'Bebe's memory will live on in the hearts of all who knew her.'\n\nThe headteacher added: 'We know that a number of other children from Churchtown were also involved in the attack, along with much-loved colleagues.\n\n'We extend our heartfelt wishes to all those families affected by this horrific incident, including those currently in hospital or continuing to receive treatment.'\n\nDevastated relatives of Alice said she had been taken by a 'despicable human being.'\n\nHer mother Alexandra Aguiar is understood to be originally from Caracas in Venezuela and her dad David Aguiar is from the Portuguese island of Madeira.\n\nRelative Carina Aguiar, a hotel worker who lives in Camara de Lobos in Madeira, posted a link on her social media to news Merseyside Police had confirmed a third child' had died following the attack and wrote tear emojis beside it.\n\nEarlier she posted a photo of a black ribbon on her Facebook alongside Alice's name after writing in an emotional tribute: 'Princess Alice. In this moment of great pain my soul hurts, my body hurts, my mind hurts. I have a lump in my throat.\n\n'You were just an innocent child, a happy smiley girl with a bright life ahead of you which a despicable human being took away from you, without pity, for no reason.'\n\nReacting to the riots, Merseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy posted on X: 'I am incredibly proud of my officers and staff who have worked so hard to save the lives of children, investigate the horrific incident from yesterday, working with partners to provide reassurance to our communities and now they are facing this level of violence from these thugs\n\n'Over 1000 residents from Southport came together this evening to remember the little girls who have died, those who are still critical in hospital and all those who witnessed & are traumatised by the events from yesterday. This is where all of our focus should be.'\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley said: 'It's distressing to see people from outside our Southport community attacking our police and local people.\n\n'I want to make it clear that I fully condemn any attack on our emergency services, these are the same services that responded to the tragic attack yesterday.\n\n'I appeal to local people to avoid the area and stay safe, to allow the police to do their job.'\n\nMr Hurley continued: 'I want to thank our community for pulling together and supporting every person who has been affected by Monday's tragic attack.\n\n'Nowhere was this more evident than the solidarity, remembrance and sympathy heard at today's vigil.\n\n'To those who laid flowers, candles, toys, thank you. I was deeply saddened to hear the news today of the death or a third child. Bebe, Elsie and Alice are in all of our thoughts and hearts today.'\n\nThe three girls stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class were yesterday named by police as nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and six-year-old Bebe King (L-R)\n\nAway from the protest, a vigil was being held for the three girls who died in the tragic incident\n\nIn stark contrast to the riots, there was a sense of tranquillity around the site of the vigil\n\nThe vigil was held at the Atkinson in Southport at around 6pm on Tuesday evening\n\nThe Southport Mosque said it was 'truly shocked and saddened to hear about the events that unfolded today'. They added: 'We extend our deepest sympathy to the families of all affected. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all.'\n\nThe Liverpool Region Mosque Network said it was 'shocked and horrified' by the knife rampage on Monday.\n\nBut it added: 'A minority of people are attempting to portray that this inhumane act is somehow related to the Muslim community. Frankly it is not, and we must not let those who seek to divide us and spread hatred use this as an opportunity.\n\n'This evening, we have seen distressing scenes outside Southport Mosque with angry protesters, gathering outside. This is causing further fear and anxiety within our communities. We must all unite and stand together against all forms of hate, violence and division.'\n\nAnd the The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) condemned 'shocking scenes of far-right rioters running amok outside a mosque'.\n\nThe MCB says Islamaphobic backlash began with a false rumour on the internet which was then stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims.\n\nMCB secretary-general Zara Mohammed said: 'At a time of great tragedy, loss, and mourning, we must stand firm against the cynical forces of hatred and division. This does not represent our diverse Britain and the people of Southport.\n\n'The Government must address the increasing rise of violent far-right extremism targeting Muslim communities. More must be done to tackle Islamophobia and offer reassurance at this time.'\n\nShe added: 'We commend the authorities for their swift action, and our prayers are with the mosque, the families of the victims of yesterday's attack, and the local community.'\n\nDowning Street also warned against 'unhelpful' speculation amid concerns that misreporting online could inflame community tensions.\n\nAn aerial view of Hart Street on Monday, where a horrifying knife attack took place just before midday\n\nOfficers should be given the space to probe the case without people guessing at the possible motive or circumstances, No 10 said.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Prime Minister was repeatedly asked 'how many more children will die?' as he placed flowers at the scene of the attack.\n\nSir Keir's brief visit, which lasted around two minutes, was interrupted by some members of the public heckling him.\n\nAs the Prime Minister walked past, one man declared: 'Here's your photo opportunity.'\n\nAnother shouted: 'How many more children? Our kids are dead and you're leaving already?'\n\nOther furious onlookers shouted 'scumbag', 'time for change' and 'go away, you're not wanted'.\n\nAnother woman said: 'I've just found out my friend's nine-year-old daughter was killed, the person I've held as a child, and you can't do s***.'\n\nAnd a different man shouted: 'Get the truth out!'\n\nMs Cooper has said social media companies 'need to take some responsibility' for some activity in the aftermath of the attack.\n\nResponding to shadow home secretary James Cleverly, she said: 'I agree with him too about the responsibility on every one of us. The police do need to be able to pursue this investigation.\n\n'There will be wider questions for other days, but the most important thing is that every one of us supports the police in their investigation now.\n\n'I agree with him too about the responsibility on social media companies, because we do need to recognise there are things that are taking place on social media that go against their terms and conditions, and their commitments as well. They need to take some responsibility for that.\n\n'Above all, this is about young children. This is about children and their families who will be grieving, and the many other children who were involved yesterday who will be facing great trauma as well.'\n\nHer counterpart Mr Cleverly called for people not to 'get involved in the grief of others' by sharing misinformation relating to the Southport attack on social media.\n\n'Enough people are already distressed without their distress being amplified by speculation and gossip online,' he added.\n\nAhead of fears mounting over a far-right rally, Sir Keir's official spokesman said: 'Of course, people should listen the police, they should not do anything that is going to make the police's job harder to manage the situation, to conduct their investigations.\n\n'It is unhelpful to speculate on things like the motive and the circumstance around this.'\n\nPolice have said that, although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

The unrest began when several hundred people, most of them men, began targeting a Southport mosque, setting vehicles and wheelie bins on fire and attacking a local shop.\n\nBottles and bricks were thrown at police who linked the rioters to the English Defence League, a group that has sometimes staged violent demonstrations against Islam.\n\nOff-duty officers and reinforcements from other forces were brought in to restore calm.\n\n\"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport,\" Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said in the statement, adding that officers had \"displayed ... courage whilst under constant and sustained attack\".\n\nThe violence broke out shortly after hundreds of people gathered in the town centre to pay tribute to those killed in the attack, laying flowers and toys. Three girls were killed in the attack while eight children were injured, with five of them in critical condition in hospital. Two adults who tried to protect them also remain in critical condition.\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer promised that the \"full force of the law\" would be used against the rioters.\n\n\"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday,\" he wrote on the social media platform X. \"They deserve our support and our respect. Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves.\"\n\nPolice have arrested a teenager for murder and attempted murder over the stabbings, saying the suspect was born in the Welsh city of Cardiff and lived in a village near Southport.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,\" Goss said.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nGoss and local politicians said many of those involved in Tuesday's violence came from outside the area, while the Liverpool Region Mosque Network said a minority of people were trying to use the incident to spread hatred.\n\n\"This evening we have seen distressing scenes outside Southport Mosque with angry protesters gathering outside,\" it said in a statement. \"This is causing further fear and anxiety within our communities.\"\n\nThe three girls who died in the attack have been named as six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar, whose parents are Portuguese.\n\n\"Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our princess, like we said before to you, you're always our princess and no one would change that,\" Aguiar's family said in a statement.\n\nWriting on Instagram, singer Taylor Swift said she was \"completely in shock\" over \"the loss of life and innocence, and the

disorder in Southport, North West Ambulance Service said.\n\nThe service said 27 officers were taken to hospital.\n\nA statement on X said: \"We treated 39 patients in total, all of which were police officers. 27 were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose, and a concussion.\n\nThree police dogs were also injured in the chaos, with Zoe and Ike suffering leg injuries from bricks thrown at them.\n\nA third dog, Quga - who was bitten, strangled and kicked by an offender at the beginning of this month - suffered burns to her back leg, the force said.\n\nMerseyside Police said those involved in the unrest - who they believe included supporters of the English Defence League - set alight cars belonging to members of the public, threw bricks at the local mosque, damaged a local convenience store, and set wheelie bins on fire.\n\nExtra police will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities.\n\nA 24-hour Section 60 Order was introduced in the area running from 7.54pm on Tuesday, which gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals and is designed to minimise serious violence.\n\nMerseyside police said these powers would not be used for anyone visiting the area and going about their daily business.\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Goss, said: \"Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\n\n\"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the mosque car park.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nMerseyside Police urged anyone with information on the disorder or who has video footage of those involved to contact the force.\n\nThe rioting followed a frenzied stabbing attack in Southport on Monday at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nEight other children were also stabbed, with five children and two adults left in a critical condition.\n\nA 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart Street.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain says Islamaphobic backlash began with a false rumour on the internet which was then stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims.\n\nThe MCB paid tribute to the three young girls killed in Southport on Monday, before condemning \"shocking scenes of far-right rioters running amok outside a mosque\".", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki",

Trouble, however, was brewing nearby.\n\nPolice initially raced to the disturbance outside a mosque on St Luke's Road in the town before the violence spread.\n\nBricks taken from garden walls were used to attack officers and cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire, police said. Eight police officers sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion. Other officers suffered head injuries and serious facial injuries. One was knocked unconscious.\n\nPolice said the violence started when a large group of people, believed by police to be supporters of the English Defence League, began to throw items towards the mosque.\n\nGreater Manchester Police officers were drafted in to support their Merseyside colleagues.\n\nMerseyside Police assistant chief constable Alex Goss said last night the force faced 'serious violence' and off-duty officers paraded back on.\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park,\" he said.\n\nPrime Minister SIr Keir Starmer said: \"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday.

Dozens of residents were outside Southport mosque with brushes and shovels on Wednesday morning, after violent protests that saw bricks, stones and bottles thrown at police and cars set alight.\n\nNorman Wallis, chief executive of Southport Pleasureland, said people had travelled from out of town to wreak havoc, leaving locals to clean up the mess.\n\nMr Wallis, who was helping at the junction of Sussex Road and St Luke's Road on Wednesday, said volunteers joined the clean-up partly in response to a social media plea he put out after witnessing the violence on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe added: \"It's horrendous what those hooligans have done last night. It was like a war scene. People from out of town just causing absolute mayhem.\n\n\"People in hoods climbing up lampposts, throwing bricks, they set a police car on fire. But none of those people were the people of Southport. The people of Southport are the ones here today cleaning the mess up. Those people from out of town - they came in in buses and cars and had a change of clothes. They just started to riot and do this.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items such as bricks towards the mosque in the seaside town at about 7.45pm. Officers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them and police vehicles were damaged and set on fire.\n\nIn a post on social media, the force said shops had been \"broken into and looted\", adding that \"those responsible will be brought to justice\".", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_scheerhout@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "John Scheerhout", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-order_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public-order crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seaside resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasureland_Southport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pleasureland Southport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Evening_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Evening News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Normans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_hooliganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football hooliganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29646956.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_pp-southport-trouble-03jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.7176470588235294, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

A peaceful vigil in the centre of the town was followed by a protest outside a mosque in St Luke's Road that quickly descended into mindless violence.\n\nIn what have been described as 'sickening' scenes, dozens of officers were injured and a major incident declared. Bricks taken from garden walls were used to attack officers and cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire. Eight police officers sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion. Other officers suffered head injuries and serious facial injuries. One was knocked unconscious.\n\nThe violence started when a large group of people, who police said are believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road on Tuesday evening. Cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire and bricks were thrown at a local mosque. Damage was also caused to a local convenience store and wheelie bins were set on fire, police said. Three police dogs have also been injured. Photos and videos shared online show large groups hurling rocks at police officers, climbing on police vans and attempting to smash the vehicles' windows.\n\nBut while many of the images shared of the night depict violence and thuggery, one woman was pictured attempting to project a different message altogether. The picture shows a woman stood in front of some of those violent scenes, holding aloft a sign which reads 'one race - human, hope not hate - racism, not welcome here.'\n\nVideo footage shared online shows the woman attempting to hold the sign up and being challenged and shouted at by those protesting. At one point someone tries to grab the sign out of her hands. The violence has been widely condemned - including by the Prime Minister and Home Secretary - but there will be no more powerful voice in this than of the mother of one of the three little girls so tragically killed in Southport on Monday. In a message widely shared on social media, Jenni Stancombe said: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\"\n\nSpeaking about the police, Ms Stancombe added: \"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\" Last night, Merseyside Police assistant chief constable Alex Goss said: \"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.

Photograph: Temilade Adelaja/Reuters\n\nAccording to reports, misinformation being spread on social media about the ethnicity and religion of the 17-year-old male suspect in police custody led to the rioting at the mosque in Southport on Tuesday night.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had earlier visited the site of Monday's brutal stabbing attack on a dance studio on Hart Street, condemned the mobs for hijacking the vigil and insulting the grieving community with their actions.\n\n\"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and our respect,\" said Starmer.\n\n\"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law,\" he said.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Bebe King, 6, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, were named as the victims of the fatal stabbing. Eight others were seriously injured, five of whom remain in critical condition in hospital.\n\nThe Merseyside police have said it was currently not treating the incident as terror-related.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets. We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time,\" said Alex Goss, assistant chief constable of the force.\n\nThe police said 22 of its officers sustained serious injuries, including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion. The rioters set cars belonging to members of the public alight, threw bricks at the local mosque and damaged a local convenience store, and set large refuse bins on fire.\n\nAs a result, strict legal orders have been enforced in the area designed to minimise serious violence and giving additional powers to officers to tackle anti-social behaviour.\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the mosque car park. This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday,\" said Goss, as he appealed for information to bring those involved to justice.\n\nThe police attracted strong support from the local community, who believed the English Defence League (EDL) supporting mob was whipped up largely from outside the town.\n\nThe disorder flared up after thousands gathered at the peace vigil to pay tribute to three girls killed and pray for those fighting for their lives in the knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club dance event at Hart Street community centre.\n\nMeanwhile, two adults who were critically injured in the attack have been named locally as yoga teacher Leanne Lucas, who co-organised the dance session for a group of six to 11-year-olds, and John Hayes, who works at the Hart Space where the stabbings took place.\n\n\"It is extremely important that people don't spread damaging misinformation online. False information has already been extensively shared in the last 24 hours,\" urged UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.\n\n\"In these dark and difficult moments, the police must be able to get on with their work and communities must be given the time and space to grieve and heal without outside voices seeking to use events to stir up division or advance their own views,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, more than GBP 2,15,000 has been raised by Taylor Swift fans via a 'Swifties for Southport Just Giving' page for the funerals of the children who were killed and for the families of the injured.\n\nThe money will also go to Alder Hey Children's Hospital where some of the victims are being treated.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors":

More must be done to tackle Islamophobia and offer reassurance at this time.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, police named the three girls killed in the stabbing as Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9.\n\nEight other children suffered stab wounds in the attack and five of them are in critical condition, police said. Two adults also remain in critical condition after being injured in the attack.\n\nPolice shared a tribute from the family of King, who said: \"No words can describe the devastation that has hit our family as we try to deal with the loss of our little girl Bebe.\"\n\nPrime Minister Starmer and other officials visited the site of the attack on Tuesday, paying tribute to the victims and thanking emergency responders who attended the scene.\n\nStarmer laid a wreath of cream and yellow-colored flowers, alongside floral tributes left by the local community.\n\nTaylor Swift, whose music was the theme of the dance class targeted in the attack, said Tuesday she was \"completely in shock.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

- who was bitten, strangled and kicked by an offender at the beginning of this month - suffered burns to her back leg, the force said.\n\nMerseyside Police said those involved in the unrest - who they believe included supporters of the English Defence League - set alight cars belonging to members of the public, threw bricks at the local mosque, damaged a local convenience store, and set wheelie bins on fire.\n\nExtra police will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities.\n\nA 24-hour Section 60 Order was introduced in the area running from 7.54pm on Tuesday,

police the power to direct people engaging in antisocial behaviour or are likely to become involved in such incidents.\n\nMerseyside police said these powers would not be used for anyone visiting the

They just started to riot and do this.\"\n\nScotland's former first minister Humza Yousaf called for the EDL to be banned under terror laws in the wake of the unrest, despite former leader Tommy Robinson's insistence that the group no longer exists.\n\nOfficers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them and police vehicles were damaged and set on fire.\n\nIn a post on social media, the force said shops had been \"broken into and looted\", adding that \"those responsible will be brought to justice\".\n\nElsie's mother, Jenni Stancombe, wrote on Facebook: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\n\n\"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nThe troubling scenes saw 27 officers taken to hospital, with 12 others being treated and discharged at the scene, North West Ambulance Service said.\n\nChief Constable Serena Kennedy said the officers injured in Tuesday's protests will \"now be unavailable for duty in what is an incredibly busy time for the force\".\n\nVideos posted on social media showed people throwing wheelie bins and bricks at officers who held riot shields to push the crowds back.\n\nThe chairman of Merseyside Police Federation, Chris McGlade, said more than 50 officers had been hurt in a \"sustained and vicious attack\".\n\nHe added: \"Police officers are not robots. We are mothers and fathers. Sons and daughters. Husbands, wives and partners.\n\n\"We should be going home at the end of our shifts. Not to hospital.\"\n\nAs well as the three children who died, eight other youngsters suffered stab wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured, police said.\n\nThe vigil was followed by the protest outside the mosque as demonstrators chanted far-right slogans and clashed with police in St Luke's Road.\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley, speaking on Wednesday, said rioters must face the \"full force of the law\", saying they were \"utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children\".\n\nHe condemned \"beered-up thugs\" who threw bricks, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all.\"\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said rioters had \"hijacked\" a vigil for victims and will \"feel the full force of the law\", while Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", which she branded \"appalling\".\n\nThe suspect, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport, and a road in the area was cordoned off by detectives on Monday afternoon.\n\nPolice have said that although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.\n\nA 32-year-old man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possession of a flick knife in Eastbank Street, near where the vigil took place on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe was taken into custody and there were no reports that anyone was injured during the incident, Merseyside Police said.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

In a far cry from the peaceful vigil held minutes earlier commemorating the victims of Monday's stabbings, protesters hurled bricks at a mosque and abused police officers, setting fire to a van.\n\nAt least five officers were injured in the violence, with one suffering a suspected broken nose. Yobs demolished garden walls and used the bricks to pelt police. Locals hit out at the shameful displays as police were left picking up the pieces in an already devastated town.\n\nMr Nasuh, 55, a Muslim born in Turkey, watched the riot unfold from his home. He told The Mirror : \"My first thought is that the people who lost their loved ones yesterday are having to deal with this insult on top of their sorrow.\n\n\"I'm seeing an organised criminal riot. I'm feeling that I've been here 40 years and this isn't the British experience. This is something alien. This is not love, this is not humanity. This is sad. I just feel so bad for the parents having to deal with this too. They live here. This is all I can think of.\"\n\nZulficar Ismail Ibrahim, 53, who worships at the mosque, said: \"This makes me very sad. It is not good for the community.\" Merseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items towards the mosque at around 7.45pm.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, we have seen overwhelming support and sympathy from the community and wider Merseyside communities for the families who are currently trying to deal with their loss and care for victims injured during the major incident. Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face. Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavour to prevent disorder.\n\n\"The actions in Southport tonight will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside. There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time. Our officers should not have to face this, but we will be there tonight to ensure the safety of the local community who have suffered enough, and will arrest those involved in criminal behaviour.\"\n\nMerseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy posted on X: \"I am incredibly proud of my officers and staff who have worked so hard to save the lives of children, investigate the horrific incident from yesterday, working with partners to provide reassurance to our communities and now they are facing this level of violence from these thugs.\n\n\"Over 1,000 residents from Southport came together this evening to remember the little girls who have died, those who are still critical in hospital and all those who witnessed & are traumatised by the events from yesterday.

Jenni Stancombe, the mother of seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe took to social media to make the powerful appeal.\n\nHer young daughter died after the horror attack at a Taylor Swift dance party in Hart Street on Monday lunchtime. Nine-year-old Alice Aguiar and six-year-old Bebe King also died in the attack, while two adults and five other children remain critically ill in hospital.\n\nWith Southport continuing to try to come to terms with this appalling tragedy, hundreds of people made their way to a vigil in the town centre yesterday evening, which was respectfully observed. However, nearby, trouble was brewing. Police raced to a disturbance taking place during a protest outside a mosque on St Luke's Road in the town.\n\nIn what have been described as 'sickening' scenes, dozens of officers were injured and a major incident declared. Bricks taken from garden walls were used to attack officers and cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire. Eight police officers sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion. Other officers suffered head injuries and serious facial injuries. One was knocked unconscious.\n\nThe violence started when a large group of people, who police said are believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road on Tuesday evening. Cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire and bricks were thrown at a local mosque. Damage was also caused to a local convenience store and wheelie bins were set on fire, police said. Three police dogs have also been injured. Photos and videos shared online show large groups hurling rocks at police officers, climbing on police vans and attempting to smash the vehicles' windows.\n\nThe violence has been widely condemned - including by the Prime Minister and Home Secretary - but there will be no more powerful voice in this than of the mother of one of the three little girls so tragically killed in Southport on Monday. In a message widely shared on social media, Jenni Stancombe said: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\"\n\nSpeaking about the police, Ms Stancombe added: \"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\" Last night, Merseyside Police assistant chief constable Alex Goss said: \"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack. I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park.\"\n\nPrime Minister SIr Keir Starmer said: \"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and our respect. Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves.

In line with British law regarding minors, the police did not identify the suspect, and subsequently they warned that a name being circulated on social media was incorrect.\n\nAlex Goss, the assistant chief constable of the Merseyside police, said on Tuesday night, \"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\"\n\nHe added, \"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the U.K. and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nMany of those involved in the unrest, he noted, \"do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside.\"\n\nThe outbreak of violence, in which rioters set police cars on fire, destroyed vehicles belonging to locals, threw bricks at the mosque and damaged a convenience store, was deeply distressing for a community still grappling with the raw emotions after Monday's attack.\n\nThe police have said that they are still investigating the motive for the attack, but said it was \"not being treated as terrorist-related.\"\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday night, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, condemned the rioting and vowed to hold those who took part accountable.\n\n\"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves,\" Mr. Starmer wrote in a statement. \"They will feel the full force of the law.\"\n\nThe North West Ambulance Service, which covers the region, said that 39 patients, all of whom were police officers, had been treated for injuries. Twenty-seven of those officers had to be taken to the hospital.\n\nThe violence began shortly after thousands had gathered in the town for a vigil to honor the victims of the attack, with many crowding a central square grasping bouquets of flowers and teddy bears.\n\nA flood of disinformation online about the perpetrator of the attack was amplified by far-right influencers, including Tommy Robinson, an anti-Islam agitator and founder of the English Defense League, and Andrew Tate, another extremist online personality.\n\nMerseyside Police later said that 22 of its officers had been injured and that eight had sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and a concussion.\n\nOthers had head injuries, facial injuries and one was knocked unconscious, the force said.\n\nThe violence occurred a short walk from where the initial stabbings took place on Monday. As the evening light turned to darkness on Tuesday, smoke from the riot drifted over the makeshift memorial that had sprung up, the acrid black fumes visible on the horizon over the piles of flowers.\n\nMr. Goss of the Merseyside Police said that a number of off-duty police officers had been called in to support their colleagues, and he applauded their dedication while criticizing those who took part in the disorder.\n\n\"This is no way to treat a community,\" he said, \"least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com",

Three police dogs were wounded, with one suffering burns to the back of her leg.\n\nSir Keir Starmer condemned the violence on Tuesday night, saying: \"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them.\n\n\"They deserve our support and our respect.

This is where all of our focus should be.\"\n\nThe mosque at the centre of the protest had extended its \"deepest sympathies\" to the families of those caught up in Southport knife attack on Monday.\n\nIn a statement on Facebook, made well before the disorder, Southport Mosque's staff posted that they were \"truly shocked and saddened\" about Monday's attack.\n\nYet it became the flashpoint for rioters who shouted \"we are doing this for our girls\" as they threw missiles at police and the building.\n\nThe MP for Southport has said he is \"deeply concerned\" by the violent protests taking place this evening, and has urged people to \"stay safe\".\n\nIn a statement on X, formerly Twitter, Patrick Hurley said he \"fully condemns any attack\" on emergency services, pointing out these are the same services that responded to the tragic stabbing attack yesterday.\n\nTommy Robinson has said violent mobs in Southport are \"justified\" in their actions.\n\nIn an expletive-laden rant posted on X, formerly Twitter, the hard-Right figure said: \"Before anyone starts condemning the angry English men up in Southport, ask yourselves this, what do you f------ expect them to do.\n\n\"Don't call them hooligans - they're justified in their anger.\"\n\nMr Robinson, who fled Britain on Sunday night to \"put himself beyond the reach of authorities\" in the UK, where he was due to be in court over alleged contempt proceedings, said the protesters actions were driven by concerns over immigration.\n\nHis words appeared to refer to a rumour widely circulated on social media that the suspect arrested for the stabbing is from Syria. Police have since said this is misinformation, and said the suspect is in fact from Cardiff.\n\nRiot police have cleared the area directly outside the mosque and were standing guard with batons raised.\n\nA police van was blazing behind them, with black smoke filling the air.\n\nMasked youths were scouring the ground for bricks littering the floor to throw at lines of officers.\n\nHeavy thuds were heard as the vans took hits and police raised their shields against incoming missiles.\n\nRiot police with dogs have charged at protesters, pushing them back towards a railway bridge.\n\nMerseyside police has branded the protests \"sickening\", blaming the scenes of lawlessness on people from beyond Merseyside with little connection to the community.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, we have seen overwhelming support and sympathy from the community and wider Merseyside communities for the families who are currently trying to deal with their loss and care for victims injured during the major incident.\"\n\nHe added: \"Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face.

She was known and loved by everyone in our school community of 700 children, a testament to her unique ability to connect with others.\n\n\"Bebe was a joyful girl, whose kindness radiated through the entire Churchtown community.

More must be done to tackle Islamophobia and offer reassurance at this time.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, police named the three girls killed in the stabbing as Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9.\n\nEight other children suffered stab wounds in the attack and five of them are in critical condition, police said. Two adults also remain in critical condition after being injured in the attack.\n\nPolice shared a tribute from the family of King, who said: \"No words can describe the devastation that has hit our family as we try to deal with the loss of our little girl Bebe.\"\n\nPrime Minister Starmer and other officials visited the site of the attack on Tuesday, paying tribute to the victims and thanking emergency responders who attended the scene.\n\nStarmer laid a wreath of cream and yellow-colored flowers, alongside floral tributes left by the local community.\n\nTaylor Swift, whose music was the theme of the dance class targeted in the attack, said Tuesday she was \"completely in shock.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA number of clashes have been reported on the streets of Southport as protesters gathered outside a mosque after yesterday's children's dance party knife attacks that saw three girls killed.\n\nA police van appears to have been torched by the protesters, who have also been seen kicking down walls and picking up loose bits of stones to throw at police who had gathered this evening, Tuesday, July 30.\n\nPeople dressed in black were also seen jumping on top of police van while a blaze has also believed to have started during the violence, reports the Mirror.\n\nThe protesters have gathered around five minutes away from the scene of this evening's vigil which saw huge crowds gather to remember the young victims. Police later claimed the group was amde up of members of the right-wing English Defence League.\n\nA witness living near the protest said: \"A man knocked on our door screaming for help, his head was split open and pouring with blood.\n\n\"He was asking for a towel to help stop the blood.

The clashes took place after a vigil for three young girls -- six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar -- who were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop at the Hart Space studio in Hart Street on Monday.\n\nThe protest was fuelled by social media rumours suggesting an Islamist link to Monday's stabbings. However, authorities have stated that the 17-year-old suspect, who was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder, has no known links to Islam, reported the BBC.\n\nThe disturbance began on Tuesday evening after a peaceful vigil was held in the town centre where more than 1,000 people gathered to pay tribute to the victims and express solidarity with those affected.\n\nMOSQUE IN SOUTHPORT ATTACKED BY FAR-RIGHT MOB\n\nHowever, a group of protesters gathered near a mosque after the rumours throughout the day, leading to a violent confrontation with police.\n\nAs the disorder escalated, the group attacked the front of the mosque by throwing bricks, bottles, fireworks, and rocks. Officers donned protective gear and used riot shields to defend themselves as wheelie bins and other objects were hurled at them. Additionally, a police vehicle was set on fire, reported the BBC.\n\nThirty-nine Merseyside Police officers were injured, with 27 taken to hospital. Eight officers suffered serious injuries, including fractures, lacerations, and a suspected broken nose. Three police dogs were also injured, reported the Guardian.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", while Southport MP Patrick Hurley condemned the actions of \"thugs who had got the train in\" and were using the deaths of the children \"for their own political purposes\", reported BBC.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss described the violence as \"sickening\" and appealed for anyone with information or video footage to come forward to help identify those responsible.\n\nThe Home Secretary warned about disinformation linked to the attack, and the Muslim Council of Britain condemned the \"shocking scenes of far-right rioters running amok outside a mosque\" as an Islamophobic backlash.\n\nKEIR STARMER PROMISES FULL FORCE OF LAW AGAINST RIOTERS\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said those who rioted would \"feel the full force of the law\" and had \"hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery\".\n\nHe added that they had \"insulted the community as it grieves\".\n\nThe Home Secretary described the attacks on police officers as \"appalling\" and \"a total disgrace\".\n\nIn response to the violence, a 24-hour Section 60 Order was put in place, giving police extra stop and search powers.\n\nA Section 34 Order was also introduced, allowing police to direct people engaging in antisocial behaviour away from the area.\n\nExtra officers will remain in the area to provide a visible presence and reassure communities.\n\nThe violence has left the community of Southport reeling, with residents expressing fear for their safety as stones flew past and police officers rushed to put on riot gear.\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread condemnation, with the Muslim Council of Britain calling for unity against \"the cynical forces of hatred and division\", reported The Guardian.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [],

They deserve our support and our respect,\" said Starmer.\n\n\"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law,\" he said.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Bebe King, 6, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, were named as the victims of the fatal stabbing. Eight others were seriously injured, five of whom remain in critical condition in hospital.\n\nMerseyside Police have said it was currently not treating the incident as terror-related.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets. We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time,\" said Alex Goss, Assistant Chief Constable of the force.\n\nThe police said 22 of its officers sustained serious injuries, including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion. The rioters set cars belonging to members of the public alight, threw bricks at the local mosque and damaged a local convenience store, and set large refuse bins on fire.\n\nAs a result, strict legal orders have been enforced in the area designed to minimise serious violence and giving additional powers to officers to tackle anti-social behaviour.\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park. This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday,\" said Goss, as he appealed for information to bring those involved to justice.\n\nThe police attracted strong support from the local community, who believed the English Defence League (EDL) supporting mob was whipped up largely from outside the town.\n\nThe disorder flared up after thousands gathered at the peace vigil to pay tribute to three girls killed and pray for those fighting for their lives in the knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club dance event at Hart Street community centre.\n\nMeanwhile, two adults who were critically injured in the attack have been named locally as yoga teacher Leanne Lucas, who co-organised the dance session for a group of six to 11-year-olds, and John Hayes, who works at the Hart Space where the stabbings took place.\n\n\"It is extremely important that people don't spread damaging misinformation online. False information has already been extensively shared in the last 24 hours,\" urged UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.\n\n\"In these dark and difficult moments, the police must be able to get on with their work and communities must be given the time and space to grieve and heal without outside voices seeking to use events to stir up division or advance their own views,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, more than GBP 2,15,000 has been raised by Taylor Swift fans via a \"Swifties for Southport\" Just Giving page for the funerals of the children who were killed and for the families of the injured.\n\nThe money will also go to Alder Hey Children's Hospital where some of the victims are being treated.

Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves.'\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said 'scenes of thuggery' on the streets of Southport 'bear no relation' to the community which had been coming together.\n\nShe told broadcasters: 'I think everyone should be showing some respect for the community that is grieving and also for the police who are pursuing an urgent criminal investigation now, and who showed such heroism and bravery yesterday in the face of these horrific attacks.\n\n'I think everyone needs to support the police in that work, and frankly the scenes of thuggery that we have seen on the streets of Southport this evening bear no relation to the way in which the Southport community has been coming together to support each other and to support grieving families.\n\n'We need to see some respect for the grieving community and for the police in their urgent work.'\n\nPatrick Hurley, Southport's Labour MP, said this morning that the riots occurred because of the 'propaganda and lies' spread on social media about the identity of the attacker.\n\nHe told Times Radio: 'Because of the propaganda and the lies that were being spread around on social media from within minutes of the news breaking on Monday afternoon about the tragic incident.\n\n'We'd had all sorts of lies being spread and misinformation being spread about the alleged perpetrator and some people with the best of intentions then they tried to rebut this, they tried to argue back, but all that happens is you're just amplifying people's false messaging.'\n\nHe added: 'This misinformation doesn't just exist on people's internet browsers and on people's phones. It has real world impact.\n\n'And what happened is that the real world impact of that was that we then had hundreds of people descending on the town, descending on Southport from outside of the area, intent on causing trouble, either because they believe what they've written, or because they are bad faith actors who wrote it in the first place, in the hope of causing community division.'\n\nMr Hurley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the rioters were 'not from Southport' and must face the 'full force of the law'.\n\n'Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all,' he said.\n\n'Not least these beered-up thugs who have descended on the town last night intent on causing trouble.\n\n'We all have to stand against that and Southport will not accept this.\n\n'Southport will unite against this sort of thing.'\n\nA police van was set on fire near a mosque in Southport on Tuesday evening as riots broke out\n\nAround 200 protesters were seen taking to the streets. Police believe many were EDL supporters\n\nA burnt out police van near a mosque in Southport as shocking riots broke out on Tuesday\n\nRiot police vans were damaged amid the chaos near the Southport Mosque\n\nThe riots came barely an hour after thousands of mourners gathered for a vigil at the Atkinson in Southport\n\nIn stark contrast to the riots on the streets, there was a sense of tranquility at the site of the vigil as night fell\n\nMerseyside Police has issued a warning over an 'incorrect' name being widely circulated online, adding: 'We would urge people not to speculate on details of the incident while the investigation is ongoing.'\n\nThe angry mob - who police 'believed to be supporters of the English Defence League' - started targeting the Muslim place of worship at around 7.45pm.\n\nEight police officers suffered serious injuries, including one who was knocked unconscious. Protesters also torched cars and wheelie bins belonging to members of the public, shattered the mosque windows with bricks and looted shops.\n\nOne Southport resident living near the mosque told how he, his partner and their young daughter fled for the evening, not wanting her to see the sickening violence.\n\nThe man said: 'We just couldn't stay while this was going on and allow our daughter to witness it.\n\n'This doesn't represent Southport - they're EDL thugs who are from Manchester and Liverpool who have just come here to cause trouble. They have no respect for a town that's grieving.'\n\nPolice have introduced a 24-hour Section 60 Order in the area where the riots took place and extra officers will remain in the area.", "source":

Images and footage seen by the ECHO showed crowds surrounding police riot vans on the street.\n\nOne video captured a man in a balaclava climbing atop a police van amidst shouts and cheers from the crowd. Other clips showed glass bottles being hurled at a police van and flares being ignited.\n\nGet the latest news straight to your phone by joining us on WhatsApp\n\nA police van was also set ablaze. The police reported that officers on the scene were dealing with violent behaviour and criminal acts, including having wheelie bins and bottles thrown at them.\n\nThis resulted in an officer sustaining a suspected broken nose, and police vehicles being damaged and set on fire. Footage from the scene showed crowds gathering in front of officers wielding riot shields, with many people recording the events on their mobile phones, reports the Liverpool Echo.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives. In the last 24 hours, we have seen overwhelming support and sympathy from the community and wider Merseyside communities for the families who are currently trying to deal with their loss and care for victims injured during the major incident.\"\n\n\"Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face. Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavor to prevent disorder.\"\n\n\"The actions in Southport tonight will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside.

discharged at scene.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose, and a concussion.\n\nThree police dogs were also injured in the chaos, with Zoe and Ike suffering leg injuries from bricks thrown at them.\n\nA third dog, Quga - who was bitten, strangled and kicked by an offender at the beginning of this month - suffered burns to her back leg, the force said.\n\nMerseyside Police said those involved in the unrest - who they believe included supporters of the English Defence League - set alight cars belonging to members of the public, threw bricks at the local mosque, damaged a local convenience store, and set wheelie bins on fire.\n\nExtra police will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities.\n\nA 24-hour Section 60 Order was introduced in the area running from 7.54pm on Tuesday, which gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals and is designed to minimise serious violence.\n\nMerseyside police said these powers would not be used for anyone visiting the area and going about their daily business.\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Goss, said: \"Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\n\n\"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the mosque car park.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nMerseyside Police urged anyone with information on the disorder or who has video footage of those involved to contact the force.\n\nThe rioting followed a frenzied stabbing attack in Southport on Monday at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nEight other children were also stabbed, with five children and two adults left in a critical condition.\n\nA 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart Street.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain says Islamaphobic backlash began with a false rumour on the internet which was then stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims.\n\nThe MCB paid tribute to the three young girls killed in Southport on Monday, before condemning \"shocking scenes of far-right rioters running amok outside a mosque\".", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com",

Charred tarmac bore witness to the police vehicles which had been set alight.\n\n\"What I saw last night was absolutely appalling ... It was devastating and it's kind of taken away from actually what's gone on, which is the tragedy of those deaths,\" local resident David Burgess told Sky News.\n\n\"This is about the girls and the tragedy which has happened -- don't make it about this,\" he said, referring to the clashes. \"This isn't Southport.

I love you.\"\n\nOfficials in Lisbon have confirmed she Portuguese national, and that her parents were originally from Madeira.\n\nThe family of Bebe King, 6, said: \"No words can describe the devastation that has hit our family as try to deal with the loss of our little girl Bebe.\"\n\nElsie Dot Stancombe, 7, was identified as one of the first victims in the attack.\n\nA Merseyside Police statement added: \"Their families, who are being supported by specialist officers, have issued photographs and have asked that their privacy is respected at this time.\"\n\nA dance class teacher left fighting for her life after desperately trying to defend the children has been named as \"beautiful\" and \"creative\" Leanne Lucas, 35.\n\nShe was named locally as one of the organisers of the dance workshop.\n\nShe and a colleague are said to have helped shield up to 16 innocent children from the onslaught.\n\nSharing a picture of Leanne on Facebook, Sunshine Yoga wrote: \"I'm absolutely devastated. Please please pray for Leanne.\n\n\"Leanne came on my training course in December. A beautiful young creative girl who was so passionate about helping children. I just can't believe it. Please pray.\"\n\nA Merseyside police spokesperson said: \"Sadly we can confirm that a third child has passed away as a result of injuries sustained in a knife attack in Southport yesterday morning, Monday 29 July. The nine-year-old girl died in hospital in the early hours of this morning, Tuesday, 30 July.\n\n\"We can confirm that the children who died yesterday were girls aged six and seven years.\n\n\"Eight other children suffered stab wounds sustained during the attack, and five of them are in a critical condition.\n\n\"Two adults are also in a critical condition after being injured during the incident.\n\n\"Our specialist Family Liaison Officers are providing support to the families at this terrible time.\"\n\nMerseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said that with \"great sadness\", the children died as a result of their injuries.\n\nShe added that officers were called at 11.47am and were shocked to discover multiple people had been \"subjected to a ferocious attack and had suffered serious injuries\".\n\n\"It is understood that the children were attending a Taylor Swift event at a dance school when the offender, who was armed with a knife, walked into the premises and started to attack those inside. We believe that the adults who were injured were trying to protect the children at the time they were attacked,\" she said.\n\nHundreds of people took part in a peaceful vigil on Tuesday evening outside Southport's Atkinson arts venue, with many in tears as they laid flowers and cards of remembrance.\n\nThe vigil was followed by a protest outside a mosque in Southport as demonstrators chanting far-right slogans clashed with police in St Luke's Road.\n\nMerseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items towards the mosque at around 7.45pm.\n\nOfficers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them and police vehicles were damaged and set on fire.\n\nMerseyside Police said an officer suffered a suspected broken nose in chaotic scenes outside the mosque as missiles were thrown at the police.\n\nThe 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident in Hart Street, Southport, on Monday, Merseyside Police said.\n\nPolice said the suspect, who was born in Cardiff, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport, and a road in the area was cordoned off by detectives on Monday afternoon.\n\nMerseyside Police added: \"A name has been shared on social media in connection with the suspect in the incident in Southport.\n\n\"This name is incorrect and we would urge people not to speculate on details of the incident while the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nA local business owner, who was one of the people who called the police, said the incident in Southport was like a \"scene in a horror movie\".\n\nColin Parry, owner of Masters Vehicle Body Repairs on Hart Street, said he believed six or seven young girls had been stabbed.\n\nHe said: \"It's like something from America, not like sunny Southport.\"\n\nA local parent, who did not wish to be named, said his daughter was \"traumatised\" by the attack.\n\nHe said: \"My daughter was in it and she was traumatised. She ran away and she's safe.\"\n\nEyewitness Bare Varathan, 35, who owns a corner shop on Hart Street, said he was called by a staff member who told him, \"Boss, get to the shop!\"\n\nHe said: \"I saw seven to ten kids outside the nursery. They were injured, bleeding. They were in the road, running from the nursery.\n\n\"They had been stabbed, here, here, here, everywhere. (Mr Varathan indicated the neck, back and chest area).\n\n\"Somebody told me he had arrived in a taxi and had a knife.\"\n\nAccording to reports, personal trainer Joel Verite, 25, rushed to the aid of a woman who screamed \"forget about me, there's a fella in there stabbing kids\".\n\nHe is reported to have helped two other officers, one using a taser, to take down the suspect.\n\nThe 6ft personal trainer told Sky News: \"I just opened the door to see if anyone was there I go on to the bottom of the stairs and I look up and there's this guy there in a full tracksuit with his hood up and a knife. He didn't realise I would be there, we looked at each other and he's scurried off to the side.\n\n\"All I saw was a knife and I thought there was more people in there hurting people. I'm there by myself and I just wanted to hurt him so bad but at the same time I was scared for myself. I just wanted to help. I'm screaming then because I know where he is and I'm trying to get everyone to come to the door. We were there for ten minutes but it felt like a lifetime.\n\nHe added: \"Police finally turned up it was one officer he said to wait for backup because he only had one baton on him. His colleague came with a taser. These two officers go up the stairs and I'm right behind them. They tackle this guy down to the floor straight away. There was no kind of fight at all. I grabbed this girl and I start sprinting towards an ambulance... Once he was down it was kind of done but the damage had been done.\n\n\"I wish I had been able to do more to help. I feel disgusted at the entire situation.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said that the incident is not believed to be terror-related and that the motive currently remains unclear.\n\nOne of the events listed at the Hart Space, based on Hart Street, at the time of the stabbings was a Taylor Swift-themed dance class for children in school years two to six - aged between six and 11.\n\nA staff member at the Hart Space said there could have been as many as 25 children attending.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"The events are just truly awful and I know the whole country is deeply shocked at what they have seen and what they have heard.\n\n\"I know I speak for everybody in the whole country in saying our thoughts and condolences are with the victims, their families, their friends and with the wider community.\n\n\"It is impossible to imagine what they are going through right now.\"\n\nSir Keir also thanked the emergency services for their response, saying: \"They have responded to an awful incident today. I want to thank them for the professionalism they have shown in doing so.\"\n\nYvette Cooper has warned against \"speculating or commenting\" on the criminal investigation into the Southport attack before updates have been provided by police.\n\nWhen asked whether she could provide more information, including whether the suspect was known to authorities, the Home Secretary said: \"Merseyside Police are leading this extremely important and serious criminal investigation.\n\n\"This was a horrific attack and they need to be able to get on with that work, and they will provide us with updates.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeira", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madeira"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madeira"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Sefton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Borough of Sefton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Borough of Sefton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lisbon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lisbon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

officers were taken to hospital.\n\nA statement on X said: \"We treated 39 patients in total, all of which were police officers. 27 were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose, and a concussion.\n\nOther officers suffered head injuries, and serious facial injuries, and one was knocked unconscious.\n\nThree police dogs were also injured in the chaos, with Zoe and Ike suffering leg injuries from bricks thrown at them.\n\nA third dog, Quga - who was bitten, strangled and kicked by an offender at the beginning of this month - suffered burns to her back leg, the force said.\n\nMerseyside Police said those involved in the unrest - who they believe included supporters of the English Defence League - set alight cars belonging to members of the public, threw bricks at the local mosque, damaged a local convenience store, and set wheelie bins on fire.\n\nExtra police will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities.\n\nA 24-hour Section 60 Order was introduced in the area running from 7.54pm on Tuesday, which gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals and is designed to minimise serious violence.\n\nA Section 34 Order has also been introduced, giving police the power to direct people engaging in antisocial behaviour or are likely to become involved in such incidents.\n\nMerseyside police said these powers would not be used for anyone visiting the area and going about their daily business.\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Goss, said: \"Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\n\n\"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the mosque car park.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nMerseyside Police urged anyone with information on the disorder or who has video footage of those involved to contact the force.\n\nThe rioting followed a frenzied stabbing attack in Southport on Monday at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nThe attack saw Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, fatally stabbed at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nEight other children were also stabbed, with five children and two adults left in a critical condition.\n\nA 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart Street.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain says Islamaphobic backlash began with a false rumour on the internet which was then stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims.\n\nThe MCB paid tribute to the three young girls killed in Southport on Monday, before condemning \"shocking scenes of far-right rioters running amok outside a mosque\".", "source": {"uri": "theargus.co.uk",

In a far cry from the peaceful vigil held minutes earlier commemorating the victims of Monday's stabbings, protesters hurled bricks at a mosque and abused police officers, setting fire to a van.\n\nAt least five officers were injured in the violence, with one suffering a suspected broken nose. Yobs demolished garden walls and used the bricks to pelt police.\n\nLocals hit out at the shameful displays as police were left picking up the pieces in an already devastated town.\n\nMr Nasuh, 55, a Muslim born in Turkey, watched the riot unfold from his home. He told The Mirror: \"My first thought is that the people who lost their loved ones yesterday are having to deal with this insult on top of their sorrow.\n\n\"I'm seeing an organised criminal riot. I'm feeling that I've been here 40 years and this isn't the British experience. This is something alien.\n\n\"This is not love, this is not humanity. This is sad. I just feel so bad for the parents having to deal with this too. They live here. This is all I can think of.\"\n\nZulficar Ismail Ibrahim, 53, who worships at the mosque, said: \"This makes me very sad. It is not good for the community.\"\n\nThe local force said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items towards the mosque at around 7.45pm.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, we have seen overwhelming support and sympathy from the community and wider Merseyside communities for the families who are currently trying to deal with their loss and care for victims injured during the major incident.\n\n\"Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face. Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavour to prevent disorder\n\n\"The actions in Southport tonight will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside.\"\n\nHe continued: \"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time. Our officers should not have to face this, but we will be there tonight to ensure the safety of the local community who have suffered enough, and will arrest those involved in criminal behaviour.\"\n\nMerseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy posted on X: \"I am incredibly proud of my officers and staff who have worked so hard to save the lives of children, investigate the horrific incident from yesterday, working with partners to provide reassurance to our communities and now they are facing this level of violence from these thugs.\n\n\"Over 1,000 residents from Southport came together this evening to remember the little girls who have died, those who are still critical in hospital and all those who witnessed & are traumatised by the events from yesterday.

facial injuries, and one was knocked unconscious.\n\nThree police dogs were also injured in the chaos, with Zoe and Ike suffering leg injuries from bricks thrown at them.\n\nA third dog, Quga - who was bitten, strangled and kicked by an offender at the beginning of this month - suffered burns to her back leg, the force said.\n\nMerseyside Police said those involved in the unrest - who they believe included supporters of the English Defence League - set alight cars belonging to members of the public, threw bricks at the local mosque, damaged a local convenience store, and set wheelie bins on fire.\n\nExtra police will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities.\n\nA 24-hour Section 60 Order was introduced in the area running from 7.54pm on Tuesday, which gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals and is designed to minimise serious violence.\n\nA Section 34 Order has also been introduced, giving police the power to direct people engaging in antisocial behaviour or are likely to become involved in such incidents.\n\nMerseyside police said these powers would not be used for anyone visiting the area and going about their daily business.\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Goss, said: \"Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\n\n\"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the mosque car park.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nMerseyside Police urged anyone with information on the disorder or who has video footage of those involved to contact the force.\n\nThe rioting followed a frenzied stabbing attack in Southport on Monday at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nThe attack saw Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, fatally stabbed at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nEight other children were also stabbed, with five children and two adults left in a critical condition.\n\nA 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart Street.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain says Islamaphobic backlash began with a false rumour on the internet which was then stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims.\n\nThe MCB paid

It comes after the horrific knife attack that took place in a dance class and saw three children lose their lives.\n\nUnder the belief that the 17-year-old attacker was Muslim, EDL members set upon a mosque and a full blown riot unfolded. The claim that the murder suspect was associated with Islam was later debunked by officials.\n\nIn the violent affair on Tuesday evening (July 30), vehicles were set alight, multiple police officers were injured and the local area was wrecked. Though crowds began to disperse around 10.30pm, the aftermath of the riot has left bricks strewn across the area, after being ripped from garden walls.\n\nMeanwhile, the still-smouldering wreckage of the protesters' arson attacks, which have left a police van and multiple residents' cars in ruins, has left a trail smoke through the air - while three local families tonight grieve for their children killed in the attack.\n\nEight other young kids on their summer holidays were injured in the attack, which took place on Monday at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport. The three tragically killed in the attack were named on Tuesday as Bebe King (6), Elsie Dot Stancombe (7), and Alice Dasilva Aguiar (9).\n\nREAD MORE: Southport stabbing victims, aged 6, 7, and 9, pictured by police\n\nThe riots are believed to be linked to misinformation spread on social media in the wake of the attack, which was later confirmed to be false. It has been reported that 22 police officers were injured in the riots, with one being knocked unconscious and others facing fractures and lacerations due to the hours-long battle.\n\nAround a third of those injured experienced concussion, facial injuries and broken bones. In the wake of the EDL violence, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper branded the crowd as \"thugs\".\n\nWhile thousands in Southport paid their respects to the three killed in the attack and threw their arms around the stricken community, hundreds of suspected EDL agitators gathered outside a mosque in the area and threw bricks and set fires. Now, police have been granted extreme powers to prevent another riot taking place.\n\nUntil 8pm tomorrow, Merseyside Police have a Section 60 and Section 34 Order in place, giving them greater power to disperse crowds, as well as seize items and vehicles being used in anti social behaviour. The force has emphasised that these powers will not be used for anyone visiting the area or going about their daily business.\n\nPolice also confirmed that three police dogs had been injured by the rioters, with two having bricks thrown at them and another being burnt on the back of its legs.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\n\n\"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park.\n\n\"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\n\n\"We would appeal to anyone who has information or video footage of those involved in this shocking behaviour to come forward so we can identify and arrest those responsible.\n\n\"Anyone with information can DM @MerPolCC or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.\"\n\nThe North West Ambulance Service confirmed the high number of police injuries, which forced them to declare a Major Incident late on Tuesday night. They said this was due to the high amount of resources they were having to dedicate to the scene, including 10 ambulances and multiple on-call doctors.\n\nNWAS stated: \"We have treated 22 police officers and so far, 11 of those have been taken to hospital.\n\n\"Due to the high number of resources required at scene and the ongoing disturbance, NWAS declared a major incident at approximately 23:00.\"\n\nMeanwhile, public officials have expressed fears for the riot's impact on the already traumatised local community.\n\nPosting a statement on X, Liverpool Mayor Steve Rotheram said: \"There are families just coming to terms with yesterday's events, parents grieving for their murdered children and survivors still trying to process what they witnessed.\n\n\"The violent scenes in Southport tonight will only further traumatise a community that is already struggling to come to terms with this attack.\"\n\nWhile Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the thugs would feel the \"full force of the law\". He said in a statement on Tuesday night: \"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and our respect.\n\n\"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves.

Hundreds of people descended on the town, setting fire to both police and civilian's vehicles, damaging a mosque and ripping bricks off walls in order to hurl at officers.\n\nAnti-Muslim chants were shouted, despite police confirming the 17-year-old suspect in relation to the mass stabbing was born in Cardiff in Wales and there being no evidence of him having any links to Islam.\n\nThe violence began when a large group of people began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road on Tuesday evening. Cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire and bricks were thrown. Damage was also caused to a local convenience store and wheelie bins were set on fire, police said.\n\nThree police dogs have also been injured. Photos and videos shared online show large groups hurling rocks at police officers, climbing on police vans and attempting to smash the vehicles' windows. The violence has been widely condemned - including by the Prime Minister and Home Secretary, and also by the mother of one of the three little girls so tragically killed on Monday. In a message widely shared on social media, Jenni Stancombe said: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\"\n\nShe added: \"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\" Many on social media have condemned the disorder.\n\nBev Lee wrote: \"It's disgusting that anyone would react with such violence after such a tragic 'violent' act that families are still grieving for and hoping that the other individuals survive! There is no excuse for their behaviour- it's disgusting and sick,. Maybe they should channel some of their anger into helping and supporting the people of Southport rather than destroying at such a sad time.\"\n\nLisa Marie said: \"In those houses surrounding would have been other children who, after hearing about the events on Monday, would have been scared and needed calm and reassurance that they're safe. I can't even imagine the trauma and fear now. The police will be the first to respond and give life saving treatment if there's a serious incident again; who's going to those incidents if numbers of an already overwhelmed, overstretched force are taken off with injuries [and] there's no vehicles to get there in?\"\n\nJulie Edwards added: \"Those rioting should have more respect for those poor families who are dealing with their devastating losses. \"Shouldn't be making it about their hatred - targeting a mosque and injuring police officers.\"\n\nReacting to Jenni Stancombe's comments, Paula Scanlon said: \"She shouldn't have to be coming out and saying that, she should be able to be grieving with her family.\"\n\nNeil Griffin said: \"Putting local residents to the effort (and cost) of having to repair their damaged homes is a great way of showing support to the local, grieving community, isn't it? Not.\n\n\"But, it was never about that. Or the poor kids who were brutally killed and injured. It was about a chance to hijack a tragedy to indulge in sheer thuggery.\"\n\nHe added: \"The people of Southport don't want or need these idiots. The traumatic experience is still fresh in their minds. Exactly how does a gang of thugs turning up in masks, with cans of ale, laughing and joking amongst themselves and singing footie style chants help this community? It doesn't. Stay away. Leave them be.\"\n\nLast night, Merseyside Police assistant chief constable Alex Goss said: \"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.

He told the ECHO: \"We're all coming together to try and help the people in Sussex Road and the area to clean up for the mess that was made by all those people, those thugs, that came into their street.\n\n\"They just totally destroyed the street, pulled the walls down, pulled fences down, set cars on fire, just terrible. We're all coming together to just try and help as a community.\"\n\nNorman added that Southport is a \"wonderful\" place which needs to be \"shouted about\" and the behaviour of the people last night does not reflect the area.\n\nCathy McGrath has been out on the clean up since 7.15am this morning. She said that the town should be grieving. Speaking to the ECHO, she said: \"I feel just angry and upset really. I went to the vigil last night and it was beautiful for the girls and the children and then you see last night.\n\n\"Those people don't represent the community, these people represent the community. They've spoilt it really and that's why I have come out today.\"\n\nDenise Mace also said: \"It was terrifying to be honest. Seeing the police come marching down and it was right outside my house. These people weren't from Southport and it wasn't a peaceful protest.\" She added: \"When they moved it so far, everyone just come out and started clearing up.\"\n\nSefton Council said its cleaning teams and neighbourhood support teams have been out since 3am trying to clear away some of the destruction left by last nights disorder. It added they have been working hard to try and remove items and debris as quickly and as safely as possible. Our reporters have been chatting to those helping in the clear up.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives. The actions in Southport tonight will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets. We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\n\n\"Our officers should not have to face this, but we will be there tonight to ensure the safety of the local community who have suffered enough, and will arrest those involved in criminal behaviour.\"\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter LANCS LIVE NEWS and get all the biggest stories from across Lancashire direct t o your inbox", "source": {"uri": "lancs.live", "dataType": "news", "title": "accrington"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_macpherson@lancs.live", "name": "Jon Macpherson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Normans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medical services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasureland_Southport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pleasureland Southport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefton_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sefton Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_mace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceremonial mace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29648832.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_locals-in-south-1226917.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Police confirmed the suspect was born in the UK and ruled out terrorism. Far-right groups incited violence, leading to damage and injuries, while the community held an emotional vigil.A large crowd of anti-Muslim protesters clashed with police on Tuesday in a northern English town where three girls were stabbed to death and five other children critically wounded during an attack on a Taylor Swift-themed event on Monday.\n\nThe horrific stabbing incident in Southport, a quiet seaside town north of Liverpool, has shocked the nation. Police have said it was not linked to terrorism and that the suspect was born in the UK.\n\nYet far-right groups have stoked speculation that the teenage suspect was involved with Islam, and police said Tuesday's violence erupted when several hundred people began to throw items at a mosque. Police linked the crowd to the English Defence League, a group which has sometimes staged violent demonstrations against Islam.\n\nPolice vehicles were damaged and set alight, officers were pelted by bricks and large garbage containers. One video posted online showed the crowd chanting \"we want our country back\".\n\nAway from the violence, hundreds had gathered for an emotional vigil to pay tribute to those killed in the attack, laying flowers and toys.\n\n\"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and our respect,\" Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.\n\n\"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law.\"\n\nA 17-year-old male is currently in police custody on suspicion of murder and attempted murder after the bloody rampage at a \"Taylor Swift yoga and dance workshop\", a summer vacation event for children aged 6 to 11.\n\nWitnesses described the attack as being like a scene from a horror film. In addition to the three deaths, eight children suffered stab wounds. Five of them and two adults who had tried to protect them remain in a critical condition.\n\nThe police have said the motive remained unclear and have not given any details about the suspect, beyond saying he was born in Wales and lived in a village nearby.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nGoss and local politicians said those clashing with police involved many from outside the area, and the Liverpool Region Mosque Network said a minority of people were trying to use the incident to spread hatred.\n\n\"This evening we have seen distressing scenes outside Southport Mosque with angry protesters gathering outside,\" it said in a statement. \"This is causing further fear and anxiety within our communities,\"\n\nStarmer had earlier paid a sombre visit to the town to lay flowers, and King Charles and his family have expressed their horror. U.S. singer Swift herself wrote on Instagram that she was \"just completely in shock\".\n\nJUST LITTLE KIDS\n\n\"These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families,\" she said.\n\nHer fans have raised more than 250,000 pounds ($320,850)online to help families of the victims and for the hospital where some of the children were being treated.\n\nThe three girls who died in the attack were named as Bebe King, aged 6, 7-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, aged 9, whose parents are Portuguese.\n\n\"Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our Princess, like we said before to you, you're always our princess and no one would change that. Love from Your Hero Daddy and Mummy,\" Aguiar's family said in a statement.\n\nThere has been increasing concern at rising levels of stabbings and knife crime in Britain, and the Southport attack follows other recent similar, indiscriminate rampages.\n\n\"I'm absolutely determined that my government will get to grips with it,\" Starmer said.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com",

Five remain in a critical condition in hospital along with two adults who tried to protect them.\n\nPolice, who have arrested an unnamed 17-year-old male on suspicion of murder and attempted murder, have said the incident was not terrorism-related and sought to quash speculation on the suspect's origins, saying he was born in Britain.\n\nThat did not prevent protesters, from what Merseyside police believed were tied to the right-wing anti-Islam group, the English Defence League, from targeting a mosque in the town and attacking police who tried to stop them.\n\nPoliticians and police said most of those taking part in the violence were not from the area, and said the clashes detracted from a large vigil attended by thousands to pay tribute to the young victims.\n\n'THUGS FROM OUT OF TOWN'\n\nA total of 39 officers were treated for injuries, including 27 who were taken to hospital, North West Ambulance Service said on Wednesday.

Charred tarmac bore witness to the police vehicles which had been set alight.\n\n\"What I saw last night was absolutely appalling ... It was devastating and it's kind of taken away from actually what's gone on, which is the tragedy of those deaths,\" local resident David Burgess told Sky News.\n\n\"This is about the girls and the tragedy which has happened - don't make it about this,\" he said, referring to the clashes. \"This isn't Southport.

It is understood six of the eight children were in a critical condition and the two adults, including Leanne Lucas, were also severely injured. There has been no suggestion the condition of any of those injured has worsened, the Liverpool Echo reports.\n\nLeanne and another teacher bravely tried to save the children during the knife attack at the Taylor Swift dance event at The Hart Space. A local yoga page previously posted on Facebook posted a picture of children's yoga teacher Leanne, with the caption reading: \"I'm absolutely devastated. Please please pray for Leanne. Leanne came on my training course in December. A beautiful young creative girl who was so passionate about helping children.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Police issue update on 17-year-old arrested over Southport stabbings\n\nBebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Aguiar, aged nine were named as the children in the attack. In a tribute, Bebe King's family shared the following tribute: \"No words can describe the devastation that has hit our family as try to deal with the loss of our little girl Bebe.\"\n\nThe family of Alice Dasilva Aguiar paid this tribute: \"Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our Princess, like we said before to you, you're always our princess and no one would change that. Love from Your Hero Daddy and Mummy.\"\n\nTheir families, who are being supported by specialist officers, and have asked that their privacy is respected at this time. A 17-year-old boy, from Banks, Lancashire, and originally from Cardiff, was apprehended and continues to be questioned by police. Officers said he is being held on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.\n\nWith Southport continuing to try to come to terms with this appalling tragedy, hundreds of people made their way to a vigil in the town centre yesterday evening, which was respectfully observed. However, nearby, trouble was brewing. Police raced to a disturbance taking place during a protest outside a mosque on St Luke's Road in the town.\n\nIn what has been described as 'sickening' scenes, dozens of police officers were injured and a major incident declared. Bricks taken from garden walls were used to attack officers and cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire. Eight police officers sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion. Other officers suffered head injuries and serious facial injuries. One was knocked unconscious.\n\nThe violence started when a large group of people, who police said are believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road on Tuesday evening. Cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire and bricks were thrown at a local mosque. Damage was also caused to a local convenience store and wheelie bins were set on fire, police said. Three police dogs have also been injured. Photos and videos shared online show large groups hurling rocks at police officers, climbing on police vans and attempting to smash the vehicles' windows.\n\nThe violence has been widely condemned - including by the Prime Minister and Home Secretary - but there will be no more powerful voice in this than of the mother of one of the three little girls so tragically killed in Southport on Monday. In a message widely shared on social media, Jenni Stancombe said: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\"\n\nSpeaking about the police, Ms Stancombe added: \"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olivia_williams@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Olivia Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "imogen_clyde_smith@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Imogen Clyde-Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Echo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool Echo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mummy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banks,_Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Banks, Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Banks, Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/article29650603.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_js340895561.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 274, "textEnd": 281}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Five remain in a critical condition in hospital along with two adults who tried to protect them.\n\nPolice, who have arrested an unnamed 17-year-old male on suspicion of murder and attempted murder, have said the incident was not terrorism-related and sought to quash speculation on the suspect's origins, saying he was born in Britain.\n\nThat did not prevent protesters, from what Merseyside police believed were tied to the right-wing anti-Islam group, the English Defence League, from targeting a mosque in the town and attacking police who tried to stop them.\n\nPoliticians and police said most of those taking part in the violence were not from the area, and said the clashes detracted from a large vigil attended by thousands to pay tribute to the young victims.\n\n'THUGS FROM OUT OF TOWN'\n\nA total of 39 officers were treated for injuries, including 27 who were taken to hospital, North West Ambulance Service said on Wednesday. Police said eight had suffered serious injuries including fractures, and three police dogs were also hurt.\n\n\"Offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park,\" Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss of Merseyside Police said in a statement.\n\n\"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, streets in Southport were littered with bricks from broken walls, smashed bottles, and large garbage bins - which had been hurled at police the night before - and their contents. Charred tarmac bore witness to the police vehicles which had been set alight.\n\n\"What I saw last night was absolutely appalling ... It was devastating and it's kind of taken away from actually what's gone on, which is the tragedy of those deaths,\" local resident David Burgess told Sky News.\n\n\"This is about the girls and the tragedy which has happened - don't make it about this,\" he said, referring to the clashes. \"This isn't Southport. This isn't the community.\"\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer and senior ministers blamed \"violent thugs from out town\", for the trouble.\n\n\"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law,\" Starmer said.\n\nMeanwhile, Taylor Swift's fans have so far raised more than 270,000 pounds ($346,000) to help families of the victims and for the hospital where some of the children were being treated.\n\n($1 = 0.7795 pounds)\n\n(Reporting by Sachin Ravikumar; writing by Michael Holden; Editing by Bernadette Baum)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nTuesday night's riot in Southport left 39 police officers and three dogs injured by members of the far right, who attacked a mosque and hurled bricks at police - just a day after the horrific knife attack at a dance class, which tragically resulted in the loss of three young lives.\n\nAlleged English Defence League members targeted the mosque under the mistaken belief that the 17-year-old attacker was Muslim. Officials later debunked this claim, stating there was no association between the murder suspect and Islam.\n\nThe violent incident unfolded on Tuesday evening (July 30), with vehicles set ablaze, multiple police officers injured, and the local area left in disarray. By 10.30pm, crowds began to disperse, revealing the aftermath of their hours-long battle with police, as bricks littered the roads around the scene where the riot broke out), reports the Mirror.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool Mayor fears 'further trauma' as 'thugs' set fires and attack police officers\n\nThe smouldering remains of the protesters' arson attacks left a police van and several residents' cars destroyed, with smoke still visible in the air as night descended over the area. Meanwhile, three local families are mourning their children who were killed in the attack.\n\nEight other children were injured during the attack, which occurred on Monday at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport. The three victims tragically killed were identified on Tuesday as Bebe King (6), Elsie Dot Stancombe (7), and Alice Dasilva Aguiar (9).\n\nViolence erupted after misinformation circulated online following the attack, which was subsequently debunked. Reports confirm that 39 police officers suffered in the clash, with one left unconscious and others sustaining fractures and gashes during the extensive confrontation.\n\nA significant number of those injured were reportedly dealing with concussion, facial trauma, and broken bones. Following the EDL-incited chaos, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the group as \"thugs\".\n\nWhile thousands in Southport solemnly honoured the three lives lost in the attack and supported the grieving community, clusters of presumed EDL troublemakers converged on a local mosque, pelting it with bricks and igniting fires. In response, authorities have now enacted robust measures to curb further unrest.\n\nMerseyside Police will be enforcing a Section 60 and Section 34 Order until 8pm tomorrow, granting them enhanced authority to scatter gatherings and confiscate potentially disruptive items and vehicles. The police have clarified, though, that this does not affect individuals attending for legitimate activities or their everyday routines.\n\nThe force also confirmed that rioters had wounded three police dogs, with two pelted by bricks and another sustaining burns to its hind legs.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss expressed his pride in the Merseyside Police's response to severe violence in Southport, stating: \"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\"\n\nHe also extended gratitude to neighbouring forces for their assistance: \"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\"\n\nHe detailed the damage caused by offenders, including attacks on police with bricks and setting public vehicles on fire: \"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park.\"\n\nGoss condemned the actions against the community and appealed for information: \"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nHe urged anyone with information or footage to come forward: \"We would appeal to anyone who has information or video footage of those involved in this shocking behaviour to come forward so we can identify and arrest those responsible.\"\n\nHe provided contact details for tips: \"Anyone with information can DM @MerPolCC or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.\"\n\nThe North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) confirmed the significant number of police injuries, which led them to declare a Major Incident late on Tuesday night. The declaration was due to the extensive resources required at the scene, including 10 ambulances and several on-call doctors.\n\nNWAS reported on the treatment of injured officers: \"We have treated 22 police officers and so far, 11 of those have been taken to hospital.\"\n\nThe North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) had to declare a significant incident last night around 23:00 due to the sheer amount of resources demanded at the scene as the unrest continued. The injured count has since risen to 39, with nearly two dozen officers needing hospital care.\n\nLocal community leaders have voiced concerns over the ongoing disorder's effect on residents who were already coping with previous traumas.\n\nMayor Steve Rotheram of Liverpool weighed in with a powerful statement shared on social media platform X, outlining the emotional toll on the community: \"There are families just coming to terms with yesterday's events, parents grieving for their murdered children and survivors still trying to process what they witnessed.\"\n\nHe further lamented, \"The violent scenes in Southport tonight will only further traumatise a community that is already struggling to come to terms with this attack.\"\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister, commented on the situation, promising justice for those affected. He stated, \"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and our respect.\"\n\nStarmer criticised the violence that overshadowed a mourning community: \"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucy_thornton@birminghammail.co.uk",

The service reported that 27 of the officers needed hospital treatment after the disorder.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson said: \"We treated 39 patients in total, all of which were police officers. 27 were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene.\" Merseyside Police disclosed that eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose, and a concussion, while other officers sustained head injuries, and serious facial injuries, and one was rendered unconscious.\n\nThree police dogs also sustained injuries amidst the turmoil; Zoe and Ike both suffered leg injuries from bricks hurled at them. Adding to this, a third dog named Quga, who had been bitten, strangled, and kicked by an offender earlier in the month, experienced burns to her back leg, as confirmed by the force.\n\nRead more: Locked up in July in Nottingham - A month dominated by killings Read more: Pub could lose licence after landlady punched police officer\n\nMerseyside Police have implicated supporters of the English Defence League in the unrest that saw public cars set ablaze, local mosque bricked, damage inflicted on a local convenience store, and wheelie bins torched. Enhanced police presence continues in the affected area to provide reassurance, with a 24-hour Section 60 Order from 7.54pm on Tuesday granting officers broader stop and search powers aimed at curtailing serious violence.\n\nA Section 34 Order has been put into effect, allowing police to direct those exhibiting antisocial behaviour away from the area. Authorities have assured that these measures are not for those simply visiting or conducting daily activities.\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Goss, stated: \"Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\"\n\nHe praised the immediate response of off-duty officers, as well as the cooperation from neighbouring forces: \"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\"\n\nRegrettably, the events took a violent turn, with individuals toppling garden walls to use bricks against officers, torching public vehicles, and damaging cars at a mosque, said ACC Goss. He expressed his concern over the community's well-being, especially after recent events: \"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nMerseyside Police is reaching out for assistance from the public to obtain further information or video footage related to the disorder. The unrest coincided with a stabbing frenzy that occurred in Southport on Monday during a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nThe harrowing incident took place at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club, resulting in the tragic deaths of Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine; Bebe King, six; and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, who were fatally stabbed.\n\nA further eight children were injured in the knife attack, leaving five youngsters and two adults fighting for their lives in critical condition.\n\nFollowing the dreadful assault at the dance studio on Hart Street, a 17 year old boy has been detained. The teenager, whose identity is protected due to legal reasons, faces charges of murder and attempted murder.\n\nIn an escalation following the horrific event, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) has reported that an unfounded online rumour sparked Islamophobic backlash. This was inflamed by erroneous reporting from a Russian news source that incorrectly linked the tragedy with the Muslim community.\n\nOffering condolences to the families of the three young victims from Southport, the MCB also denounced the \"shocking scenes of far-right rioters running amok outside a mosque\" that occurred subsequent to the incident.", "source": {"uri": "nottinghampost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nottingham Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_dimmer@nottinghampost.com", "name": "Sam Dimmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "press_association@nottinghampost.com", "name": "Press Association", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Ambulance_Service", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North West Ambulance Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_and_search", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stop and search"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assistant chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-social behaviour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Council_of_Britain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslim Council of Britain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Wales Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/news/uk-world-news/article9448527.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_riotgoers-attack-police-during-a-protest-in-southport-after-three-children-died-and-eight-were-injured-after-a-knife.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Shortly after, the force named the victims as Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, who were pronounced dead shortly after Monday's rampage, while Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, died from her injuries in hospital on Tuesday.\n\nAs five more children continued to fight for their lives following the tragedy, along with two dance class teachers who bravely tried to defend their pupils, the tight-knit community of Southport gathered in the town centre at 6pm to grieve together. Hundreds of people held each other and wiped away tears as Martin Abrahams, the spiritual leader at Southport Hospital, said the crowds \"show we want to stand together\".\n\nBut despite the mournful air, tensions that had been building throughout the day was palpable. Mr Abrahams was interrupted twice - once by a man shouting \"we stick together\", and then by panicked calls for paramedics from the centre of the crowd, which temporarily paused the event. It later emerged that a man was arrested with a flick knife just yards away from the vigil.\n\nThere were growing fears over how many were going to turn up to a far-right protest planned to take place outside a mosque on St Luke's Road that evening, an event police were understood to be monitoring.\n\nEarlier that day, Sir Keir Starmer had been hurriedly whisked away after being heckled as he placed a floral tribute at the Hart Street scene. His visit to the police cordon lasted barely two minutes as some watching members of the public shouted, \"How many more children? Our kids are dead and you're leaving already?\" and \"get the truth out!\"\n\nChief Constable Serena Kennedy, who attended with the prime minister, was asked why the alleged attacker had not been named and if he was on a \"watch list\".\n\nDetectives continued to question a 17-year-old suspect from Wales but Merseyside Police was forced to put out a statement urging people not to speculate after false claims the boy was an asylum-seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat spread online.\n\nWithin an hour of the vigil ending, crowds of men began gathering outside The Blue Anchor pub, some holding beers and wearing masks, in front of the hundreds of floral tributes that continued to pile up outside the police cordon at the top of Hart Street.\n\nWord came from St Luke's Road before the demonstration's official kick-off time at 8pm that the area near the mosque was already packed with angry protesters responding to the rallying cry of elements of the far-right on social media.\n\nThe air was charged with rage and anticipation as dusk began to descend on what had already been a highly emotional day.\n\nHundreds of men were already stationed directly outside the mosque and in the surrounding streets, while a number of police officers and riot vans were standing guard, amid chants of \"No surrender!\" and \"English till I die!\" from sections of the crowd.\n\nWith tensions already running high, events escalated rapidly into a riot, with violence breaking out and demonstrators clashing with police. Dozens of officers ended up suffering injuries in the disorder, leading North West Ambulance Service to declare a major incident.\n\nStones and bottles were launched at officers in helmets and riot gear, as police riot vans were attacked. Debris was scattered on the ground around the vans while police used their shields to deflect missiles thrown from the crowds.\n\nA crowd of men, many wearing masks and hoodies, were in a running battle with officers outside the mosque as more police arrived. Officers walked through crowds with police dogs as others with shields and batons were in a stand-off with protesters.\n\nFirecrackers and flares went off as multiple police sirens sounded, and a police helicopter hovered over the area. Shocked local residents were out on the streets, while roads were jammed with traffic, and numerous police cars and vans, blue lights flashing, were patrolling local streets.\n\nRiot police then charged the crowds outside the mosque as a police van was set on fire, sending black smoke into the air.\n\nThe force issued an update at around 9pm, disclosing that an officer had suffered a suspected broken nose in the disturbance and multiple police vehicles had been damaged and set alight - with the protesters believed to be supporters of the English Defence League (EDL).\n\nThe disorder continued into the night, with wheelie bins set alight and engulfed in flames in the streets, and shops, restaurants and hotels under lockdown amid the chaos. The sounds of sirens and the circulating police helicopter echoed around Southport well after midnight as I walked through the seaside town's deserted streets.\n\nThe prime minister was among those who took to social media to condemn the violence, writing on X just before midnight that the rioters had hijacked a vigil for victims and vowed they would \"feel the full force of the law\".\n\nAfter the chaos, the message from the people of Southport was clear; the town is mourning multiple tragedies and does not want the kind of trouble the rioters brought with them.\n\nHelping with the clean-up operation on Wednesday, Norman Wallis, chief executive of Southport Pleasureland said: \"It's horrendous what those hooligans have done. It was like a war scene. People from out of town just causing absolute mayhem.\n\n\"People in hoods climbing up lampposts, throwing bricks, they set a police car on fire. But none of those people were the people of Southport. The people of Southport are the ones here cleaning the mess up.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchblade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switchblade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Van"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Violence broke out after the deaths of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, in a knife attack at a summer holiday Taylor Swift dance workshop.\n\nThree police dogs were injured and eight Merseyside Police officers sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion.

A third dog, PD Quga, who was bitten, strangled and kicked by an offender at the beginning of this month, has tonight suffered burns to her back leg. Merseyside Police said in a statement: \"As a result of the disorder, a 24-hour Section 60 Order has been introduced in the area (see attached), running from 19.54pm today and extra officers will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities.\n\n\"The Order, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals in the area and is designed to minimise serious violence. A Section 34 Order has also been introduced under the Anti-Social Behaviour & Policing Act 2014, giving officers powers to direct people who are engaging in antisocial behaviour or are likely to become involved in such incidents. These powers will not be used for anyone visiting the area and going about their daily business.\n\n\"Under the legislation, officers have the power to seize any item, including vehicles, used in the commission of anti-social behaviour. Should a person who has previously been directed to leave the area return, an offence would be committed, which they may ultimately be arrested for.\"\n\nMerseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said three people were arrested on Tuesday night. She said: \"Our priority was to try and keep the communities of Southport safe and also to make sure officers remained safe. Three arrests were made, however more will follow. It's impossible to say [how many will be arrested]. It's really early days in the investigation.\"\n\nShe added: \"Initially, there were about 70 people who made their way away from the vigil and were making their way towards the mosque. They suddenly became about 200 in number and then others joined that number.\"\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss: \"Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack. I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park. This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\n\n\"We would appeal to anyone who has information or video footage of those involved in this shocking behaviour to come forward so we can identify and arrest those responsible.

Protesters gathered outside a local mosque in what Chairman of Merseyside Police Federation Chris McGlade said was a \"sustained and vicious attack\".\n\nThree victims killed in the knife attack have been named by police as nine-year-old Alice Aguiar from Portugal, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, aged seven. Six children were left in a critical condition following the attack with two adults also fighting for their lives.\n\nRioters threw stones, bottles and bricks at police while members of the crowd were heard shouting \"no more boats\" before a police van was set on fire. Around a third of those injured experienced concussion, facial injuries and broken bones. In the wake of the EDL violence, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper branded the crowd as \"thugs\".\n\nAnd in a powerful image captured by Mirror reporter Lucy Thornton, a brave female police officer is seen with blood dripping down her face as bricks are launched overhead and rioters set fire to shops and vehicles. Police officers armed with riot shields and helmets stood across the road as fires burned and debris was thrown.\n\nThe North West Ambulance service said 27 officers were taken to hospital. A statement on X said: \"We treated 39 patients in total, all of which were police officers. 27 were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene.\" Merseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose, and a concussion.\"\n\nA police van was set on fire and thick black smoke was seen rising from the vehicle while people were seen mounting the roof of another. Others were seen kicking down walls and throwing loose stones at officers in the unrest.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was among those who criticised the mob, saying in a statement posted online that the perpetrators would \"feel the full force of the law\". He wrote: \"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law.\"\n\nUntil 8pm tonight, Merseyside Police have a Section 60 and Section 34 Order in place, giving them greater power to disperse crowds, as well as seize items and vehicles being used in anti social behaviour. The force has emphasised that these powers will not be used for anyone visiting the area or going about their daily business.\n\nThe riots come after Merseyside Police arrested a 17-year-old boy, who lives in Lancashire but was born in Cardiff, in connection with the attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party on Monday. The incident took place at a community centre known as The Hart Space, on Hart Street, Southport, where a class was taking place for children aged six to eleven during the school holidays.\n\nMeanwhile, tributes were paid on social media to the bravery of dance and yoga teacher Leanne Lucas after she was attacked in the incident.

One woman earnestly holds up a sign reading: \"One race - human. Hope not hate.

Merseyside Police have since warned against speculation, saying a name that has been cited is 'incorrect'.\n\nNearly 40 police officers were injured during the riots. Police have since said they believe supporters of the English Defence League (EDL) - a far-right organisation known for its Islamophobia - were behind the violence. Sir Keir Starmer last night said the rioters would 'feel the full force of the law'.\n\nHe said the 'hijacked' the vigil that was held between leaders and members of the local community to remember the lives of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, who all died in the horror attack at the Taylor Swift-themed dance party.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said officers 'should not have to face' the 'sickening' attack, fuelled in part by 'speculation' around the suspect arrested over the stabbings.\n\nHe said of the incident: \"It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, we have seen overwhelming support and sympathy from the community and wider Merseyside communities for the families who are currently trying to deal with their loss and care for victims injured during the major incident.\n\n\"Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face. Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavor to prevent disorder.\n\n\"The actions in Southport tonight will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets. We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\n\n\"Our officers should not have to face this, but we will be there tonight to ensure the safety of the local community who have suffered enough, and will arrest those involved in criminal behavior.\"\n\nLocal MP Mr Patrick Hurley publicly condemned the attack and echoed the sentiments of the powerful sign seen held by a protester as he added: \"Nowhere was this more evident than the solidarity, remembrance and sympathy heard at today's vigil.\n\n\"To those who laid flowers, candles, toys, thank you. I was deeply saddened to hear the news today of the death or a third child.

Cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire and bricks were thrown at a local mosque.\n\nDamage was also caused to a local convenience store and wheelie bins were set on fire, police said. Three police dogs have also been injured. Police Dogs Zoe and Ike have sustained leg injuries from bricks thrown at them. A third dog, PD Quga, also suffered burns to her back leg.\n\nPhotos and video seen by the ECHO showed crowds gathered around police riot vans on St Luke's Road. A police van was also seen up in flames. Merseyside Police said as a result of the disorder, a 24-hour Section 60 Order has been introduced in the area, running from 19.54pm on (Tuesday). Extra officers will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities. The order, under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals in the area and is designed to minimise serious violence.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack. I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park.\n\n\"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.

It came after misinformation was spread online about the identity of the suspect arrested over the frenzied stabbing at a children's dance class that killed three young girls.\n\nDozens of brave officers were injured, including police dogs, as a major incident was declared for the second time this week. Merseyside Police said the thugs involved in the unrest - who they believe included supporters of the English Defence League - disgracefully set alight cars belonging to members of the public, threw bricks at the local mosque and set wheelie bins on fire.\n\nThe rioting followed the tragic deaths of Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, at the Taylor Swift-themed holiday club on Monday. Eight other children were also stabbed, with five children and two adults left in a critical condition. A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody.\n\nPowerful message of peace\n\nOne woman was pictured standing up to a mob of jeering rioters with a powerful message of peace. In a clip that has gone viral on social media, the woman held a sign that read: \"One race - human, hope not hate, racism not welcome here\", as objects were being thrown. Her actions have been praised as \"brave\" and \"courageous\" online.\n\n\"What an incredibly brave woman. On nights like this, she's just given me a little bit of hope back in humanity,\" one Twitter user wrote. Another said: \"Applaud her trying to unite a community while literally staring hate in the face. She represents the people of Southport, not the thugs attacking religious buildings and emergency services!\"\n\nThe Mirror's own reporter Lucy Thornton, who witnessed the riot, described the woman as a beacon of light in the madness and said: \"Amid all this terror, I saw one defiant shining light, an incredibly brave woman, shaking like a leaf with youths screaming in her face but strong enough to hold up a poster saying 'Hope not Hate' while bricks fell around her.\"\n\nComing together to clean-up\n\nAfter calm was finally restored, the extent of the chaos could be seen today with rubbish, burnt-out vehicles and smashed windows scattered across the streets. But locals have been quick to get involved in the clean-up. One local said: \"At least the bin men don't have to empty the bins today - they've all been burnt.\"\n\nA local businessman, Andy Southwood, 54, said: \"I didn't sleep much last night. In half an hour it exploded. It was chaotic. Mainly young kids with masks. It looked organised to me. It's crazy. It's a massive stain on the town.\" But he pointed out: \"Random people are coming out with shovels and spades to help clean up. That's the true spirit of Southport.\"\n\nBrave off-duty police\n\nOff-duty police officers in Merseyside stepped up last night to courageously support their colleagues, despite many of them finishing full shifts. In a proud statement, Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\n\n\"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.

This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nNearly 40 officers sustained injuries at the scene of violent disorder, North West Ambulance Service confirmed, after they were forced to declare a 'major incident' on Tuesday night. A statement on X said: \"We treated 39 patients in total, all of which were police officers. 27 were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene.\" Merseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries, including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose, and a concussion.\n\nMerseyside Police is appealing to anyone who has information or video footage of those involved in the rioting to come forward.

Those responsible will face the full force of the law.\n\n\"It is appalling that the local police, who have already dealt with extraordinarily difficult circumstances this week, and are undertaking an urgent criminal investigation, should be on the receiving end of violence and abuse.\"\n\nJenni Stancombe, the mother of one of the girls killed in the attack - Elsie Dot Stancombe - also called for the violence to stop, with the Liverpool Echo reporting she said: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight. The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nAnd after footage from the Liverpool Post was shared online of a woman standing up to the far-right on Tuesday, Twitter/X users have branded the individual \"brave\" and \"a light in the darkness\":\n\nA 17-year-old male from Banks in Lancashire, born in Cardiff, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder in connection with Monday's stabbing.\n\nPolice are urging anyone with information or video footage of the incident, or of the violence and disorder which followed the next day, to come forward by direct messaging @MerPolCC on Twitter/X or calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.", "source": {"uri": "indy100.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "indy100.com"}, "authors": [],

Five are in a critical condition, alongside two women who were also critically injured as they bravely tried to save the children.\n\nBut the rioting erupted barely an hour after thousands of mourners had gathered for a vigil to remember the victims.\n\nAsked during an interview on LBC whether the EDL's activities would be curbed, Ms Rayner said: 'We have laws and we have proscribed groups and we do look at that and it is reviewed regularly.\n\n'So I'm sure that that will be something that the Home Secretary will be looking at as part of the normal course of what we do and the intelligence that we have.'\n\nRiot police hold back protesters near a burning police vehicle after disorder broke out in Southport\n\nDeputy PM Angela Rayner said the government 'will look at various different groups' amid widespread condemnation of violence that broke out after the horrific knife attack on children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class\n\nSouthport burns: A street near a mosque goes up in flames as violent thugs took to the streets last night\n\nThree girls were killed in a bloody rampage on Hart Street on Monday. On Tuesday, a vigil was held for the victims on Lord Street. While it was going on, a man with a flick knife was arrested on Eastbank Street. On St Luke's Road, riots erupted outside a mosque - also on Tuesday\n\nThe PM insisted that those who rioted in Southport last night will 'feel the full force of the law'\n\nKeir Starmer lays a floral tribute to the knife rampage victims in Southport yesterday\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper and local MP Patrick Hurley inspect tributes in Southport\n\nMs Rayner added: 'The inciting of violence and violence on the street has absolutely no place in our democracy, and we have to crack down on those that perpetuate violence and spread it within our communities.'\n\nHowever, she said 'the bigger issue is about taking on the minority of people that have got thuggish behaviour, that actually that's not our British values'.\n\nMerseyside's Police and Crime Commissioner Emily Spurrell said there is a 'strong feeling' that members of the EDL used the Southport stabbing to 'whip up hatred'.\n\nMs Spurrell told ITV's Good Morning Britain that the 'violence and abuse' towards police officers on Tuesday was 'utterly abhorrent and completely unacceptable'.\n\nShe said: '(Merseyside Police) will be reviewing the footage of exactly who was there last night, they have been monitoring the online activity as well, trying to understand who was doing what.\n\n'They have said that they believe it was members of the English Defence League (EDL), they don't believe it was individuals from the local area.\n\n'There is a strong feeling that there are individuals like the EDL, who have been using this incredibly tragic event to whip up hatred, incite violence, and that's the result of what we saw last night.'\n\nScotland's former first minister Humza Yousaf has called for the EDL to be banned under terror laws in the wake of the unrest, despite former leader Tommy Robinson's insistence that the group no longer exists.\n\nKeir Starmer has insisted those responsible for the rioting should face the 'full force of the law' after a police van was torched and several officers injured.\n\nOn St Luke's Street near the vigil, rioters chanting 'English till I die' surrounded the Southport Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre and began hurling rubble at police officers who had formed a protective line around the building.\n\nThe violence appears to have been fuelled by false claims online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nThe 17-year-old boy, who remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder, is originally from Cardiff but now lives in the nearby Lancashire village of Banks.\n\nMerseyside Police said 22 of its officers were injured after clashes broke out in the seaside town.\n\nWriting on X, Sir Keir said: 'The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday.\n\n'They deserve our support and our respect. Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves.'\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said 'scenes of thuggery' on the streets of Southport 'bear no relation' to the community which had been coming together.\n\nShe told broadcasters: 'I think everyone should be showing some respect for the community that is grieving and also for the police who are pursuing an urgent criminal investigation now, and who showed such heroism and bravery yesterday in the face of these horrific attacks.\n\n'I think everyone needs to support the police in that work, and frankly the scenes of thuggery that we have seen on the streets of Southport this evening bear no relation to the way in which the Southport community has been coming together to support each other and to support grieving families.\n\n'We need to see some respect for the grieving community and for the police in their urgent work.'\n\nPatrick Hurley, Southport's Labour MP, said this morning that the riots occurred because of the 'propaganda and lies' spread on social media about the identity of the attacker.\n\nHe told Times Radio: 'Because of the propaganda and the lies that were being spread around on social media from within minutes of the news breaking on Monday afternoon about the tragic incident.\n\n'We'd had all sorts of lies being spread and misinformation being spread about the alleged perpetrator and some people with the best of intentions then they tried to rebut this, they tried to argue back, but all that happens is you're just amplifying people's false messaging.'\n\nHe added: 'This misinformation doesn't just exist on people's internet browsers and on people's phones. It has real world impact.\n\n'And what happened is that the real world impact of that was that we then had hundreds of people descending on the town, descending on Southport from outside of the area, intent on causing trouble, either because they believe what they've written, or because they are bad faith actors who wrote it in the first place, in the hope of causing community division.'\n\nMr Hurley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the rioters were 'not from Southport' and must face the 'full force of the law'.\n\n'Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all,' he said.\n\n'Not least these beered-up thugs who have descended on the town last night intent on causing trouble.\n\n'We all have to stand against that and Southport will not accept this.\n\n'Southport will unite against this sort of thing.'\n\nA police van was set on fire near a mosque in Southport on Tuesday evening as riots broke out\n\nAround 200 protesters were seen taking to the streets. Police believe many were EDL supporters\n\nA burnt out police van near a mosque in Southport as shocking riots broke out on Tuesday\n\nRiot police vans were damaged amid the chaos near the Southport Mosque\n\nThe riots came barely an hour after thousands of mourners gathered for a vigil at the Atkinson in Southport\n\nIn stark contrast to the riots on the streets, there was a sense of tranquility at the site of the vigil as night fell\n\nMerseyside Police has issued a warning over an 'incorrect' name being widely circulated online, adding: 'We would urge people not to speculate on details of the incident while the investigation is ongoing.'\n\nThe angry mob - who police 'believed to be supporters of the English Defence League' - started targeting the Muslim place of worship at around 7.45pm.\n\nEight police officers suffered serious injuries, including one who was knocked unconscious. Protesters also torched cars and wheelie bins belonging to members of the public, shattered the mosque windows with bricks and looted shops.\n\nOne Southport resident living near the mosque told how he, his partner and their young daughter fled for the evening, not wanting her to see the sickening violence.\n\nThe man said: 'We just couldn't stay while this was going on and allow our daughter to witness it.\n\n'This doesn't represent Southport - they're EDL thugs who are from Manchester and Liverpool who have just come here to cause trouble. They have no respect for a town that's grieving.'\n\nPolice have introduced a 24-hour Section 60 Order in the area where the riots took place and extra officers will remain in the area.", "source":

I share that shock shared by the whole community here, in a quieter community where this has not been a kind of experience they have come across.\n\n'It is really a shock and the whole community is united together in their sadness.'\n\nLabour MP for Southport Patrick Hurley reflected on the vigil in the town on Tuesday evening for victims of Monday's knife attack, saying the community were 'reeling' and 'in grief' following the death of three girls.\n\nHe condemned the 'beered-up thugs' who threw bricks towards a mosque, and said yobs had got the train in and used the tragic deaths 'for their own political purposes'.\n\nA baby seat can be seen in the back seat of a car whose windows have been smashed through outside the mosque in Southport\n\nThe car outside the religious building has been smashed following the rioting last night\n\nDamage to the Southport Islamic Society Mosque after rioters congregated around the sacred building\n\nWorkers have brought in machinery to clean away the chaos around the suburban Mosque\n\nSpeaking to the Today programme, he said: 'These were thugs who got the train in, these were not the people from Southport.\n\n'They were using the horrific incident on Monday, the deaths of three little kiddies, for their own political purposes and actually to attack the very same first responders and the very same police, who had been on the scene on Monday, were then being pelted with bricks the day after by these thugs.\n\n'There's no way to describe that other than to say it's utterly reprehensible and we must identify these people and make sure that the full force of the law is down against them.'\n\nHe went on: 'These people are utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children and utterly disrespecting the town.'\n\nHe continued: 'Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all. Not least these beered-up thugs who have descended on the town last night intent on causing trouble.\n\n'We all have to stand against that and Southport will not accept this. Southport will unite against this sort of thing.'\n\nThe Prime Minister and Home Secretary joined police chiefs in condemning the 'sickening' violence, which started barely an hour after thousands of mourners had gathered for a vigil to remember the victims who lost their lives.\n\nJust yards away from the emotional vigil, a 32-year-old man, dressed in all black with a hat on the joint-hottest day of the year, was separately arrested after being caught carrying a flick knife on Eastbank Street at 6.55pm.\n\nOn nearby St Luke's Street, rioters chanting 'English till I die' surrounded the Southport Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre and began hurling rubble at police officers who had formed a protective line around the building.\n\nThe violence appears to have been fuelled by false claims online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nThe 17-year-old boy, who remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder, is originally from Cardiff but now lives in the nearby Lancashire village of Banks.\n\nLocals came out in force to clean the mess with any means they had - including by hand\n\nFamily homes were left damaged and devastated by the riots as walls and cars were ruined\n\nFootage showed a man, dressed in all black in the scorching heat, being arrested near the vigil for the three girls who died\n\nThe riots came barely an hour after thousands of mourners gathered for a vigil at the Atkinson in Southport\n\nIn stark contrast to the riots on the streets, there was a sense of tranquility at the site of the vigil as night fell\n\nHome Secretary Yyvette Cooper, pictured leaving flowers at the scene of the attack yesterday, condemned the mob violence\n\nMerseyside Police has issued a warning over an 'incorrect' name being widely circulated online, adding: 'We would urge people not to speculate on details of the incident while the investigation is ongoing.'\n\nThe service said 27 of its officers were taken to hospital following the violence.\n\nA statement on X said: 'We treated 39 patients in total, all of which were police officers. 27 were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene.'\n\nMerseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose, and a concussion.\n\nOther officers suffered head injuries, and serious facial injuries, and one was knocked unconscious.\n\nThree police dogs were also injured in the chaos, with Zoe and Ike suffering leg injuries from bricks thrown at them.\n\nA third dog, Quga - who was bitten, strangled and kicked by an offender at the beginning of this month - suffered burns to her back leg, the force said.\n\nThe angry mob - who police 'believed to be supporters of the English Defence League' - started targeting the Muslim place of worship at around 7.45pm.\n\nEight police officers suffered serious injuries, including one who was knocked unconscious. Protesters also torched cars and wheelie bins belonging to members of the public, shattered the mosque windows with bricks and looted shops.\n\nOne Southport resident living near the mosque told how he, his partner and their young daughter fled for the evening, not wanting her to see the sickening violence.\n\nThe man said: 'We just couldn't stay while this was going on and allow our daughter to witness it.\n\n'This doesn't represent Southport - they're EDL thugs who are from Manchester and Liverpool who have just come here to cause trouble. They have no respect for a town that's grieving.'\n\nThe Prime Minister said rioters had 'hijacked' a vigil for victims and would 'feel the full force of the law'.\n\nWriting on X, Sir Keir said: 'The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday.\n\n'They deserve our support and our respect. Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves.'\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said 'scenes of thuggery' on the streets of Southport 'bear no relation' to the community which had been coming together.\n\nShe told broadcasters: 'I think everyone should be showing some respect for the community that is grieving and also for the police who are pursuing an urgent criminal investigation now, and who showed such heroism and bravery yesterday in the face of these horrific attacks.\n\n'I think everyone needs to support the police in that work, and frankly the scenes of thuggery that we have seen on the streets of Southport this evening bear no relation to the way in which the Southport community has been coming together to support each other and to support grieving families.\n\n'We need to see some respect for the grieving community and for the police in their urgent work.'\n\nPolice have introduced a 24-hour Section 60 Order in the area where the riots took place and extra officers will remain in the area.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: 'Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.'\n\nHe added: 'Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park.\n\n'This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.'\n\nThe violence was condemned by Sir Keir Starmer, Mayor Steve Rotheram and the Liverpool Region Mosque Network on Tuesday night\n\nHundreds of protesters, many masked, battled with riot police officers\n\nEngland flags were on display at the anti-Muslim demonstration in Southport\n\nSmoke is seen billowing from a police van which was set ablaze. The mosque is seen on the right\n\nTensions flared in Southport last night, with police saying supporters of the EDL were targeting the mosque\n\nLocal mosque groups condemned the violence aimed towards Muslims, adding: 'We must not let those who seek to divide us and spread hatred use this as an opportunity.'\n\nAnd Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool city region, wrote: 'There are families just coming to terms with yesterday's events, parents grieving for their murdered children and survivors still trying to process what they witnessed.\n\n'The violent scenes in Southport tonight will only further traumatise a community that is already struggling to come to terms with this attack.\n\n'Mindless violence directed at the very people who ran towards the danger yesterday, and outright Islamaphobia, only distract from the work of delivering justice.\n\n'The real story tonight is of the thousands who gathered at the vigil in Southport in memory of Bebe, Elsie and Alice. For the sake of their loved ones, this disorder needs to stop so the police do their jobs.'\n\nPolice said that a number of officers were injured, while cars were set alight and shops were broken into and looted during the disorder.\n\nIn a desperate bid to protect themselves, officers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them. One officer has suffered a suspected broken nose and police vehicles have been damaged and set on fire as around 400 people gathered to watch.\n\nThe three girls who died were among 11 children stabbed during a 'ferocious' knife attack which left mothers picking up their children screaming in horror.\n\nChaotic scenes erupted near to where the knife rampage took place in Southport yesterday\n\nThe aftermath of the riots, where police vans were burnt and rocks were launched\n\nRioters wearing masks launch missiles towards police officers in Southport\n\nRiot police with shields and helmets hold back protesters after disorder broke out\n\nProtesters cheer as they launch bins at riot police vans amid ugly scenes in Southport\n\nRioters were seen jumping on police vans as things got out of control\n\nSmoke billows behind riot police officers amid riots in the seaside town\n\nA traffic cone is hurled by a masked man at a police officer near to a mosque in Southport\n\nA wounded police officer with blood pouring down his head after being caught up in the riots\n\nRiot police try to control the angry mob who have taken to the streets of Southport\n\nFive further children, aged between six and 11, are in a critical condition alongside two female adults, among them hero yoga teacher Leanne Lucas, who 'bravely tried to protect them'.\n\nOne source told The Sun that she needed an eight-hour operation and remains seriously ill in hospital. Dance tutor Heidi Liddle and window cleaner Joel Verite have also been hailed for their bravery during the attack.\n\nAs thousands of mourners attended an emotional vigil in Southport on Tuesday evening, protests broke out on the streets surrounding Hart Street, where the attack took place.\n\nFurious demonstrators tore down garden walls to use as missiles to pelt at police, with wheelie bins also thrown during the mayhem.\n\nA police van was set on fire by protesters. Angry mobs chanted 'Stop the boats' and kicked out at police vans sent to restore order.\n\nSome threw smoke bombs, with men wearing caps and shorts charging at outnumbered police.\n\nScores of riot vans and patrol cars raced to the scene as a police helicopter hovered overhead as the violence spread out of control.\n\nHuge crowds of men, many masked and wearing hoodies, were seen clashing with police - as stones, bottles, bricks and fireworks were launched.\n\nDemonstrators could be heard shouting 'No surrender' and 'English till I die'.\n\nOne police officer was seen being helped into a van by his colleagues with blood streaming down his face and a heavily bandaged head. A female officer was also seen with a cut cheek.\n\nBy 8pm, around 500 rioters had massed in two streets outside the mosque - Sussex Road and St Luke's Road - trapping around 40 police officers in the middle.\n\nMissiles were hurled at riot officers and dog handlers from both sides. Bottles, bricks, fireworks and lumps of concrete were thrown to cheers from the rioters, who goaded police and eyes each other on.\n\nAt about 8.15pm a crowd surrounded three riot vans and began rocking one to try and flip it over.\n\nMoments later a small explosion was heard and a mini-fireball erupted in the air as the van went up in flames.\n\nOne man shouted: 'We're doing this for our girls!' as officers drove the other vans away from the fire to stop them also being set alight.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to quell the disorder, a charge from riot police brandishing batons sent around 300 of the rioters fleeing down the street as reinforcements flooded the area.\n\nBut violence continued into the night, with rioters forming a burning barricade of wheelie bins as they hurled bricks and lumps of concrete at riot police.\n\nMobs chanting 'save our girls' clashed with police until 10.30pm outside the Southport Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre.\n\nA nearby corner shop looked to have been broken into and looted. Rioters set alight at least five wheelie bins in the middle of Sussex Road sending flames and toxic black plumes of smoke shooting up into the night's sky.\n\nWith officers unable to charge due to the burning barricade, a volley of missiles was hurled from behind the makeshift bonfire.\n\nAt one point the ferocity of the violence sent the line of police retreating slightly. Officers in a Merseyside Police helicopter continued to monitor events from the air.\n\nThe crowd began to thin out around 11pm with reports of disturbances - including cars being torched - breaking out across Southport.\n\nDuring the demonstration, several people carried placards with slogans about stopping the boats. One read: 'Stop the boats! Send them back! Fight for our kids! Let's stand together!\n\nRiot police hold back protesters near a burning police vehicle\n\nA police officer holding a baton with a cut on her face after rioters stormed the area near the mosque\n\nRiot police intervene as activists cause chaos in Southend as rumours circulate over the suspect's identity\n\nA protester walks away holding his head as activists clashed with police on Tuesday\n\nClashes between protesters and police can be seen breaking out in the far distance\n\nSome held placards saying 'stop the boats'. This is despite police issuing a warning after an 'incorrect' name for the alleged attacker was widely circulated online\n\nWheelie bins and bricks were thrown at police, while a police van went up in flames - as police warned people not to speculate about the identity of the suspect\n\nHuge crowds have clashed with police in Southport as tensions boil over following the knife rampage\n\nActivists were seen launching missiles at police and attempting to damage riot vans\n\nOne woman carrying a placard said the disorder was because the knife man who attacked the children 'was a Muslim.'\n\nShe said: 'We are saying enough is enough. Why are they not stopping the migrants coming in?\n\n'How many more children will be killed because they are letting them all in? They should be at the borders stopping them.'\n\nHer comments came after inaccurate posts by social media sleuths about the identity of the perpetrator have received millions of views and engagements.\n\nSunder Katwala, director of the think-tank British Future, said a bogus news channel seemed to have invented a fake name for the suspect and run a false story that was shared online.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Goss said: 'There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n'We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\n\n'It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.'\n\nThe riots went on late into the evening, with police officers desperately trying to regain control\n\nRiot police wearing helmets and shields try to defend themselves near the mosque\n\nRiot police officers storm into the area to try and disperse the growing crowd\n\nAlso on Tuesday evening, officers were called to reports of a man carrying a weapon at around 6.50pm, during which time the vigil was taking place at the Atkinson venue.\n\nPolice swooped on the scene and detained the man minutes later before seizing the flick knife.\n\nA 32-year-old man dressed in all black, from Standish, was arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article, and taken into custody. There were no reports of any injuries during the incident.\n\nDetective Inspector Gavin Mulcahy said: 'We know too well the devastating impact knife crime can have for victims, their families and friends, and those who carry them.\n\n'This week has seen an unspeakable tragedy unfold in Southport, and this incident occurred a short distance from where a vigil had been happening where the community was paying their respects to all those affected.\n\n'Officers made a swift arrest and have seized a knife that could have been used to cause harm in our communities.\n\n'Those offenders who carry them have no place whatsoever in our communities.\n\n'Every day we are carrying out stop checks, warrants and land searches to take knives off our streets, but as this incident shows, the assistance of members of the public in telling us where they are stored and who is carrying them is vital to ensure the safety of families and residents.'\n\nAt the vigil, tearful locals laid flowers outside the Merseyside town's grand Atkinson building after falling silent to remember Bebe, Elsie and nine-year-old Alice.\n\nIn the first week of the summer holidays, the seaside town should be bustling with happy families and tourists. But at 6pm on Tuesday, more than 5,000 people stood in silence outside the Atkinson building amid an outpouring of grief and shock.\n\nIn front of the Grade II-listed building, which comprises a theatre, museum and library, is the Town Hall Gardens, where a sea of floral tributes built up.\n\nOne heartbreaking poster surrounded by candles and flowers said 'never stop dancing'. The children had been enjoying a summer holiday dance workshop when a knifeman entered the studio and launched a frenzied attack.\n\nAmong the bouquets, there were also a number of Taylor Swift-style friendship bracelets. 'Thinking of you all,' a row of four of them spelt out.\n\nAhead of the vigil, the families and schools of the innocent girls who were fatally attacked by a crazed knifeman also released tributes.\n\nIn a statement, Bebe's family said: 'No words can describe the devastation that has hit our family as try to deal with the loss of our little girl Bebe.'\n\nThe family of Alice Dasilva Aguiar added: 'Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our Princess, like we said before to you, you're always our princess and no one would change that. Love from Your Hero Daddy and Mummy.'\n\nAnd the headteacher of Farnborough Road Infant School said they were 'heartbroken and devastated' by the death of pupil Elsie.\n\nJennifer Sephton said: 'Elsie has been a loving and bright member of our wonderful community since first being brought here on her father's shoulders, and even at her early age she was such a caring and charismatic young lady who loved to please.\n\n'Elsie was a kind and caring friend to all who met her and was adored by everyone in our community. Our hearts and most deeply-felt sympathies go out to Elsie's family, friends and our Farnborough community who have been left numb by what has happened.\n\n'It is immensely difficult to put into words how amazing Elsie was and the impact she had on those around her. We will miss you dearly Elsie. You were one of a kind.'\n\nAlder Hey Children's hospital this afternoon released a statement confirming that seven children had been taken to the site for treatment. One of those was Alice, and of the others, two remain in a critical condition, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe head of the school trust attended by Alice and Bebe said the girls 'will be in our hearts forever'.\n\nEndeavour Learning Trust chief executive David Clayton said 'no words can do justice to what has happened here in Southport.\n\nThe trust contains Churchtown Primary School in Southport, which Alice and Bebe had both attended.\n\nChurchtown Primary headteacher Jinnie Payne said the school had heard the 'tragic news' with 'great sadness', describing the stabbings as an 'atrocity'.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Clayton said: 'No words can do justice to what has happened here in Southport - and our hearts are broken for the families who have lost their children.\n\n'No one should ever have to experience horror like this.\n\n'Our immediate focus now is on providing support to the community as we start to understand what has happened. The death of a child is always a desperate tragedy for a school, and particularly so under such circumstances.\n\n'We will come together as a community, offering each other support and care as we work through this difficult time.\n\n'Alice and Bebe will be in our hearts forever.'\n\nMs Payne said Alice, a Year 4 pupil at Churchtown, was the 'happiest of souls, a true ray of sunshine'.\n\nThe Churchtown Primary headteacher added: 'She was known and loved by everyone in our school community of 700 children, a testament to her unique ability to connect with others.\n\n'Alice's radiant smile brightened our days, and she embraced every aspect of school life with enthusiasm and joy.\n\n'Her kindness, playful nature, and zest for trying new things will forever be remembered. Alice, you will always hold a special place in our hearts at Churchtown.'\n\nMs Payne said Bebe, a former pupil at the school, was a 'joyful girl' whose 'kindness radiated through the entire Churchtown community'.\n\nThe headteacher added: 'During her time at the school, Bebe's considerate nature and her love of learning shone through in everything that she did.\n\n'Each day, she would come into school ready to grasp every opportunity available to her and fun and laughter were never far away whenever Bebe was involved.\n\n'Her considerate nature meant that she had many friends and she always ensured all children felt included, whether that was through play or working together in the classroom.\n\n'Bebe's memory will live on in the hearts of all who knew her.'\n\nThe headteacher added: 'We know that a number of other children from Churchtown were also involved in the attack, along with much-loved colleagues.\n\n'We extend our heartfelt wishes to all those families affected by this horrific incident, including those currently in hospital or continuing to receive treatment.'\n\nDevastated relatives of Alice said she had been taken by a 'despicable human being.'\n\nHer mother Alexandra Aguiar is understood to be originally from Caracas in Venezuela and her dad David Aguiar is from the Portuguese island of Madeira.\n\nRelative Carina Aguiar, a hotel worker who lives in Camara de Lobos in Madeira, posted a link on her social media to news Merseyside Police had confirmed a third child' had died following the attack and wrote tear emojis beside it.\n\nEarlier she posted a photo of a black ribbon on her Facebook alongside Alice's name after writing in an emotional tribute: 'Princess Alice. In this moment of great pain my soul hurts, my body hurts, my mind hurts. I have a lump in my throat.\n\n'You were just an innocent child, a happy smiley girl with a bright life ahead of you which a despicable human being took away from you, without pity, for no reason.'\n\nReacting to the riots, Merseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy posted on X: 'I am incredibly proud of my officers and staff who have worked so hard to save the lives of children, investigate the horrific incident from yesterday, working with partners to provide reassurance to our communities and now they are facing this level of violence from these thugs\n\n'Over 1000 residents from Southport came together this evening to remember the little girls who have died, those who are still critical in hospital and all those who witnessed & are traumatised by the events from yesterday. This is where all of our focus should be.'\n\nMP Mr Hurley said: 'It's distressing to see people from outside our Southport community attacking our police and local people.\n\n'I want to make it clear that I fully condemn any attack on our emergency services, these are the same services that responded to the tragic attack yesterday.\n\n'I appeal to local people to avoid the area and stay safe, to allow the police to do their job.'\n\nMr Hurley continued: 'I want to thank our community for pulling together and supporting every person who has been affected by Monday's tragic attack.\n\n'Nowhere was this more evident than the solidarity, remembrance and sympathy heard at today's vigil.\n\n'To those who laid flowers, candles, toys, thank you. I was deeply saddened to hear the news today of the death or a third child. Bebe, Elsie and Alice are in all of our thoughts and hearts today.'\n\nThe three girls stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class were yesterday named by police as nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and six-year-old Bebe King (L-R)\n\nAway from the protest, a vigil was being held for the three girls who died in the tragic incident\n\nIn stark contrast to the riots, there was a sense of tranquillity around the site of the vigil\n\nThe vigil was held at the Atkinson in Southport at around 6pm on Tuesday evening\n\nThe Southport Mosque said it was 'truly shocked and saddened to hear about the events that unfolded today'. They added: 'We extend our deepest sympathy to the families of all affected. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all.'\n\nThe Liverpool Region Mosque Network said it was 'shocked and horrified' by the knife rampage on Monday.\n\nBut it added: 'A minority of people are attempting to portray that this inhumane act is somehow related to the Muslim community. Frankly it is not, and we must not let those who seek to divide us and spread hatred use this as an opportunity.\n\n'This evening, we have seen distressing scenes outside Southport Mosque with angry protesters, gathering outside. This is causing further fear and anxiety within our communities. We must all unite and stand together against all forms of hate, violence and division.'\n\nAnd the The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) condemned 'shocking scenes of far-right rioters running amok outside a mosque'.\n\nThe MCB says Islamaphobic backlash began with a false rumour on the internet which was then stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims.\n\nMCB secretary-general Zara Mohammed said: 'At a time of great tragedy, loss, and mourning, we must stand firm against the cynical forces of hatred and division. This does not represent our diverse Britain and the people of Southport.\n\n'The Government must address the increasing rise of violent far-right extremism targeting Muslim communities. More must be done to tackle Islamophobia and offer reassurance at this time.'\n\nShe added: 'We commend the authorities for their swift action, and our prayers are with the mosque, the families of the victims of yesterday's attack, and the local community.'\n\nDowning Street also warned against 'unhelpful' speculation amid concerns that misreporting online could inflame community tensions.\n\nAn aerial view of Hart Street on Monday, where a horrifying knife attack took place just before midday\n\nOfficers should be given the space to probe the case without people guessing at the possible motive or circumstances, No 10 said.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Prime Minister was repeatedly asked 'how many more children will die?' as he placed flowers at the scene of the attack.\n\nSir Keir's brief visit, which lasted around two minutes, was interrupted by some members of the public heckling him.\n\nAs the Prime Minister walked past, one man declared: 'Here's your photo opportunity.'\n\nAnother shouted: 'How many more children? Our kids are dead and you're leaving already?'\n\nOther furious onlookers shouted 'scumbag', 'time for change' and 'go away, you're not wanted'.\n\nAnother woman said: 'I've just found out my friend's nine-year-old daughter was killed, the person I've held as a child, and you can't do s***.'\n\nAnd a different man shouted: 'Get the truth out!'\n\nMs Cooper has said social media companies 'need to take some responsibility' for some activity in the aftermath of the attack.\n\nResponding to shadow home secretary James Cleverly, she said: 'I agree with him too about the responsibility on every one of us. The police do need to be able to pursue this investigation.\n\n'There will be wider questions for other days, but the most important thing is that every one of us supports the police in their investigation now.\n\n'I agree with him too about the responsibility on social media companies, because we do need to recognise there are things that are taking place on social media that go against their terms and conditions, and their commitments as well. They need to take some responsibility for that.\n\n'Above all, this is about young children. This is about children and their families who will be grieving, and the many other children who were involved yesterday who will be facing great trauma as well.'\n\nHer counterpart Mr Cleverly called for people not to 'get involved in the grief of others' by sharing misinformation relating to the Southport attack on social media.\n\n'Enough people are already distressed without their distress being amplified by speculation and gossip online,' he added.\n\nAhead of fears mounting over a far-right rally, Sir Keir's official spokesman said: 'Of course, people should listen the police, they should not do anything that is going to make the police's job harder to manage the situation, to conduct their investigations.\n\n'It is unhelpful to speculate on things like the motive and the circumstance around this.'\n\nPolice have said that, although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType":

In no time, there were hundreds.\"\n\nREAD NEXT: Chaos in Southport as nearly 40 police officers injured during violent riots\n\nA clothing bank in the grounds of the mosque was torched amid the disorder. The imam said he heard shouts of 'we want our country back' from outside. \"I was scared,\" he said. \"There were about eight of us and we had to barricade ourselves in.\"\n\nOyess Ali, 28, who attends the mosque, said the imam and others were inside praying when it was targeted. They were forced to barricade themselves inside the building, he said.\n\nMr Ali lives close to the scene where children were stabbed in Southport on Monday, and witnessed the horrific aftermath. \"Monday was horrific, then Tuesday happened, and now I'm thinking 'what's next?' The whole town is in shock.\"\n\nTracy Whitfield, whose partner runs a business in Sussex Road, revealed its windows were damaged by the heat from a police van that was set on fire outside. She described the mob which gathered as 'the worst of humanity'.\n\n\"I couldn't believe the aggression towards the police,\" she went on. \"There was one lady - a police officer - who looked out cold. She was being dragged by her colleagues to an ambulance.\"\n\nTracey said she came down to the shop to collect paperwork amid fears the building could be set on fire. \"There were people everywhere,\" she said. \"There were flames, fireworks, and the van was on fire. Every bang made me jump.\"\n\nNorman Wallis, chief executive of Southport Pleasureland, described those involved in last night's disorder as 'cowards'. \"These people have been bussed in to hijack a terrible tragedy,\" he said. \"They weren't from the town.\"\n\nMr Wallis said the disorder and those involved are 'not the face of the town'. \"Southport is not like that,\" he said. \"It's a very safe place.\"\n\nMr Wallis said he 'put the message out' for people to join in the community clean-up this morning. \"I thought we have to do something about it.

The family has owned Windsor Mini Mart for four years and say they have 'never had a single incident' until last night.\n\nDozens of people entered the shop and stole items including alcohol and cash from the till, Thanuja said. \"It was terrifying to watch.

Not to hospital.\"\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), meanwhile, paid tribute to the victims of the mass stabbing, before condemning \"shocking scenes of far-right rioters running amok outside a mosque\".\n\nMCB secretary general, Zara Mohammed, said: \"At a time of great tragedy, loss, and mourning, we must stand firm against the cynical forces of hatred and division.\n\n\"This does not represent our diverse Britain and the people of Southport.\"", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Hussein_(runner)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ibrahim Hussein (runner)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ITV News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Violent disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ummah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seaside resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North West England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medical services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zara_Mohammed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zara Mohammed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Council_of_Britain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslim Council of Britain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives/Activities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives/Activities", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/4WKWqfeGVqNBonD1UQa2Eu/320d0d8d3b05b417df078b9ce80c867d/3107_MOSQUE_CHAIRMAN_HERO.jpeg?fm=jpg&fit=fill&w=1600&h=900&q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4823529411764705, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Violent scenes broke out on Tuesday, July 30 during protests taking place on St Luke's Road.\n\nThe latest figures from emergency services said 39 police officers were injured, with 27 of them being taken to hospital. Bricks taken from garden walls were used to attack officers and cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire.\n\nIn one video, shared widely on social media, a man appears to be goading riot police officers, a brick can then be seen hitting the man's head. He can be seen touching his head and blood can be seen on his hand.\n\nOther people can be seen continuing to throwing wheelie bins and bricks at officers. As the man walks away from the scene, he is then hit with another brick in his groin. He can be seen keeled over and helped by another man as he leaves the scene.\n\nMerseyside Police said several officers sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion. Other officers suffered head injuries and serious facial injuries. One was knocked unconscious.\n\nA large group of people, who police said are believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road on Tuesday evening. Cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire and bricks were thrown at a local mosque.\n\nDamage was also caused to a local convenience store and wheelie bins were set on fire, police said. Three police dogs have also been injured. Police Dogs Zoe and Ike have sustained leg injuries from bricks thrown at them. A third dog, PD Quga, also suffered burns to her back leg.\n\nPhotos and video seen by the ECHO showed crowds gathered around police riot vans on St Luke's Road. A police van was also seen up in flames. Merseyside Police said as a result of the disorder, a 24-hour Section 60 Order has been introduced in the area, running from 19.54pm on (Tuesday). Extra officers will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities. The order, under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals in the area and is designed to minimise serious violence.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack. I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\n\n\"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park.\n\n\"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday. We would appeal to anyone who has information or video footage of those involved in this shocking behaviour to come forward so we can identify and arrest those responsible. Anyone with information can DM @MerPolCC or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olivia_williams@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Olivia Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_container", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waste container"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_van", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police van"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_and_search", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stop and search"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Justice_and_Public_Order_Act_1994", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Wales Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assistant chief constable"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/article29649344.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_OWR_LECH_310724_UGC.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 229, "textEnd": 236}], "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families.\"\n\nSwift is currently completing the European leg of her Eras Tour. She will return to the UK in August to perform the show for five more nights in London.\n\nSwift fans created the \"Swifties for Southport\" campaign to fundraise money for the victims and their families through the Alder Hey Children's Charity. Originally setting a target goal of \u00a313,000 ($28,264), the page managed to raise \u00a3100,000 ($217,379) in under 24 hours.\n\nThe town of Southport has been reeling as locals work with police to learn what triggered the attack on the the group of young children, who were between 6 and 11 years old.\n\nA growing wall of flowers, written messages, and toys has emerged on a road near where the attack unfolded.\n\nA 17-year-old male was arrested after police responded to the \"ferocious attack\" on a class at a dance and yoga workshop at around 11.50am (local time). He was arrested under suspicion of murder or attempted murder.\n\nThe male suspect was born in Cardiff and lived in the nearby town of Banks, Lancashire, according to Merseyside Police. No further details on the perpetrator have been released as of yet.\n\nIn the day following the attack, shortly after a minute's silence was held the by the Southport community, hundreds of protesters gathered by a local mosque a few streets over, the BBC reported.\n\nMany of the protesters covered their faces with scarves and hoodies, vandalising the mosque with items like rocks and bottles.\n\nFalse reports had earlier circulated that the suspect was an asylum seeker who'd recently crossed the English Channel and was on an MI6 watchlist. Merseyside Police have linked the online rhetoric to the \"sickening\" violence that erupted the day after the attack.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nSpeaking on the unrest, Merseyside Police said that they were dealing with \"criminal behaviour\" while trying to process the events of the day before.\n\nEmergency vehicles were set on fire and burned, protesters threw heavy items at police officers, and a store was broken into and ransacked.\n\nSeveral officers were injured in the clashes, including an officer who suffered a \"broken nose\".\n\n\"Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face,\" said Constable Goss.\n\n\"Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavour to prevent disorder.\"\n\nUK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called for an end to the violence and asked all parties to de-escalate the tension on Southport's streets, stating that the \"scenes of thuggery\" were not reflective of the community that had come together to mourn.\n\n\"I think everyone should be showing some respect for the community that is grieving and also for the police who are pursuing an urgent criminal investigation now, and who showed such heroism and bravery yesterday in the face of these horrific attacks,\" Cooper said.\n\n\"I think everyone needs to support the police in that work, and frankly the scenes of thuggery that we have seen on the streets of Southport this evening bear no relation to the way in which the Southport community has been coming together to support each other and to support grieving families.\n\n\"We need to see some respect for the grieving community and for the police in their urgent work.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"},

Police have said it was not linked to terrorism and that the suspect was born in the UK.\n\nYet far-right groups have stoked speculation that the teenage suspect was involved with Islam, and police said Tuesday's violence erupted when several hundred people began to throw items at a mosque. Police linked the crowd to the English Defence League, a group which has sometimes staged violent demonstrations against Islam.\n\nPolice vehicles were damaged and set alight, officers were pelted by bricks and large garbage containers. One video posted online showed the crowd chanting \"we want our country back\".\n\nAway from the violence, hundreds had gathered for an emotional vigil to pay tribute to those killed in the attack, laying flowers and toys.\n\n\"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and our respect,\" Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.\n\n\"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law.\"\n\nA 17-year-old male is currently in police custody on suspicion of murder and attempted murder after the bloody rampage at a \"Taylor Swift yoga and dance workshop\", a summer vacation event for children aged 6 to 11.\n\nWitnesses described the attack as being like a scene from a horror film. In addition to the three deaths, eight children suffered stab wounds. Five of them and two adults who had tried to protect them remain in a critical condition.\n\nThe police have said the motive remained unclear and have not given any details about the suspect, beyond saying he was born in Wales and lived in a village nearby.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nGoss and local politicians said those clashing with police involved many from outside the area, and the Liverpool Region Mosque Network said a minority of people were trying to use the incident to spread hatred.\n\n\"This evening we have seen distressing scenes outside Southport Mosque with angry protesters gathering outside,\" it said in a statement. \"This is causing further fear and anxiety within our communities,\"\n\nStarmer had earlier paid a sombre visit to the town to lay flowers, and King Charles and his family have expressed their horror. US singer Swift herself wrote on Instagram that she was \"just completely in shock\".\n\n\"These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families,\" she said.\n\nHer fans have raised more than 250,000 pounds (S$430,600) online to help families of the victims and for the hospital where some of the children were being treated.\n\nThe three girls who died in the attack were named as Bebe King, aged 6, 7-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, aged 9, whose parents are Portuguese.\n\n\"Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our Princess, like we said before to you, you're always our princess and no one would change that. Love from Your Hero Daddy and Mummy,\" Aguiar's family said in a statement.\n\nThere has been increasing concern at rising levels of stabbings and knife crime in Britain, and the Southport attack follows other recent similar, indiscriminate rampages.\n\n\"I'm absolutely determined that my government will get to grips with it,\" Starmer said.", "source": {"uri": "asiaone.com", "dataType":

hospital after a deadly knife attack at a school holiday workshop in Southport.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were all fatally stabbed on Monday after a knifeman entered the Hart Centre where a Taylor Swift-themed class for young children was taking place.\n\nEight other children suffered stab wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured, Merseyside Police said.\n\nMeanwhile, a 17-year-old teenage boy, who has not been identified due to his age, remains in police custody after he was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.\n\nIt comes as the town recovers from a night of violence after hundreds of people, thought by police to be members of the English Defence League, gathered outside a mosque in protest.\n\nFifty officers suffered serious injuries when bricks, stones and bottles were thrown and cars were set alight during violent protests following a vigil for Alice, Bebe and Elsie.\n\nMerseyside Police said \"a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" - began to throw items such as bricks towards the place of worship at about 7:45pm.\n\nOfficers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them and police vehicles were damaged and set on fire.\n\nMerseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion.\n\nIn a post on social media, the force said shops had been \"broken into and looted\", adding that \"those responsible will be brought to justice\".\n\nA police cordon remains in place on Hart Street, two days after the attack, with mourners continue to lay flowers, balloons and messages of condolences for loved ones.\n\nRepresentatives from Farnborough Road Infant School, where Elsie attended, visited the scene on Wednesday to lay their own floral tributes.\n\nThe suspect, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport.\n\nPolice have said that, although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.\n\nAngela Rayner has criticised the \"disgraceful\" rioting in Southport and \"disrespectful\" social media theories as she urged people to allow the police to establish the facts.\n\nSpeaking on ITV's This Morning, the Deputy Prime Minister said: \"I think there's been a couple of instances recently where, especially particularly online, where theories and things are whipped up, whereas actually it turns out to be not true or not the full picture.\n\n\"And I think there's a culture now where people want to instantly get the facts, but actually it's important that police and those people that are doing the work are able to carry out that work.\n\n\"And it's important for justice as well, because we have law and order in the UK, and it's important that those authorities are able to establish the facts and then to be able to bring those forward.\n\n\"But speculation and some of the untruths that have been put around social media, not only is that creating tensions and fear in the community, but it's disrespectful to family who maybe want those answers that haven't got those answers.\"\n\nShe added that it is \"really unhelpful for the police\" and \"my plea is that we all need to step back and just wait and then that information will come but allow the police to do their work\".", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"},

The suspect then stabbed three children aged 6, 7, and 9 to death, and injured eight other children, five of whom are in critical condition, and two adults, according to a statement from the Merseyside Police.\n\nThe murders became a flash point for anti-immigration sentiment after it was revealed by neighbors of the suspect that the murderer was the son of Rwandan parents, but was born in the U.K., according to the Daily Express.\n\nDespite the suspect reportedly being raised by Christian parents, rioters assembled outside the Southport Islamic Society Mosque on Tuesday evening, chanting \"No surrender!\" and \"English till I die!\"\n\nAccording to The Guardian, others heard chants of \"Allah Allah, who the f**k is Allah?\"\n\nThe rioters are allegedly members of the far-right English Defence League, an organization that has been referred to as explicitly anti-immigrant and Islamophobic by activists.\n\n\"At around 7.45pm, a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League - began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road in Southport,\" Merseyside police wrote in a statement.\n\nPolice also stated that the riots \"involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside.\"\n\nAdditionally, a number of officers were injured, police confirmed, while a number of cars were also damaged and a shop was broken into and looted in Southport. \"This is completely unacceptable. We're gathering evidence and those responsible will be brought to justice,\" police said in an appeal on Facebook.\n\nOnline speculation and conspiracy theories claim that the suspect was not born in the U.K. and that he was being monitored by law enforcement before the attack, both of which are untrue.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,\" Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time. Our officers should not have to face this, but we will be there tonight to ensure the safety of the local community who have suffered enough, and will arrest those involved in criminal behaviour.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the conspiracy theories in an address to the House of Commons on Tuesday evening saying, \"False information has already been extensively shared in the last 24 hours. Those who do this for their own purposes risk undermining a crucial criminal investigation, and I ask everyone to show some respect for the community in Southport and for families who are grieving and in trauma.\"\n\nFar-right activist, Tommy Robinson, who was arrested on suspected charges of terrorism on Sunday, went viral on Tuesday evening after he posted a rant to his X account in which he condemned the police for \"allowing people into our towns and cities that are raping their way through our towns.\"\n\n\"You care more for Afghanis, Somalis, Eritreans, Syrians, Pakistani... They are a danger to us,\" Robinson went on. The post has garnered 46k likes and millions of views at the time of publishing.\n\nMP Nigel Farage, whose Reform UK party has also been called anti-immigrant and racist by activist groups, echoed conspiracy theories about the suspect in a video posted to his X on Tuesday evening.\n\n\"Was this guy being monitored by the security services, some reports say he was, others less sure,\" Farage said. \"The police say it was a non-terror incident. Just as they said, the stabbing of an Army lieutenant colonel in uniform on the streets of Kent was a 'non-terror incident.' I just wonder if the truth is being withheld from us.\"\n\nFarage's post has similarly garnered more than a million views at the time of publishing.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com",

Police have said it was not linked to terrorism and that the suspect was born in the UK.\n\nYet far-right groups have stoked speculation that the teenage suspect was involved with Islam, and police said Tuesday's violence erupted when several hundred people began to throw items at a mosque. Police linked the crowd to the English Defence League, a group which has sometimes staged violent demonstrations against Islam.\n\nPolice vehicles were damaged and set alight, officers were pelted by bricks and large garbage containers. One video posted online showed the crowd chanting \"we want our country back\".\n\nAway from the violence, hundreds had gathered for an emotional vigil to pay tribute to those killed in the attack, laying flowers and toys.\n\n\"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday. They deserve our support and our respect,\" Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.\n\n\"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law.\"\n\nA 17-year-old male is in police custody on suspicion of murder and attempted murder after the bloody rampage at a \"Taylor Swift yoga and dance workshop\", a summer vacation event for children aged six to 11.\n\nWitnesses described the attack as being like a scene from a horror film. In addition to the three deaths, eight children suffered stab wounds. Five of them and two adults who had tried to protect them remain in a critical condition.\n\nThe police have said the motive remained unclear and have not given any details about the suspect, beyond saying he was born in Wales and lived in a village nearby.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nGoss and local politicians said those clashing with police involved many from outside the area, and the Liverpool Region Mosque Network said a minority of people were trying to use the incident to spread hatred.\n\n\"This evening we have seen distressing scenes outside Southport Mosque with angry protesters gathering outside,\" it said in a statement. \"This is causing further fear and anxiety within our communities,\"\n\nStarmer had earlier paid a sombre visit to the town to lay flowers, and King Charles and his family have expressed their horror.\n\nTaylor Swift 'completely in shock'\n\nUS singer Swift herself wrote on Instagram that she was \"just completely in shock\".\n\n\"These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families,\" she said.\n\nHer fans have raised more than 250,000 pounds ($NZ544,000)online to help families of the victims and for the hospital where some of the children were being treated.\n\nThe three girls who died in the attack were named as Bebe King, aged 6, 7-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, aged 9, whose parents are Portuguese.\n\n\"Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our Princess, like we said before to you, you're always our princess and no one would change that. Love from Your Hero Daddy and Mummy,\" Aguiar's family said in a statement.\n\nThere has been increasing concern at rising levels of stabbings and knife crime in Britain, and the Southport attack follows other recent similar, indiscriminate rampages.\n\n\"I'm absolutely determined that my government will get to grips with it,\" Starmer said.", "source": {"uri": "odt.co.nz", "dataType": "news",

She said: \"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\" Ms Stancombe added: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\"\n\nA 17-year-old youth from the village of Banks, five miles away from Southport was arrested on Monday afternoon on suspicion of murder and attempted murder and remains in police custody. The violence broke out amid claims that the police were not telling the truth about the suspect's background and his motives, with rumours swirling on social media.\n\nEarlier, a vigil was held to remember the three girls who were killed with six-year-old Bebe King and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar also named as victims.\n\nFollow for the latest updates.\n\n8:15AM Southport riots 'appalling', says Labour housing minister\n\nMatthew Pennycook, a housing minister, labelled violent scenes in Southport overnight \"absolutely appalling\" and \"completely despicable\".\n\nThe Labour frontbencher told Sky News: \"We have had 22 officers now injured, seen reports of vehicles belonging to members of the public set on fire, bricks and fireworks thrown at a mosque.\n\n\"I think it is absolutely appalling if I am honest.\n\n\"The community in Southport is reeling from the horrific events two days ago.

You can imagine that yesterday was a very emotional day for so many people in Southport. We had a vigil with thousands of people paying their respects in a peaceful fashion and just having a space and a place where they can express their emotions.\"\n\nHe added: \"And then within an hour, an hour and a half, we also had this horrific riots. There's no other word to describe it. It was led by people from outside of town. These were thugs who got the train in. These were not people from Southport. They were using the deaths of three little kiddies for their own political purposes and to attack the very same first responders and the very same police who had been on the scene on Monday.\"\n\nMr Hurley added: \"There's no way to describe that other than to say it's utterly reprehensible and we must identify these people and make sure that the full force of the law is down against them.\"\n\n8:06AM Pictured: Aftermath of violent disorder outside mosque in Southport 8:00AM Councillor saw masked men arriving at scene\n\nCouncillor Mike Salmon, who saw the violence happening outside his home on Tuesday, told BBC Radio Merseyside several people arrived at the scene wearing \"masks and balaclavas\".\n\nHe said: \"A few hours ago there were lots of people arriving down my road.

This does not represent our diverse Britain and the people of Southport.\n\n\"The Government must address the increasing rise of violent far-right extremism targeting Muslim communities. More must be done to tackle Islamophobia and offer reassurance at this time.\"\n\nShe added: \"We commend the authorities for their swift action, and our prayers are with the mosque, the families of the victims of yesterday's attack, and the local community.\"\n\n7:45AM Labour minister condemns 'absolutely appalling' violence outside mosque in Southport\n\nA Labour frontbencher has condemned the \"absolutely appalling\" violence in Southport last night.\n\nA mob gathered outside a mosque and hurled bricks, masonry and fireworks at police officers, with 39 officers injured and 27 taken to hospital.\n\nMatthew Pennycock, the housing minister, told Times Radio: \"The people of Southport are obviously reeling from the horror that was inflicted upon them two days ago, they're doing their best to pull together, to have the process the space they need.\n\n\"To have that overshadowed by the violence and disorder is sickening... They should feel the full force of the law.\"\n\nAsked what message he would send to those minded to take part in further violence, Mr Pennycock said: \"Well, not to do it, to give the community the space to grieve, to process the trauma they've experienced. I think the community needs that space, it doesn't need violence and disorder, and from what we can tell lots of people who don't even live in Merseyside coming in and trying to stir up

Police have said it was not linked to terrorism and that the suspect was born in the UK.\n\nYet far-right groups have stoked speculation that the teenage suspect was involved with Islam, and police said Tuesday\u2019s violence erupted when several hundred people began to throw items at a mosque.\n\nPolice linked the crowd to the English Defence League, a group which has sometimes staged violent demonstrations against Islam.\n\nPolice vehicles were damaged and set alight, officers were pelted by bricks and large garbage containers. One video posted online showed the crowd chanting \u201cwe want our country back\u201d.\n\nAway from the violence, hundreds had gathered for an emotional vigil to pay tribute to those killed in the attack, laying flowers and toys.\n\n\u201cThe people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday.

This is causing further fear and anxiety within our communitiesMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss\n\nWitnesses described the attack as being like a scene from a horror film. In addition to the three deaths, eight children suffered stab wounds. Five of them and two adults who had tried to protect them remain in a critical condition.\n\nThe police have said the motive remained unclear and have not given any details about the suspect, beyond saying he was born in Wales and lived in a village nearby.\n\n\u201cThere has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,\u201d said Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss.\n\n\u201cWe have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\u201d\n\nGoss and local politicians said those clashing with police involved many from outside the area, and the Liverpool Region Mosque Network said a minority of people were trying to use the incident to spread hatred.\n\n\u201cThis evening we have seen distressing scenes outside Southport Mosque with angry protesters gathering outside,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThis is causing further fear and anxiety within our communities.\u201d\n\nStarmer had earlier paid a sombre visit to the town to lay flowers, and King Charles and his family have expressed their horror.\n\nUS singer Swift herself wrote on Instagram that she was \u201cjust completely in shock\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese were just little kids at a dance class.

Chaos erupted after a vigil was held to commemorate the victims of the knife attack, as well as those who remain in a critical condition in hospital.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine; Bebe King, six; and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, have all been named as victims. A 17-year-old boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons because of his age - remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder.\n\nREAD NEXT: Devastated parents are 'not speaking, only crying' after little girl, 9, killed in Southport stabbing\n\nMerseyside Police said the disorder began last night when 'a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League' - started to throw items such as bricks towards a mosque. Officers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched at them and police vehicles were damaged and set on fire.\n\nIn a post on social media, the force said shops had been 'broken into and looted', adding that 'those responsible will be brought to justice'. 27 police officers taken to hospital amid the chaotic scenes, with 12 others being treated and discharged at the scene, the North West Ambulance Service said.\n\nThis morning, dozens of local residents have turned outside the mosque with brushes and shovels to help with the clean-up operation. Norman Wallis, chief executive of Southport Pleasureland, who was helping at the junction of Sussex Road and St Luke's Road, said it was partly in response to a social media plea he put out after witnessing the violence on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe described the riots as being 'like a war scene' as he 'people came out of town to cause mayhem'. Mr Wallis said: \"It's horrendous what those hooligans have done last night.\n\n\"It was like a war scene. People from out of town just causing absolute mayhem.\n\n\"People in hoods climbing up lampposts, throwing bricks, they set a police car on fire. But none of those people were the people of Southport.\n\n\"The people of Southport are the ones here today cleaning the mess up. Those people from out of town - they came in in buses and cars and had change of clothes.\n\n\"They just started to riot and do this.\" He added: \"There are hundreds of people who have responded, and we've ended up with lots of people down here today, all from the local community and helping with the fantastic clean-up.\"\n\nShop owner Chanaka Balasuryla said the Southport community has rallied around him since his store was looted during the disorder. Mr Balasuryla said he called 999 after spotting men trying to smash their way in, on the CCTV camera from his home five minutes away.\n\nHe said he was 'terrified' when he thought they would set fire to the premises because there is a woman and her daughter living in a flat above. He said he later found out that the woman confronted the raiders, telling them it was her shop in an attempt to stop them.\n\nMr Balasuryla said: \"I got a couple of hours' sleep and then got a phone call saying 'You need to come down, there's lots of people waiting to help.\"\n\nHe added that local people had said they would defend his shop if necessary. He said: \"It was terrifying last night. But I feel safe again because people are here to protect us.\"\n\nPatrick Hurley, the Labour MP for Southport, said that 'beered-up thugs' were behind the riots. Speaking on the boy who was arrested after the stabbing on Monday, he said: \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all.\n\n\"Not least these beered-up thugs who have descended on the town last night intent on causing trouble. We all have to stand against that and Southport will not accept this.\n\n\"Southport will unite against this sort of thing.\" He added: \"These were thugs who got the train in, these were not the people from Southport.\n\n\"They were using the horrific incident on Monday, the deaths of three little kiddies, for their own political purposes and actually to attack the very same first responders and the very same police, who had been on the scene on Monday, were then being pelted with bricks the day after by these thugs.\n\n\"There's no way to describe that other than to say it's utterly reprehensible and we must identify these people and make sure that the full force of the law is down against them. These people are utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children and utterly disrespecting the town.\"\n\nThe stabbing suspect, who remains in custody, was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, police said. Merseyside Police have said that, although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.\n\nRead more of today's top stories here", "source": {"uri":

Here's What You Need To Know", "body": "A vigil for the three girls who died on Monday was hijacked by far-right activists.\n\nAfter a horrific attack on a children's dance class in Southport on Monday, far-right activists started a violent protest outside a local mosque the following night.\n\nWhen a knifeman entered a Taylor Swift-themed yoga and dance session two days ago, three girls were killed and eight others left in a critical condition.\n\nA vigil held for the deceased in Southport was then hijacked by far-right figures who soon started to attack the police and the surrounding areas, shouting offensive phrases.\n\nHere's a chronological look at what we know so far about these two horrendous incidents.\n\nOn Monday night, two girls died from stab wounds - six-year-old Bebe King and seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe. A third child, nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar, also died in hospital in the early hours of Tuesday morning.\n\nEight other children suffered from stab wounds in the attack, five of whom went into a critical condition.\n\nTwo adults were also injured, and are in a critical condition.\n\nThe attacker was quickly arrested and a knife was seized by the police.\n\nThe only detail released to the public about the suspect so far is that he is a 17-year-old from Banks village in Lancashire, and born in Cardiff - he cannot be named due to his age.\n\nHe has no known links to Islam and his motive remains unclear.\n\nPM Keir Starmer went to Stockport on Tuesday to join the vigil, but he was soon heckled by one woman for not being able to help the situation.\n\nHome secretary Yvette Cooper also called for the public to avoid \"unhelpful\" speculation around the attack on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nShe said: \"This is about children and their families who will be grieving, and the many other children who were involved yesterday who will be facing great trauma as well.\"\n\nThe incident sparked a response from the Royal Family, too.\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla released a statement saying they were \"profoundly shocked\" by the \"utterly horrific incident\".\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales also wrote on X, sending \"love, thoughts and prayers to all those involved in this horrid and heinous attack\".\n\nTaylor Swift also responded via her Instagram story, writing that the \"horror of yesterday's attack in Southport is washing over me continuously\".\n\nShe said: \"I'm just completely in shock. The loss of life and innocence and the horrendous trauma inflicted on everyone who was there, the families, and first responders.\n\n\"These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families.\"\n\nFns of the singer have since raised more than \u00a3272,000 on a Just Giving page to donate to Alder Hey Children's Hospital.\n\nDespite calls for calm, a protest erupted in Southport on Tuesday night.\n\nHundreds of far-right activists, potentially members of the English Defence League, threw bricks at police, set vehicles on fire and attacked a mosque.\n\nThe ambulance service says 39 people were treated after the protest - all of whom were police officers - 27 were taken to hospital, and 12 were treated and discharged at the scene.\n\nInjuries included fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and a concussion.\n\nThree police dogs were also injured having been hit by the bricks or burnt by the fires.\n\nLocal police say many of the crowd may not actually live in the Merseyside area.\n\nIt's believed some people may have been fired up by baseless claims on social media that the suspect had links to Islam, with false accusations and incorrect names of the attacker.\n\nThe local community has already condemned the protest - Southport MP Patrick Hurley said the rioters must face the \"full force of the law\".\n\nHe told the Today programme people \"were using the horrific incident on Monday, the deaths of three little kiddies, for their own political purposes\".\n\nHe said the protesters were \"beered-up thugs\", adding: \"Even if [the suspect] turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all\".\n\nOfficers were granted enhanced stop and search powers to stop any similar unrest breaking out again.\n\nSocial media companies are facing pressure to police content after misinformation and conspiracy theories took root on their platforms, helping to galvanise the far-right protests.\n\nThe prime minister has said the rioters will feel the \"full force of the law\", saying they had \"hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery\" and \"insulted the community as it grieves\".\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain's secretary general, Zara Mohammed, said: \"At a time of great tragedy, loss and mourning, we must stand firm against the cynical forces of hatred and division.\n\n\"This does not represent our diverse Britain and the people of Southport.\"", "source": {"uri":

Nearly 40 police officers sustained injuries and 27 were taken to hospital as chaos broke out on Tuesday as protestors met up following the frenzied stabbing attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nAfter calm was finally restored the extent of the chaos could be seen with rubbish burnt out vehicles and smashed windows but locals have been quick to get involved in the clean-up. One local said: \"At least the bin men don't have to empty the bins today - they've all been burnt.\"\n\nAndy Southwood, 54,local businessman, said: \"I didn't sleep much last night. In half an hour it exploded. It was chaotic. Mainly young kids with masks. It looked organised to me. It's crazy. It's a massive stain on the town.\" But he pointed out locals were up through the night cleaning up. \"Random people are coming out with shovels and spades to help clean up. That's the true spirit of Southport,\" he added.\n\nMerseyside Police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose, and a concussion. Other officers suffered head injuries, and serious facial injuries, and one was knocked unconscious.\n\nThree police dogs were also injured in the chaos, with Zoe and Ike suffering leg injuries from bricks thrown at them. A third dog, Quga - who was bitten, strangled and kicked by an offender at the beginning of this month - suffered burns to her back leg, the force said.\n\nMerseyside Police said those involved in the unrest - who they believe included supporters of the English Defence League - set alight cars belonging to members of the public, threw bricks at the local mosque, damaged a local convenience store, and set wheelie bins on fire.\n\nOne brave woman stood shaking crying holding up a 'hope not hate' poster despite being shouted at by the mob for being there. Several fires were started including what appeared to be an attempt to set fire to the mosque as burning bins and fence panelling erupted near the back entrance.\n\nExtra police will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities. North West Ambulance Service said of the injured police officers: \"We treated 39 patients in total, all of which were police officers. 27 were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene.\"\n\nThe violence followed the stabbings of Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, at the Taylor Swift-themed holiday club. Eight other children were also stabbed, with five children and two adults left in a critical condition. A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart Street.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucy_thornton@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lucy Thornton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tim_hanlon@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Tim Hanlon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_road_numbering_scheme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain road numbering scheme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strangling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Dasilva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Dasilva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Ambulance_Service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North West Ambulance Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_container", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waste container"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33363219.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AGP_MDM_310724_03.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Five remain in a critical condition in hospital along with two adults who tried to protect them.\n\nPolice, who have arrested an unnamed 17-year-old male on suspicion of murder and attempted murder, have said the incident was not terrorism-related and sought to quash speculation on the suspect's origins, saying he was born in Britain.\n\nThat did not prevent protesters, from what Merseyside police believed were tied to the right-wing anti-Islam group, the English Defence League, from targeting a mosque in the town and attacking police who tried to stop them.\n\nPoliticians and police said most of those taking part in the violence were not from the area, and said the clashes detracted from a large vigil attended by thousands to pay tribute to the young victims.\n\n'THUGS FROM OUT OF TOWN'\n\nA total of 39 officers were treated for injuries, including 27 who were taken to hospital, North West Ambulance Service said on Wednesday. Police said eight had suffered serious injuries including fractures, and three police dogs were also hurt.\n\n\"Offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park,\" Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss of Merseyside Police said in a statement.\n\n\"This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, streets in Southport were littered with bricks from broken walls, smashed bottles, and large garbage bins - which had been hurled at police the night before - and their contents. Charred tarmac bore witness to the police vehicles which had been set alight.\n\n\"What I saw last night was absolutely appalling ... It was devastating and it's kind of taken away from actually what's gone on, which is the tragedy of those deaths,\" local resident David Burgess told Sky News.\n\n\"This is about the girls and the tragedy which has happened - don't make it about this,\" he said, referring to the clashes. \"This isn't Southport. This isn't the community.\"\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer and senior ministers blamed \"violent thugs from out town\", for the trouble.\n\n\"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law,\" Starmer said.\n\nMeanwhile, Taylor Swift's fans have so far raised more than 270,000 pounds ($346,000) to help families of the victims and for the hospital where some of the children were being treated.\n\n($1 = 0.7795 pounds)\n\n(Reporting by Sachin Ravikumar; writing by Michael Holden; Editing by Bernadette Baum)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement in the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North West England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assistant chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Ambulance_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North West Ambulance Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/theprint_default_image_new.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nIn the wake of the horrific violence that saw three young children tragically killed at a Taylor Swift dance club in Southport on Monday, English Defence League rioters have taken over the streets near the incident, setting fires, throwing bricks, and attacking the police officers.\n\nYesterday, emergency service workers rushed to the horrifying scene at the dance club, arrested the attacker, and tried to save the lives of the more than a dozen young children who were injured in the knife attack. Today, as residents in the area report having their garden walls broken down by rioters, Liverpool's Mayor Steve Rotheram blasted the violent crowd for attacking \"the very people who ran towards the danger yesterday.\"\n\nThe violent crowd hurled residents' wheelie bins at police and attacked a nearby mosque, following unsubstantiated claims that the 17-year-old attacker was a Muslim. Shortly before a police vehicle was set on fire, Merseyside Police revealed that the suspect was born in Cardiff and moved to Southport 11 years ago, but due to age-related reporting restrictions, they cannot be identified.\n\nREAD MORE: Large disorder breaks out next to mosque after vigil for Southport knife victims\n\nOfficers at the scene equipped helmets and riot gear, with stones and bottles launched at them and police riot vans attacked. One was set on fire, while multiple officers are said to have been injured.\n\nLiverpool Echo and Manchester Evening News reporters at the scene reported balaclava-clad thugs breaking down garden walls for bricks, as well as widespread drinking and Islamophobic chants.\n\nFar from the violent crowds, thousands in Southport paid their respects to the young children who were killed in the shocking attack. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who laid flowers near to the scene, personally thanked the emergency services and members of the public who risked their lives during the incident.\n\nMeanwhile, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has called the rioters \"thugs\" and condemned their actions, while calling for \"respect\" for a community in grief. She said the violent scenes \"in no way reflect\" on the people of Southport.\n\nPosting the statement on X, Mayor Steve Rotheram said: \"There are families just coming to terms with yesterday's events, parents grieving for their murdered children and survivors still trying to process what they witnessed. The violent scenes in Southport tonight will only further traumatise a community that is already struggling to come to terms with this attack.\n\n\"Mindless violence directed at the very people who ran towards the danger yesterday, and outright Islamaphobia, only distract from the work of delivering justice.\n\n\"The real story tonight is of the thousands who gathered at the vigil in Southport in memory of Bebe, Elsie and Alice. For the sake of their loved ones, this disorder needs to stop so the police do their jobs.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_morgan@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "William Morgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nightclub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rotheram", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Rotheram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Evening_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Evening News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Echo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool Echo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29646256.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS340839592.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Send them back! Fight for our kids! Let's stand together!\"\n\nThe disgraceful scenes came after police condemned false rumours that the 17-year-old suspect in custody on suspicion of murder over the deadly attack in the town on Monday was an asylum seeker who came to Britain on a small boat.\n\nThey stressed that he was born in Cardiff and that his parents came to the UK from Rwanda.\n\nTensions had been rising all day, with a visit to the scene by Sir Keir Starmer marred by shouts of \"Disgrace!\" and \"You should be ashamed of yourself, killing our kids!\"\n\nOne woman at the riot said the disorder was because the knife man who attacked the children \"was a Muslim\".\n\nShe said: \"We are saying enough is enough. Why are they not stopping the migrants coming in? \"How many more children will be killed because they are letting them all in? They should be at the borders stopping them.\"\n\nThe furious mob tore down garden walls to use the bricks as missiles to pelt police.\n\nBricks were also thrown at the mosque and wheelie bins were hurled.\n\nSome thugs threw smoke bombs, with men wearing caps and shorts charging at outnumbered officers.\n\nScores of riot vans and patrol cars raced to the scene and a police helicopter hovered overhead as the violence spread out of control, with smoke pouring into the darkening skies.\n\nMerseyside Police's assistant chief constable Alex Goss said last night: \"It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, we have seen overwhelming support and sympathy from the community and wider Merseyside communities for the families who are currently trying to deal with their loss and care for victims injured during the major incident.\n\n\"Yesterday our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face. Tonight they find themselves being attacked as they endeavour to prevent disorder.\n\n\"The actions in Southport will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside.\"\n\nThe appalling scenes came after the Prime Minister's official spokesman was asked whether he would appeal for calm before the planned far-Right rally.\n\nHe replied: \"Of course, people should listen to the police, they should not do anything that is going to make the police's job harder to manage the situation, to conduct their investigations.\"\n\nMerseyside Police yesterday issued a warning after an \"incorrect\" name for the alleged Southport attacker was widely circulated online.\n\nInaccurate posts by social media sleuths about the identity of the perpetrator have received millions of views and engagements. Downing Street also warned against \"unhelpful\" speculation amid concerns that misreporting online could inflame tensions.\n\nOfficers should be given the space to investigate the case without people guessing at the possible motive or circumstances, No 10 said.\n\nSunder Katwala, director of the think-tank British Future, said a bogus news channel seemed to have invented a fake name for the suspect and run a false story that was shared online.\n\nPolice have said that, although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.\n\nEarlier yesterday, the Home Secretary called for social media firms to \"take some responsibility\" for inflammatory misinformation being spread online about the suspect.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your

According to the BBC, some of the mosque's windows were smashed in the process.\n\nMerseyside Police condemned the violence and said one of their officers had suffered a suspected broken nose. Photos and videos posted on social media showed several riot police officers with cuts and grazes to their faces following the clashes with the far-right mob.\n\n\"At around 7.45pm, a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League - began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road in Southport,\" the force said.\n\n\"Officers who are deployed are currently dealing with criminal behaviour and violence with bottles and wheelie bins being thrown at them.\"\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were all fatally stabbed in Monday's attack, whilst eight other children suffered stab wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured.\n\nBBC News reported late on Tuesday that the 17-year-old suspect was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents and had moved to the Southport area in 2013. Because the suspect is under 18 he cannot be legally identified.\n\nPolice have provided no details except that he was born in the UK. The Sun newspaper reported that he was born in Cardiff in 2006 after his parents, who are Christian, moved from Rwanda.\n\nShortly after the violence began, far-right leader Tommy Robinson said the violent mob was \"justified\" in their actions and said they were driven by concerns over immigration.\n\nIn an expletive-laden rant posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, Robinson said: \"Before anyone starts condemning the angry English men up in Southport, ask yourselves this, what do you fucking expect them to do. Don't call them hooligans - they're justified in their anger.\"\n\nRobinson fled the UK on Sunday to \"put himself beyond the reach of [UK] authorities\" where he was due to be in court over alleged contempt proceedings.\n\nHis words appeared to refer to a rumour widely circulated on social media that the suspect arrested for the stabbing is from Syria.\n\nSeveral major social media accounts, including influencer Andrew Tate, also peddled the false claim the attacker was an illegal immigrant.\n\nYvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, had earlier warned against using the killing of three schoolgirls to \"stir up division\" and spread misinformation online.\n\n\"Above all, this is about young children,\" she said. \"This is about children and their families who will be grieving, and the many other children who were involved yesterday who will be facing great trauma as well.\"\n\nIn a statement on its Facebook page, made well before the violence erupted, the Southport Islamic Society Mosque posted that they were \"truly shocked and saddened\" about Monday's attack.", "source": {"uri": "middleeasteye.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Middle East Eye"}, "authors": [],

As reported by Sky News, three of the victims - six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar - sadly passed, while five other children and two adults remain in critical condition.\n\nA 17-year-old male was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody. According to police, he is originally from Cardiff and lived in the village of Banks close to Southport in Merseyside, England.\n\nThe stabbing is currently believed to be an isolated incident, and it is not being treated as terror-related. Police are not looking for other suspects in connection with the attack. However, the motivation for the incident is currently \"unclear\".\n\nTo pay respects to the victims, a peaceful vigil was held in the seaside town, with hundreds arriving to lay wreaths, candles and toys in tribute to the three children who died in the attack.\n\nThings soon turned violent, however, when the protestors took to the streets - throwing bricks at local mosques, clashing with police, setting cars alight and causing physical violence.\n\nOfficers \"sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion,\" Merseyside Police said (via CNN), and a number of police dogs were also hurt.\n\nPolice believe that the violence ensued over the unconfirmed reports of the identity of the suspect, who has \"incorrectly\" been named on social media.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,\" Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK, and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nGoss also added that many of those involved in the violence were not local to the area, and are likely to have travelled to Southport with the intention of causing unrest.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) also weighed in on the recent events, paying tributes to the girls killed in the attack and highlighting how a \"false rumour on the internet\" has seen a rise in Islamophobia in the area.\n\n\"Southport's tragedy was shamelessly exploited to spark outrage, with Islamophobia fueling the fire and leading to tonight's violence. This began with a false rumour on the internet, stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims,\" it said.\n\n\"[The government] must address the increasing rise of violent far-right extremism targeting Muslim communities. More must be done to tackle Islamophobia and offer reassurance at this time.\"\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer has commented on the incidents too, and described the protesters as having \"hijacked\" the peaceful vigil \"with violence and thuggery\", as well as \"insulted the community as it grieves\" (via The Guardian).\n\nHe added that those involved \"will feel the full force of the law.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, footage of the protestors has been quick to circulate online, with clips of the group ensuing violence in the area and clashing with police spreading on platforms such as X.\n\nOne that has particularly caught people's attention is a video of one of the protestors being hit in the crotch by a rock as he walked away from a barricade of police officers. In the footage, police are seen standing in riot gear while items such as rocks and wheely bins are hurled at them. One protester in the midst of it all is seen getting hit in the head by an object thrown by the crowd, before turning around and getting hit in the crotch by a rock thrown.\n\nSince being uploaded, it has already gathered over 40,000 'likes' and received over 3.8million views. Check it out below.\n\nFollowing news breaking of the tragic mass stabbing, Taylor Swift shared a handwritten statement addressing the attack on her Instagram Stories feed. \"The horror of yesterday's attack in Southport is washing over me continuously, and I'm just completely in shock,\" she wrote.\n\n\"The loss of life and innocence, and the horrendous trauma inflicted on everyone who was there, the families and first responders. These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families.\"\n\nIt was later confirmed that two Swift fans had launched a fundraiser to help raise funds for those affected by the tragedy and have so far raised over \u00a3120,000.\n\n\"We are working with Alder Hey Children's Hospital to help raise money for the families affected by the tragedy in Southport, and raising funeral funds for the two young swifties who have tragically passed.

Five remain in critical condition in hospital, along with two adults who tried to protect them.\n\nPolice are legally restricted in the details they can provide about the alleged teenage attacker, but they have said the incident was not terrorism-related, and that he was born in Britain, quashing speculation on his origins.\n\nThat did not prevent protesters, who police believe were supporters of a right-wing group, from targeting the mosque and attacking police who tried to stop them.\n\n'THUGS FROM OUT OF TOWN'\n\nPoliticians and police said most of those taking part in the violence were not from the area, and that the clashes detracted from a large vigil attended by thousands to pay tribute to the young victims.\n\nKennedy said 54 officers were hurt, and 27 of them were taken to hospital for serious injuries that included fractures and head wounds. Three police dogs were also hurt.\n\nThe police chief said she was disgusted and appalled by the violence, and a full investigation was underway to identify those involved.\n\n\"They were there purely for hooliganism and thuggery in terms of bringing that level of violence and that behaviour onto the streets of Southport and that is not what this community is about,\" she said.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer said the \"violent thugs from out town\" would \"feel the full force of the law\".\n\nOn Wednesday, streets in Southport were littered with bricks from broken walls, smashed bottles, large garbage bins and their contents.

Police have said it was not linked to terrorism and that the suspect was born in the UK.\n\nYet far-right groups have stoked speculation that the teenage suspect was involved with Islam, and police said Tuesday's violence erupted when several hundred people began to throw items at a mosque. Police linked the crowd to the English Defence League, a group which has sometimes staged violent demonstrations against Islam.\n\nPolice vehicles were damaged and set alight, officers were pelted by bricks and large garbage containers.

In addition to the three fatalities, eight children suffered stab wounds, with five of them and two adults who intervened remaining in critical condition.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss emphasized the importance of refraining from speculation about the suspect. \"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,\" Goss said.\n\nLocal politicians and community leaders, including the Liverpool Region Mosque Network, urged for calm and unity. \"This evening we have seen distressing scenes outside Southport Mosque with angry protesters gathering outside,\" the network said. \"This is causing further fear and anxiety within our communities.\"\n\nPrime Minister Starmer paid a somber visit to the town to lay flowers in memory of the victims. King Charles and his family expressed their horror, and Taylor Swift shared her shock on Instagram, stating, \"These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families.\"\n\nSwift's fans have raised over \u00a3250,000 ($320,850) to support the families of the victims and the hospital treating the injured children. The three girls who lost their lives were identified as 6-year-old Bebe King, 7-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, and 9-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar, whose parents are Portuguese.\n\nIn response to the rising concern over knife crime in Britain, Starmer vowed that his government would address the issue. \"I'm absolutely determined that my government will get to grips with it,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "lagatar24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lagatar English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seaside resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://lagatar24.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/112147664.jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The suspect then stabbed three children aged 6, 7, and 9 to death, and injured eight other children, five of whom are in critical condition, and two adults, according to a statement from the Merseyside Police.\n\nThe murders became a flash point for anti-immigration sentiment after it was revealed by neighbors of the suspect that the murderer was the son of Rwandan parents, but was born in the U.K., according to the Daily Express.\n\nDespite the suspect reportedly being raised by Christian parents, rioters assembled outside the Southport Islamic Society Mosque on Tuesday evening, chanting \"No surrender!\" and \"English till I die!\"\n\nAccording to The Guardian, others heard chants of \"Allah Allah, who the f**k is Allah?\"\n\nThe rioters are allegedly members of the far-right English Defence League, an organization that has been referred to as explicitly anti-immigrant and Islamophobic by activists.\n\n\"At around 7.45pm, a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League - began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road in Southport,\" Merseyside police wrote in a statement.\n\nPolice also stated that the riots \"involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside.\"\n\nAdditionally, a number of officers were injured, police confirmed, while a number of cars were also damaged and a shop was broken into and looted in Southport. \"This is completely unacceptable. We're gathering evidence and those responsible will be brought to justice,\" police said in an appeal on Facebook.\n\nOnline speculation and conspiracy theories claim that the suspect was not born in the U.K. and that he was being monitored by law enforcement before the attack, both of which are untrue.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,\" Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time. Our officers should not have to face this, but we will be there tonight to ensure the safety of the local community who have suffered enough, and will arrest those involved in criminal behaviour.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the conspiracy theories in an address to the House of Commons on Tuesday evening saying, \"False information has already been extensively shared in the last 24 hours. Those who do this for their own purposes risk undermining a crucial criminal investigation, and I ask everyone to show some respect for the community in Southport and for families who are grieving and in trauma.\"\n\nFar-right activist, Tommy Robinson, who was arrested on suspected charges of terrorism on Sunday, went viral on Tuesday evening after he posted a rant to his X account in which he condemned the police for \"allowing people into our towns and cities that are raping their way through our towns.\"\n\n\"You care more for Afghanis, Somalis, Eritreans, Syrians, Pakistani... They are a danger to us,\" Robinson went on. The post has garnered 46k likes and millions of views at the time of publishing.\n\nMP Nigel Farage, whose Reform UK party has also been called anti-immigrant and racist by activist groups, echoed conspiracy theories about the suspect in a video posted to his X on Tuesday evening.\n\n\"Was this guy being monitored by the security services, some reports say he was, others less sure,\" Farage said. \"The police say it was a non-terror incident. Just as they said, the stabbing of an Army lieutenant colonel in uniform on the streets of Kent was a 'non-terror incident.' I just wonder if the truth is being withheld from us.\"\n\nFarage's post has similarly garnered more than a million views at the time of publishing.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

escalated around 7.45 p.m. local time when supporters of the English Defence League -- a far-right, Islamophobic organization -- threw items at the Southport Mosque.\n\nThe tension quickly turned to

The Southport Islamic Society Mosque reportedly got damaged during the rioting.\n\nThirty-nine police officers have been injured after unrest broke out in Southport hours after a vigil took place to remember the victims of a knife attack in which three children were killed, the North West Ambulance Service said.\n\nOn Monday, Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were killed after being fatally stabbed at the children's dance club in Hart Street.

Damage was also caused to a local convenience store and wheelie bins were set on fire, police said. A clean up operation has taken place this morning, with members of the local community stepping in to help.\n\nThe disorder last night came after a mass stabbing on Hart Street on Monday resulted in the death of three girls - Alice Aguiar, aged nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven. Merseyside Police have arrested a 17-year-old boy who is originally from Cardiff but lives in Banks, Lancashire, on suspicion of murder.\n\nSocial media has been awash with misinformation since Monday's tragic incident. A spokesperson for the Merseyside Police said an incorrect name has been shared on social media in connection with the suspect.\n\nThey added: \"We would urge people not to speculate on details of the incident while the investigation is ongoing.\" This incident is not currently being treated as terror-related and detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with it.\n\nAngela Rayner criticised the \"disgraceful\" scenes in Southport and \"disrespectful\" social media theories as she urged people to allow the police to establish the facts. Speaking on ITV's This Morning, the Deputy Prime Minister said: \"I think there's been a couple of instances recently where, especially particularly online, where theories and things are whipped up, whereas actually it turns out to be not true or not the full picture.\n\n\"And I think there's a culture now where people want to instantly get the facts, but actually it's important that police and those people that are doing the work are able to carry out that work. And it's important for justice as well, because we have law and order in the UK, and it's important that those authorities are able to establish the facts and then to be able to bring those forward.\n\n\"But speculation and some of the untruths that have been put around social media, not only is that creating tensions and fear in the community, but it's disrespectful to family who maybe want those answers that haven't got those answers.\" She added that it is \"really unhelpful for the police\" and \"my plea is that we all need to step back and just wait and then that information will come but allow the police to do their work\".\n\nHaving released a full statement condemning the violence yesterday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper reiterated her message on Wednesday morning. Posting on X (formerly Twitter), the Home Secretary said: \"Brave police, firefighters & paramedics saved lives in the horrific Southport attack. Total disgrace those same emergency services were attacked & officers injured by violent thugs from out of town. Grieving community & emergency services deserve all our support & respect.\"\n\nLiverpool City Region Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram said: \"There are families just coming to terms with yesterday's events, parents grieving for their murdered children and survivors still trying to process what they witnessed. The violent scenes in Southport tonight will only further traumatise a community that is already struggling to come to terms with this attack.\n\n\"Mindless violence directed at the very people who ran towards the danger yesterday, and outright Islamophobia, only distract from the work of delivering justice. The real story tonight is of the thousands who gathered at the vigil in Southport in memory of Bebe, Elsie and Alice. For the sake of their loved ones, this disorder needs to stop so the police do their jobs.\"\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the violent protests. In a statement, he added: \"It's distressing to see people from outside our Southport community attacking our police and local people. I want to make it clear that I fully condemn any attack on our emergency services, these are the same services that responded to the tragic attack yesterday.\"\n\nMr Hurley continued: \"I want to thank our community for pulling together and supporting every person who has been affected by Monday's tragic attack. Nowhere was this more evident than the solidarity, remembrance and sympathy heard at today's vigil. To those who laid flowers, candles, toys, thank you. I was deeply saddened to hear the news today of the death of a third child. Bebe, Elsie and Alice are in all of our thoughts and hearts today.\"\n\nMerseyside's Police Commissioner Emily Spurrell said: \"I am absolutely appalled by the disgraceful scenes of violence in Southport tonight. This is a community which has faced unimaginable tragedy, and it is grieving.\n\n\"Such behaviour is abhorrent and only causes further harm and suffering. Officers are working around the clock to get justice for the families. It is completely unacceptable that they - and the wider community - are now being put in danger by those who would bring violence and disorder to our streets.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_haygarth@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Dan Haygarth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Rayner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angela Rayner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Morning_(TV_programme)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "This Morning (TV programme)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banks,_Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Banks, Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Banks, Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Spurrell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emily Spurrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_City_Region", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool City Region"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rotheram", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Rotheram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/article29648126.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Protest-In-Southport-Sparked-By-Rumours-Of-Stabbing-Suspects-Identity.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

However, police have clarified that the horrific incident, which left eight other children and two adults wounded, was not linked to terrorism.\n\nPolice have arrested an unnamed 17-year-old male on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. The suspect was born in Britain. A total of 39 police officers were treated for injuries, with 27 taken to the hospital, according to the North West Ambulance Service.

He is in custody held on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.\n\nThree girls Bebe King, six; Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven; and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, died from their injuries and eight other girls are currently in hospital - five in critical condition.\n\n(Image: Merseyside Police)\n\nTwo adults also suffered injuries and are in hospital in critical condition.\n\nIn light of the tragedy a vigil was held in Southport yesterday Tuesday, July 30, and immediately following this a violent protest on a nearby street broke out close to a mosque.\n\nOfficers are appealing for footage and information after more than 50 officers were hurt during the disorder.\n\nOf the 53 injured, 49 were Merseyside Police officers and four were Lancashire Police officers. Eight sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion and were treated in hospital.\n\nOther officers suffered varying degrees of injury including head injuries, serious facial injuries and one was knocked unconscious.\n\nThe disorder began at around 7.45pm and the crowd had dispersed by around midnight.\n\nA total of four men have been arrested and taken into custody in connection with the disorder.\n\nAmong them a 31-year-old man from St Helens was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder.\n\nA 31-year-old man from West Derby, Liverpool was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder; a 39-year-old man from Southport was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and a 32-year-old man from Manchester with a probation address in Southport was arrested on suspicion of affray and possession of a bladed article.\n\nBricks from garden walls were reportedly used as missiles to attack officers and set cars belonging to the public on fire at random.\n\n(Image: Pat Hurst/PA Wire)\n\nBricks were also reportedly thrown at a mosque, a convenience store was damaged, and wheelie bins set on fire. Three police dogs were also injured. After having bricks thrown at them, Police Dog Zoe sustained a laceration to her leg, has been stitched and is now resting, and PD Ike is recovering after sustaining a cut mouth and swelling to his front leg.\n\nPD Quga suffered burns to her back leg. A fourth dog, PD Repo, was spared injury after their handler kicked petrol away.\n\nAs a result of the disorder, a 24-hour Section 60 Order was introduced in the area and remains in place today.\n\nExtra officers will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities. The Order, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals in the area and is designed to minimise serious violence.\n\nA Section 34 Order has also been introduced under the Anti-Social Behaviour & Policing Act 2014, giving officers powers to direct people who are engaging in antisocial behaviour or are likely to become involved in such incidents.\n\nThese powers will not be used for anyone visiting the area and going about their daily business. Under the legislation, officers have the power to seize any item, including vehicles, used in the commission of anti-social behaviour. Should a person who has previously been directed to leave the area return, an offence would be committed, which they may ultimately be arrested for.\n\n(Image: The damage in the road)\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said: \"I know the wider community is as shocked as we are about the abhorrent events of last night.\n\n\"Through the night there has been a tremendous effort by members of the public who came out to help clean up the streets, using hose pipes and brushes and donating food and dog food to officers to restore the pride and respect they have for their town. Partner agencies, including Sefton Council, were also deployed to help clean up the damage left by those involved.\n\n\"We have been overwhelmed with messages of thanks from the community, and I know I speak on behalf of all those officers there last night when I say how grateful we all are for their support.\n\n\"We were joined by colleagues from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support, and I want to thank them publicly for their assistance. Sadly, 49 Merseyside officers and four Lancashire officers were injured in their efforts to prevent further disorder and protect the public.\n\n\"The wanton violence and destruction we saw is the very last thing the people of Southport need having been rocked by the awful events of Monday. The disrespect toward grieving families and the community is despicable, and I want to reassure residents in Southport that we will have a significantly increased police presence in the town in the coming days.\n\n\"We would appeal to anyone who has information or video footage of those involved in this shocking behaviour to come forward so we can identify and arrest those responsible.\n\n\"Finally, I want to make this absolutely clear: anyone who intends to cause future damage and harm to our communities will be dealt with robustly, using all our available powers. There are extensive plans and resources in place to quickly deal with anyone intent on causing disorder over the coming days.

This violent thuggery, which has overshadowed a peaceful vigil for three little girls, is an insult to the community and to all those who need the space to process what has happened and to heal.\"\n\nShe added her condemnation of the attack on local police stating: \"It is appalling that the local police, who have already dealt with extraordinarily difficult circumstances this week and are undertaking an urgent criminal investigation, should be on the receiving end of violence and abuse.\"\n\nCooper emphasised the importance of unity and support, declaring: \"Our focus must remain on supporting the police in their urgent criminal investigation into yesterday's attack and on supporting the families and community who have faced such tragedy and deserve everyone's prayers tonight.\"\n\nFollowing a visit earlier today, when the Home Secretary laid a floral tribute at the scene on Hart Street, Cooper addressed the troubling surge of misinformation and malicious messaging spread across social media since the incident, appealing to the public not to impede the police work.", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lottie_gibbons@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Lottie Gibbons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "phoebe_tonks@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Phoebe Tonks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Echo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool Echo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29646466.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_js340774453.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

He said people had 'got the train in' to the Merseyside town 'intent on causing trouble'.\n\nHe added that those who threw bricks towards a mosque following a vigil used the incident 'for their own political purposes'. Mr Hurley spoke this morning after a night of terror and violence for residents, as chaotic scenes unfolded close to the scene of the fatal stabbing on Hart Street.\n\nREAD NEXT: Southport riots sparked by English Defence League supporters, police say\n\nBricks taken from garden walls were used to attack officers and cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire, police said. 39 police officers were injured in the scenes of 'disorder', with 27 taken to hospital.\n\nThe disorder escalated after bricks were thrown at a local mosque. In a statement issued last night, police said they believed this initial disorder was sparked by a number of supporters of the EDL - a far-right organisation known for its Islamophobia.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Mr Hurley said 'under no circumstances' was the attack on the mosque justified'. Speaking on the 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, who was arrested after the stabbing on Monday, he said: \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all.\n\n\"Not least these beered-up thugs who have descended on the town last night intent on causing trouble. We all have to stand against that and Southport will not accept this.\n\n\"Southport will unite against this sort of thing.\" He added: \"These were thugs who got the train in, these were not the people from Southport.\n\n\"They were using the horrific incident on Monday, the deaths of three little kiddies, for their own political purposes and actually to attack the very same first responders and the very same police, who had been on the scene on Monday, were then being pelted with bricks the day after by these thugs.\n\n\"There's no way to describe that other than to say it's utterly reprehensible and we must identify these people and make sure that the full force of the law is down against them. These people are utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children and utterly disrespecting the town.\"\n\nHe said that the riots happened because of 'propaganda and lies' spread on social media about the identity of the attacker. He told Times Radio: \"Because of the propaganda and the lies that were being spread around on social media from within minutes of the news breaking on Monday afternoon about the tragic incident.\n\n\"We'd had all sorts of lies being spread and misinformation being spread about the alleged perpetrator and some people with the best of intentions then they tried to rebut this, they tried to argue back, but all that happens is you're just amplifying people's false messaging.\"\n\nHe added: \"This misinformation doesn't just exist on people's internet browsers and on people's phones. It has real world impact. And what happened is that the real world impact of that was that we then had hundreds of people descending on the town, descending on Southport from outside of the area, intent on causing trouble, either because they believe what they've written, or because they are bad faith actors who wrote it in the first place, in the hope of causing community division.\"\n\nThe riots broke out after the brutal stabbing at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club on Hart Street on Monday. Three little girls - Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven - lost their lives in the incident.\n\nEight other children and two adults were also stabbed. Five children and the two adults remain in a critical condition/\n\nA 17-year-old boy remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder. Police have said that, although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related.\n\nRead more of today's top stories here", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashlie_blakey@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Ashlie Blakey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(BBC_Radio_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Today (BBC Radio 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Times Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29646867.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Protest-In-Southport-Sparked-By-Rumours-Of-Stabbing-Suspects-Identity.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4666666666666667, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Eight police officers sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion.\n\nOther officers suffered head injuries and serious facial injuries.

A police van was also seen up in flames.\n\nMerseyside Police said as a result of the disorder, a 24-hour Section 60 Order has been introduced in the area, running from 19.54pm on (Tuesday). Extra officers will remain in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities. The order, under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, gives officers enhanced stop and search powers to stop individuals in the area and is designed to minimise serious violence.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.

A major incident was declared by emergency services on St Lukes's Road, Southport on Tuesday, July 30. Ms Kennedy told the ECHO earlier today that 54 police officers were injured last night - 49 from Merseyside Police and five from Lancashire Constabulary.\n\nThis afternoon, she confirmed none of the officers who were injured are in a critical condition. Officers' injuries included broken bones, cuts and concussion. High visibility patrols will continue in these areas and a dispersal order is in place.\n\nMs Kennedy said: \"Being at Southport police station last night and seeing the officers being brought in from the street with their injuries was just devastating.\" She said it was a \"fast-moving investigation and its progressing well\".\n\nAccording to the Chief Constable, three people were arrested on Tuesday night. She said: \"Our priority was to try and keep the communities of Southport safe and also to make sure officers remained safe. Three arrests were made, however more will follow. It's impossible to say (how many will be arrested). It's really early days in the investigation.\"\n\nShe estimated 200 to 300 people were involved. She added: \"Initially, there were about 70 people who made their way away from the vigil and were making their way towards the mosque. They suddenly became about 200 in number and then others joined that number.\"\n\nEmily Spurrell, Merseyside's Police and Crime Commissioner paid tribute to the injured officers and said she was \"appalled\" by the scenes of violence yesterday.\n\nMs Spurrell said: \"I cannot even begin to imagine how the people of Southport are feeling today. A community trying to come to terms with the most unimaginable tragedy, rooted in grief, subjected to such mindless displays of violence.\n\n\"I am totally appalled by the senseless behaviour from those individuals who came to Southport last night with the sole intention of bringing mayhem and disorder to our streets. Streets that, just hours before, were full of compassion, of love, and unity, in memory of the three little girls killed in Monday's horrendous attack, as well as all those injured and deeply affected.\n\n\"The same community which is trying to come to terms with the horrific scenes they witnessed on Monday have this morning come together, to clean the debris from their streets, left behind in the wake of last night's disgraceful scenes. Many of them having had their own property vandalised, walls knocked over, vehicles set alight, and are now left counting the cost of such abhorrent behaviour.\n\n\"My heart goes out to everybody in those communities, and I hope they can find some comfort in the love and support they will receive from across Merseyside today, and in the days to come.\n\n\"I also want to pay tribute to the Merseyside Police officers who came under attack last night. Their bravery, dedication, and commitment to put the safety of our communities before their own cannot be overstated. As ever, we are in their debt.\n\n\"These are the same heroic police officers who were back on shift after responding to the knife incident the day before. The same officers who ran towards danger on Monday and, along with our other blue light services helped to save lives and care for the injured. The same officers faced with such awful and hateful behaviour from individuals seeking to use this tragedy to spread fear and hate, whilst risking the lives of the wider community.\n\n\"That 53 officers and three police dogs suffered injuries at those hands of these thugs is reprehensible and shameful. My thoughts are with them, and I wish them all a speedy and full recovery.\n\n\"The individuals that caused those injuries and took part in those appalling scenes are not representative of the people of Merseyside. The violence and hatred they peddle will never be welcome here. I know that officers are working around the clock to identify those who incited and took part in last night's events, and I'm assured that once identified they will feel the full weight of the law.\"\n\nThe Commissioner added: \"Southport is a beautiful place. A seaside town, that brings joy to many families, now suffering with unspeakable heartache, reeling from mindless violence and at the centre of a media storm.

"Attack on a Taylor Swift themed dance workshop in Southport of UK, at least 8 injured\n\nViolent clashes broke out in Southport, a seaside town in North West England, Tuesday evening as police confronted demonstrators protesting in the wake of a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class the previous day that killed three girls.\n\nPolice said the situation escalated around 7.45 p.m. local time when supporters of the English Defence League -- a far-right, Islamophobic organization -- threw items at the Southport Mosque.\n\nThe tension quickly turned to violence as bottles and wheelie bins were thrown at officers, leading to a police van being set on fire.\n\nAn officer suffered a suspected broken nose amid the chaos, and additional patrols, including the dog section, were deployed to the area.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Doss described the situation as \"sickening,\" particularly in light of the community's recent trauma following the tragic loss of three young lives in the stabbing incident.\n\nDoss emphasized that the unrest was being fueled by individuals from outside the Merseyside area, exploiting the recent tragedy to incite disorder.\n\n\"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody,\" he said. \"Some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\"\n\nThe home secretary earlier issued a warning against spreading disinformation about the stabbing attack, a call echoed by the police in their statement tonight.\n\nThe arrested individual, according to the police, was born in the UK, and speculation about his status is seen as unhelpful and potentially harmful.\n\nMerseyside police have vowed to continue their efforts to ensure the safety of the local community, which has already suffered immensely.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

He's a bit of a party animal and I think he just got excited last night. His head will be hurting this morning.'\n\nThe 'sickening' violence, which started barely an hour after thousands of mourners had gathered for a vigil to remember the victims who lost their lives, with the Prime Minister, Home Secretary and police chiefs condemning the thuggery.\n\nThe violent group were accused of showing 'no respect to a town that's grieving'.\n\nTributes poured in for the three little girls killed who police yesterday named as six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar.\n\nEight other children suffered stab wounds at the Taylor Swift-themed summer holiday dance workshop.

It's impossible to say (how many will be arrested). It's really early days in the investigation.'\n\nPC Kennedy estimated 200 to 300 people were involved. She said: 'Initially, there were about 70 people who made their way away from the vigil and were making their way towards the mosque.\n\n'They suddenly became about 200 in number and then others joined that number.'\n\nResidents and locals were left terrified by the incident locking themselves up in their homes.\n\nSouthport burns: A street near a mosque goes up in flames as violent thugs took to the streets last night\n\nAround 200 protesters were seen taking to the streets.

I don't see any justifiable point at what they were doing. It was heinous.\n\n'It was frightening, we were fearful for our own safety. Due to our ethnic origin we closed all the blinds, turned the lights off and hid ourselves inside. We were all very shaken and my mum didn't sleep last night. We didn't know what would happen to us.\n\n'I came home from university expecting to relax for three months and this happens.'\n\nA few doors down the road Denise Mace, 51, and her chef husband Graham, 52, watched from inside also fearing for their safety and worrying their car parked outside would be smashed up.\n\nAs the police were forced back they quietly pleaded with officers to hold their ground as they filmed from an upstairs window.\n\n'It was terrifying, absolutely horrendous. We didn't know if they would come into our house. We were very lucky compared to other people. We were scared they would break in.'\n\nMrs Mace, a care consultant, said the local imam used to live next door and was a 'beautiful man.'\n\n'He would bring us food at Ramadan,' she said.

A number of officers were injured, including one who suffered a suspected broken nose.\n\nIt came as a vigil was taking place nearby to remember the three girls who were killed in the attack, identified on Tuesday as six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar.\n\nThe violence flared hours after Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, warned that divisions were being stirred up in the wake of the attack. There has been mounting speculation online about the identity of the attacker and the motive behind his rampage.\n\nMerseyside Police described Tuesday night's scenes as \"sickening\" and said people were using the speculation about the attack to \"bring violence and disorder to our streets\".\n\nRussian state media were among those falsely identifying the suspect as an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat last year and sharing claims that he was on an MI6 watch list and was known to local mental health services.\n\nUnsubstantiated claims that the attacker shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" have also circulated on social media.\n\nIn a statement to the Commons, Ms Cooper said those peddling misinformation about the tragedy risked undermining the ongoing criminal investigation and were being disrespectful to the grieving families.\n\nHowever, her statement did not rule out that the investigation could become a terror inquiry.\n\nDowning Street also appealed for calm after Sir Keir Starmer was heckled during a visit to Southport, with some protesters accusing the police of covering up aspects of the case.\n\nNigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, said the heckling of the Prime Minister demonstrated how unhappy the public were with the state of law and order in the country.\n\nHe said important questions about the case remained, including whether there was any truth in suggestions that the suspect was on a security services watch list and whether it was terror-related.\n\nIn a video statement, Mr Farage said: \"I just wonder whether the truth is being withheld from us. I don't know the answer, but I think it is a fair and legitimate question. What I do know is that something is going horribly wrong in our once beautiful country.\"\n\nMerseyside Police officers are continuing to question a 17-year-old on suspicion of murder and attempted murder in connection with the attack.\n\nIt is understood that although police are not treating the attack as terror-related, it has not been ruled out. Counter-terror police are continuing to support the investigation.\n\nMs Cooper's statement raised the prospect that the investigation could become a terror inquiry. She said the authorities would examine what contact the suspect had with \"different agencies\", which could include the security services and police, as well as mental health services.\n\nThe Home Secretary also made reference to Martyn's Law, legislation about the safety of public venues that was proposed following the Manchester Arena terror attack in 2017, saying the Southport case would no doubt feature in the debates over the measure.\n\nA source said: \"Terror has not been entirely ruled out at this point. We recognise that it can go in any direction. All agencies are still involved, including counter-terror police. They are not leading the investigation, and it is not being treated as a terror incident, but they are still on hand. We don't want to categorically rule anything out.\"\n\nRussia Today cited claims by a website called Channel 3 Now that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat last year and was on an MI6 watch list. The Russian state-controlled television channel later updated its story to reflect that the claim had been retracted.\n\nChannel 3 Now claims to be a US-based website, although its Facebook page showed that it is partly managed from Pakistan, while its YouTube channel contains dozens of Russian-language videos.\n\nWith an incorrect name of the alleged attacker being shared widely online, Merseyside Police was forced to issue a statement.\n\nA spokesman for the force said: \"This name is incorrect, and we would urge people not to speculate on details of the incident while the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nSpeaking about the violent protests on Tuesday night, Alex Goss, the Merseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable, said: \"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\n\"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK, and speculation helps nobody at this time. Our officers should not have to face this, but we will be there tonight to ensure the safety of the local community who have suffered enough, and will arrest those involved in criminal behaviour.\"\n\nThe teenager being questioned by police cannot be named because of his age, but was born in Cardiff in 2007. It is understood his parents came to the UK from Rwanda in 2002.\n\nMs Cooper urged people to avoid speculating on the case and allow the police to get on with their job.\n\nShe told MPs: \"False information has already been extensively shared in the last 24 hours. Those who do this for their own purposes risk undermining a crucial criminal investigation, and I ask everyone to show some respect for the community in Southport and for families who are grieving and in trauma.\n\n\"In these dark and difficult moments, the police must be able to get on with their work and communities must be given the time and space to grieve and heal without outside voices seeking to use events to stir up division or advance their own views.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said: \"People should listen to the police - they should not do anything that is going to make the police's job harder to manage the situation, to conduct their investigations. It is unhelpful to speculate on things like the motive and the circumstances around this.\"\n\nSteve Rotheram, the Mayor of Liverpool City Region, said: \"I don't understand that people want to weaponise the deaths of three children before the investigations have concluded.\"\n\nJames Cleverly, the shadow home secretary, called for people not to \"get involved in the grief of others\" by sharing misinformation relating to the attack on social media.\n\nMr Goss added: \"It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, we have seen overwhelming support and sympathy from the community and wider Merseyside communities for the families who are currently trying to deal with their loss and care for victims injured during the major incident.\n\n\"Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face. Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavour to prevent disorder.\n\n\"The actions in Southport tonight will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_evans@aol.co.uk", "name": "Martin Evans", "type": "author",

The attack, which occurred at a community center, shocked the nation and led to widespread grief and outrage. In the aftermath, tensions flared, resulting in violent clashes between far-right protesters and police near a local mosque.\n\nThe suspect, a 17-year-old male, was arrested shortly after the attack.While police have confirmed that the attack is not being treated as terrorism-related, misinformation and false rumors have fueled anger, leading to violent protests. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the violence, urging calm and unity as the community mourns the tragic loss of innocent lives.\n\nHere is all you need to know:\n\nWhat happened in Southport?\n\nOn Monday, a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event in Southport resulted in the deaths of three young girls and injuries to eight others. The attacker, a 17-year-old male, entered the dance studio and began stabbing attendees.\n\nWho were the victims?\n\nThe victims were identified as Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6. Alice's parents described her as their \"princess\" and said, \"Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our princess.\" Bebe King's family expressed their devastation, stating, \"No words can describe the devastation that has hit our family.\"\n\nWhat led to the violent clashes?\n\nFollowing the attack, fueled by false online rumors, protesters encircled the Southport Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre, shouting \"English till I die\" as they hurled bottles and stones at cops, set a police van ablaze, and injured 22 officers. The protesters were believed to be supporters of the English Defence League.\n\nWhat did the police say about the suspect?\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said, \"There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody.\" Police clarified that the suspect, born in Britain, was not an asylum seeker as some rumors claimed.\n\nHow did the community respond?\n\nThe community held a peaceful vigil to mourn the victims, but it was overshadowed by the violence that erupted later. Local leaders called for calm and unity. June Burns, the mayor of the Sefton region, urged people to be good to one another, stating, \"It's unbelievable that we find ourselves laying flowers for little girls who just wanted to dance.\"\n\nWhat was Prime Minister Keir Starmer's response?\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the violence, calling it \"thuggery\" and stating, \"Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves.\" He also emphasized the importance of addressing knife crime in the country.\n\nWhat is the significance of this incident in the context of UK knife crime?\n\nThe Southport attack is one of the most shocking incidents involving children in recent years. The rise in knife crime has been a growing concern in the UK, with calls for the government to take stronger action against bladed weapons. The attack has reignited debates about knife crime and public safety.\n\nHow did Taylor Swift react to the incident?\n\nTaylor Swift expressed her shock and sorrow on Instagram, saying, \"These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families.\" Her fans have raised over \u00a3250,000 to support the victims' families and the hospital treating the injured.\n\nWhat measures are being taken to prevent further violence?\n\nPolice have been deployed to maintain order and prevent further clashes. Authorities are urging the public to avoid spreading false information and to allow the investigation to proceed without speculation. The Liverpool Region Mosque Network called for unity and condemned the violence, stating, \"A minority of people are attempting to portray that this inhumane act is somehow related to the Muslim community. Frankly, it is not.\"\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, were at a Taylor Swift themed dance class on Monday when they were attacked.\n\nOther children and adults were also injured in the ordeal and police have since arrested a 17-year-old boy who was born in Cardiff in relation to the incident. Tensions have been high since the attack on Monday, July 29, and a large group of people have been seen shouting and pushing one another this evening (Tuesday, July 30) with police drafted in in an attempt to calm the escalating scenes.\n\nBroken bottles can be seen smashed in the middle of the street and items are being hurled at police vans, Manchester Evening News reports. Some police officers have suffered what appeared to be minor injuries in chaotic scenes outside the mosque.\n\nGet breaking news on BirminghamLive WhatsApp, click the link to join\n\nOfficers at the scene have equipped helmets and riot gear, with stones and bottles launched at them and police riot vans attacked. Firecrackers could be heard going off along with multiple police sirens sounding.\n\nMultiple men wearing masks and hoodies to cover their faces have been seen in a running battle with officers. Others were pictured with a George Cross flag next to a crate of cider.\n\nVideo on social media showed more police arriving with some officers seen walking through crowds with police dogs. Debris can be seen on the ground around the vans while police have been using their shields to deflect missiles thrown from the crowds.\n\nA helicopter is hovering over the area, and shocked local residents are out on the streets with roads busy with traffic. One man said Southport is \"edgy\" and others described the situation as \"horrendous\". Multiple police cars and vans, blue lights flashing and sirens blaring are patrolling local streets, with hundreds of onlookers gathering in the area.\n\nA police van appears to have been set on fire in the chaos just after 8pm this evening (July 30).", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isabelle_bates@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Isabelle Bates", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "james_holt@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "James Holt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Dasilva", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Dasilva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Evening_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Evening News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_van", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police van"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Van"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren_(alarm)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Siren (alarm)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firecracker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firecracker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hoodie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29646005.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_disorder.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 644, "textEnd": 651}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 752, "textEnd": 759, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Officers were also injured in the clashes, including one who suffered a broken nose.\n\nBut who exactly is the far right group that turned what was meant to be a peaceful night of remembrance for the three young girls killed and multiple other victims of the incident? The group was initially co-founded by Tommy Robinson in 2009, which he led until 2013.\n\nA partial statement from Merseyside Police this evening read: \"At around 7.45pm, a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League - began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road in Southport.\"\n\nIt continued: \"The actions in Southport tonight will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside. There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets. We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\nThe EDL is a far-right organisation known for its Islamophobia. It views Islam as a primitive religion that is not compatible with life in England but claims to be a non-racist group, despite a number of members clearly spouting racist remarks over the course of its existence.\n\nDespite the EDL claiming it is not a racist organisation that advocates white supremacy, investigations into the group have unearthed some members using derogatory slurs about people often with South Asian or Arabic backgrounds. The group has claimed they wish to use peaceful and non-violent means to protest, but its members have been responsible for violent demonstrations across the country.\n\nStephen Yaxley-Lennon (aka Robinson) created the hateful group alongside Kevin Carroll, before eventually quitting the group in part due to infighting.

A crowd of masked thugs had gathered outside Windsor Mini Mart, and they were hurling rocks and other projectiles.\n\nFortunately, Chanaka had left the shop an hour earlier after concerned neighbours warned him to 'be careful' as a 'protest' was about to take place nearby. He headed straight home, where he and his wife, Thanuja, watched on helplessly as their shop was looted.\n\n\"We knew they were going to come in,\" Thanuja said. \"They broke the glass then pulled the shutter open.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Police issue update on 17-year-old arrested over Southport stabbings\n\nAfter prising open the front door, dozens of rioters poured inside the shop. They ransacked the shelves and smashed open the till, swiping the cash inside.\n\nOver the next few hours, looters came and went. So did the stock; alcohol, sweets, soft drinks, even ice creams were among the items taken.\n\n\"They were coming and going in dozens,\" said Thanuja. \"It was terrifying to watch.\"\n\nAt one stage, Thanuja says rioters 'threw a stick on fire' inside the shop. That was the moment it all became too much for her and her husband.\n\n\"We thought they were going to burn it down,\" she said. \"We turned it off because we didn't want to see.\"\n\nChanaka and Thanuja are not the only ones who have been left reeling following a night of violent disorder in Southport last night (Tuesday).\n\nNearly 40 police officers were injured after riots erupted outside a mosque in the town. The unrest started after a vigil was held to remember the lives of three little girls killed in a brutal stabbing in Southport on Monday.\n\nAs tensions ran high, a large mob - who police believe included supporters of the English Defence League - pelted police with rocks and bottles, set cars alight, threw bricks at a mosque and set wheelie bins on fire.\n\nThe night of carnage was the last thing Southport needed as it reeled in the aftermath of Monday's unthinkable tragedy, which claimed the lives of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine.\n\nAfter the rioters dispersed yesterday evening, Chanaka and Thanuja headed down to their shop. They were greeted by a scene of devastation.\n\n\"There was a lot of damage,\" Thanuja said. \"Everything has to be replaced. I don't see the purpose of it.\"\n\nThe couple stayed at the shop until 4am before heading home to catch some sleep. When they returned this morning, police officers were carrying out investigations inside their store.\n\nAs they stood in the street, the owner of a neighbouring business pulled them to one side. \"If we can do anything, anything at all,\" she told Thanuja.\n\nShe is not the only one to have rallied around the couple, who have owned Windsor Mini Mart for four years. Before yesterday, they said they 'never had a single incident'.\n\n\"We have got so much support from the community,\" Thanuja explained. \"We feel blessed.\"\n\nOn the streets of Southport this morning (Wednesday), there was eerie sense of calm as residents rallied with brushes and shovels to begin the clean-up. Outside Southport Mosque, where the riots began, a crowd of people repaired a wall that had been damaged amid the disorder.\n\nAmong those handing out water to those cleaning the streets was Imam Ibrahim Hussein, who was inside the mosque when it was targeted last night. He had rushed down to the mosque, at the junction of Sussex Road and St Luke's Road, after hearing rioters were planning to gather outside.\n\n\"They started throwing things and hailing abuse,\" the Imam said. \"In no time, there were hundreds.\"\n\nRioters torched a clothing bank outside the mosque as the Imam said he heard shouts of 'we want our country back'.\n\n\"I was scared,\" he said. \"There were about eight of us inside and we had to barricade ourselves in.\"\n\nThis morning, a car with a smashed windscreen remained in the car park of the mosque - a casualty of last night's chaos.\n\nOyess Ali, 28, attends the mosque and lives close to the scene where the children were stabbed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on Monday. He heard 'screams' and witnessed the horrific aftermath as some of the victims were treated in the street outside.\n\n\"It's the worst thing that's happened in Southport,\" he said.\n\n\"Monday was horrific, then Tuesday happened, and now I'm thinking 'what's next?' The whole town is in shock.\n\n\"Southport is normally a very boring place, it's a small, quiet seaside town. We all get along.\"\n\nA combination of conspiracy theories, disinformation on social media, and a 'fake' Russian-based website laid the ground for the shocking rioting. This toxic mix linked to an entirely false, 'Arabic' name being circulated on social media - which far right yobs took as a cue to scapegoat Muslims.\n\nMr Ali said he heard talk of a 'protest' taking place outside the mosque earlier on Tuesday, but said he \"didn't really believe it was going to happen\".\n\n\"This riot took place because people were misled,\" he said. \"The majority of them were out of towners.\n\n\"They came prepared. They were in balaclavas and masks, they didn't come for the vigil.\"\n\nAs the crowds ran riot, several businesses and homes were caught in the crossfire. Tracey Whitfield's partner runs a plumbing and heating business in Sussex Road. Its windows were damaged by the heat from a police van that was set on fire by rioters.\n\nWhen she saw the footage of the van in flames, Tracey became worried that the shop may be next. She went down to collect some paperwork and described the scenes she witnessed as 'the worst of humanity'.\n\n\"It was absolutely horrendous,\" she said. \"There were people everywhere. There were flames, fireworks, and the van was on fire. Every bang made me jump.\n\n\"I couldn't believe the aggression towards the police. There was one lady - a police officer - who looked out cold. She was being dragged by her colleagues to an ambulance.\"\n\nNorman Wallis, chief executive of Southport Pleasureland, was among thousands who attended last night's vigil to remember the three girls killed earlier this week. After hearing something was going on outside the mosque, he said he went to \"have a look\".\n\nHe described those involved in last night's disorder as 'cowards'.\n\n\"These people have been bussed in to hijack a terrible tragedy,\" he said. \"They weren't from the town.\"\n\nMr Wallis said the disorder and those involved are 'not the face of the town'.\n\n\"Southport is not like that,\" he said. \"It's a very safe place.\n\n\"Southport is a very close community and everyone knows someone who knows these girls who have died and been stabbed.\n\n\"We're all heartbroken. I put my arms around my kids every day and I can't imagine not being able to do that again.\"\n\nAfter witnessing the disorder, Mr Wallis said he 'put the message out' for people to take part in a community clean-up this morning.\n\n\"I thought we have to do something about it,\" he explained. \"Everyone has brought shovels and brushes to clean everything away. That's what the true community here is.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_george@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Thomas George", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29646956.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_pp-southport-trouble-03jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Tributes have been paid to the bravery of dance and yoga teacher Leanne Lucas, who was one of the wounded adults.\n\nUS pop star Swift said she was \"completely in shock\" over \"the loss of life and innocence, and the horrendous trauma inflicted on everyone\".\n\nAguiar was the daughter of Portuguese parents from Madeira. \"Her parents are in a state of shock,\" Portugal's communities minister Jose Cesario told AFP.\n\nHer family said in a tribute: \"Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our princess.\"\n\nResidents of the seaside town said they were struggling to come to terms with the deaths.\n\n\"You can feel in the air that it's affected the whole town. We're just a small little town, everyone knows everyone,\" mental health nurse Katy Watkinson told AFP.\n\nSara Taylor, a Southport resident from Portugal used to see Alice Aguiar at the local Portuguese shop.\n\n\"When I first saw her picture...

Many were hurt by flying bricks with dozens of officers having to be led away from rioters to get treatment. One male officer appeared to have a head injury as he was driven for hospital treatment. A police riot van, mosque fencing, a pink car and a minimarket was looted during the violence, which has been met with widespread condemnation from locals.\n\nDo you know this brave woman? Get in touch at webnews@reachplc.com\n\nMerseyside Police believe the protesters included supporters of the far right English Defence League, who are believed to have travelled to Southport from outside the area.\n\nIn a clip that has gone viral on social media, one woman stood in front of the rioters holding up a sign with a message of peace as bricks and other objects were being thrown, ignoring the jeers from the mostly male crowd. Her sign read: \"One race - human, hope not hate, racism not welcome here.\"\n\nHer actions have been praised as \"brave\" and \"courageous\" online.\n\nTrouble erupted around 8pm after social media reports a protest was being held outside a local mosque. Gangs of masked men started to appear on the streets before throwing bricks at a local mosque smashing their windows as people hid inside. Later several jumped on top of a police riot van before it was torched. Then followed hours of violence with waves of attacks on police front lines.\n\nSeveral fires were started including what appeared to be an attempt to set fire to the mosque as burning bins and fence panelling erupted near the back entrance. Eventually after reinforcements arrived from Lancashire and elsewhere in the region the rioters were forced away from the mosque.\n\nThis morning the clear up was ongoing. The riot van has already been removed from the scene. One local said: \"At least the bin men don't have to empty the bins today - they've all been burnt.\" Andy Southwood, 54,local businessman, said: \"I didn't sleep much last night. In half an hour it exploded. It was chaotic. Mainly young kids with masks. It looked organised to me. It's crazy. It's a massive stain on the town.\"\n\nBut he pointed out locals were up through the night cleaning up. \"Random people are coming out with shovels and spades to help clean up. That's the true spirit of Southport,\" he added.\n\nThe violence followed the stabbings of Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, at the Taylor Swift-themed holiday club. Eight other children were also stabbed, with five children and two adults left in a critical condition. A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart Street.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_hanlon@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Tim Hanlon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Dasilva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Dasilva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shovel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shovel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33363523.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_GTw-_DjX0AA3As6jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

A 17-year-old boy has been arrested and remains in police custody.\n\nREAD MORE: Riot police subjected to relentless and 'sickening' attack with vans set alight in night of chaos in Southport\n\nVolunteers have gathered on St Luke's Road in Southport this morning to help clear the debris left by rioters. Pictures show diggers and waste removal trucks on the scene as residents use brooms and wheelbarrows to help clear the street.\n\nAndy Southwood, 54,local businessman, said: \"I didn't sleep much last night. In half an hour it exploded. It was chaotic. Mainly young kids with masks. It looked organised to me. It's crazy. It's a massive stain on the town.\"\n\nBut he pointed out locals were up through the night cleaning up. \"Random people are coming out with shovels and spades to help clean up. That's the true spirit of Southport,\" he added.\n\nIt is understood that the riots were sparked by rumours circulating online over the 'status' of the boy, who police have stated was born in Cardiff. They have warned over 'speculation', citing a rumoured name as 'incorrect'.\n\nPolice were first called to St Luke's Road last night, close to where the brutal attack happened on Hart Street, to reports of disorder at a local mosque. Sections of the crowd could be heard chanting \"No surrender\" and \"English till I die\" as the scenes unfolded.\n\nProtesters went on to throw bricks at the mosque before the violence escalated, with cars and wheelie bins set alight.\n\nThis morning, Southport MP Patrick Hurley has said rioters must face the \"full force of the law\".\n\nMr Hurley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"These were thugs who got the train in, these were not the people from Southport.\n\n\"They were using the horrific incident on Monday, the deaths of three little kiddies, for their own political purposes and actually to attack the very same first responders and the very same police, who had been on the scene on Monday, were then being pelted with bricks the day after by these thugs.\n\n\"There's no way to describe that other than to say it's utterly reprehensible and we must identify these people and make sure that the full force of the law is down against them.\"\n\nHe went on: \"These people are utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children and utterly disrespecting the town.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

A large group of people, who police said were believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, began to throw items towards a local mosque.\n\nPolice said officers at the scene were dealing with criminal behaviour and violence, with bottles and wheelie bins being thrown at them.

Putting his hand to the back of his head after being struck, it looks like he sees blood on his hand - but then the man in a full grey Polo tracksuit has worse problems as he is hit by another brick, right where it hurts.\n\nREAD MORE: Southport stabbing: Violence erupts on streets as mosque attacked and police van set on fire\n\nREAD MORE: Southport stabbing victim, 9, named as family pay tribute and slam 'despicable' killer\n\nWincing from the first brick, which was aimed at a line of police officers, another brick can be seen sailing through the air, before smashing directly into the protester's testicles. This second blow clearly connected, as the man doubles over immediately.\n\nIn a moment of pain that half the population will likely be able to feel themselves, the man can be seen gingerly hobbling away from the police line that he had, only moments before, been aggressively approaching.\n\nThe rioters, who in their hours-long battle with Merseyside Police injured a whopping 39 officers and triggered a major incident for the North West Ambulance Service, can be heard asking the man if he is alright, as the masked people around him continued to hurl objects at police. Another can be heard reprimanding the aim of the thugs throwing bricks.\n\nOne social media user viewing the video commented \"serves him right\", while another X user shared the video, saying: \"Whatever your take on the goings on in Southport, this is inarguably very funny. Concussion, no b******** and nicked tomorrow for rioting.\"\n\nIn a statement on the riots, released late on Tuesday night, Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\n\n\"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park. This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\n\n\"We would appeal to anyone who has information or video footage of those involved in this shocking behaviour to come forward so we can identify and arrest those responsible.

North West Ambulance Service confirmed paramedics treated 39 police officers after violent scenes broke out during a protest on St Luke's Road in Southport on Tuesday, July 30.\n\nThe ambulance service confirmed 27 officers were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene. It was declared as a \"major incident\" by emergency services.\n\nBricks taken from garden walls were used to attack officers and cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire. A large group of people, who police said are believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road. Cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire and bricks were thrown at a local mosque.\n\nDamage was also caused to a local convenience store and wheelie bins were set on fire, police said. Three police dogs have also been injured. Police Dogs Zoe and Ike have sustained leg injuries from bricks thrown at them. A third dog, PD Quga, also suffered burns to her back leg.\n\nPhotos and video seen by the ECHO showed crowds gathered around police riot vans on St Luke's Road. A police van was also seen up in flames. Following the scenes, residents living on the road and the surrounding area have come out in force to help with the clean up.\n\nNorman Wallis, owner of Southport Pleasureland, is helping clear the rubble. He told the ECHO: \"We're all coming together to try and help the people in Sussex Road and the area to clean up for the mess that was made by all those people, those thugs, that came into their street.\n\n\"They just totally destroyed the street, pulled the walls down, pulled fences down, set cars on fire, just terrible. We're all coming together to just try and help as a community.\"\n\nNorman added that Southport is a \"wonderful\" place which needs to be \"shouted about\" and the behaviour of the people last night does not reflect the area.\n\nCathy McGrath has been out on the clean up since 7.15am this morning. She said that the town should be grieving. Speaking to the ECHO, she said: \"I feel just angry and upset really.

Not satisfied with the damage they had caused, they surrounded one and began jostling to flip it over.\n\nMoments later there was a loud bang, launching a fireball into the sky to loud cheers from the protesters that left smoke billowing into the sky.\n\nIt followed chants of \"No Surrender\" and \"English till I die\" as balaclava-clad thugs hurled bricks and fireworks at police and the Southport Islamic Society Mosque.\n\nSome later ran away as police charged with dogs towards them after the mob tore down garden walls and hurled rubble at vans.\n\nThe violence flared in the wake of the mass knife attack on Monday at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in which three schoolgirls were killed.\n\nSpeculation has swirled online about the identity of the attacker and his motives, and last night police claimed that people used this \"to bring violence and disorder to our streets.\n\nMerseyside Police said \"a large group of people believed to be supporters of the English Defence League\" began to throw items towards the mosque at around 7.45pm.\n\nThe mosque at the centre of the protest had extended its 'deepest sympathies' to the families of those caught up in the Southport knife attack on Monday.\n\nYet it became the flashpoint for rioters who shouted \"we are doing this for our girls\" as they threw missiles at police and the building.\n\nOfficers put on helmets and riot gear after stones and bottles were launched and police vehicles damaged and set on fire.\n\nMeanwhile, figures in masks scoured the ground for bricks littering the floor to throw at lines of officers.\n\nHeavy thuds were heard as the vans took hits and police raised their shields against incoming missiles.\n\nWhile many ran away from police chasing them with batons, others went in the opposite direction, scuffling with those in uniform. One police officer was seen with blood streaming down her face. Police said an officer suffered a suspected broken nose.\n\nThe mob grew quickly as protesters arrived on bike and on foot only an hour after a vigil took place on the other side of the seaside town. There, it was grief, rather than anger, that was on display.\n\nDarren Colenutt, 58, brought three generations of his family to quietly mourn the killings of the three little girls.\n\nHis stepdaughter Chelsea Porter, 28, had brought her daughters River, two, and Lilly, nine, who was booked in to attend one of the workshops at the Hart Space later in the year.\n\nMr Colenutt's daughter Sovereign Porter, 22, was also there, among thousands who gathered outside the 19th century Atkinson Theatre, a mile from the attacks, with his other granddaughter Isabella, four.\n\n\"Nobody would think this would happen in Southport,\" Mr Colenutt said.\n\n\"My granddaughter was due to go to an event later in the year with the same organisers. It could have been anyone, we are just a lovely little town.\"\n\nSovereign said: \"Even though it's not our family it affects you so, so much. Southport is in mourning. We are all in shock. We haven't been out until now. My heart can't take it.\"\n\nTwo days ago, the town of 95,000 was only known as the quiet seaside resort associated with beaches, piers and fairground rides.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was acknowledged that Southport is now a world-famous name for all the wrong reasons.\n\nAs mourners held white candles, purple balloons or clutched teddies and unicorns, Martin Abrahams, the spiritual leader at Southport Hospital, said: \"Southport is not used to global attention.\n\n\"To be known around the globe for a defining incident has shook us all to the core.\n\n\"Taylor Swift, who herself has commented on events, and her bracelets of friendship, which people are encouraged to make and swap and share, remind us we should never feel alone.\n\n\"Clearly the crowds tonight show we want to stand together.\"\n\nWhile those at the vigil shed tears rather than hurling bricks, the mourners, like the protesters, are looking for answers.\n\n\"It's just kids enjoying a holiday, it's unheard of,\" Mr Colenutt said. \"There are little bits of crime on estates but nothing like this. We all want answers. The kids are petrified.\n\n\"It's a very friendly town, it's welcoming. Your heart melts, you can feel how the families feel.\"\n\nLesley Francis, 64, who works in a nursery, was waiting in the queue to leave flowers.\n\n\"You can't stop thinking about those people living a nightmare,\" Ms Francis said. \"Why would somebody target children?\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_johnston@aol.co.uk", "name": "Neil Johnston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Van"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracksuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tracksuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baton (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Litter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seaside resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_I_of_Castile", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isabella I of Castile"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Hurling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Hurling", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VLTbtQEMMWUQnyJbqauRKA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_telegraph_624/e1b6803194fad336800f98ea53f15544", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Three children are dead and five are in a critical condition after a stabbing attack at a dance class. And then, on Tuesday, the town became the scene of violent clashes in and around a mosque as far right thugs, fuelled by lies, sought to exploit the tragedy.\n\nThe truth behind Monday's awful crime will, in time, be unravelled by investigators. We can't yet say how such horror descended on suburban streets. But how it was that a grieving community found itself swamped by agitators fighting with police is a question that can begin to be answered now. How on earth did that happen?\n\nREAD MORE: Southport stabbings LIVE: Community clean-up begins after 'disgraceful' night of violence and rioting\n\nA combination of conspiracy theories, disinformation on social media, and a 'fake' Russian-based website laid the ground for the shocking rioting, which led to 39 police officers being treated by paramedics and families and children already rocked by tragedy cowering behind curtains, it emerged today.\n\nThis toxic mix linked to an entirely false, 'Arabic' name being circulated on social media - which far right yobs took as a cue to scapegoat Muslims. Windows of the mosque were smashed and cars parked near it attacked. Police were pelted with rocks and bottles. Yobs knocked down walls to hurl masonry at officers and police vehicles and wheelie bins were set alight. The sky burned.\n\nWorryingly, this is the second time in the last week that trouble has flared after agitators have seized on a sensitive situation, without all the facts being known, to pursue a divisive agenda.\n\nDays ago, it was feared that a video of a police officer's conduct during an incident at Manchester Airport would trigger serious unrest - tensions which only eased after the M.E.N exclusively obtained and published another video which helped increase understanding of the context.\n\nWhile the events in Southport and Manchester Airport were not in any way linked, in both there was a rush to judgement, with the most sinister consequences felt in Southport, where a tragedy was hijacked and a shellshocked community was subjected to yet more anguish.\n\nIt started on Tuesday afternoon with a series of posts on a website. Named as Channel 3 Now, and said to be linked to Russia, the website posted a fake name for the attacker, which was subsequently shared by millions online.\n\nThis name - Ali Al-Shakati - appeared to have been generated by the website - which, the Guardian reports, 'mixes potentially AI-generated US and UK news content and is styled like a mainstream American network news channel' - before being shared online on X by far right influencers and social media accounts.\n\nIt's understood that conspiracy theorist 'content creators' headed to Southport amid unsubstantiated claims that police were somehow 'suppressing' information.\n\nMerseyside Police was even forced into issuing a statement to confirm a name for the 17 year-old arrested being shared online was wrong, amid false claims he's an asylum seeker.\n\nBy this stage, a violent mob was hellbent on terrorising a mosque near the scene of the stabbings. This violence 'will involve many people who do not live in the Merseyside area or care about the people of Merseyside', Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss, in a statement last night, said.\n\nThe senior officer went on to reference 'much speculation and hypothesis around the status' of the teenager arrested and said 'some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets', adding: \"We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK and speculation helps nobody at this time.\"\n\n\"What was done for clicks, what was done to socialise hatred/violence via misinformation after these shocking murders and what platform responsibility is are important questions,\" Sunder Katwala , director of the thinktank British Future, wrote of the incident.\n\nHe also referenced the Channel 3 Now website, calling it a 'scam/fake news channel' that 'seems to have invented a fake Arab name and run a false story about Southport, generating 1.4m impressions'.\n\nMr Katwala said the 'pace' with which misinformation was spreading after the incident 'presents important challenges to social media platforms and ultimately for policymakers as regulators and lawmakers if platforms cannot respond'.\n\n\"There are different types of bad faith actor spreading misinformation at pace in heightened circumstances,\" he said. \"There may be low quality feeds masquerading as news sites, even scraping social media rumours to produce AI-generated content.\n\n\"There can be more deliberate networks of extreme actors, including far right groups and foreign intelligence actors. The platforms will struggle to get everything right in real time. But it matters as to whether they have the will and capacity to respond to the most serious threats, such as those breaching legal constraints and injunctions and those using heightened moments with the intent of socialising people towards extremism and violence.\"\n\nThe far-right, it appears, seized on the narrative it wanted. That isn't the narrative that is welcome in Southport, as evidenced by the family of one of the girls murdered, seven year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe. Despite her grief, mum Jenni wrote: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\"\n\nPolice, she added, have been 'nothing but heroic' and 'they and we don't need this'. In her darkest hour, it was a post she shouldn't have had to make.\n\nAfter yobs said by police to be linked to the English Defence League surrounded his mosque in Southport, mosque chairman Ibrahim Hussein revealed today he's been sent flowers and people have offered to repair damaged walls for free.\n\nThe love he felt today was in stark contrast to the hate waged last night. Mr Hussein was trapped in the mosque with eight others and said he feared it was going to be burnt down. He only managed to leave under a police guard.\n\nAsked if he thought the far-right had hijacked his town, Mr Hussein said: \"Naturally. This is a beautiful town. We've lived here 30 years, no bother at all. We love this community. The community loves us. We don't have any issues.\"\n\nNazir Afzal, the former chief prosecutor who is Chancellor of the University of Manchester, said rioters were 'encouraged' with 'lies and bigotry'. He said the 17 year-old boy arrested was born in Britain to Rwandan parents - and Rwanda 'is 98 per cent Christian'.\n\n\"So why attack a mosque,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"Responsibility for the riots lies with all who participated and all who encouraged it.\"\n\nA statement from the Liverpool Region Mosque Network, meanwhile, said the stabbings, which they called 'heinous', were 'unconnected to Islam'. \"A minority of people are attempting to portray that this inhumane act is somehow related to the Muslim community,\" they said. \"Frankly it is not, and we must not let those who seek to divide us and spread hatred use this as an opportunity.\"\n\nFalse claims had also spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat. Police have said that, although the motive for the attack is unclear, it is not believed to be terror-related, although Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, said the police investigation would pursue 'any contact the suspect may or may not have had with different agencies' before the incident.\n\nThere were concerns in Downing Street even before a brick was thrown, with No 10 urging the public to avoid 'unhelpful' speculation about the stabbings amid concerns that misreporting online could inflame community tensions.\n\nThe Home Secretary, meanwhile, giving a statement in the Commons ahead of the summer recess, urged social media companies to 'take some responsibility' for the wild speculation.\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley, meanwhile, condemned 'beered-up thugs' involved. Images from the peaceful vigil outside Southport's Atkinson arts venue, staged before the violence, showed a number of men who turned up with a crate of cider and flags.\n\nMr Hurley told the BBC: \"Even if this lad, the 17-year-old, turns out to be Muslim, under no circumstances does that justify any attack on a mosque by anybody at all.\" He also hit out at the 'swirling morass' of social media 'lies and propaganda.\n\nMr Hurley pointedly said the riots in Southport occurred because of the 'propaganda and lies' spread on social media about the identity of the attacker.\n\nHe told Times Radio: \"We'd had all sorts of lies being spread and misinformation being spread about the alleged perpetrator and some people with the best of intentions then they tried to rebut this, they tried to argue back, but all that happens is you're just amplifying people's false messaging.\n\n\"This misinformation doesn't just exist on people's internet browsers and on people's phones. It has real world impact.\n\n\"And what happened is that the real world impact of that was that we then had hundreds of people descending on the town, descending on Southport from outside of the area, intent on causing trouble, either because they believe what they've written, or because they are bad faith actors who wrote it in the first place, in the hope of causing community division.\"\n\nThe EDL - co-founded by Tommy Robinson - today faced calls for it to be proscribed under terrorism laws. In a letter to the Home Secretary, Scotland's former first minister Humza Yousaf claimed 'Britain has a far-right problem', urging her to use anti-terrorism powers to make membership of the group illegal.\n\n\"It is time we took on the English Defence League and the evil ideology that drives them,\" he wrote. He added that such action would not provide an 'overnight fix', but would demonstrate the Government's intention to be 'proactive in tackling far-right violence and terror that has been allowed to run rampant in the streets of the UK for far too long'.\n\nMeanwhile, the Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner, criticised the \"disgraceful\" rioting in Southport and \"disrespectful\" social media theories as she urged people to allow the police to establish the facts.\n\nShe said: \"I think there's been a couple of instances recently where, especially particularly online, where theories and things are whipped up, whereas actually it turns out to be not true or not the full picture.\n\n\"And I think there's a culture now where people want to instantly get the facts, but actually it's important that police and those people that are doing the work are able to carry out that work. And it's important for justice as well, because we have law and order in the UK, and it's important that those authorities are able to establish the facts and then to be able to bring those forward.\n\n\"But speculation and some of the untruths that have been put around social media, not only is that creating tensions and fear in the community, but it's disrespectful to family who maybe want those answers that haven't got those answers.\"\n\nThe mayor of Liverpool, Steve Rotheram, said it was 'too easy for people with nefarious intent to go online and to say things that aren't factual and then for people to believe those things'. \"It leaves a very sour taste in the mouth that these people believe they can come here and divide our community,\" he said. \"They won't be doing that and the haters won't win out.\"\n\nHe said 'the one' thing 'social media wants to find out is the religion' of the teenager arrested.\n\n\"So you have to ask yourself the questions, why would anybody want to know the religion of the perpetrator of this vicious and heinous crime? And it's to do exactly what we just talked about earlier, which is to stir up more tension in this community,\" he said.\n\nPolice today announced they've been given more time by a magistrate to continue to question the 17 year-old arrested. It's been confirmed that he was born in the U.K, to Rwandan parents, lived in Cardiff before moving north, and is from the Banks area of Southport.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk",

More info\n\nA courageous woman was pictured bravely standing up to EDL thugs by holding up a powerful sign during riots in Southport.\n\nA major incident was declared on July 30, after hundreds of rioters took to the seaside town streets, lobbing bricks and flares outside a mosque while more than 50 cops trying to control the crowds.\n\nIn a clip that has gone viral on social media, one woman stood in front of the thugs holding up a sign with a message of peace with a sign that read: \"One race - human, hope not hate, racism not welcome here.\"\n\nDespite bricks and other items being lobbed at her as well as aggressive jeers from the crowd the lady bravely stood her ground to get the message across, reports the Mirror. Her brave actions amidst a night of disgraceful behaviour have been widely praised by many.\n\nDozens of cops were hurt by flying bricks and had to be taken away from the chaos to get treatment, and one male officer appeared to have a head injury as he was driven for hospital treatment. A police riot van, mosque fencing, a pink car and a minimarket were looted during the violence, which has been met with widespread condemnation from locals.\n\nMerseyside Police believe the protesters included supporters of the far-right English Defence League, who are believed to have travelled to Southport from outside the area. Trouble erupted around 8pm after social media reports a protest was being held outside a local mosque.\n\nGangs of masked men started to appear on the streets before throwing bricks at a local mosque smashing their windows as people hid inside. Later several jumped on top of a police riot van before it was torched. Then followed hours of violence with waves of attacks on police front lines.\n\nThe violence followed the stabbings of Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, at the Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nEight other children were also stabbed, with five children and two adults left in a critical condition.\n\nA 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in custody accused of murder and attempted murder following the incident at the dance studio in Hart Street.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucy_thornton@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Lucy Thornton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "iona_young@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Iona Young", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seaside resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33363523.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_GTw-_DjX0AA3As6jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 300, "textEnd": 307}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

A large group of people attacked the Southport Islamic Society Mosque on the corner of Sussex Road and St Luke's Road.\n\nFollowing a vigil for those affected by the Southport stabbings, the group tore bricks from garden walls and threw them at the mosque, smashing some of its windows, and a convenience store. Police officers were attacked and cars belonging to members of the public were torched. Police said the group was made up of English Defence League supporters.\n\nAn ambulance service spokesperson said 39 patients were treated - all of them police officers. Twenty-seven were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at the scene.\n\nWhen contacted by the ECHO, a mosque spokesperson condemned yesterday's attacks. They said: \"First and foremost we are all very shocked and saddened about what occurred on Monday. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those affected. What followed last night on the part of the far-right was an insult to the families and a town that is collective in its grieving.\"\n\nResidents of Southport are cleaning up in the aftermath of the horrific scenes. Norman Wallis, owner of Southport Pleasureland, told the ECHO: \"We're all coming together to try and help the people in Sussex Road and the area to clean up for the mess that was made by all those people, those thugs, that came into their street. They just totally destroyed the street, pulled the walls down, pulled fences down, set cars on fire, just terrible. We're all coming together to just try and help as a community.\"\n\nResident Cathy McGrath said: \"I feel just angry and upset really.

Six other children were left in a critical condition and two adults are still fighting for their lives in hospital.\n\nFrontline cops were hit with bricks and bottles and cars were set alight, including a police van, as people swarmed outside a local mosque after false rumours spread online about the murder suspect. Three people have since been arrested and more than 50 police officers were injured during last night's chaos.\n\nMerseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said three people were arrested on Tuesday night. She said: \"Our priority was to try and keep the communities of Southport safe and also to make sure officers remained safe. Three arrests were made, however more will follow. It's impossible to say [how many will be arrested]. It's really early days in the investigation.\"\n\nShe added: \"Initially, there were about 70 people who made their way away from the vigil and were making their way towards the mosque.

People dressed in dark clothing with their faces covered were spotted jumping on police vehicles and one emergency service van was then set alight.\n\nRiot police were then deployed to St Luke's Road in Southport where the violent scenes were taking place.

One said: \"Yup that's the greatest. Pure Cinema.\" And a second called it \"perfect karma\".\n\nAnother said it was a \"splendid end to his evening,\" while a fourth said it was \"poetic justice\" - and another called him a \"human riot shield\".\n\nThere was a serious side to the riots, which were sparked by far right groups descending on the area after the alleged murder of three young girls during a stabbing spree, in which five other children and two adults, one believed to be class organiser Leanne Lucas, were left in a critical condition.\n\nA 17-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder in relation to the stabbings.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said moments after the riots started: \"It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, we have seen overwhelming support and sympathy from the community and wider Merseyside communities for the families who are currently trying to deal with their loss and care for victims injured during the major incident.\n\n\"Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face.

Many legacy media outlets and political figures characterised the protests on Tuesday as \"far-right\".\n\nLeading the condemnation was Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who pledged to bring down the \"full force of the law\" on those involved in the riots.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper branded the outbreak of violence as a \"a total disgrace,\" saying: \"It is so appalling to now see those same police facing violent attacks from thugs on the streets who have no respect for a grieving community.\"\n\nBut some were quick to note the difference in the Home Secretary's tone following the Southport riots to during Roma riots in Leeds just five days earlier, in which she did not refer to the rioters as \"thugs\" but merely \"individuals.\" Lord Goldsmith, a former government minister, opined it was right to be strong on disorder but said Cooper's statement \"couldn't contrast more starkly with Home Office Ministers' reactions to the Manchester riots where violent thugs demanded instant justice 'or else' & where Ministers bent over backwards to explain that they 'understood' the anger.\"\n\nHe asked: \"Why has the Home Office response to these two events been so different? Can they not see how this feeds the narrative of a two tier approach and drives people to the far right? It is extraordinarily shortsighted and unwise\".\n\nOthers were very keen to see ulterior motives. Former Scottish First Minister, Humza Yousaf, said people who protest against the killings of children don't actually care about children. He said: \"Attacking mosques and chanting Islamaphobic abuse. Let's not pretend the far-right care one jot about children murdered in Southport. These thugs are scum who are exploiting the killing of children for their own bigoted ends. This is what happens when you appease the far-right.\"\n\nFollowing the mass stabbing the day prior, Yousaf, Scotland's first Muslim leader, said: \"Simply awful. Our only response to the evil we witnessed in Southport yesterday should be an outpouring of grief for the children and adults killed in such a senseless attack. If you use such a horrific tragedy to fuel bigotry, then you are the worst of humanity.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\"\n\n\"We would appeal to anyone who has information or video footage of those involved in this shocking behaviour to come forward so we can identify and arrest those responsible.\"\n\nAnyone with information can DM @MerPolCC or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_morgan@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "William Morgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Ambulance_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North West Ambulance Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Wales Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29646535.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Southport-stabbings-riot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar had barely begun to live when their lives were violently taken away. It is impossible to comprehend how anyone could target children. Children doing what children do: having fun, dancing to pop songs. Their pictures are haunting: smiling innocence, still so young that their were teeth missing.\n\nI can't stop thinking about the graphic descriptions of the attack on a children's Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, in which eight other girls were also stabbed. One victim was the same age as my eldest. I can't quite bring myself to process how frightened they must have been. The disbelief of the local community is palpable.\n\nWhen something so awful happens, we need answers. We demand them. We can't accept that something so senseless could be just that - senseless. In today's fast-paced, social-media-dominant world, we seemingly can't and won't wait. We, at times, inhibit the police from doing their job; we demand a running commentary. And when we don't receive it, into that void of information rushes dangerous speculation.\n\nWithin hours of news of the stabbing taking place, the crime was attributed to 17-year-old \"Ali Al-Shakati\", an asylum seeker who'd arrived in the UK on a boat last year, and who was supposedly on an MI6 watch list. None of this was true. The name was fake. People didn't stop to ask why MI6 would be monitoring people on British soil, when that would generally be the preserve of MI5. Or how, when there are reporting restrictions for those under 18, the name might have leaked. Millions saw it online, and believed it.\n\nSome people didn't ask questions because those looking for a villain who fitted their wider political and world view had what they needed: an excuse to stoke fear and division; to tell people that they can't trust those who we rely on to protect us, namely the police or the government. By the time Merseyside Police felt the need to state officially that, \"This name is incorrect and we would urge people not to speculate on details of the incident while the investigation is ongoing,\" it was too late. The denial became part of the conspiracy: why are the police lying to us?\n\nThe police have now confirmed that the 17-year-old who has been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted to murder was from Banks in Lancashire, and was born in Cardiff. It's understood his parents are Rwandans. But this hasn't stopped elected officials subtly undermining trust in the police and politicians, and sowing seeds of doubt. In response to the attack, Nigel Farage, MP for Clacton and leader of Reform UK, asks: \"Was this guy being monitored by the security services?\". This is quickly followed by: \"I just wonder whether the truth is being withheld from us.\" He made similar remarks on GB News. The former actor turned right-wing contrarian Laurence Fox declared, \"We are going to have to take our country back. Street by street. The politicians couldn't care less about your kids... When they appeal for calm, I hear 'Shut up and stop complaining.'\"\n\nThis is something I never thought I would hear - certainly not on this scale - in Britain. It frightens me. While the majority of people in Southport attended a deeply moving, peaceful vigil last night, others went to riot. A group of mostly men gathered outside Southport Mosque, chanting anti-Muslim abuse and hurling rocks at it. It seems highly unlikely that the 17-year-old alleged perpetrator is a Muslim, given the biggest religion followed in Rwanda is Christianity. But why let the facts get in the way of hatred and violence? Those attacking the mosque, including those believed to be supporters of the far-right English Defence League, attacked police officers: a police van was set alight and missiles were thrown. The Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, branded the scenes a \"disgrace\".\n\nThat anyone would use the violent murder of three young girls for their own hateful and divisive political cause is disgusting. Speaking after Tuesday night's violent scenes, Merseyside Police assistant chief constable Alex Goss said: \"It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives.\" He stated clearly that the speculation around the identity and status of the suspect was being used \"to bring violence and disorder to our streets\".\n\nWe know, as Taylor Swift said in her response to this horror, that the victims \"were just little kids at a dance class\". I, like her, am at a complete loss as to how to ever convey my sympathies to the families forever changed by the attack. But I hold nothing but contempt for those seeking to manipulate such senseless violence to further their own agendas.", "source": {"uri": "newstatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New

Gemma Taylor joined her son Sebastian, 10, and daughter Evelyn, seven, in cleaning up following the disturbances.\n\nPolice officers were attacked and riot vans set alight on St Luke's Road. A nearby mosque and convenience store were also targeted.\n\nA large group of people, which police said are believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, took bricks from garden walls and began throwing them. The North West Ambulance Service confirmed 27 officers were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene. Three police dogs were also injured. It was declared a \"major incident\" by emergency services.\n\nThis morning, residents began the task of clearing up the damage to their community. Sebastian was helping sweep up near the mosque with his sister Evelyn and Gemma. Sebastian said his family lives just a short distance from where the violence erupted.\n\nGemma told PA: \"The first I saw was a load of people walking down our road which you wouldn't walk down unless you lived down there. I thought 'it's happening' and got them all upstairs and shut all the blinds. Unfortunately, you can't keep them away from it if it's right on our doorstep and they looked out of the window.\"\n\nSebastian said: \"It was really scary. Mum told us to go upstairs for some strange reason. Last night was just horrible so we were like 'you know what, we should help because everyone was helping'. We were sweeping up bricks and metal and bottles and we were sweeping up burnt pieces of bins which had been on fire.\"\n\nSebastian said he watched as local volunteers removed all the bricks from a wall which was partially demolished around the mosque so it can be rebuilt. Those helping move the bricks said builders in the area had already told them they would help repair walls for free.\n\nOther residents of Southport have been cleaning up in the aftermath of the horrific scenes. Norman Wallis, owner of Southport Pleasureland, told the ECHO: \"We're all coming together to try and help the people in Sussex Road and the area to clean up for the mess that was made by all those people, those thugs, that came into their street.\n\n\"They just totally destroyed the street, pulled the walls down, pulled fences down, set cars on fire, just terrible. We're all coming together to just try and help as a community.\"\n\nResident Cathy McGrath said: \"I feel just angry and upset really. I went to the vigil last night and it was beautiful for the girls and the children and then you see last night. Those people don't represent the community, these people represent the community. They've spoiled it really and that's why I have come out today.\"\n\nMeanwhile, members of the Southport Islamic Society Mosque, which was targeted last night, have spoken out. A spokesperson for the mosque said: \"First and foremost we are all very shocked and saddened about what occurred on Monday. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those affected. What followed last night on the part of the far-right was an insult to the families and a town that is collective in its grieving.\"\n\nBelow you can leave your tribute to the little girls who lost their lives in the attack\n\nThe Liverpool Region Mosque Network, who work in collaboration, said it was horrified \"by the heinous acts. They added: \"This is an attack against society, irrespective of faith or background.\n\n\"A minority of people are attempting to portray that this inhumane act is somehow related to the Muslim community. Frankly it is not, and we must not let those who seek to divide us and spread hatred use this as an opportunity.\n\n\"This evening, we have seen distressing scenes outside Southport Mosque with angry protestors, gathering outside. This is causing further fear and anxiety within our communities. We must all unite and stand together against all forms of hate, violence and division.\n\n\"We thank Merseyside Police, Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram, and other political and community leaders for their outstanding response to this tragedy and their continued support for communities across the region during this difficult time.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_greer@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Jamie Greer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Ambulance_Service", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North West Ambulance Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasureland_Southport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pleasureland Southport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Normans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rotheram", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Rotheram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Community", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Community", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/article29649836.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Southport-incident.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Tensions are running high in the seaside town following last night's riots which followed the tragic killing of three young girls on Monday.\n\nAfter Tuesday night's 'sickening scenes', Merseyside Police has said it is prepared for further violence, with misinformation being shared on social media. In a statement this afternoon, Wednesday, Sefton Council said there is categorically no disruption or disorder taking place in Southport at this time and that the town centre is open.\n\nThe statement from the local authority follows reports this afternoon that some businesses have decided to close early and some staff members have reportedly advised to go home early over fears of further violent scenes in the town. Sefton Council is now calling for calm as it seeks to reassure people that Southport is a safe place to go.\n\nA statement from Sefton Council released this afternoon said: \"We are aware of misinformation online whereby people are being told to avoid Southport Town Centre this afternoon (Wednesday July 31). We have confirmed that there is NO disruption or disorder in Southport at this time and the town centre remains fully open for business.\n\n\"We urge people to remain calm and if they need, to please seek advice from official channels such as Sefton Council and Merseyside Police. We understand this is a highly emotional time and we would like to reiterate that Southport stands united and open.\"\n\nRumours had circulated on social media about more planned protests in the town today, but this has so far not materialised. Earlier Merseyside Police's Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said her officers were prepared to manage any future demonstrations. She said: \"I am absolutely concerned about repeats, there is that misinformation out there on social media, but please be reassured we are absolutely planning for that, please be reassured that we are planning for what might take place this evening and over the weekend. We were really supported by colleagues from other forces last night and that support is available to us again.\"\n\nCC Kennedy confirmed that in last night's grim scenes, which saw police vans set on fire and local people's property destroyed, a total of 53 officers were injured and in need of medical attention. She said: \"Our officers were then faced with the most horrendous violence against them last night. 54 police officers were injured last night, 49 from Merseyside Police and four from Lancashire Constabulary.\n\n\"It is completely unacceptable. All the blue light services responding yesterday, their focus is around protecting and keeping our communities safe and yet they were faced with that disgusting level of violence from people who do not represent our communities here in Southport.\"\n\nShe confirmed that three people were arrested following the violence last night, with more expected to follow.\" Asked if her force was prepared for what arrived, she added: \"This was well planned and well organised but kept off social media. We were absolutely prepared, we had sufficient resources on the ground.\n\n\"This is a tight-knit community, I do not want my officers on the streets of a community like Southport in riot gear, based on the intelligence we were dealing with, that would not have been appropriate.

My main concern was the woman who lives up stairs and her daughter.\"\n\nThe Southport dad, a buddhist, said that the woman came down and remonstrated with the thugs.\n\nHe said: \"She told me she came down to them and told them to clear off.\n\n\"I just want to thank the community for doing their best for me. Last night and this morning. Everyone has looked after me.\"\n\nChanuka knocked back suggestions the police should have done more to protect his shop.\n\nHe said: \"They did their best on the night.\"\n\nHe pinned the blame for what happened firmly on the thugs who were not from Southport.\n\nHe said that thousands of pounds worth of cigarettes and alcohol had been stolen from the shop last night.\n\nMr Balasuriya, who has a son aged 11 and daughter 18, said that he became anxious earlier in the evening when he realised there were strangers in his shop.\n\nHe said: \"I didn't recognise their accents, and I know or recognise most of my customers.\"\n\nDespite the break-in he said he can't wait to re-open and get back to serving the community.\n\nHe said: \"Everyone knows this place as the green shop. It's a safe place for everyone.\"\n\nNorman Wallis, 61, the chairman of the Pleasureland amusement park, said of the riots: \"It was absolute mayhem - it was like a war zone. But this wasn't the people of Southport.\n\n\"There were people bussed in from outside, intent on causing carnage.\n\n\"They were organised criminals who have hijacked our town's collective grief.\n\n\"This morning we've come together and rolled up our sleeves to clean up the streets.\n\n\"That's what real community is and what Southport is all about.\"\n\nMr Wallis added: \"These yobs are nothing to do with Southport. It is a wonderful town to live and visit and no-one should ever feel scared to come here.\n\n\"The people causing the trouble, they're not from this area. They're cowards who have come in on the buses and trains with face coverings and a change of clothes.\n\n\"They've got their own agenda which is nothing to do with.the people who live and work here.\n\n\"They haven't got the slightest care or consideration for how the families of the children are feeling.\n\n\"Their lives have changed forever and their grief is being weaponised by thugs.\"\n\nSouthport mosque chairman Ibrahim Hussein said: \"I would like to thank the police very, very, very much indeed.\n\n\"I'm very sorry for the causalities that the police took. They took a very bad beating.\n\n\"I would love to make it better but there's nothing I can do about it.\n\n\"But I would like to thank them for their support because at one point we thought they (the rioters) were coming in and they were going to burn the place down.\"\n\nMr Hussein said the mosque was open and added: \"I will pray for the whole of Southport, I will pray for the victims of the awful attack on Monday, I will pray for the police and I will pray for the whole community to stay as beautiful as it has always been.\"\n\nHe said the Muslim community still felt vulnerable, adding he had seen messages the day before indicating something was going to happen.\n\nMr Hussein described the attack on the dance class as \"absolutely heartbreaking\".", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk",

Chief Constable Serena Kennedy was speaking after violent scenes in the town that resulted in injuries to 54 officers.\n\nViolence erupted in and around St Luke's Road after a large group, which police have linked to the far-right English Defence League, gathered outside a Mosque, attempting to damage the building. Those gathered then turned on the police, setting fire to vehicles and hurling rocks at officers, resulting in many injuries and terrifying scenes.\n\nSpeaking to reporters today, Chief Con Kennedy was asked if she was concerned about further violent scenes in the town in the coming days. She said: \"I am absolutely concerned about repeats, there is that misinformation out there on social media, but please be reassured we are absolutely planning for that, please be reassured that we are planning for what might take place this evening and over the weekend. We were really supported by colleagues from other forces last night and that support is available to us again.\"\n\nOn Tuesday night's violence, she said: \"My officers and staff who responded along with blue light colleagues to the incident on Monday, they are traumatised by what they dealt with and what they have been continuing to deal with over the last 48 hours. Their number one priority was to save as many lives as they could on Monday, working with our colleagues - but also to provide that really important support to the community in Southport, which is a small, tight-knit community that is also traumatised by what has happened.\n\n\"Our officers were then faced with the most horrendous violence against them last night. 54 police officers were injured last night, 49 from Merseyside Police and five from Lancashire Constabulary. It is completely unacceptable. All the blue light services responding yesterday, their focus is around protecting and keeping our communities safe and yet they were faced with that disgusting level of violence from people who do not represent our communities here in Southport.\"\n\nAsked if her force was prepared for what arrived, she added: \"This was well planned and well organised but kept off social media. We were absolutely prepared, we had sufficient resources on the ground. This is a tight-knit community, I do not want my officers on the streets of a community like Southport in riot gear, based on the intelligence we were dealing with, that would not have been appropriate. However the situation very quickly changed and we were able to take control of the position where those people were attending. When we frustrated their attempts at what they were trying to do, they then turned on my officers and became violent and we very quickly had to change.\"\n\nCC Kennedy said she shares people's 'horror and disgust' at what took place on Tuesday night, adding: \"What I would say is please be reassured in terms of that level of support in terms of policing and from our partners.\"\n\nShe added: \"I am so proud of my officers and staff in terms of what they have dealt with over the past 48 hours and the incredible hours they have worked. Everyone has pulled together, working as one team. Staff are working incredibly long hours to make sure we can deal with the events of Monday, which is a really unusual and unfortunately unique investigation but obviously then dealing with the events of yesterday. Those officers had to quickly switch from providing that reassurance at the vigil to then dealing with those mindless hooligans, who inflicted such violence on them, so yes my officers and staff are traumatised by what they have witnessed.\"\n\nThe force leader said online 'misinformation' is a major concern at present, adding: \"There is a lot of speculation out there. We are working really closely with our stakeholders, with our elected members and key members of the community to make sure they have the information which is truthful, using ourselves as that single source of the information so we can try and manage that misinformation out. It is really not helpful to the communities of Southport. We will give you the information when we can, this is a delicate but fast moving investigation and we will get that information out when we can. But there has been lots of untruthful misinformation out there.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_thorp@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Liam Thorp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "patrick_edrich@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Patrick Edrich", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/article29650530.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_riot-southport-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

The North West Ambulance Service reports that 39 police officers required medical attention after Tuesday's disturbance on St Luke's Road.\n\nAccording to the ambulance service, 27 of those officers were taken to hospital and the remaining 12 received treatment on-site. The incident was swiftly elevated to a \"major incident\" status by emergency services due to its severity.\n\nAggressors armed with bricks from nearby garden walls targeted both police and vehicles, sparking fires.

Further vandalism occurred at a local shop, and various wheelie bins were set ablaze. Moreover, the riotous activity resulted in injuries to three police dogs, reports the Liverpool Echo.\n\nPolice Dogs Zoe and Ike suffered leg injuries from bricks, while PD Quga endured burns to her back leg. Imagery and recordings show large crowds surrounding police riot vans on St Luke's Road, where a van was captured engulfed in flames. In the wake of these events, the residents around St Luke's Road have banded together in a significant community effort to restore the area.\n\nNorman Wallis, the owner of Southport Pleasureland, joined forces to tackle the debris left behind. Speaking with the ECHO, he said: \"We're all coming together to try and help the people in Sussex Road and the area to clean up for the mess that was made by all those people, those thugs, that came into their street.\"\n\n\"They just totally destroyed the street, pulled the walls down, pulled fences down, set cars on fire, just terrible. We're all coming together to just try and help as a community.\"\n\nWallis further remarked on the town's virtues, saying Southport is a \"wonderful\" place that deserves more recognition, and stressed that the destructive actions are not representative of the area.\n\nCathy McGrath has been participating in the cleanup efforts since early this morning and shared her feelings with the ECHO: \"I feel just angry and upset really. I went to the vigil last night and it was beautiful for the girls and the children and then you see last night.\"\n\n\"Those people don't represent the community, these people represent the community. They've spoilt it really and that's why I have come out today.\"\n\nDenise Mace recalled the unrest as being frightening: \"It was terrifying to be honest.

Putting his hand to the back of his head after being struck, it looks like he sees blood on his hand - but then the man in a full grey Polo tracksuit has worse problems as he is hit by another brick, right where it hurts.\n\nWincing from the first brick, which was aimed at a line of police officers, with another brick can be seen sailing through the air, before smashing directly into the protester's testicles.

Another can be heard reprimanding the aim of the thugs throwing bricks.\n\nOne social media user viewing the video commented: \"serves him right\". While another X user shared the video, saying: \"Whatever your take on the goings on in Southport, this is inarguably very funny.\n\n\"Concussion, no b******** and nicked tomorrow for rioting.\"\n\nIn a statement on the riots, released late on Tuesday night, Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: \"Tonight, Merseyside Police has faced serious violence in Southport and I am so proud to have witnessed off-duty officers (many of whom had not long finished a full shift) parade back on duty to support their colleagues who had displayed such courage whilst under constant and sustained attack.\n\n\"I would also like to thank officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Police, Lancashire Police and North Wales Police who also provided mutual aid and support.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Sadly, offenders have destroyed garden walls so they could use the bricks to attack our officers and have set cars belonging to the public on fire, and damaged cars parked in the Mosque car park. This is no way to treat a community, least of all a community that is still reeling from the events of Monday.\n\n\"We would appeal to anyone who has information or video footage of those involved in this shocking behaviour to come forward so we can identify and arrest those responsible.\n\n\"Anyone with information can DM @MerPolCC or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_morgan@mirror.co.uk", "name": "William Morgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Ambulance_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North West Ambulance Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sailing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Wales Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assistant chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33362962.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Southport-stabbings-riot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

Keir Starmer warned last night that those behind the unrest will \"feel the full force of the law\" after a mosque was attacked, police vehicles torched and officers targeted with bricks and bottles. Expect plenty of tough questions about the role social media played in stoking the violence.\n\nDeveloping overnight: The North West Ambulance Service said its staff treated 39 police officers, with 27 taken to hospital. Merseyside Police said injuries included fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and a concussion. Three police dogs were injured, too. Officers were given enhanced stop-and-search powers as legal orders were imposed on the town to prevent disorder from breaking out again.\n\n**A message from Lloyds Banking Group: Tonight, over 145,000 children will go to bed in temporary accommodation. That's why we've committed \u00a3200 million to support local providers who deliver housing for those who need it most. Find out more here.**\n\nWhat happened: A peaceful vigil was held to mourn the deaths of Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9. But a short while later, a large group of people, who police believe were supporters of the English Defence League, began to hurl items at a mosque close to the scene of the fatal stabbings. Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said offenders destroyed garden walls to grab bricks to hurl at officers during the chaotic clashes. Expect news of arrests to follow.\n\nProviding answers: Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner will follow Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook's morning round (timings at the bottom of the email) by talking to ITV's This Morning at 10.30 a.m. and Jeremy Vine on Radio 2 at midday.\n\nThe reaction so far: The prime minister, who was heckled as he laid flowers at the scene of the stabbings, said those who \"hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves.\" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who is being kept closely up to date on the situation, used a broadcast clip from parliament's central lobby to blame the \"appalling\" attacks on \"thugs on the streets.\" Southport MP Patrick Hurley blamed \"people from outside our Southport community\" for the violence.\n\nWhat's known: The BBC reports the 17-year-old suspect -- born in Cardiff to parents from Rwanda -- has no known links to Islam, but social media has been rampant with rumors there's an Islamist connection to the killings. Police say the motive is unclear but is not currently believed to be terror-related.\n\nThe misinformation: The Guardian's Ben Quinn has a good piece on the flood of misinformation from far-right activists, fake news websites and conspiracy theorists. In the Commons before the clashes, Cooper said social media companies \"need to take some responsibility.\"\n\nOn the ground: Reporters posted disturbing footage of the violence, with the Guardian's Josh Halliday capturing the blazing police van and reporting chants of \"who the f*** is Allah.\" His colleague Hannah Al-Othman recorded shouts of \"we want our country back\" as well as various scenes of disorder, as she was caught up in the tear gas. The Mail reports there were chants of \"no more boats,\" with one demonstrator carrying a placard reading \"Stop the boats! Send them back!\" ITV's Paul Brand faced some nasty harassment.\n\nLeaning in: Nigel Farage broke ranks with other MPs to bring politics into the killings. In a video on X posted before the rioting, he said the heckling of Starmer shows the public's unhappiness at the \"state of law and order in our country.\" The Reform leader asked: \"Police say it was a non-terror incident ... I just wonder whether the truth is being withheld from us?\" He said what he does know is \"something is going horribly wrong in our once beautiful country\" and suggested there are reports the suspect was being monitored by the security services.\n\nBut but but: Farage didn't say where he saw those reports -- and they're definitely not widespread in the British media. However, Martin Evans and Charles Hymas write in the Telegraph's splash that Russian state-controlled media was among those spreading false claims including that the suspect was on an MI6 watch list, having arrived as an asylum seeker on a boat last year. They point out that Russia Today went on to update its story to say the claim had been retracted. Will Farage have anything to add?\n\nA SUMMER OF TAX SPECULATION\n\nAND BREATHE ... The first day of summer recess means exhausted MPs and political staffers will be settling into a well-earned rest after the grueling weeks of campaigning were followed by the dizzying days of political overhaul. But the great wheels of speculation shall not be slowed -- thanks to Rachel Reeves giving them a good old spin with a suggestion of impending tax hikes.\n\nThe admission: The chancellor gave a heavy hint in her Commons statement on the \u00a322 billion \"black hole\" that she'd be making \"difficult decisions,\" including on tax, in her Oct. 30 budget -- and then she basically confirmed to the News Agents podcast that they will indeed be coming. \"I think that we will have to increase taxes in the budget,' she told Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel. At least for Reeves' sake, recess means Speaker Lindsay Hoyle will be discreetly fulminating in Lancashire rather than loudly in the Commons at the chancellor not giving that scoop to the chamber.\n\nFor whom the tax tolls? Pressed by the podcasting duo, Reeves didn't rule out hiking taxes on inheritance or capital gains or easing the relief on pension contributions. She was, however, standing by the manifesto pledges not to hike income tax, VAT or national insurance. No doubt Rayner and Pennycook will face questions on this in their media grillings.\n\nOn the Hunt: The tax admission from Reeves was like a fox-scented rag for Jeremy Hunt. The shadow chancellor, already enraged by the black hole attacks on his legacy, issued a \"we told you so\" statement, saying: \"Just as we warned -- they were always planning to do this, they just didn't have the courage to be honest about it\".\n\nBlame game, the sequel: The bitter row over just how much the Tories are to blame -- and how much Reeves is milking this funding deficit to justify painful policies -- was taking place on the front page of the Financial Times. The pink 'un has a good go at getting to the bottom of just what Labour knew. Hunt hit back at Reeves' \"desperate\" attack and former Home Secretary James Cleverly insisted it's \"nonsensical\" to feign surprise that asylum support had been funded through reserves. Read the piece here.\n\nIt's all in the phrasing: Showing just why this messaging war is so important is this new Savanta polling. The survey shared with Playbook suggests 64 percent of Britons would \"be happy\" to be taxed more to cover a pay rise for NHS nurses. But this drops to 49 percent when people are asked about hikes to recruit and train more police, 48 percent to pay teachers better and 44 percent to fund new infrastructure projects. Hard to see those \"unfunded\" or \"unaffordable\" rail, road and hospital projects being revived any time soon then ...\n\nWHAT LABOUR ACTUALLY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT: Angela Rayner, in her role as housing secretary, is announcing she's launched a task force to recommend where to build a promised series of new towns. But the task force, led by English Cities Fund Chair Michael Lyons, isn't expected to produce its final report for up to a year, raising questions about just how quickly these towns will be realized.\n\nSoftly does it: After announcing sweeping reforms to deliver 1.5 million more homes this decade, Rayner sought to win round the NIMBYs with an op-ed in the Telegraph. To those who reckon England's green and pleasant land has been concreted over, she says: \"I could gently reassure them. Or, more likely, I can just say: 'It's nonsense.'\" Read her case here.\n\nOAPeeved off: Between ending winter fuel payments and taking aim at the housing hesitant, Labour appears increasingly willing to piss off one of the country's most powerful interest groups: old people. My colleague Esther Webber writes today that it makes sense for the government to make a bold play while it's at its most powerful -- and will deepen Tory fears that they're losing the battle for working-age votes. Read her piece here.\n\nMission bored? Energy Secretary Ed Miliband is chairing another one of those \"mission boards,\" summoning ministers to discuss plans to make Britain a clean energy superpower. Expect a statement after they meet.\n\nSomething to cheer about: The former Labour leader is rather gleeful about throwing more money to renewables developers, raising the budget for the ongoing auction round for clean energy projects nearly 50 percent to \u00a31.5 billion, energy guru and POLITICO colleague Nicholas Earl writes in to say. \"This will restore the U.K. as a global leader for green technologies and deliver the infrastructure we need to boost our energy independence, protect billpayers and become a clean energy superpower,\" Miliband beamed.\n\nPLANET TORY\n\nALL CALM: Kemi Badenoch came out swinging at the Guardian last night after Pippa Crerar reported allegations that the Tory leadership frontrunner has been accused of \"bullying and traumatizing\" behavior towards officials in the Department for Business and Trade.\n\nA very civil service: The report details claims that Badenoch presided over a toxic and intimidating atmosphere while running the government department -- claims she rather sharply denied. At least three officials were said to have found her behavior so poor they felt they had no choice but to quit. It's worth reading Pippa's piece in full here.\n\nKemi strikes back: Badenoch used a mini-thread on X to return fire. The shadow housing secretary called the piece a \"hit job\" and -- never one to miss an opportunity -- argued that her campaign has \"spooked the lefties\" because she's the \"one person they know can beat Keir Starmer.\"\n\nThere's more: Badenoch pointed out that no official complaints to the department were made about her conduct there, as backed up by a statement from the DBT. She claimed the allegations are \"smears from former staff who I sacked\" after they were themselves accused of bullying and lying, though that's a bit confusing because ministers (other than the PM) don't have the authority to dismiss civil servants.\n\nSecuring maximum coverage: The angry denial led several rival papers' stories. It also offered further evidence to Tory MPs weighing up whether to back Badenoch that she's never one to resist a public scrap.\n\nTODAY IN WESTMINSTER\n\nWITH PARLIAMENT IN RECESS: Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Defence Secretary John Healey are in Qatar to call for de-escalation in the Middle East, meeting U.K. personnel working on supporting stability in the region.\n\nNOT POLITICS, BUT: Huw Edwards is due before Westminster Magistrates' Court this morning charged with making indecent images of children. The former BBC presenter is alleged to have committed three offenses between December 2020 and April 2022. PA previews the appearance.\n\nIT'S CHRONIC: Junior doctors have been told the next \"window of opportunity\" for strikes is about 12 months away, \"when Labour's honeymoon period ends,\" the Times reports. The comments came from the BMA's junior doctors committee Co-Chair Robert Laurenson after the government offered a 22 percent pay rise to end the strikes.\n\nMore health problems: Boris Johnson's plan to build 40 new hospitals by 2030 is set to be missed following a project review, the i's Hugo Gye and Ben Gartside report. The construction of the majority of these new hospitals is yet to begin and is set to be paused until later in the year once the review has concluded. A Department for Health spokesperson said: \"The previous government's commitment to build 40 new hospitals by 2030 is undeliverable and unaffordable. The funding allocated by the previous government runs out in March.\"\n\nSNP STRUGGLES: The SNP has been licking its wounds and its members letting loose at each other since its humiliation in July's election, POLITICO's Andrew McDonald writes in a great piece on the nationalist plight. Blame is still flying around the party, while the financial implications of the big defeat have hit hard with a big staffing cut at Westminster.\n\nYellow fever: \"Parties die. If we don't change, we will die,\" one SNP figure told Andrew, as it gears up for a big challenge from Scottish Labour at Holyrood in two years. More recriminations and analysis in the piece here.\n\nSCOOP -- ASBESTOS BREACH: Parliamentary authorities broke health and safety law during an asbestos incident in the Palace of Westminster in 2021, my colleague Esther Webber writes in to say. The Health and Safety Executive has finally concluded an inquiry into the exposure that occurred as part of fire safety work being carried out in Speaker's House, first reported by POLITICO. The watchdog is not expected to take enforcement action but found \"material breaches\" of asbestos control regulations, and criticized the use of a contractor that was not properly qualified.\n\nIt's all adding up: The House of Commons will issue a response today but has already undertaken to foot the bill for the HSE investigation into the incident, which resulted in dozens of people working on the estate being notified of possible asbestos exposure. Meanwhile, plans for the wholesale restoration of parliament remain in limbo.\n\nCOOLING IT DOWN: The DWP held a late afternoon briefing to soothe the nerves of MPs worried about winter fuel payment changes, Playbook's Bethany Dawson heard. PoliticsHome's Nadine Batchelor-Hunt hears the same, and reports the meeting was hosted by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones.\n\nBREAKFAST WITH RACHEL: Chancellor Rachel Reeves is hosting a bevy of deep-pocketed tech companies and investors for breakfast this morning to talk tech and AI, my colleagues on our Morning Tech newsletter report. Senior execs from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Nvidia are expected.\n\nANOTHER TYPE OF CHANCELLOR: The Financial Times reports that former Labour Secretary of State Peter Mandelson and former Conservative Leader William Hague are in the race to be the next chancellor of the University of Oxford, along with former Prime Minister Theresa May. The election will take place in the Michaelmas term (which, for normies, is between October and December).\n\nMORE ELECTION DATES: The House of Commons has announced select committee nominations will run until Sept. 9, with the ballot scheduled for Sept. 11.\n\nDON'T BE A HERO: The IPPR's Commission on Health and Prosperity, chaired by experts including Ara Darzi and charged by the health secretary with undertaking an independent investigation into the state of the NHS, has produced a report revealing the annual cost of employee sickness has risen \u00a330 billion since 2018. The report says employees lose the equivalent of 44 days of productivity soldiering through illness, with 6.7 days lost each year to sick leave.\n\nREPORTS OUT TODAY: The IFG has produced a list of 20 ways the civil service can be improved, including the introduction of a new civil service board and the default external advertising of roles ... Centre for Cities says 68 percent of households in England could have their annual council tax bill reduced by \u00a3494 if council taxes were set locally.\n\nTRIBUTES PAID: To the Independent's War and Diplomatic Correspondent Kim Sengupta, who has died at age 68. Foreign Secretary David Lammy wrote that his \"brave dispatches will be sorely missed,\" and Defence Secretary John Healey described his expertise on defense as \"unparalleled.\" There were also warm words from Sky's Jon Craig and the BBC's Quentin Sommerville.\n\nBEYOND THE M25\n\nLEBANON AIRSTRIKE: The Israel Defense Forces claimed they killed a senior Hezbollah commander in an airstrike on the Lebanese capital of Beirut on Tuesday, a significant escalation in the long-running conflict between Israel and the militant group that European capitals fear could quickly snowball into a regional conflict. Earlier on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Britons in Lebanon should leave to avoid \"becoming trapped in a warzone.\"\n\nSWEDISH FEARS: A spate of deadly gang violence is part of a brutal summer troubling Sweden's government, my colleague Charlie Duxbury reports. On July 22, a person hurled a hand grenade into a shop in S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, where several bystanders were injured and one woman in her 50s had to be airlifted to the hospital. Only a day later, a man was shot and injured on a street nearby. There have been 148 shootings in Sweden this year, killing 20 and injuring 26. In 2023, there were a total of 53 gun deaths.\n\nSECRET RELOCATIONS: More than 5,000 former military and intelligence operatives in Afghanistan have been evacuated from the Taliban-ruled country to the U.K. by the MoD since October, the National reports, and are now living in surplus military housing across the country. The MoD declined to comment.\n\nDC TENSIONS: Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. repeatedly raised his voice during a senate hearing on the shooting of Donald Trump, as he pushed back against withering criticism of his agency's performance. Rowe acknowledged the Secret Service made catastrophic errors, but vowed to prevent his agency's leaders from being \"unfairly persecuted.\"\n\nOver in Atlanta: Vice President Kamala Harris has once again challenged Trump to a televised debate, saying \"I do hope Trump will agree to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you got something to say, say it to my face.\"\n\n**A message from Lloyds Banking Group: At Lloyds Banking Group, we've been championing the social housing sector for decades.

North West Ambulance Service confirmed paramedics treated 39 police officers after violence flared during a protest on St Luke's Road in Southport on Tuesday, July 30.\n\nThe ambulance service confirmed 27 officers were taken to hospital and 12 were treated and discharged at scene. It was declared as a \"major incident\" by emergency services.\n\nBricks taken from garden walls were used to attack officers and a police van was torched. A large group of people, who police said are believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, began to throw items towards a local mosque on St Luke's Road. Cars belonging to members of the public were set on fire and bricks were thrown at a local mosque.\n\nDamage was also caused to a local convenience store and wheelie bins were set alight, police said. Jack Richards, 21, lives at home with his mum, dad and 21-year-old sister.\n\nHe spoke to the ECHO about what unfolded. He said people used bins in the roads as barricades. Jack said: \"After the vigil we saw lots of people running down towards Hart Street, the streets filled up with cars parking up, and then everything happened. It started on St Luke's Road then started progressing from there, they raided the little mini mart up the road and marched down onto Queen's Road, people saying 'do you want a beer lad or some vapes' and shouting over.\n\n\"Once it started to turn dark they were all leaning on my sister's car, my sister politely asked them to get off, she told them she loves that car and asked them to stop leaning on it, and to be fair they said yeah - then they started taking the p*** - they noticed all the police coming and started putting all the bins in the roads as barricades and while they were lighting the bins someone ran down the road and jumped on my sister's windscreen and two footed it.\"\n\nJack added his family had to put fires out as emergency services dealt with various incidents of disorder.\n\nHe said: \"Fires started getting a lot bigger, they started to clear off once the fires were going so we came out with the garden hose and started trying to put the fire out, my dad had two fire extinguishers as well.

Jack Heathcote took out his camera while he was on the way to rescue his brother, who lives near to where the riot, broke out on St Luke's Road.\n\nA protest was organised following the murder of three young children in the town on Monday. Hundreds of people descended on Southport, setting fire to both police and civilian vehicles, damaging a mosque and ripping bricks off walls in order to hurl at officers. The march has been widely condemned - including by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nJack, a gardener who is from the area, had attended the touching vigil at the Atkinson when he went back home to get his dinner. He told the ECHO: \"I'd got home when I began to get calls from my family telling me that it's all kicking off. I rang my brother, because he lives close to the protest, and asked him if he needed to get out.\n\nSouthport stabbing\n\n\"He said 'yes' so I took the car down. When I got there, there was smoke and a police van had been set on fire. I thought it was important that I photographed it, so I took out my camera.\" The 32-year-old captured images which include riot police protecting a burning vehicle and a policewoman with blood streaming down the side of her face. He also photographed the plumbing business of Robert Whitfield, 67, who was this morning counting the cost of the night of violence after his business was attacked.\n\nSpeaking about the riot, Jack said: \"It was shocking. I thought it was going to be naked aggression from the crowd but what disturbed me was that it was sadistic. People were enjoying it, they weren't angry about the girls - they were just using that as an excuse.\"\n\nThe North West Ambulance Service confirmed they treated 39 police officers after the protest in Southport turned ugly.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conaill_corner@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Conaill Corner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Ambulance_Service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North West Ambulance Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29650521.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_riot-southport-4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777011", "eventUri": "eng-9777011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

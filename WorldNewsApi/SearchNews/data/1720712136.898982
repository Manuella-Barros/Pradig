The 28-year-old has endured plenty of ups and downs during his decade at Old Trafford, where he says this was his \u201cmost frustrating season\u201d to date having dealt with \u201cinjury after injury\u201d. Shaw was restricted to 15 appearances and last played in mid-February, yet positive rehab \u2013 and a paucity of left-back options \u2013 saw Gareth Southgate select him for this summer\u2019s Euros. \u201cI\u2019m definitely progressing much better than I think they thought, and me too,\u201d the Euro 2020 final goalscorer said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to look too far ahead. Obviously, I\u2019m very grateful for Gareth picking me and showing the faith that he has in me. \u201cYou know, for me, it\u2019s about repaying that and doing everything I can to try and get fit and try and help the team win this Euros.\u201d Shaw has yet to begin full training but has not given up on featuring in next Sunday\u2019s group opener against Serbia, although Southgate says the second game against Denmark is more likely. The England manager acknowledges he took a calculated gamble by selecting a player whose availability for his country this summer has led some to question his loyalty to United. Shaw hit back at that talk in a social media post after missing their FA Cup final triumph and admitted after his Euros selection was confirmed that it has been \u201cplaying on my mind a little bit\u201d. \u201cNo one knows the situation, what\u2019s been happening,\u201d he said, \u201cObviously, I think people have seen that there was a setback, but I was actually very close to returning to team training. I think it was the day before. \u201cIn my opinion, I was pushing to try and get back for the games and the final and I think I pushed too hard. \u201cI came back too quick and I actually ended up getting another injury in my hamstring, which was a (grade) 2c. That was three weeks from the final and they said it was a six-week injury, so that\u2019s obviously why there was that setback. \u201cI think people have been getting confused with what\u2019s actually happened because nothing had ever been said. That\u2019s why I did my post. I got a few people coming up to me, saying, \u2018how can you not be fit for United and (can) for England?\u2019 \u201cBut the circumstances were that I did push to do everything I can to be fit for United, and that\u2019s been really my whole season. It\u2019s been disappointing for me, but I want to do everything I can, first and foremost, for United. \u201cThat\u2019s my club, I\u2019ve been there for a long time but, of course, that wasn\u2019t the case, so that was hard to obviously take in the last few weeks. \u201cBut I\u2019m here now and I\u2019m still not there yet, I\u2019ve still got a while to go, but I\u2019m trying to do everything I can to make it happen.\u201d Shaw says his first thought when he suffered the setback was missing the end of United\u2019s season and FA Cup final rather than potentially being ruled out of the Euros. The left-back is now looking to move on and takes his share of blame, admitting \u201cmaybe at times, especially my first hamstring, could have been avoidable\u201d. \u201cI felt something against Aston Villa and came off at half-time at Villa Park,\u201d Shaw said of the issue that came a week before limping off at Luton \u2013 his last appearance on February 18. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of everyone\u2019s fault. Partly my fault, partly medical staff, I think everyone would admit that. \u201cI didn\u2019t train the whole week. The scan came back and there wasn\u2019t too much there. But I didn\u2019t train all week, then trained the day before the game. \u201cIf the manager asks me to play, I\u2019m never going to say no. I played and obviously I shouldn\u2019t have played.\u201d Put to Shaw that only underlines his commitment to United, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve always said the team comes before everything for me. That will never change.\u201d", "summary": "<p>The left-back was restricted to 15 appearances for his club side this season and last played in mid-February.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/luke-shaw-manchester-united-injury-gareth-southgate-england-b2559415.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/11/3c0ee6e2307af66dc1c2b5fe38634b04Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE4MDEzMjk5-2.76431965.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:24:35", "author": "Simon Peach", "authors": ["Simon Peach"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.332}

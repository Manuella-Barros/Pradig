This year's \"cicada-geddon\" is brought to us by one each of Brood XIII, which is primarily in Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin, and Brood XIX, which extends south and east from there.\n\nMassospora cicadina has already infected cicadas in Champaign, Illinois, and is expected to migrate north to the Chicago area, according to Jim Louderman, a collection's assistant at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History. Experts in Missouri say the fungus has also started impacting cicadas there.\n\nBirds that eat the infected cicadas may also experience hallucinatory effects.\n\nThe white fungus takes over male cicadas and causes the gonads to be torn from the body. The chalky spores that are released by the fungus are spread to other nearby cicadas, infecting more and more.\n\nThe fungus also takes over the way the cicadas behave. Even though their reproductive parts have been replaced by a fungus, they are driven to mate with as many other cicadas as possible, Dr. Matt Kasson, an associate professor of mycology and forest pathology at West Virginia University, explained to CNN.\n\nInfected males also flick their wings in an attractive way, luring in more victims.\n\n\"It turns infected cicadas into 'zombie insects' that disperse more fungus by causing males infected with Stage I [of emergence] to produce wing-flick signals as if they were females- making them highly attractive to cicadas of both sexes,\" the University of Connecticut explains.\n\nBy fervently mating with healthy cicadas, the sickened insects spread the fungus far and wide. And with trillions - potentially even hundreds of trillions - of cicadas emerging this year, the fungus has a lot of insects to prey on.\n\nFor those whose neighborhoods are still plagued by swarming cicadas, perhaps some of them zombies, relief is on the way. The cicadas tend to disappear a few weeks after they appear, once they've successfully laid eggs. That means most parts of the country will be quiet, rid of the roaring cicada song, by the end of the month. Some cicadas could linger into early July.", "source": {"uri": "myfox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myfox8.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alix_martichoux@myfox8.com", "name": "Alix Martichoux",

Typically, male cicadas make a loud mating call to attract females, who respond by flicking their wings. Infected males, in their fungus-fueled quest for world domination, will also pretend to be females to mate with other males.\n\nTheir attempts at reproduction, doomed from the start, only fuel the virus' spread, a group of scientists at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History told NPR in a statement.\n\n\"Eventually, their fungal plug gets ripped open, and they fly around raining down spores, further spreading the fungus,\" they wrote. \"Some scientists call the cicadas at this stage 'flying salt shakers of death.' \"\n\nPeriodical cicadas only live about three to four weeks once they emerge from the ground, so this year's crop will start to dwindle later this month. The fungus, however, will live on.\n\n\"Stage I\" infected cicadas pass the disease onto other adults in their same generation, according to the University of Connecticut. \"Stage II\" cicadas disperse spores into the soil, where they will go on to infect the next generation of cicada nymphs in either 13 or 17 years.\n\nKasson says not to worry about the welfare of the infected cicadas, in part because of another curious side effect of the fungus.\n\n\"It turns out the fungus produces a stimulant called cathinone that likely means the cicadas don't mind because they are possibly high out of their minds,\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nA study published in Fungal Ecology in 2019 reported the discovery of cathinone -- a plant-associated amphetamine -- in four infected cicada populations, and the hallucinogen psilocybin in some annual cicadas infected with the fungus.\n\nThe Field Museum scientists say those natural amphetamines may affect not only the cicadas but the bigger animals that prey on them, like birds. But the amount is so small that there is no risk to people or pets.\n\nScientists don't know exactly how widespread Massospora is or how many of the billions of cicadas buzzing around the U.S. will be affected.\n\nField Museum researchers, for example, identified just seven infected cicadas out of the \"hundreds\" they examined on a visit to central Illinois last week.\n\nKasson estimates the overall incidence of infection at \"maybe below 5%\" -- but not everywhere.\n\n\"We've encountered some areas where it's as high as 20-30%,\" he said, adding his team is trying to understand the reasons for such variation. \"With climate change and landscape fragmentation, all these things cumulatively could tip the scales against cicadas to really impact a specific brood.\"\n\nHe says his team has collected more data over the last near-decade about 17-year cicadas, so is hoping to get their hands on more infected cicadas from the 13-year population -- as well as those in the part of Illinois where the two broods geographically overlap.\n\nKasson is also encouraging observers to alert him to any specimens they might want to contribute to his research, and tweeted this week that \"the only way to truly experience periodical cicadas and their zombie cicada fungus, Massospora cicadina, is to drive out to meet them in person.\" (He found 18 infected living specimens on his first day in the Chicago area.)\n\nAnyone hoping to get up close to an infected cicada -- or to avoid them at all costs -- can rest assured knowing that the Massospora doesn't pose a risk to humans.\n\n\"The fungus is also specialized to cicadas, so other animals and people can't get infected by it,\" the Field Museum scientists wrote. \"They're safe to handle (but you might want to wash your hands afterward).\"", "source": {"uri": "kgou.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGOU 106.3"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada", "type": "wiki", "score":

In the late summer, in the warm, muggy evenings so typical of that region, one omnipresent thing was the call of Japanese cicadas, which, unlike our variety, are present every summer. Hearing the call of the Japanese cicada to this day evokes memories of the rice fields, the orchards, the mountains and valleys of Japan.\n\nOur American variety is very much in evidence this year, as a major hatching cycle is underway. But the American cicadas contend with something their Japanese cousins do not: a fungal infection that would have made George A. Romero clap his hands in admiration, as it turns them into hyper-sexualized zombie cicadas.\n\nA sexually transmitted disease that is said to turn cicadas into \"zombies\" and causes their genitals to fall off has been detected in southern parts of Illinois and is spreading throughout the Midwest.\n\nThe fungal infection, called Massospora cicadina, targets only the 13- and 17-year periodical cicadas. This year's \"cicada-geddon\" is brought to us by one each of Brood XIII, which is primarily in Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin, and Brood XIX, which extends south and east from there.\n\nAs to how the fungus works:\n\nThe white fungus takes over male cicadas and causes the gonads to be torn from the body. The chalky spores that are released by the fungus are spread to other nearby cicadas, infecting more and more.\n\nThe fungus also takes over the way the cicadas behave. Even though their reproductive parts have been replaced by a fungus, they are driven to mate with as many other cicadas as possible, Dr. Matt Kasson, an associate professor of mycology and forest pathology at West Virginia University, explained to CNN.\n\nInfected males also flick their wings in an attractive way, luring in more victims.\n\nWell, that's just downright unsettling.\n\nSee Related: Unsuspecting Family Recovers From 'Brain Worms' After Consuming Underdone Bear Meat\n\nYes, You Can Eat Cicadas - But Should You Eat Cicadas?\n\nHere's how this is liable to play out over, oh, probably the next century or so. There will be -- there always are -- some cicadas that are resistant to the fungus. They will survive; either the fungus will not be able to infect them, or the cicada's immune systems will kill it or render it harmless once they are infected. Those cicadas, obviously, will not lose their gonads and die; they will mate normally and lay eggs, while their infected counterparts will fail to do so. Over a couple of cycles, most of the susceptible cicadas will be infected and die, while the resistant ones will reproduce more resistant ones, giving the population a natural immunity.\n\nImagine that. Exposure to a pathogen can help develop herd immunity. Who knew?\n\nOh, the fungus will spread to adjacent cicada populations, where the process will be repeated, producing more hyper-sexualized zombie cicadas. Nature is weird. And, honestly, what could be more disconcerting than zombie cicadas?\n\nOf course, this, too, shall pass. Eventually, the summer will end, and the cicadas, both zombified and non-zombified, will disappear, and people living in the areas affected by this summer's humdinger of a hatch will get some peace and quiet again.\n\nIn the meantime, those of us living in these afflicted areas should try to take it all in stride. After all, we shouldn't let it bug us.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ward_clark@redstate.com", "name": "Ward Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cicada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fungus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungal_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fungal infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zombie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexually transmitted infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honshu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honshu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Honshu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_A._Romero", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George A.

But when it comes to the fungus Massospora cicadina, said Dr. John Cooley, an associate professor in residence of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut, Hartford, \"the truth is actually much stranger than science fiction.\"\n\nPeriodical cicadas lay their eggs in tree branches, and when those eggs hatch, the resulting baby cicadas, or nymphs, drop to the ground and burrow into the soil. Depending on their species, they spend 13 or 17 years underground, drinking sap from tree roots, until it's time for the nearly grown cicadas to emerge. At some point, the insects are exposed to spores of the fungus Massospora cicadina. It's not clear to scientists whether it happens when the cicadas enter the soil or when they leave it, or how that exposure happens.\n\nThe spores make their way into the cicadas' bodies, and from that point on, the cicadas are at the mercy of the fungal parasite. A mass of fungal spores builds up in the abdomen of each infected cicada. Eventually, the back end of the cicada - including its genitals - falls off. In its place, a white fungal plug is exposed, \"a clump of spores that are erupting out of where the genitals and abdomen once were,\" said Dr. Matt Kasson, an associate professor of mycology and forest pathology at West Virginia University. \"It looks like there's a gumdrop that's been dropped in chalk dust, glued to the backside of these cicadas.\"\n\nDespite having a chalky gumdrop of spores instead of genitals, the infected cicadas still attempt to mate, with gusto. The fungus manipulates the cicadas' behavior, causing what researchers including Kasson refer to as hypersexualization. The infected males keep trying to mate with females, and they also change their behavior to attract their fellow males. Healthy female cicadas will flick their wings to indicate that they're ready to mate. Both male and female cicadas infected with Massospora flick their wings to draw in amorous, soon-to-be-infected males.\n\nBut attempting to mate is just one part of how infected cicadas spread the fungus.\n\n\"Periodical cicadas have interlocking genitalia. So when they pull apart, guess what happens? Rip. And then there's a cicada walking around with someone else's genitals stuck to them,\" Cooley said. \"And now the cicada that's infected is busted open.\"\n\nWATCH | ABC7 Chicago Cicada-Cast 2024 breaks down latest on Illinois emergence\n\nOnce the chalky fungal plug is ripped apart, the infected and disemboweled cicada flies around, raining down fluffy, brown spores. \"We call them the saltshakers of death,\" Kasson said. The spores dispersed by these flying saltshakers go on to infect the next generation of cicadas that will emerge more than a decade later and begin the cycle again.\n\nIt's an awful lot of moving around and mating for animals whose bodies have been torn apart. Kasson and his colleagues have found a potential explanation for what keeps these cicadas going. \"We found an amphetamine in those fungal plugs, which provides a plausible explanation as to why the behavioral modification is occurring,\" Kasson said. After all, amphetamines are powerful stimulants in humans.\n\nCooley noted that while amphetamines stimulate the central nervous systems of vertebrate animals, insects (which are all invertebrates) such as cicadas have different nervous systems, and it's not clear if those stimulants would affect them the same way.\n\n\"We're left with this problem, that it's making a powerful psychoactive chemical, but the powerful psychoactive chemical may not do anything to the insects,\" Cooley said. He suggested that the fungus may have a different means of controlling the cicadas' behavior, and that the amphetamines it produces might instead serve to ward off vertebrate predators of cicadas (and thus, of cicada-dwelling fungi), such as birds.\n\nThis spring's periodical cicada emergence is noteworthy because two different broods will emerge simultaneously in neighboring regions - 17-year cicadas concentrated in northern Illinois, and 13-year cicadas throughout much of the Midwest and Southeast. These two broods have not been aboveground at the same time since 1803; however, scientists expect little geographical overlap of the two broods.\n\nKasson said he hopes to study infected insects from the two different broods and see whether there are genetic differences between the M. cicadina infecting the 17-year and 13-year broods.\n\nWhile cicadas are edible, Kasson said people hoping to sample the bugs should be choosy about which ones they eat. If you find adult cicadas near the end of their lives, or already dead, Kasson said, \"you do not want to put those in your mouth,\" regardless of whether they're infected with M. cicadina. If a person, dog or cat were to eat an infected cicada, they wouldn't be affected by the amphetamines in it - the dose is too small. And for \"The Last of Us\" fans, M. cicadina is only capable of infecting cicadas (and just the 13- and 17-year varieties of these bugs), so humanity is probably safe from zombification.\n\nKasson said that while he understands the trepidation people might have about the upcoming cicada emergence, not to mention the grotesque fungal infection that up to 10% of them might develop, he noted, \"It's a biological spectacle. And I think we should just appreciate this as one of the natural wonders of the world.\"\n\nRELATED | What trees do cicadas like?

Here's what you can expect.\n\nBillions of cicadas are currently swarming a large area of the country.\n\nBrood XIX (19) appeared around the same time as Brood XIII (13) starting in May. The double invasion is anticipated to be unusually large, with some experts estimating that more than a trillion cicadas could emerge in the United States in 2024.\n\nSeveral nearby states are experiencing cicadas this year, but they did not reach Ohio. The last time they were here was in the summer of 2021, when a large portion of western and central Ohio were carpeted by the insects, according to Ohio State University's Buckeye Environmental Horticulture Team.\n\nBut a cicada brood will be making noise here next year. Here's what we know.\n\nWhen will cicadas appear in Ohio?\n\nRelieved that the cicadas missed your area? Well, that relief won't last because another group of cicadas will dwell in the Ohio Valley in 2025.\n\nBrood XIV (14) will emerge in 2025, according to the Buckeye Environmental Horticulture Team.\n\nBrood XIV, also on a 17-year cycle, will be larger than Brood X, which appeared in 2021.\n\nAccording to a University of Connecticut interactive map, Brood XIV exists in four distinct patches:\n\nIf you're from Cincinnati or planning to travel to southwest or southern Ohio in May or June of 2025, plan on having cicadas join your summer vacation.\n\nAkron, Canton next in line for cicadas after Cincinnati\n\nCincinnati should expect cicadamania in 2025. Then Ohio will have to wait a few years to see the periodic winged insects again.\n\nAccording to a United States Forest Service map, nearly all of Eastern Ohio, including Akron and Canton, will see Brood V cicadas emerge in 2033. The time that area of the state saw cicadas was 2016.\n\nWhen will Columbus see cicadas?\n\nBrood X crowded Franklin County in 2021. As a 17-year cicada, the capital city won't see another Brood X emergence until 2038, according to Georgetown University.\n\nThe range of Brood XIV cicadas emerging in 2025 could extend toward central Ohio but is not expected to reach Columbus as they will appear in southern Ohio.\n\nWhy didn't Ohio have cicadas this year?\n\nOhio is not a region hosting the two broods that have appeared across much of the Southeast and Midwest in 2024. So, no cicadas in the Buckeye State this year.\n\nHowever, you might still spot either brood this spring as \"some stragglers may pop up in the southwest of the state,\" Ohio State University's Buckeye Environmental Horticulture Team warned.\n\nBrood XIX emerged in 14 states across the Southeast and Midwest, and Brood XIII emerged in five Midwestern states around the same time, USA Today reported. This double emergence happened for the first time in 221 years and won't happen again until 2245. Confusingly, Brood XIII emerges every 17 years while Brook XIX resurfaces every 13 years, according to the University of Illinois.", "source": {"uri": "marionstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Helen McDade was grilled by the BBC\u2019s Sunday Show on her party\u2019s stance around a number of issues including immigration, net zero and private healthcare. She is standing in a seat the Tories are desperate to win from the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart. He could get a boost if Reform UK, now led by Nigel Farage, pull votes away from the Tories in the target constituency. Tory candidate Luke Graham, who was joined on the campaign trail by deputy party leader Meghan Gallacher in Perth on Sunday, described the interview as \u201cshambolic\u201d. \u2018Too much immigration\u2019 Ms McDade came under pressure from the BBC\u2019s Martin Geissler to explain how the party would make their plans for \u201cnet zero immigration\u201d work. She said while there is \u201ctoo much immigration\u201d, the party would allow people working in health and social care to enter the country. Net zero immigration means that the number legally allowed to enter to live and work in the UK each year should equal the number emigrating. But when asked how she would ensure migration stays down, Ms McDade, who is a former vet, said: \u201cIf we need a lot (health and social care staff), we would train up our own. \u201cAnd one of the things we would do on that is when nurses and doctors qualify, we would give them a tax break for three years and we would also take off their tuition fees.\u201d Asked how the hospitality sector would manage to fill jobs, the Reform candidate said people earning under \u00a320,000 would not pay basic income tax. She said this would be funded by the party\u2019s policy to \u201cabolish net zero\u201d in a bid to save \u00a330 billion, saying \u201chuge amounts\u201d are being given to renewables firms. But no specifics were provided on how this figure was reached at. Ms McDade claimed: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about the windfall tax on the oil and gas companies. No one talks about doing it to renewable energy companies which did very well over Covid. They are getting a lot of money in subsidies.\u201d The Reform candidate said she \u201cdidn\u2019t have a figure\u201d for how many jobs would be lost by the party\u2019s plans to cut public spending by 5%. Admitting it would be \u201ccostly\u201d, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t know the particular cost because I\u2019m not the economic expert. Please do invite him on. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d be keen to come and answer that question.\u201d \u2018Shambolic interview\u2019 Mr Graham said: \u201cThis shambolic interview shows Reform aren\u2019t bringing positive ideas to Scotland, just negative arguments from elsewhere in the UK, which is no surprise since Reform have little support here. \u201cI think it would be hard for any pro-UK voter to support Reform and help the SNP win. \u201cThe fight is very different in Scotland, and in Perth & Kinross-shire it is solely a contest between the SNP and the Scottish Conservatives.\u201d Other candidates standing in the seat include Graham Cox (Labour), Amanda Clark (Liberal Democrats) and Sally Hughes (independent).

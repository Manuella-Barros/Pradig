{"id": 232040344, "title": "Tories embroiled in hypocrisy row over anti-Ulez pledge", "text": "The Conservatives are embroiled in a hypocrisy row over Rishi Sunak\u2019s \u201cbacking drivers bill\u201d to scale back Ulez, ban pay-per-mile road taxes and crack down on Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs). The prime minister said the bill would be part of his first King\u2019s Speech if he is re-elected on 4 July, promising to end Labour\u2019s \u201cwar on drivers\u201d in London and Wales. But Mr Sunak was accused of hypocrisy after it emerged his own ministers had supported many of the measures he is now railing against. As chancellor, Mr Sunak reportedly drew up plans to introduce a pay-per-mile road pricing system. And in 2022 one of the PM\u2019s own transport ministers, Huw Merriman, said London mayor Sadiq Khan should introduce a road pricing scheme to replace lost revenues from fuel and vehicle excise duties. Labour also pointed out that Mr Merriman also suggested Mr Khan\u2019s Ulez expansion was a \u201cbold attempt to reduce congestion and pollution\u201d. Transport secretary Mark Harper on Friday ruled out introducing any pay-per-mile schemes and promised to reverse the London mayor\u2019s \u201cunfair Ulez expansion. Former prime minister Boris Johnson introduced Ulez as mayor in 2015, calling it an \u201cessential measure\u201d that would \u201clengthen London\u2019s lead as the greatest city on earth\u201d. The Conservatives\u2019 backing drivers bill is the party\u2019s latest attempt to shore up its core support, with Mr Sunak on course for a 1997-style election drubbing. The Tories said they will \u201cprotect drivers from the draconian policies of local Labour politicians\u201d. Anti-Ulez backlash was widely credited for helping the Tories narrowly hold on to Mr Johnson\u2019s former Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat in the by-election to replace him. And the party hopes it can hold onto the backing of motorists counting the cost of environmental policies in the general election. But as well as top Tories\u2019 past support for Ulez and pay-per-mile schemes, Labour also pointed to senior Conservatives who have previously backed LTNs. Tory chairman Richard Holden in 2022 said decisions about LTNs should be \u201centirely a matter for local authorities such as Warrington to make\u201d. Meanwhile former transport secretary Grant Shapps touted pop-up bike lanes, wider pavements, cycle and bus only streets as \u201cexamples of what people will start to see more of\u201d under his \u00a3250m Emergency Active Travel Funding plans in May 2020. Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh told The Independent: \u201cThis is rank hypocrisy from a party in total chaos. It has nothing to offer drivers but reheated announcements, gimmicks and broken promises. \u201cThe Conservatives\u2019 abysmal record is there for everyone to see. Britain has 100 times more potholes than craters on the moon and car insurance costs are out-of-control.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh told <em>The Independent </em>the Conservatives\u2019 plan for drivers is \u2018rank hypocrisy from a party in total chaos\u2019</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rishi-sunak-ulez-general-election-b2559450.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/14/SEI207782571.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/lVtmfMyc-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:27:18", "author": "Archie Mitchell", "authors": ["Archie Mitchell"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.007}

Extending the line to Botswana is part of a tripartite project between Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Botswana, which also envisages the construction of a deep water mineral port in the far south of Mozambique.\n\nNyusi mentioned these plans during his speech inaugurating the doubling of the track on the Ressano Garcia line, which links Maputo to South Africa.\n\n\"We are working with our brothers in Zimbabwe so that we can link the Machipanda line to Zimbabwe\", said Nyusi, promising that further discussions between the three countries involved will take place \"in the coming weeks\".\n\nThe Mozambique-Botswana Joint Cooperation Commission met in Maputo on Monday, and at the end of the discussions, Mozambican Foreign Minister Veronica Macamo declared that major advances have been made in bilateral cooperation.\n\nBut clearly the main point under discussion was the projected deep water port in the southernmost Mozambican district of Matutuine. Plans for such a port have been on the drawing board for decades, since they were first mooted in the colonial period.\n\nThe proposed location of the port has shifted, from Dobela Point to Techobanine Point, but the funds for its construction (estimated at 6.5 billion US dollars) are not yet available.\n\nMacamo said a tripartite agreement will be signed in Maputo on Friday \"to encourage the negotiations on the port of Techobanine\".\n\n\"The discussions for the implementation of the project in question are expected to be finalized, taking into account the meeting at the highest level between Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi and his Botswana counterpart (Mokgweetsi Masisi), which will take place on Wednesday this week\", she said.\n\nThe port will be linked to Botswana by a 1,700 kilometre long railway that will also pass through Zimbabwe. The main cargo is expected to be Botswanan coal. There is considerable opposition to a new mineral port on environmental grounds.\n\n\"We have already spoken a great deal about this\", said Macamo, \"but no tripartite agreement on the matter has ever been signed before. This project needs a great deal of synergy and mobilization of resources, and now the three countries are going to collaborate so that the project really does happen\".\n\nIn addition to finalizing discussions on the Techobanine project, memorandums of understanding will be signed in the areas of geology, mining and metallurgy.\n\n\"The conclusion of the negotiations and other legal instruments will be signed during the visit of President Masisi to Mozambique, which will take place between 10 and 12 July\", she said.\n\nMacamo also appreciated the support of the Botswana government in sending a contingent to fight against Islamist terrorists in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, as part of the Southern African Development Community Military Mission to Mozambique (SAMIM).\n\nFor his part, Botswana's Foreign Minister Lemogang Kwape said that his country will continue to support Mozambique in the fight against terrorists in Cabo Delgado, saying that those relations between Botswana and Mozambique are historic and founded on great friendship, solidarity and mutual co-operation.\n\n\"The meeting comes at a time when our countries are facing enormous challenges, such as climate change.

This project needs a great deal of synergy and mobilisation of resources, and now the three countries are going to collaborate so that the project really does happen.\"\n\nIn addition to finalising discussions on the Techobanine project, memorandums of understanding will be signed in the areas of geology, mining and metallurgy.\n\n\"The conclusion of the negotiations and other legal instruments will be signed during the visit of President Masisi to Mozambique, which will take place between July 10 and 12,\" Minister Macamo said.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning of the renovated railway line in Manica, Mozambique, in November last year, President Mnangagwa said not only will the rehabilitated 318km railway line reduce transport costs, but it will also ease congestion at Forbes Border Post in Mutare.\n\nIn January this year, the transport Ministers of Zimbabwe and Mozambique toured Forbes and Machipanda Border Posts. After the tour, Minister Magala said: \"We had an opportunity to discuss and agree on major issues that we need to address in order to have efficient, modern and progressive infrastructure that facilitates trade and integration of our countries. We basically want to open borderless countries because Zimbabwe and Mozambique have a unique history.\n\n\"I am very happy that we managed to agree on what we need to do and stressed the urgency of those actions. One of them is that in the next three months, we want to see the railway line from Machipanda to Mutare operational at highest standards.\n\n\"The second thing is that we want to see the train from Beira to Harare and beyond also happening very soon.\"\n\nRelated posts:\n\nZambia To Seek 'Mediation' For Zimbabwe Diplomatic Row Zambia takes ED to AU, Sadc over diplomatic row Zim, Iran relations

This project, a tripartite effort between Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Botswana, also includes constructing a new deepwater mineral port in southern Mozambique to facilitate the exploitation of Botswana's coal reserves.\n\nFollowing the upgrade of the Beira to Machipanda line, Zimbabwe and Mozambique began refurbishing and extending the railway line from Machipanda to Mutare in May. Mozambique's Transport Minister, Mateus Magala, and Zimbabwe's Transport Minister, Felix Mhona, discussed infrastructure cooperation during a visit in January, coinciding with the commissioning of the upgraded Beira-Machipanda railway line.\n\nPresident Nyusi announced the latest developments while inaugurating the doubling of the track on the Ressano-Garcia line, linking Maputo to South Africa. Zimbabwe's Ambassador to Mozambique, Victor Matemadanda, confirmed the proposal to link the Machipanda line to Zimbabwe, aiming to connect the region through Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Mozambique-Botswana Joint Cooperation Commission met recently, focusing on the projected deepwater port in Matutuine. A tripartite agreement to facilitate negotiations on the Techobanine port, linked to Botswana by a 1,700km railway through Zimbabwe, is expected to be signed soon.

It promises to connect landlocked Botswana to global markets through Mozambique's coastal line.\n\nThis alliance also emphasizes knowledge exchange, which is crucial for leveraging natural resources like Mozambique's oil and gas.\n\nMasisi's visit reiterates a shared history and a forward-looking approach, focusing on concrete outcomes that promise economic growth and stability in the region.\n\nThrough these partnerships, Mozambique and Botswana are not just reshaping their bilateral landscape but also setting a stage for sustainable development in Southern Africa.\n\nThis is a strategic move in a world where economic ties are increasingly pivotal to geopolitical stability and prosperity.", "source": {"uri": "riotimesonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Rio Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokgweetsi_Masisi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mokgweetsi Masisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipe_Nyusi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filipe Nyusi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maputo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maputo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maputo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_African_Development_Community", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern African Development Community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techobanine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Techobanine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landlocked_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landlocked country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural resource"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic Management", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.riotimesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/veronicamac.aim_.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720414", "eventUri": "eng-9720414", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Work on doubling the track took about two years.\n\nOver the past five years, according to Nyusi, the publicly owned ports and rail company, CFM, has invested over 600 million meticais (about 9.4 million dollars, at the current exchange rate) in infrastructures, technical equipment and human resources.\n\nThese investments results in expanding the Ressano Garcia line, and doubling its track. Nyusi said this was in implementation of the government's five year plan form 2019-2024.\n\nHe praised CFM for its achievement, but demanded that the money invested should now result in profits for the company.\n\n\"What makes us proud is that CFM financed the line with its own funds\", he said. \"Our pride will be all the greater when we manage to recover what we have invested\".\n\nDoubling the track on the Ressano Garcia line, he added, \"meets the demands made of the Mozambican port and rail system in recent years by the neighbouring countries, particularly South Africa\".\n\nNyusi believed that one of the advantages of doubling the track will be to ease the pressure on the EN4 motorway between Maputo and South Africa, caused by the road transport of South African minerals to the port of Maputo. He expected much of this traffic to switch from road to rail.\n\nNyusi thought it likely that the increased capacity of the Ressano Garcia line would reduce congestion on the road.\n\nNyusi also inaugurated a new passenger terminal in Maputo Central station, which could triple the daily number of passengers handled by the station, from 25,000 to 75,000.\n\nTransport Minister Mateus Magala said the doubling of the capacity of the Ressano Garcia line, and the new passenger terminal correspond to \"the vision of integrated development of the Maputo Corridor to meet the new challenges facing the country and the region\".\n\nThe two projects cost CFM the equivalent of 98 million US dollars.", "source": {"uri": "clubofmozambique.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mozambique"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressano_Garcia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ressano Garcia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ressano Garcia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique_Ports_and_Railways", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mozambique Ports and Railways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipe_Nyusi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filipe Nyusi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moamba_District", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moamba District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moamba District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maputo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maputo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maputo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Maputo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port of Maputo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maputo_Corridor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maputo Corridor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Road transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Department for Transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mineral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Urban_Transport", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Urban Transport", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://clubofmozambique.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nyusicfmtr.fb_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720414", "eventUri": "eng-9720414", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

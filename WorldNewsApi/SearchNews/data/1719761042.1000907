Jackson explained that the jury will be instructed on the differences between direct evidence and circumstantial evidence and said: \"As to specifically, this other crime, that's a big issue.\"\"I think the criticism was, what is that specific other crime that the prosecutor is talking about,\" Jackson said. \"Is it a tax crime, is it a campaign finance crime, what is it? And so specifically, I think in the instructions the judge will talk about the other crime, what you have to do to get to the other crime and what specifically is a violation as it relates to the other crime.\"The contextTrump's criminal trial is expected to continue on Wednesday with deliberations and jury instructions.Trump was indicted last April with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg saying that the former president \"fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal crimes that hid damaging information\u2014including a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels\u2014from the public during the 2016 presidential campaign.\"Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has continued to deny any wrongdoing in the case, repeatedly calling for it to be dismissed and criticizing Judge Merchan.What We KnowAccording to the New York Times, Bragg has accused Trump of violating campaign finance laws by arranging for the hush money payments to be made to Daniels, who is alleged to have had an affair with the former president.However, Bragg didn't have to explicitly charge Trump with a secondary crime relating to a campaign finance violation, but had to prove to the jury that the former president attempted to \"commit or conceal\" it, the New York Times reported.ViewsOn Tuesday, former White House lawyer Ty Cobb told Semafor that he expects Trump to be found guilty in the case, mainly because of the jury instructions.\"If the jury begins deliberations Tuesday afternoon, expect a verdict no later than Friday afternoon. I expect a 'GUILTY' verdict, but only because the jury instructions as urged by the DA and adopted by the judge, over strenuous and well founded defense objections, virtually require conviction,\" Cobb said to Semafor.What's Next?Newsweek's Katherine Fung, who has been inside the courtroom for Trump's trial, reported on Tuesday that Judge Merchan will be reading jury instructions on Wednesday morning and the court is expected to begin at 10 a.m. local time.Merchan reminded the court that once the instructions are read, no one will be allowed in or out, Fung reported.Newsweek reached out to Trump's spokesperson via email for comment.", "summary": "The former president's trial is expected to continue on Wednesday with jury instructions by Judge Juan Merchan.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-manhattan-criminal-trial-jury-instructions-juan-merchan-1905810", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2400577/donald-trump.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:55:23", "author": "Matthew Impelli", "authors": ["Matthew Impelli"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.309}

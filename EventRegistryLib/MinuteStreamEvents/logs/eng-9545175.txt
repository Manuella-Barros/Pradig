The only scorers for LSG were Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran who scored 55 (30) and 48 (26) respectively.\n\nIt was a thunderstorm as the SRH openers were yet again on a high as Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma chased down the target of 166 runs without losing a wicket and in just 9.4 overs.

LSG is at the sixth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points.\n\nIn the run-chase of 166 runs, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) did not waste any time as openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma attacked right from the start. In just the second over, Abhishek smashed Yash Thakur for four successive boundaries, looting 17 runs from the over.\n\nThe next over was Head's turn to swing his bat, launching Krishnappa Gowtham for three sixes and a four, getting 22 runs from the over.\n\nA massive six over long-on on a Ravi Bishnoi delivery took SRH to the 50-run mark in just 3.1 overs. Head smashed him for a four and then a six over long-off to concluded the fourth over on a high, getting 17 more runs.\n\nThe next over saw Abhishek giving the strike to Head and then the Australian proceeding to tear into Naveen-ul-Haq with 4,4,6,4 and 4. Head reached his half-century, his fourth in the tournament, in 16 balls with five fours and five sixes.\n\nAbhishek ended the powerplay on high, once again targeting Yash with two fours and two sixes and taking SRH to 107/0 at the end of six overs, with Head (58*) and Abhishek (46*) unbeaten. SRH reached the 100-run mark in just 5.4 overs.\n\nAbhishek reached his second fifty in the tournament in 19 balls, with six fours and four sixes.

Pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar made them regret this decision by striking twice in the powerplay. First, in the third over, he removed an out-of-form Quinton de Kock for just two runs in five balls with Nitish Kumar Reddy taking a catch at deep backward square leg.\n\nIn the fifth over, Sanvir took a fine diving catch near mid-on, removing the in-form Marcus Stoinis for just three and giving Bhuvneshwar his second wicket. LSG was 21/2 in 4.2 overs.\n\nSkipper KL Rahul and Krunal Pandya joined forces, getting their team through the remainder of the powerplay. At the end of six overs, LSG was 27/2, with KL (19*) and Krunal (2*) unbeaten.\n\nIn the seventh over bowled by Jaydev Unadkat, Krunal relieved some pressure by smashing him for two sixes and getting his team a total of 15 runs out of it.\n\nBy drilling Cummins for a four towards mid-off, KL brought LSG to the 50-run mark in 9.1 overs. However, at the end of the over, he was dismissed by the SRH captain for a sluggish 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six. T Natrajan took the catch. LSG was 57/3 in 10 overs.\n\nLSG's situation became worse, with Cummins running out Krunal for 24 in 21 balls, with two sixes. LSG was 66/4 in 11.2 overs.\n\nThe 14th over bowled by Natrajan proved to be an expensive over for SRH, with Ayush Badoni hitting him for four boundaries and taking a total of 17 runs from the over.\n\nA boundary from Badoni helped Lucknow reach the 100-run mark in 15 overs. At that point, LSG was 102/4, with Badoni (23*) and Nicholas Pooran (18*) unbeaten.\n\nBadoni continued to pierce through the gaps, mainly targeting Natrajan. He brought up his fourth IPL fifty in 28 balls, with eight fours. At the end of 19 overs, LSG was 146/4, with Badoni (50*) and Pooran (34*) unbeaten.\n\nLSG ended their innings at 165/4 in their 20 overs, with Pooran-Badoni getting 19 runs in the final over. Badoni was unbeaten at 55 in 30 balls, with nine fours while Pooran scored 48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six. Both had a 99-run partnership.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the pick of the bowlers for SRH.

In just the second over, Abhishek smashed Yash Thakur for four successive boundaries, looting 17 runs from the over.\n\nThe next over was Head's turn to swing his bat, launching Krishnappa Gowtham for three sixes and a four, getting 22 runs from the over.\n\nAlso Read | Viyaskanth Vijayakanth Quick Facts: Here's All You Need To Know About Wanindu Hasaranga's Replacement in SRH For IPL 2024.\n\nA massive six over long-on on a Ravi Bishnoi delivery took SRH to the 50-run mark in just 3.1 overs. Head smashed him for a four and then a six over long-off to concluded the fourth over on a high, getting 17 more runs.\n\nThe next over saw Abhishek giving the strike to Head and then the Australian proceeding to tear into Naveen-ul-Haq with 4,4,6,4 and 4. Head reached his half-century, his fourth in the tournament, in 16 balls with five fours and five sixes.\n\nAbhishek ended the powerplay on high, once again targeting Yash with two fours and two sixes and taking SRH to 107/0 at the end of six overs, with Head (58*) and Abhishek (46*) unbeaten. SRH reached the 100-run mark in just 5.4 overs.\n\nAbhishek reached his second fifty in the tournament in 19 balls, with six fours and four sixes.

Pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar made them regret this decision by striking twice in the powerplay. First, in the third over, he removed an out-of-form Quinton de Kock for just two runs in five balls with Nitish Kumar Reddy taking a catch at deep backward square leg.\n\nIn the fifth over, Sanvir took a fine diving catch near mid-on, removing the in-form Marcus Stoinis for just three and giving Bhuvneshwar his second wicket. LSG was 21/2 in 4.2 overs.\n\nSkipper KL Rahul and Krunal Pandya joined forces, getting their team through the remainder of the powerplay. At the end of six overs, LSG was 27/2, with KL (19*) and Krunal (2*) unbeaten.In the seventh over bowled by Jaydev Unadkat, Krunal relieved some pressure by smashing him for two sixes and getting his team a total of 15 runs out of it.\n\nBy drilling Cummins for a four towards mid-off, KL brought LSG to the 50-run mark in 9.1 overs. However, at the end of the over, he was dismissed by the SRH captain for a sluggish 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six. T Natrajan took the catch. LSG was 57/3 in 10 overs.\n\nLSG's situation became worse, with Cummins running out Krunal for 24 in 21 balls, with two sixes. LSG was 66/4 in 11.2 overs.\n\nThe 14th over bowled by Natrajan proved to be an expensive over for SRH, with Ayush Badoni hitting him for four boundaries and taking a total of 17 runs from the over.\n\nA boundary from Badoni helped Lucknow reach the 100-run mark in 15 overs. At that point, LSG was 102/4, with Badoni (23*) and Nicholas Pooran (18*) unbeaten.\n\nBadoni continued to pierce through the gaps, mainly targeting Natrajan. He brought up his fourth IPL fifty in 28 balls, with eight fours. At the end of 19 overs, LSG was 146/4, with Badoni (50*) and Pooran (34*) unbeaten.\n\nLSG ended their innings at 165/4 in their 20 overs, with Pooran-Badoni getting 19 runs in the final over. Badoni was unbeaten at 55 in 30 balls, with nine fours while Pooran scored 48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six. Both had a 99-run partnership.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the pick of the bowlers for SRH. Cummins (1/47) also got a wicket.\n\nBrief Scores: Lucknow Super Giants: 165/4 (Ayush Badoni 55*, Nicholas Pooran 48, Bhuvneshwar Kumar 2/12) lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad: 167/0 in 9.4 overs (Travis Head 89*, Abhishek Sharma 75*).

The 57th match of the Indian Premier League 2024 (IPL 2024) was held at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\n\nSRH were invited to bowl first in the match and the bowlers did a fantastic job by restricting LSG to 165/4. Chasing the target, SRH openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma came out all guns blazing and demolished the LSG bowling attack. Head slammed 89 runs in 30 balls while Abhishek Sharma blasted 75 runs in 28 balls to complete the run chase inside 9.4 overs.\n\nAt the post-match presentation ceremony, Pat Cummins said that the duo of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma changed the pitch with their batting. Pat Cummins said:\n\n\"(On did he change the pitch) Maybe Travis and Abhishek did. We just let them go, they are two guys who are very positive and I'm a bowler, it is tough for me to give them any inputs.\"\n\nWhile speaking about Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, Pat Cummins said that both of them are incredible players and bowling against them is very hard. He stated:\n\n\"(On Travis Head) He's been like this for 2 years, he hits the tough areas, hits the middle a lot, might not be super conventional. (On Abhishek Sharma) Just an incredible player of spin and pace. With just 2 fielders out, it is really difficult for the bowlers against them.\"\n\nPat Cummins further said that the par scores in T20 cricket have increased and with the wickets being batting-friendly, the job has become tough for bowlers. Pat Cummins asserted:\n\n\"(On where the game is headed) I think the scores have gone up, and when the wickets are good, it is tough to come up with answers against batters when they get going. The boys have had a fantastic season, but to win this with less than 10 overs played is unreal.\"\n\nLucknow Super Giants and Sunrisers Hyderabad faced off each other for the first time on April 4, 2022, at the Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, Mumbai. Batting first, KL Rahul (68) and Deepak Hooda (51) smashed half-centuries and took LSG to 169 for 7. Chasing the target, only two SRH batters - Rahul Tripathi (44) and Nicholas Pooran (34) - breached the 30-run mark and they were restricted to 157/9, losing by 12 runs.\n\nIn Indian Premier 2023, LSG and SRH locked horns with each other twice and the Lucknow-based franchise won both matches. On April 7, SRH batters showcased a poor performance at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow and only registered 121/8 in the first innings.

Nice to get this done in 10 overs. Abhi (Abhishek Sharma) and I have had a few partnerships like this. Just concentrate on getting in good positions, watch the ball hard and try to maximise the powerplay. It is something I have been working on (spin-hitting), it will be a big part of the Caribbean as well. It is important to go 360 in the modern game. The last 12 months, that is how they wanted me to play in the Aussie team, and that is what I have been told to do here as well.\"\n\nPraising his opening partner Abhishek for his hard work and \"deep thinking\", Head said that the uncapped Indian star's spin play is \"second to none\".\n\nAlso Read | Viyaskanth Vijayakanth Quick Facts: Here's All You Need To Know About Wanindu Hasaranga's Replacement in SRH For IPL 2024.\n\n\"We complement each other very well. We didn't think about it till the Timeout, but after that, the boys came out and told us to score quickly. The crowd was exceptional tonight, that is what we needed after losing the last two. I haven't got many things over him, so that is good to know that I have more runs than David Warner did in his first SRH season,\" he concluded.\n\nComing to the match, LSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six.\n\nIn the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55* in 30 balls, with nine fours) and Nicholas Pooran (48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six) turned things around with a 99-run stand, putting a score of 165/4 in 20 overs for LSG.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the top bowler for LSG. Pat Cummins also got a wicket.\n\nIn the run-chase of 166 runs, openers Travis Head (89* in 30 balls, with eight fours and eight sixes) and Abhishek Sharma (75* in 28 balls, with eight fours and six sixes) launched what seemed like a never-ending assault on LSG batters, helping SRH chase down the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket.\n\nSRH is at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points. LSG is in the sixth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points.

SRH is at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points. LSG is at the sixth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points.\n\nIn the run-chase of 166 runs, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) did not waste any time as openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma attacked right from the start. In just the second over, Abhishek smashed Yash Thakur for four successive boundaries, looting 17 runs from the over. The next over was Head's turn to swing his bat, launching Krishnappa Gowtham for three sixes and a four, getting 22 runs from the over.\n\nA massive six over long-on on a Ravi Bishnoi delivery took SRH to the 50-run mark in just 3.1 overs. Head smashed him for a four and then a six over long-off to concluded the fourth over on a high, getting 17 more runs. The next over saw Abhishek giving the strike to Head and then the Australian proceeding to tear into Naveen-ul-Haq with 4,4,6,4 and 4. Head reached his half-century, his fourth in the tournament, in 16 balls with five fours and five sixes.\n\nAbhishek ended the powerplay on high, once again targeting Yash with two fours and two sixes and taking SRH to 107/0 at the end of six overs, with Head (58*) and Abhishek (46*) unbeaten. SRH reached the 100-run mark in just 5.4 overs. Abhishek reached his second fifty in the tournament in 19 balls, with six fours and four sixes. Ayush Badoni's first over did turn out to be good, as he gave away 19 runs, including two sixes and a four, all by Abhishek.\n\nSRH brought up their 150-run in 8.2 overs, with Head (85* in 27 balls) and Abhishek 63* in 23 balls) unbeaten. SRH ended their run-chase in less than 10 overs, finishing at 167/0 in 9.4 overs, with Head (89* in 30 balls, with eight fours and eight sixes) and Abhishek (75* in 28 balls, with eight fours and six sixes).\n\nEarlier, a fine half-century from Ayush Badoni and his partnership with Nicholas Pooran helped Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) reach a modest total of 165/4 in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad on Wednesday. LSG needs to defend 166 runs to get their seventh win of the tournament.\n\nAfter winning the toss, LSG opted to bat first. Pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar made them regret this decision by striking twice in the powerplay. First, in the third over, he removed an out-of-form Quinton de Kock for just two runs in five balls with Nitish Kumar Reddy taking a catch at deep backward square leg. In the fifth over, Sanvir took a fine diving catch near mid-on, removing the in-form Marcus Stoinis for just three and giving Bhuvneshwar his second wicket. LSG was 21/2 in 4.2 overs.\n\nSkipper KL Rahul and Krunal Pandya joined forces, getting their team through the remainder of the powerplay. At the end of six overs, LSG was 27/2, with KL (19*) and Krunal (2*) unbeaten.In the seventh over bowled by Jaydev Unadkat, Krunal relieved some pressure by smashing him for two sixes and getting his team a total of 15 runs out of it. By drilling Cummins for a four towards mid-off, KL brought LSG to the 50-run mark in 9.1 overs. However, at the end of the over, he was dismissed by the SRH captain for a sluggish 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six. T Natrajan took the catch. LSG was 57/3 in 10 overs.\n\nLSG's situation became worse, with Cummins running out Krunal for 24 in 21 balls, with two sixes. LSG was 66/4 in 11.2 overs. The 14th over bowled by Natrajan proved to be an expensive over for SRH, with Ayush Badoni hitting him for four boundaries and taking a total of 17 runs from the over.\n\nA boundary from Badoni helped Lucknow reach the 100-run mark in 15 overs. At that point, LSG was 102/4, with Badoni (23*) and Nicholas Pooran (18*) unbeaten. Badoni continued to pierce through the gaps, mainly targeting Natrajan. He brought up his fourth IPL fifty in 28 balls, with eight fours. At the end of 19 overs, LSG was 146/4, with Badoni (50*) and Pooran (34*) unbeaten.\n\nLSG ended their innings at 165/4 in their 20 overs, with Pooran-Badoni getting 19 runs in the final over. Badoni was unbeaten at 55 in 30 balls, with nine fours while Pooran scored 48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six. Both had a 99-run partnership. Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the pick of the bowlers for SRH. Cummins (1/47) also got a wicket.\n\nBrief Scores: Lucknow Super Giants: 165/4 (Ayush Badoni 55*, Nicholas Pooran 48, Bhuvneshwar Kumar 2/12) lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad: 167/0 in 9.4 overs (Travis Head 89*, Abhishek Sharma 75*).

AP\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) are back doing Sunrisers Hyderabad things in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Not only did they thump Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) by 10 wickets on Wednesday, but also dashed Mumbai Indians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (MI) hopes of making the IPL playoffs as Hardik Pandya and Co became the first team to be eliminated from the IPL this season.\n\nTravis Head, Abhishek Sharma dominate proceedings yet again\n\nSRH have made a name for themselves by being dominant bowlers on their home turf at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad. The Pat Cummins-led outfit have won three out of their four matches at the venue this season so far, with their only defeat coming against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on 25 April.\n\nAlso read | SRH shatter records in rapid run-chase against LSG\n\nThat was while chasing, as they eventually lost by 35 runs, and while the Orange Army aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t known to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chase masters\u00e2\u20ac in the IPL as far as this season is concerned, Travis Head (89*) and Abhishek Sharma (75*) proved otherwise on Wednesday. The famed SRH opening duo have batted on their terms throughout the season with some free-flowing performances, and it was something similar on Wednesday against a hapless LSG bowling lineup.\n\nOn a rather slow wicket to bat on in Hyderabad, LSG did exactly that after they won the toss. And that backfired early on, with dismissals of Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis as Bhuvneshwar Kumar struck twice in the powerplay. KL Rahul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strike-rate was once again under scrutiny after hitting just one four and one six in a 33-ball knock of 29. Hitting at a strike-rate of below 100 is far from ideal in a T20 and Rahul was undone by the length balls and inswingers that Bhuvneshwar kept producing.\n\nThe LSG captain was dismissed by Pat Cummins in the 10th over after he holed out to T Natarajan at long leg.\n\nLSG were 57/3 at that stage and were further restricted to 66/4 in the 12th following Krunal Pandya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wicket. What followed, however, was a valiant fightback from Nicholas Pooran (48*) and Ayush Badoni (55*), who put on an unbeaten 99 runs off 52 deliveries for the fifth wicket. Lucknow eventually managed to post 165/4, a total that Badoni felt bowlers could defend if there was no dew on offer.\n\nAs Badoni predicted, there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much dew. But, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, the ever-dependable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Travishek\u00e2\u20ac opening duo, defied the odds. Hoping that spinners would be of good use on the slower surface against SRH, Rahul turned to off-break bowler Krishnappa Gowtham to begin the bowling attack.\n\nThe first over was largely a disciplined one from Gowtham, barring a boundary off Head in the last ball of that over. However, in just his second over, the all-rounder would get bashed for some merciless boundaries from the Australia big-hitter. Head began with a maximum over the bowler, before slamming a couple more sixes towards the sightscreen later in the over. A total of 22 runs had come off the 35-year-old\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second over and added to Lucknow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s misery as SRH rushed to 47/0 in just three overs.\n\nAbhishek Sharma, meanwhile, had begun his assault even before. In the second over, when he hit four fours off Yash Thakur. The 50-run stand between Abhishek and Head came in less than four overs, courtesy of a maximum from the former over long-on. To be exact, the half-century run partnership came off just 19 balls, the same amount of deliveries Abhishek got to his fifty.\n\nDot balls were hard to come by for Lucknow and the innings appeared as of a highlights package. Just 14 dot balls were bowled during these 9.4 overs that SRH took to finish the match as Abhishek and Head got going and compelled the bowlers to dance to their tunes.\n\nAnd just like that, SRH got to 107 inside the powerplay without losing a wicket. That was the second-highest powerplay total this IPL after SRH\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 125/0 against Delhi Capitals (DC) earlier. LSG also missed pacer Mohsin Khan due to a head injury and that hurt their chances big time. In only his first over, Naveen-ul-Haq went for 23 runs as he bowled the fifth over of the chase. SRH were more than halfway through, having reached 87/0 by then. Ravi Bishnoi also got punished by both the openers for regular boundaries.\n\nThe heavy defeat left skipper KL Rahul clueless. \"Am lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on tv. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six-hitting skills. They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one,\" Rahul said after the match, adding that the visitors were at least \"40-50 runs\" short.\n\nThe loss leaves LSG with more work left to be done in order to qualify for the playoffs. Two victories in their last two matches would only take them to 16 point s, which may not be enough given that Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have an extra game in hand.\n\nCSK (Fourth, 12 points) DC (Fifth, 12 points) and LSG (Sixth, 12 points) are in a tight contest for possibly the fourth playoff spot, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess as to who among the three teams would go through.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

( Image Source :PTI )\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) defeated Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) by 10 wickets in the 57th match of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) season 2024 as they chased the target of 166 runs set by LSG in just 9.4 overs. Travis Head achieved a 50 from just 16 balls, while Abhishek Sharma reached his half-century in 19 balls, leading SRH to a stunning victory over Lucknow. With the win, SRH now move to the third spot in the IPL 2024 points table.\n\nAfter winning the toss, LSG captain KL Rahul opted to bat first. Hyderabad's Bhuvneshwar Kumar delivered an early blow to Lucknow as he took the wicket of Quinton de Kock on the very first ball of his second and team's third over. He claimed another crucial wicket in the form of Marcus Stoinis in the fifth over of the innings. From there on, LSG looked like they were withering away as SRH had them at 69-4 after 12 overs. However, Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran revived LSG's innings and fought back well. They made sure that they got past the 150-mark as LSG posted the total of 165-4 in 20 overs.\n\nTravis Head & Abhishek Sharma Show!\n\nThere was some chatter around how the pitch looked a bit slowish as Ayush Badoni in the post-innings talk with the official live-streaming partners of the iPL talked about it. However, all of that was put aside when Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma came out to bat for Sunrisers.\n\nHead and Abhishek scored eight runs in the first over of their batting innings and that was the least they scored in the innings as they went on to score more than 14 runs in every other over until they chased down the target pof 166 runs in just 9.4 overs. Travis Head finished with the score of 89* off just 30 balls with eight sixes and eight fours.

I think the scores have gone up, and when the wickets are good, it is tough to come up with answers against batters when they get going. The boys have had a fantastic season, but to win this with less than 10 overs played is unreal.\"\n\nComing to the match, LSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in the first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six.\n\nIn the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55* in 30 balls, with nine fours) and Nicholas Pooran (48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six) turned things around with a 99-run stand, putting a score of 165/4 in 20 overs for LSG.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the top bowler for LSG.

LSG is at the sixth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points.\n\nHead took home the 'Player of the Match' award.

LSG is at the sixth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points.\n\nIn the run-chase of 166 runs, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) did not waste any time as openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma attacked right from the start. In just the second over, Abhishek smashed Yash Thakur for four successive boundaries, looting 17 runs from the over.\n\nThe next over was Head's turn to swing his bat, launching Krishnappa Gowtham for three sixes and a four, getting 22 runs from the over.\n\nA massive six over long-on on a Ravi Bishnoi delivery took SRH to the 50-run mark in just 3.1 overs. Head smashed him for a four and then a six over long-off to concluded the fourth over on a high, getting 17 more runs.\n\nThe next over saw Abhishek giving the strike to Head and then the Australian proceeding to tear into Naveen-ul-Haq with 4,4,6,4 and 4. Head reached his half-century, his fourth in the tournament, in 16 balls with five fours and five sixes.\n\nAbhishek ended the powerplay on high, once again targeting Yash with two fours and two sixes and taking SRH to 107/0 at the end of six overs, with Head (58*) and Abhishek (46*) unbeaten. SRH reached the 100-run mark in just 5.4 overs.\n\nAbhishek reached his second fifty in the tournament in 19 balls, with six fours and four sixes. Ayush Badoni's first over did turn out to be good, as he gave away 19 runs, including two sixes and a four, all by Abhishek.\n\nSRH brought up their 150-run in 8.2 overs, with Head (85* in 27 balls) and Abhishek 63* in 23 balls) unbeaten.\n\nSRH ended their run-chase in less than 10 overs, finishing at 167/0 in 9.4 overs, with Head (89* in 30 balls, with eight fours and eight sixes) and Abhishek (75* in 28 balls, with eight fours and six sixes).\n\nEarlier, a fine half-century from Ayush Badoni and his partnership with Nicholas Pooran helped Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) reach a modest total of 165/4 in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad on Wednesday.\n\nLSG needs to defend 166 runs to get their seventh win of the tournament.\n\nAfter winning the toss, LSG opted to bat first. Pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar made them regret this decision by striking twice in the powerplay. First, in the third over, he removed an out-of-form Quinton de Kock for just two runs in five balls with Nitish Kumar Reddy taking a catch at deep backward square leg.\n\nIn the fifth over, Sanvir took a fine diving catch near mid-on, removing the in-form Marcus Stoinis for just three and giving Bhuvneshwar his second wicket. LSG was 21/2 in 4.2 overs.\n\nSkipper KL Rahul and Krunal Pandya joined forces, getting their team through the remainder of the powerplay. At the end of six overs, LSG was 27/2, with KL (19*) and Krunal (2*) unbeaten.\n\nIn the seventh over bowled by Jaydev Unadkat, Krunal relieved some pressure by smashing him for two sixes and getting his team a total of 15 runs out of it.\n\nBy drilling Cummins for a four towards mid-off, KL brought LSG to the 50-run mark in 9.1 overs. However, at the end of the over, he was dismissed by the SRH captain for a sluggish 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six. T Natrajan took the catch. LSG was 57/3 in 10 overs.\n\nLSG's situation became worse, with Cummins running out Krunal for 24 in 21 balls, with two sixes. LSG was 66/4 in 11.2 overs.\n\nThe 14th over bowled by Natrajan proved to be an expensive over for SRH, with Ayush Badoni hitting him for four boundaries and taking a total of 17 runs from the over.\n\nA boundary from Badoni helped Lucknow reach the 100-run mark in 15 overs. At that point, LSG was 102/4, with Badoni (23*) and Nicholas Pooran (18*) unbeaten.\n\nBadoni continued to pierce through the gaps, mainly targeting Natrajan. He brought up his fourth IPL fifty in 28 balls, with eight fours. At the end of 19 overs, LSG was 146/4, with Badoni (50*) and Pooran (34*) unbeaten.\n\nLSG ended their innings at 165/4 in their 20 overs, with Pooran-Badoni getting 19 runs in the final over. Badoni was unbeaten at 55 in 30 balls, with nine fours while Pooran scored 48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six. Both had a 99-run partnership.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the pick of the bowlers for SRH. Cummins (1/47) also got a wicket.\n\nBrief Scores: Lucknow Super Giants: 165/4 (Ayush Badoni 55*, Nicholas Pooran 48, Bhuvneshwar Kumar 2/12) lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad: 167/0 in 9.4 overs (Travis Head 89*, Abhishek Sharma 75*).

Sunrisers Hyderabad openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma smashed Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) bowlers to the pulp, registering a ten-wicket victory and chasing down the target of 166 runs in just 9.4 overs in their Indian Premier League (IPL) game at Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Head said in the post-match presentation, \"Had a lot of fun today. Nice to get this done in 10 overs. Abhi (Abhishek Sharma) and I have had a few partnerships like this. Just concentrate on getting in good positions, watch the ball hard and try to maximise the powerplay. It is something I have been working on (spin-hitting), it will be a big part of the Caribbean as well. It is important to go 360 in the modern game. The last 12 months, that is how they wanted me to play in the Aussie team, and that is what I have been told to do here as well.\" Praising his opening partner Abhishek for his hard work and \"deep thinking\", Head said that the uncapped Indian star's spin play is \"second to none\".\n\n\"We complement each other very well. We didn't think about it till the Timeout, but after that, the boys came out and told us to score quickly. The crowd was exceptional tonight, that is what we needed after losing the last two. I haven't got many things over him, so that is good to know that I have more runs than David Warner did in his first SRH season,\" he concluded. Coming to the match, LSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six.\n\nIn the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55* in 30 balls, with nine fours) and Nicholas Pooran (48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six) turned things around with a 99-run stand, putting a score of 165/4 in 20 overs for LSG. Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the top bowler for LSG. Pat Cummins also got a wicket.\n\nIn the run-chase of 166 runs, openers Travis Head (89* in 30 balls, with eight fours and eight sixes) and Abhishek Sharma (75* in 28 balls, with eight fours and six sixes) launched what seemed like a never-ending assault on LSG batters, helping SRH chase down the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket. SRH is at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points. LSG is in the sixth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points.

After the match, a video from the animated discussion has been doing the rounds on the internet in which franchise owner Sanjiv Goenka is seen talking to Lucknow skipper KL Rahul near the LSG dugout.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) destroyed the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), dominating them with the new ball and then chasing the target of 166 in 9.4 overs without losing a wicket in the IPL match played on Wednesday. It was the fastest 10-over score in T20. Speaking about the video at an event in Delhi, Lee said the conversation should have happened behind the doors.\n\n\"It gets tough as a team owner, as a captain and a coach. You try to do the best you can. When yesterday, LSG made 160-odd and SRH blew them away without losing a wicket, people are going to ask you questions. But there is a time and place. There is a place behind closed doors that would have been a better option, rather than the whole world watching. On the other side, you look at the passion of owners and coaches for their team, they want them to do well.\" Though KL has helped the team win matches with his captaincy tactics, his strike rate has been under the scanner this season. In 12 matches, he has scored 460 runs at an average of 38.33 and a strike rate of just over 136, with three half-centuries. His best score is 82.\n\nAfter the match, Rahul said he was at a loss for words for the Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma's blitzkrieg hitting. \"Am lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six-hitting skills,\" Rahul said.\n\nThe loss was LSG's sixth in the IPL 2024, and because of the wide margin of defeat, it damaged their net run rate as well. They are currently ranked sixth after falling below Delhi Capitals. LSG elected to bat first after winning the toss.

While RCB came into the game on the back of a three-match winning streak, Punjab had lost their previous match to the Chennai Super Kings, chasing a mere 168 in Dharamsala.\n\nMeanwhile. Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH)'s Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma chased down 166 in 9.4 overs on Wednesday, May 8 against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). As a result of their 10-wicket win, SRH now has a major boost in net run rate. At the top of the game, Ayush Badoni starred with a feisty half-century as he, with the help of Nicholas Pooran guided LSG to 165/4 against SRH. Lucknow Super Giants captain KL Rahul won the toss and opted to bat first against Sunrisers Hyderabad. Both teams made 2 changes each with Sanvir Singh coming in for Mayank Agarwal and Vijayakanth Viyaskanth making his debut in place of Marco Jansen for SRH.\n\nMore updates from the SRH vs LSG game. Having lost the game against SRH, LSG's chances of making it to the playoffs were firmly squashed on Wednesday, May 8. After the game ended, cameras caught a slice of interaction between LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka and Indian cricketer KL Rahul, who is also the captain of the LSG franchise. While not much is known of what was being said between the two, Goenka looked animated while Rahul coolly heard him out.\n\nMoving on. In the match played on May 8 against Lucknow Super Giants, the Sunrisers have gone past 100 in the Powerplay for the second time this season. There was no respite no matter what was bowled at them as everything seemed destined for the stands. With Hyderabad showing its slowest surface so far this season, the ball appeared to be taking an age to reach the batsmen. As a result, the Lucknow Super Giants top order struggled to score quickly in comparison to the SRH openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma.\n\nLSG skipper KL Rahul spoke to the media after the game his side played against SRH on May 8. It was a comprehensive victory for the home team, one that rendered the opposition skipper KL Rahul lost for words in the post-match recap. Speaking to broadcasters he said: \"We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills.\" The Lucknow Super Giants captain didn't shy away from accepting that nothing they tried worked on the duo, adding that Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma did not allow LSG to know what the pitch played in the second innings.\n\nMoving on. Senior members of the struggling Indian Premier League side Mumbai Indians have questioned the functioning of the team under captain Hardik Pandya. An MI official told the Indian Express that this wasn't a leadership crisis but more of a sign that a team that was used to Rohit's captaincy for the last 10 years was still coming to terms with the change of guard. The source also added: \"These are regular teething problems for a team that sees leadership change. This happens in sports all the time.\" Former Australia captain Michael Clarke went to the extent of saying that the franchise seems to be divided into factions.\n\nHere's a points table update. The Sunrisers Hyderabad kept their play-off chances alive after they demolished the Lucknow Super Giants by 10 wickets, chasing down a target of 166 in just 9.4 overs. On the other hand, The Delhi Capitals (DC) kept themselves alive in the Playoffs race with a 20-run win over Rajasthan Royals (RR) at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi on Tuesday, May 7. RR, KKR, CSK and SRH are the four sides that are currently in the top four. The top four teams will qualify for the IPL 2024 playoffs. The top two teams will play in the first Qualifier with the winner going straight into the final.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

LSG opened their bowling with Krishnappa Gowtham and Yash Thakur expectedly, but SRH got off to a flyer.\n\nTravis hits Gowtham for 22 runs followed by Abhishek taking four fours off Thakur.\n\nThe hitting never stopped even after the fifties, as both batters were on a destructive mode to help SRH chase down the target in less than 10 overs.\n\nHead smashed a half-century and this time in just 16 balls. It was some astonishing hitting from Head, who was just picking his spots and sending them there no matter where the ball is pitched, no matter the pace. One of the incredible was a back-foot off-drive off Ravi Bishnoi for a huge six over long-off.\n\nThen there was a swat down the wicket straight of mid-off off Naveen-ul-Haq. He was 58 off 18 now, and went past 500 for the tournament, and also had hit the most fours in this IPL. SRH were 87 for 0 in five overs. That was four times what LSG were at this point.\n\nIn all T20 cricket, only seven times have 100 or more been scored in the powerplay, SRH have the top two scores, both in this year of IPL. It seemed slow by comparison, but Abhishek Sharma reached his fifty in 19 balls with a straight six off Ayush Badoni as SRH reached 120 for 0 in 6.3 overs.\n\nAs many as 14 sixes and 16 fours were hit in the chase which meant every second ball reached the boundary.\n\nEarlier, Bhuvneshwar Kumar led the way with figures of 4-0-12-2, conceding only in denominations of one, completely shutting down the LSG top order, which scored just 66 in the first 11.2 overs. The unbeaten 99-run stand between Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran guided LSG to a respectable total.\n\nBrief score:\n\nLucknow Super Giants 165 for 4 in 20 overs (Ayush Badoni 55 not out, Nicholas Pooran 48 not out; Bhuvneshwar Kumar 2-12, Pat Cummins 1-47) lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad 167 for 0 in 9.4 overs (Travis Head 89 not out, Abhishek Sharma 75) by ten wickets\n\nMumbai Indians Knocked Out\n\nThe five-time champions Mumbai Indians get knocked out from the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 after Sunrisers Hyderabad thrashed Lucknow Super Giants by ten wickets, here at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, on Wednesday.\n\nThe Hardik Pandya-led side has only won four games out of 12 thus far, falling short of expectations. Even if MI wins their next two games, they will only have 12 points after eight losses already.\n\nBut SRH's victory ensured they advanced to 14 points in the standings. With DC and LSG set to face on May 14, one of the two would also get 14 points which means MI will not be able to make the cut.\n\nDue to the fact that the loser will be eliminated from the competition, the PBKS vs RCB match is now a \"do or die\" situation for both sides.\n\nEarlier, Travis Head hammered 30 balls 89 and Abhishek Sharma slammed 75 off 38 as Sunrisers Hyderabad thrashed Lucknow Super Giants by ten wickets and chased down the target of 166 runs in just 9.4 overs at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, here on Wednesday night.", "source": {"uri": "asianlite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local News for British Asian and Indian Community in London"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Thakur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yash Thakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnappa_Gowtham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Krishnappa Gowtham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bishnoi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naveen-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://asianlite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IPL_SRH_VS_LSG_083.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 3081, "textEnd": 3087}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

It was the fastest 10-over score in T20.\n\nSpeaking about the video at an event in Delhi, Lee said the conversation should have happened behind the doors.\n\n\"It gets tough as a team owner, as a captain and a coach. You try to do the best you can. When yesterday, LSG made 160-odd and SRH blew them away without losing a wicket, people are going to ask you questions. But there is a time and place.

He will instrumental if SRH hope to keep LSG batters quiet after the powerplay.\n\nPlayer to watch out for in Lucknow Super Giants: Marcus Stoinis has been devastating against pace attacks this season: he averages 105 against them at a strike rate of 161.54 with 23 fours and eight sixes. Overall, Stoinis has scored 126 runs from 11 games in IPL 2024.\n\nSRH vs LSG head-to-head stats\n\nMatches played: 3, Sunrisers Hyderabad won: 0, Lucknow Super Giants won: 3\n\nSquads:\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad Squad: Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Nitish Reddy, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan, Sanvir Singh, Mayank Markande, Glenn Phillips, Jaydev Unadkat, Umran Malik, Aiden Markram, Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar, Anmolpreet Singh, Upendra Yadav, Jhatavedh Subramanyan, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Akash Maharaj Singh.\n\nLucknow Super Giants Squad: KL Rahul (c & wk), Arshin Kulkarni, Marcus Stoinis, Deepak Hooda, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Ashton Turner, Krunal Pandya, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-Haq, Yash Thakur, Mohsin Khan, Manimaran Siddharth, Krishnappa Gowtham, Devdutt Padikkal, Amit Mishra, Kyle Mayers, Quinton de Kock, Matt Henry, Prerak Mankad, Arshad Khan, Shamar Joseph.\n\nSRH vs LSG Pitch Report\n\nThe pitches at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad have been extremely good for batting in recent times, starting from the ODI World Cup late last year.

We kind of complement each other. He is very very enjoyable to be around. He is very very excited and thinks about the game,\" Head said at a post-match press conference.\n\nThe powerplay, a phase of the match the Sunrisers have dominated in the tournament so far, set the stage for this victory. They scored an incredible 107 runs during the powerplay overs, practically snuffing out any hopes of a comeback that Lucknow may have entertained and took their team to within a touching distance of the target in under 10 overs.\n\nThe persistent and ferocious assault by the SRH openers was simply too much for the LSG bowlers to handle.\n\nAfter posting a reasonable and fighting target of 167 on the board, the Sunrisers, riding on the exploits of the opening duo, cantered home in just 9.4 overs. The fireworks by the willow-wielders yet again reaffirmed the team's formidable batting lineup, which is arguably among the most feared this ongoing IPL season.\n\n\"Yeah, very happy with how we operate in power play and also glad to see how we scored runs outside of power play today. At time out we spoke about NRR (Net Run Rate) being important. Very pleased that checked out,\" he added.\n\nLSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got off to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in the first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six.\n\nIn the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55* in 30 balls, with nine fours) and Nicholas Pooran (48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six) turned things around with a 99-run stand, putting a score of 165/4 in 20 overs for LSG.\n\nIn the run-chase of 166 runs, openers Travis Head (89* in 30 balls, with eight fours and eight sixes) and Abhishek Sharma (75* in 28 balls, with eight fours and six sixes) launched what seemed like a never-ending assault on LSG batters, helping SRH chase down the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket.\n\nSRH is at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points.

LSG opened their bowling with Krishnappa Gowtham and Yash Thakur expectedly, but SRH got off to a flyer.\n\nTravis hits Gowtham for 22 runs followed by Abhishek taking four fours off Thakur.\n\nThe hitting never stopped even after the fifties, as both batters were on a destructive mode to help SRH chase down the target in less than 10 overs.\n\nHead smashed a half-century and this time in just 16 balls. It was some astonishing hitting from Head, who was just picking his spots and sending them there no matter where the ball is pitched, no matter the pace. One of the incredible was a back-foot off-drive off Ravi Bishnoi for a huge six over long-off.\n\nThen there was a swat down the wicket straight of mid-off off Naveen-ul-Haq. He was 58 off 18 now, and went past 500 for the tournament, and also had hit the most fours in this IPL. SRH were 87 for 0 in five overs. That was four times what LSG were at this point.\n\nIn all T20 cricket, only seven times have 100 or more been scored in the powerplay, SRH have the top two scores, both in this year of IPL. It seemed slow by comparison, but Abhishek Sharma reached his fifty in 19 balls with a straight six off Ayush Badoni as SRH reached 120 for 0 in 6.3 overs.\n\nAs many as 14 sixes and 16 fours were hit in the chase which meant every second ball reached the boundary.\n\nEarlier, Bhuvneshwar Kumar led the way with figures of 4-0-12-2, conceding only in denominations of one, completely shutting down the LSG top order, which scored just 66 in the first 11.2 overs. The unbeaten 99-run stand between Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran guided LSG to a respectable total.\n\nBrief score:\n\nLucknow Super Giants 165 for 4 in 20 overs (Ayush Badoni 55 not out, Nicholas Pooran 48 not out; Bhuvneshwar Kumar 2-12, Pat Cummins 1-47) lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad 167 for 0 in 9.4 overs (Travis Head 89 not out, Abhishek Sharma 75) by ten wickets", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnappa_Gowtham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Krishnappa Gowtham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bishnoi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naveen-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?url=IPL+2024%3A+Travis+Head%2C+Abhishek+Sharma+shine+as+SRH+thrash+LSG+by+ten+wickets", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 16}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Despite Skipper KL Rahul's efforts to stabilize the innings with a modest 29-run contribution, it was Nicholas Pooran and Ayush Badoni who provided the real fireworks. Pooran remained unbeaten with a scorching 48 off 26 deliveries, while Badoni played an electrifying knock of 55 runs off just 30 balls. Despite their strong efforts, LSG managed to post a competitive total of 165/4 in their allotted 20 overs.\n\nSRH's bowling unit demonstrated discipline, led by Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who claimed two crucial wickets while conceding a mere 12 runs in his four overs. Pat Cummins also contributed with a wicket, albeit conceding 47 runs during his spell.\n\nIn pursuit of 166 runs, SRH openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head launched a relentless assault on the LSG bowlers. Travis Head played a remarkable innings, finishing unbeaten on 89 off just 30 balls, displaying exceptional hitting prowess with eight fours and eight sixes. Abhishek Sharma complemented him perfectly with an explosive knock of 75 runs off only 28 deliveries, smashing eight fours and six sixes. Together, they dismantled the LSG bowling attack, guiding SRH to victory without losing a single wicket.\n\nAfter the match, KL Rahul praised the extraordinary batting display by Sunrisers Hyderabad, expressing awe at their remarkable skill and ability to consistently find the middle of the bat. He acknowledged the relentless six-hitting prowess of the opposition and admitted the challenge they posed from the very start. Rahul admitted that being on the losing side raises questions about decision-making and acknowledged that his team fell short by 40-50 runs.\n\n\"Am lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on tv. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills. They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one. Once you are on the losing side, there are questions marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum. Ayush and Nicky batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well,\" Rahul said during the post-match presentation.\n\nAlso Read: Watch: Pat Cummins celebrates birthday with father and SRH teammates, video goes viral\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad will face Gujarat Titans in their upcoming match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad on May 16th, while Lucknow Super Giants will take on Delhi Capitals on May 14th at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_de_Kock", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quinton de Kock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

The winning team of the SRH vs LSG clash will take one team near the playoffs, while the other one will find them in a tough situation.\n\nLucknow haven't cracked the code of scoring freely in the powerplay of the IPL 2024. Their 134.09 strike rate in the first six overs of the tournament sits at the penultimate position, while Sunrisers Hyderabad are way ahead of them, at the top of the ladder with a strike rate of 176.77.\n\nHyderabad have lost 17 wickets, but that's quite acceptable given how fast they have been scoring so far inside the powerplay, going into the SRH vs LSG clash. On the other hand, Lucknow, even with a low economy rate have lost 18 wickets in the period, which has made it tough for them in the middle overs.\n\nHyderabad have nailed 41 sixes in the period, which sounds quite crazy especially in just 11 innings, while on the other hand, Lucknow have managed half of those sixes (20) in the first six overs.\n\nAmong those who have faced at least 100 balls in the powerplay, Travis Head has the best strike rate (208.28) with three fifties, while for Lucknow, their captain KL Rahul has struggled in this time frame for his 138.32 strike rate in 11 innings, going into the SRH vs LSG face-off.\n\nAlso Read: IPL 2024: \"It Is Evolving\" - KL Rahul Makes U-Turn On His 'Strike Rate Is Overrated' Statement Amid Gavaskar-Kohli Row\n\nIn the same category, Head also has smashed the most runs (327) in this period in 10 innings, whereas Rahul has the 10th most runs (231) in the duration. In the last game against KKR, Rahul's 21-ball 25-run knock was one of the reasons behind the failure of the Lucknow side.\n\nThe 57th affair of the IPL 2024 between the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) will take place at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, in Hyderabad on May 08, 2024, at 7:30 pm IST.\n\nThe Disney Star won the TV rights of the IPL for five years with a price of INR 23,575 crore.

LSG opened their bowling with Krishnappa Gowtham and Yash Thakur expectedly, but SRH got off to a flyer.\n\nTravis hits Gowtham for 22 runs followed by Abhishek taking four fours off Thakur.\n\nThe hitting never stopped even after the fifties, as both batters were on a destructive mode to help SRH chase down the target in less than 10 overs.\n\nHead smashed a half-century and this time in just 16 balls. It was some astonishing hitting from Head, who was just picking his spots and sending them there no matter where the ball is pitched, no matter the pace. One of the incredible was a back-foot off-drive off Ravi Bishnoi for a huge six over long-off.\n\nThen there was a swat down the wicket straight of mid-off off Naveen-ul-Haq. He was 58 off 18 now, and went past 500 for the tournament, and also had hit the most fours in this IPL. SRH were 87 for 0 in five overs. That was four times what LSG were at this point.\n\nIn all T20 cricket, only seven times have 100 or more been scored in the powerplay, SRH have the top two scores, both in this year of IPL. It seemed slow by comparison, but Abhishek Sharma reached his fifty in 19 balls with a straight six off Ayush Badoni as SRH reached 120 for 0 in 6.3 overs.\n\nAs many as 14 sixes and 16 fours were hit in the chase which meant every second ball reached the boundary.\n\nEarlier, Bhuvneshwar Kumar led the way with figures of 4-0-12-2, conceding only in denominations of one, completely shutting down the LSG top order, which scored just 66 in the first 11.2 overs. The unbeaten 99-run stand between Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran guided LSG to a respectable total.\n\nBrief score:\n\nLucknow Super Giants 165 for 4 in 20 overs (Ayush Badoni 55 not out, Nicholas Pooran 48 not out; Bhuvneshwar Kumar 2-12, Pat Cummins 1-47) lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad 167 for 0 in 9.4 overs (Travis Head 89 not out, Abhishek Sharma 75) by ten wickets", "source": {"uri": "andhrawatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Andhrawatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnappa_Gowtham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Krishnappa Gowtham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bishnoi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naveen-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://andhrawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_1240.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

While speaking after the match, Rahul said they have watched such kind of batting only on television. He also praised Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma'a batting and said it was \"unreal\".\n\n\"Am lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills,\" Rahul said. He added the SRH openers did not give any chance to the Lucknow-based franchise. He accepted it was hard to stop the opening duo of Abhishek and Head.\n\n\"They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one. Once you are on the losing side, there are questions marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum. Ayush and Nicky batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well,\" he added. Recapping the match, LSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in the first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of just 29 runs.\n\nIn the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55*) and Nicholas Pooran (48*) turned things around with a 99-run stand, putting a score of 165/4 in 20 overs for LSG. Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the top bowler for LSG. Pat Cummins also got a wicket.\n\nIn the run-chase of 166 runs, openers Travis Head (89*) and Abhishek Sharma (75*) launched what seemed like a never-ending assault on LSG ballers, helping SRH chase down the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket. SRH is at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points. LSG is in the sixth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points.

SRH started their season with a bang, breaking multiple batting records in the IPL history.\n\nThe Pat Cummins-led side, however, is currently going through a rough patch with three defeats in their last four matches.

Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma's explosive batting dominated the day and continued to show why the SRH batting is one of the most feared in the TATA Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024. A target of 166 was chased down in 9.4 overs - a fact that sums up SRH's batting performance of the day.\n\nSRH's pyrotechnics were on display in the powerplay - a phase they have generally dominated through the tournament. SRH scored 107 in the powerplay alone - which effectively won them the game. The LSG bowlers had no margin for error as the left-handed opening pair were intent on dominating the day.\n\nWhat makes their feat most mind-boggling is that they only made eight runs in the first over. The second over is when they unleashed their best with Abhishek stroking four fours off Yash Thakur. When K Gowtham came on to bowl the third - Head got into the act by picking up 22 - three sixes and a four. This forced KL Rahul to bring in Ravi Bishnoi in the fourth over - a move that did not deter SRH as the runs continued to flow easily. When Naveen-ul-Haq came on for the fifth over, Head maintained that tempo and raced away to a 16-ball half-century. That over too went for 23.\n\nThakur bowled the last over of the powerplay and Abhishek, matched Head shot for shot and took SRH past their 100. When the field spread, many would have felt that there would be some respite for LSG. That wasn't the case as Head slog-swept the first ball of the seventh over for a six over mid-wicket. Abhishek then got to his fifty by hitting a six over long-on.\n\nThe boundaries kept flowing from both ends. It didn't matter who came on to bowl, as Head and Abhishek were batting as if they had to get the target inside 10 overs. Victory was achieved when Abhishek smashed Thakur over cover for a huge six. Head remained unbeaten on 89 off 30 balls, and Abhishek finished on 75 not out off 28 balls. The SRH innings featured as many as 16 fours and 14 sixes. The LSG bowlers had a day to forget as their bowling figures indicated.\n\nEarlier, SRH's bowlers had done well to restrict LSG to 165 by jolting their top order with wickets at regular intervals. It was only due to a good partnership by Ayush Badoni (55 not out off 30 balls) and Nicholas Pooran (48 not out of 26 balls) that LSG reached that total. The unbeaten 99-run stand dominated the last 10 overs of their innings. It was quite in contrast with the way LSG's innings panned out in the first 10.\n\nIn the initial overs, Bhuveshwar Kumar brought in all his experience to put pressure on the LSG batting. In his first three overs, he conceded only seven runs and bagged the first two wickets of Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis. It was evident with the score at the end of the powerplay - which was 27 for two. LSG had to rebuild with Krunal Pandya and KL Rahul.\n\nPandya decided to shift gears in the eighth over when he targeted Jaydev Unadkat and smashed two sixes. However, LSG were still scoring at less than a run-a-ball overall and the difficulties only compounded when Rahul fell for 29 - hitting one off Pat Cummins to the deep. In the 12th over, Pandya was run-out for 24. That is when Pooran and Badoni came together.\n\nWhile Pooran showed all his application and experience, Badoni was the one who brought out the aggression and helped pump life into the LSG innings. When T Natarajan was brought in for the 14th over, Badoni opened up and picked three fours. The 16-run over brought in much-needed impetus. What helped LSG was that the two batters managed to score over 10 runs in every over since the 14th - apart from Bhuvneshwar's last - which went for only five runs. Bhuvneshwar capped off a successful spell of two for 12 - outlandish figures considering what we saw later in the match.\n\nBadoni brought up his fifty in the penultimate over - getting there off only 28 balls. The last two overs of the LSG innings went for 34 - which included 19 off the last bowled by Cummins. This propelled LSG to 165. If one puts into perspective their effort in the first 10, the recovery was remarkable and would have given them hope going into the defence. But Head and Abhishek were too good on the day.", "source": {"uri": "pragativadi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pragativadi: Leading Odia Dailly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yajati_keshari_rout@pragativadi.com", "name": "Yajati Keshari Rout", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bishnoi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Thakur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yash Thakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

He slammed 8 fours and 6 sixes while chasing the 166-run target given by LSG.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Abhishek heaped praise on Travis Head for taking the pressure off from the start of the run chase.\n\nThe 23-year-old revealed that the Sunrisers bowlers adviced the batters during the inning break and told them that the pitch was getting better for batting. He also thanked Yuvraj Singh, Brian Lara, and his father for helping him reach at this level.\n\n\"All the credit goes to him (Travis Head). The way he starts against all bowlers... he goes after them from the start and takes the pressure off. The bowlers told us (during the innings break) that it was getting better, but myself and Travis thought it was not doing much. I think the hard work I put in before the tournament is showing now, thanks to Yuvi Paaji, Brian (Lara) as well and my father, who is my first coach,\" Abhishek said.\n\nSummarizing the match, LSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in the first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of just 29 runs.\n\nIn the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55*) and Nicholas Pooran (48*) turned things around with a 99-run stand, putting a score of 165/4 in 20 overs for LSG.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the top bowler for LSG.

The 57th match of the Indian Premier League 2024 (IPL 2024) was held at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\n\nLucknow Super Giants won the toss and chose to bat first in the match. They weren't able to make the most of the decision and were off to a poor start as they batted slow and lost wickets at regular intervals. However, good performances from Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran helped LSG score 165 runs.\n\nChasing the target, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma made a mockery of the Lucknow Super Giants bowling unit and played stupendous cricket. Head smashed 89 while Abhishek slammed 75 as SRH completed run-chase in 9.4 overs\n\nSpeaking after the match, KL Rahul said that he was lost for words as the blistering batting of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma left him awestruck. KL Rahul said:\n\n\"I'm lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on tv. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills. They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings.\"\n\nKL Rahul admitted that his bowlers found it hard to stop Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma as they kept going from ball one. KL Rahul further said that they were 40-50 runs short, but he acknowledged the fact that the SRH openers would have even chased a total of 240 with the kind of batting they did. KL Rahul said:\n\n\"Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one. Once you are on the losing side, there are questions marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum. Ayush and Nicky batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well.\"\n\nLucknow Super Giants haven't had the smoothest of campaigns in the Indian Premier League 2024. Before the match against Sunrisers Hyderabad, Lucknow Super Giants won 3 out of 5 matches they featured in. They registered wins against MI and CSK and lost against RR and KKR.\n\nAhead of the SRH clash, the KL Rahul-led side occupied the sixth position in the standings above Gujarat Titans, Mumbai Indians, Punjab Kings, and Royal Challengers Bengaluru. They had 12 points under their belt in 11 matches, LSG had won 6 and lost 5 games. After the conclusion of the match against Sunrisers Hyderabad, KL Rahul & Co. have retained the same position with a Net Run Rate of -0.769.\n\nLucknow Super Giants will be next up in action in the 64th match of the Indian Premier League 2024 when they lock horns with the Rishabh Pant-led Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi on May 14.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

On what seemed to be a slow surface, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma launched a relentless attack on LSG bowlers to register a 10-wicket win at home on Wednesday, creating a record of the highest total to be chased down within less than 10 overs.\n\n\"Maybe Travis and Abhishek did (on did he change the pitch). We just let them go, they are two guys who are very positive and I am a bowler, it is tough for me to give them any input,\" Cummins said during the post-match presentation. He praised Head, also his Australian teammate. \"He has been like this for two years, he hits the tough areas, hits the middle a lot, might not be super conventional.\"\n\nOn Abhishek Sharma's hitting, Cummins said, \"Just an incredible player of spin and pace. With just two fielders out, it is really difficult for the bowlers against them. I think the scores have gone up, and when the wickets are good, it is tough to come up with answers against batters when they get going. The boys have had a fantastic season, but to win this with less than 10 overs played is unreal.\" Coming to the match, LSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in the first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six.\n\nIn the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55* in 30 balls, with nine fours) and Nicholas Pooran (48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six) turned things around with a 99-run stand, putting a score of 165/4 in 20 overs for LSG. Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the top bowler for LSG. Pat Cummins also got a wicket.\n\nIn the run-chase of 166 runs, openers Travis Head (89* in 30 balls, with eight fours and eight sixes) and Abhishek Sharma (75* in 28 balls, with eight fours and six sixes) launched what seemed like a never-ending assault on LSG batters, helping SRH chase down the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket. SRH is at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points. LSG is at the sixth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points.\n\nHead took home the 'Player of the Match' award.

In 10 matches overall he averages 44.4.\n\nTop Pick - All-Rounder\n\nMarcus Stoinis is a prominent player for Lucknow Super Giants. He top-scored for the side in the losing cause against Knight Riders, adding 36 runs from 21 balls. Overall in the tournament, he made 352 runs at an average of 39.11 and picked up 4 wickets.\n\nTop Pick - Bowler\n\nPat Cummins not only with the ball but also impressed with his lower-order batting this season. In 11 matches, he picked up 13 wickets with the best figures of 3 for 43 and scored 77 runs in 7 innings.\n\nTop Pick - Wicketkeeper\n\nKL Rahul is the leading run-scorer for LSG this season, smashing 431 runs in 11 matches at an average of close to 40.\n\nX-Factor:\n\nNicholas Pooran is due for a big score following his modest scores in the last 3 matches where he made 10, 14*, and 11 runs.\n\nWhat are the Fantasy Suggested teams for SRH vs LSG, IPL 2024, Match 57?\n\n1. KL Rahul (vc), Nicholas Pooran, Heinrich Klaasen, Travis Head (c), Ashton Turner, Abhishek Sharma, Marcus Stoinis, K Nitish Reddy, Pat Cummins, T Natarajan, Naveen ul Haq\n\n2. KL Rahul, Heinrich Klaasen (vc), Mayank Agarwal, Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ayush Badoni, Marcus Stoinis (c), Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Pat Cummins, Naveen ul Haq\n\nPre-Match Analysis:\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad got a great escape at home with a mere one-run win over Rajasthan Royals last week but their batting was exposed at a contrasting Wankhede wicket on Monday where they could only make 173. Travis Head who got multiple reprieves top scored for the side with 48 runs while skipper Pat Cummins did the bulk of the scoring in the closing stages and remained unbeaten on 35*. They were a bowler short as they had used the impact player in the first half which made the difference. Marco Jansen bagging a wicket of Ishan Kishan hasn't made any big impression as he has the figures of 1 for 45, 0 for 44, and 0 for 40 in his three appearances this IPL.\n\nThey are a versatile side and there is no doubt about that but they need to fix their combination well as they return to home where they have a 3-1 win-loss record this season. With 6 wins and 5 losses overall, they are placed 4th in the standings with 12 points. They might bring changes to their start line-up in this match.\n\nLucknow Super Giants shouldn't take anything for granted from now on as they dropped down to the 5th spot in the table following their massive loss to Kolkata Knight Riders by 98. With this result, they wind off their home leg with a loss and will play their remaining 3 league games away which poses a challenge. Their bowling came under immense scanner as they leaked runs easily right from the start and for the second time this season, they conceded more than 200 runs.\n\nThey even recorded their lowest score this year, scoring only 137 against Knight Riders. It's time to bring their A-game to the fore at the crucial juncture of the tournament.", "source": {"uri": "in.ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "K.

He also praised Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma'a batting and said it was \"unreal\".\n\n\"Am lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills,\" Rahul said.\n\nHe added the SRH openers did not give any chance to the Lucknow-based franchise. He accepted it was hard to stop the opening duo of Abhishek and Head.\n\n\"They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one. Once you are on the losing side, there are questions marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum. Ayush and Nicky batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well,\" he added.\n\nRecapping the match, LSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in the first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of just 29 runs.\n\nIn the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55*) and Nicholas Pooran (48*) turned things around with a 99-run stand, putting a score of 165/4 in 20 overs for LSG.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the top bowler for LSG. Pat Cummins also got a wicket.\n\nIn the run-chase of 166 runs, openers Travis Head (89*) and Abhishek Sharma (75*) launched what seemed like a never-ending assault on LSG ballers, helping SRH chase down the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket.\n\nSRH is at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points. LSG is in the sixth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points.

We've watched that kind of batting on TV while they batted for a few games. But this was unbelievable. I have no words to describe how they were hitting the ball. Kudos to the skill level and I'm sure all of them have worked really, really hard with their six-hitting ability and you can see that.\"\n\nRahul continued:\n\n\"They didn't even give a chance to see what the wicket was playing like in the second innings. I think the pitch didn't change too much. When you have two batters coming in with that kind of mindset and freedom and they tee off from ball one, it's very hard to stop them. The only way to stop them was to get wickets in the powerplay but if you don't, it's very hard.\"\n\nPBKS will square off against RCB in the next match of IPL 2024 at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamshala on Thursday, May 9.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

This is the first meeting between the two sides this season. LSG have won all three previous games against SRH.\n\nThe SRH vs LSG IPL 2024 match will be played in Hyderabad on May 8 from 7.30 pm IST. SRH are yet to win against LSG in the IPL and play their remaining three games at home.\n\nSRH came back to winning ways against RR as they won by one run but then lost to Mumbai Indians. Despite the loss, they have managed to cling on to the fourth spot on the points table.\n\nChasing has been their major problem this season something that the opposition teams have noticed. Batting first and piling up big totals remains their strength and they have been pretty good at doing that.\n\nSRH batters Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma have been key to them getting good starts just like Phil Salt and Sunil Narine for KKR. Their batters have given them the cushion of extra 20-30 runs to defend totals.\n\nThe template for success is set for them and they would like to make it count by playing at home. Their batting was a bit below par last game and back at home where they achieved a lot of success they would be gunning to win the remaining three games.\n\nSRH Squad\n\nPat Cummins (c), Abdul Samad, Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, Marco Jansen, Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Sanvir Singh, Heinrich Klaasen, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Agarwal, T.

They have won some close games but have been outplayed in a few games, especially against KKR. The Knight Riders won the previous game by 8 wickets at home and in Lucknow piled up 235 with the bat and bowled out the opposition for just 137. The defeat has rung the alarm bells for LSG.\n\nLucknow Super Giants will play their remaining three games away from home and the challenge for them will be to take the pressure and find a way to win games.\n\nKL Rahul (c), Quinton de Kock, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis, Deepak Hooda, Devdutt Padikkal, Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-Haq, Krunal Pandya, Yudhvir Singh, Prerak Mankad, Yash Thakur, Amit Mishra, Shamar Joseph, Mayank Yadav, Mohsin Khan, K. Gowtham, Arshin Kulkarni, M. Siddharth, Ashton Turner, Matt Henry, Mohd. Arshad Khan\n\nRahul has been slow to start in the last few games. This is where Bhuvi has the chance to dismiss him early and set the pace for SRH in the match.\n\nThe two Australian teammates will come face to face against each other and look to outdo each other. Stoinis has been in good form with the bat and started well against KKR. For SRH to win, they must dismiss him early.\n\nThe southpaw will come up against the SRH death overs specialist in the final overs. This contest might well dictate the result of the match. Pooran played for SRH in IPL 2022.\n\nThe SRH opener has been in red-hot form this season and will look to take on the LSG bowlers on a placid Hyderabad pitch. Naveen's change-ups and slower deliveries might work in his favor like it did against Phil Salt.\n\nThe two batters have been severe against spinners hitting 28 and 31 sixes respectively. Ravi Bishnoi will need to bowl to them with a big heart and look to dismiss them early.\n\nFor SRH, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharam will be key with the bat. Heinrich Klaasen is key in the middle-order. With the ball, they have relied on their seamers to get the job done and hence Cummins, Bhuvi, and Natarajan will be key.\n\nFor LSG, KL Rahul, Marcus Stoinis, and Nicholas Pooran will be key with the bat. It will be interesting to see whether they include either of de Kock or Mayers in the lineup. With the ball, Naveen, Bishnoi, and Krunal will be key.\n\nThe temperature will be around 27 to 30 degrees in the evening, and The humidity levels will be around 70 percent, There is a five percent chance of rain but the clouds might clear out by the evening.\n\nTalking about the pitch, Hyderabad has been a high-scoring venue with SRH themselves posting 277 against MI earlier this season. We can expect this game to be another high-scoring contest.\n\nA win for SRH will take them close to the playoff berth while the challenge for LSG will be to win away from home in their remaining three matches.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Narine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Narine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Yadav", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fazalhaq_Farooqi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fazalhaq Farooqi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umran_Malik", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Umran Malik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yudhvir_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yudhvir Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

The win in 9.4 overs with 62 balls remaining is the biggest ever while chasing a 100+ target. This season, SRH have smashed 146 sixes so far. This is the highest ever for any team in one season.

Both teams have 12 points from 11 games. SRH is slightly ahead because they have a better score rate. This match is crucial because both teams want to go to the playoffs.\n\nSRH, led by Pat Cummins, need to improve their batting. They lost their last match to Mumbai Indians because they didn't score enough runs. Travis Head is doing well, but others like Abhishek Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen need to play better. Coach Daniel Vettori wants the middle order to do better.\n\nHead to head, LSG has won all three matches against SRH in the IPL. LSG has been stronger than SRH in their matches.\n\nThe Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium has hosted 75 IPL matches. Teams usually win more when they chase. The average score in the first innings is around 162 runs. The highest score was by SRH, and the lowest by DC.\n\nIn the last 10 matches at this stadium, teams batting first usually win. The average score in the first innings is around 185 runs. Teams score fast in the powerplay and death overs.\n\nPredictions: The match will be tough. SRH will try to break their losing streak against LSG. LSG will aim to continue their winning streak against SRH. Since teams batting first usually win at this stadium, the toss might be crucial.\n\nHyderabad and Lucknow have played against each other three times in the IPL. Hyderabad has not won any of these matches, while Lucknow has won all three times.\n\nBat 1st: Abhishek Sharma, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Travis Head, Aiden Markram, Nitish Reddy, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins(c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan, Jaydev Unadkat.\n\nBowl first: Abhishek Sharma, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Travis Head, Aiden Markram, Nitish Reddy, Shahbaz Ahmed, Abdul Samad, Pat Cummins(c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan, Jaydev Unadkat.\n\nImpact Player options: Aiden Markram, Nitiesh Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen\n\nBat 1st: Arshin Kulkarni, Deepak Hooda, KL Rahul (c/wk), Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Ashton Turner, Naveen-ul-Haq, Mohsin Khan, Ravi Bishnoi.\n\nBowl 1st: Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, KL Rahul (c/wk), Deepak Hooda, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Ashton Turner, Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-Haq, Mohsin Khan, Yash Thakur.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants will play in the IPL. Sunrisers Hyderabad, led by Pat Cummins, started the season well but lost three out of their last four matches. They lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Chennai Super Kings but won against Rajasthan Royals. In their last match, they lost to Mumbai Indians.\n\nThe match will be held at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad. Lucknow Super Giants have been doing well this season but lost two out of their last three matches. In their last match, they lost to Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nIn their previous encounters, Lucknow Super Giants have won all three matches against Sunrisers Hyderabad.\n\nThe Hyderabad pitch has been great for batsmen at the beginning of IPL 2024, allowing them to score lots of runs easily. Batsmen like it because the ball bounces predictably and the pace is consistent. Matches have been exciting with big scores.\n\nBut when Sunrisers Hyderabad played against Royal Challengers Bengaluru, the pitch changed. It became unpredictable, making it hard for both batsmen and bowlers. Instead of being a high-scoring game, it became more tactical and strategic.\n\nAccuWeather predicts that there will be cloudy weather on the evening of the match day, with thunderstorms and winds likely after 8 pm.

We just let them go, they are two guys who are very positive and I am a bowler, it is tough for me to give them any input,\" Cummins said during the post-match presentation.\n\nHe praised Head, also his Australian teammate. \"He has been like this for two years, he hits the tough areas, hits the middle a lot, might not be super conventional.\"\n\nOn Abhishek Sharma's hitting, Cummins said, \"Just an incredible player of spin and pace. With just two fielders out, it is really difficult for the bowlers against them. I think the scores have gone up, and when the wickets are good, it is tough to come up with answers against batters when they get going. The boys have had a fantastic season, but to win this with less than 10 overs played is unreal.\"\n\nComing to the match, LSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in the first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six.\n\nIn the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55* in 30 balls, with nine fours) and Nicholas Pooran (48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six) turned things around with a 99-run stand, putting a score of 165/4 in 20 overs for LSG.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the top bowler for LSG. Pat Cummins also got a wicket.\n\nIn the run-chase of 166 runs, openers Travis Head (89* in 30 balls, with eight fours and eight sixes) and Abhishek Sharma (75* in 28 balls, with eight fours and six sixes) launched what seemed like a never-ending assault on LSG batters, helping SRH chase down the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket.\n\nSRH is at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points. LSG is at the sixth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points.\n\nHead took home the 'Player of the Match' award.

That way, they could sneak into the playoffs as the fourth team with 16 points.\n\nIn case of more than one team vying for the fourth place with 16 points, the Super Giants will need to ensure that they have the best run rate to finish fourth and book their spot in the playoffs. Their run rate, though, has taken a severe beating following their 10-wicket hammering against SRH.\n\nLSG's remaining matches in IPL 2024\n\nFollowing the loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad, the Super Giants next take on Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi on May 14.\n\nKL Rahul and Co. conclude their IPL 2024 league campaign against Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede in Mumbai on May 17.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "renin_wilben_albert@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Renin Wilben Albert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arun_Jaitley_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arun Jaitley Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

Abhishek played a 75-run knock from 28 balls\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) batter Abhishek Sharma heaped praise on his opening partner Travis Head for playing spin like no one else. On Wednesday, the Hyderabad-based franchise clinched a massive 10-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, where Head scored 89 runs from 30 balls. Abhishek played a 75-run knock from 28 balls.\n\nSpeaking on JioCinema, Abhishek recalled how Head played shots against LSG spinner Krishnappa Gowtham and said not all batters can do that. \"I don't think anyone plays better spin than Travis. The shots he hit off K Gowtham, normally batters can't do that, that shows how special he is. He's very clear, whenever I talk to him, the way he compliments me, I have always been a big fan of his over the last year...I have followed him. When our understanding was established and our partnership improved, we became good friends off the pitch and have started spending more time,\" Abhishek said.\n\nThe 23-year-old opener talked about his performance and said he started this attacking approach from the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. \"I think this approach was something I took on during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. I feel when I play this way, look at the ball, and react, my shots come off better and the bowler comes under pressure. I always thought if I play in the IPL, I'll try to maintain this. Our support staff and Pat (Cummins), the way they think, I have never seen anyone else think like that. They're like, 'Go out there and express yourself. Play as aggressively as you can, we'll back you.' I think that matters a lot,\" he added.\n\nSummarizing the match, LSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in the first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of just 29 runs. In the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55*) and Nicholas Pooran (48*) turned things around with a 99-run stand helping put a score of 165/4 for LSG.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the top bowler for LSG. Pat Cummins also got a wicket.In the run-chase of 166 runs, openers Travis Head (89*) and Abhishek Sharma (75*) launched what seemed like a never-ending assault on LSG ballers, helping SRH chase the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket. SRH are at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points. LSG are at the sixth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points.

LSG posted 165 runs for the loss of four wickets in their 20 overs. In response, SRH chased down the target in just 9.4 overs with 10 wickets in hand.\n\nAfter opting to bat first, none of the LSG batters, apart from Ayush Badoni (55 off 30) and Nicholas Pooran (48 off 26), showed any intent. Their skipper KL Rahul could only score 29 runs off 33 balls while Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis got out early. On the contrary, the SRH openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma got off to a brilliant start as they amassed 107 runs in powerplay unlike LSG who couldn't even go past the 50-run mark.\n\nMatthew Hayden, former Australian player, blamed the LSG batters for their lack of intent during their innings. He said that the Super Giants required someone to show intent with the bat while highlighting that they didn't score enough runs in the powerplay. \"I have to call them out. This is not 5 runs per over wicket. Somebody needed to show intent. They had one of the slowest powerplays. That took the innings nowhere. When the opposition team has Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen your intention should be to go at 10s and over. 160-170 will never be enough,\" Hayden said.\n\nAfter the match, LSG skipper KL Rahul was at loss of words and he also appreciated the SRH batters, Head and Abhishek, saying, \"Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills. They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings.\n\n\"It was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one. Once you are on the losing side, there are question marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum. Ayush and Nicky batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aditya_kukalyekar@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Aditya Kukalyekar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

Giants Head-to-Head IPL Records And Stats:\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad will be hosting Lucknow Super Giants in match 57 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Wednesday, May 8.\n\nBoth the teams are in desperate need of a win at the moment, having lost their respective previous matches.\n\nLSG lost their previous fixture in the tournament against Kolkata

four teams currently have 12 points under their belt including LSG and SRH and will be aiming to make it to the final four with improved performances in their respective remaining matches.\n\nBoth teams have six wins and 12 points under their belt after 11 games but SRH are ahead in the points table, having placed fourth with a net run rate of -0.065.\n\nOn the other hand, LSG stand in the

LSG in their much needed winning match against the Sunrisers Hyderabad could only post 165 runs after winning the toss and opting to bat first.\n\n('Rohit Sharma Won't Be At MI Next Year...': Wasim Akram Wants Star Batter With Gautam Gambhir At KKR)\n\nHere's how fans trolled KL Rahul for his struggling knock...\n\nA fine half-century from Ayush Badoni and his partnership with Nicholas Pooran helped Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) reach a modest total of 165/4 in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad on Wednesday. LSG needs to defend 166 runs to get their seventh win of the tournament.\n\nAfter winning the toss, LSG opted to bat first. Pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar made them regret this decision by striking twice in the powerplay. First, in the third over, he removed an out-of-form Quinton de Kock for just two runs in five balls with Nitish Kumar Reddy taking a catch at deep backward square leg.\n\nIn the fifth over, Sanvir took a fine diving catch near mid-on, removing the in-form Marcus Stoinis for just three and giving Bhuvneshwar his second wicket. LSG was 21/2 in 4.2 overs.\n\nSkipper KL Rahul and Krunal Pandya joined forces, getting their team through the remainder of the powerplay. At the end of six overs, LSG was 27/2, with KL (19*) and Krunal (2*) unbeaten.\n\nIn the seventh over bowled by Jaydev Unadkat, Krunal relieved some pressure by smashing him for two sixes and getting his team a total of 15 runs out of it.\n\nBy drilling Cummins for a four towards mid-off, KL brought LSG to the 50-run mark in 9.1 overs. However, at the end of the over, he was dismissed by the SRH captain for a sluggish 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six. T Natrajan took the catch. LSG was 57/3 in 10 overs.\n\nLSG's situation became worse, with Cummins running out Krunal for 24 in 21 balls, with two sixes. LSG was 66/4 in 11.2 overs. The 14th over bowled by Natrajan proved to be an expensive over for SRH, with Ayush Badoni hitting him for four boundaries and taking a total of 17 runs from the over.\n\nA boundary from Badoni helped Lucknow reach the 100-run mark in 15 overs. At that point, LSG was 102/4, with Badoni (23*) and Nicholas Pooran (18*) unbeaten.\n\nBadoni continued to pierce through the gaps, mainly targeting Natrajan. He brought up his fourth IPL fifty in 28 balls, with eight fours. At the end of 19 overs, LSG was 146/4, with Badoni (50*) and Pooran (34*) unbeaten.\n\nLSG ended their innings at 165/4 in their 20 overs, with Pooran-Badoni getting 19 runs in the final over. Badoni was unbeaten at 55 in 30 balls, with nine fours while Pooran scored 48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six. Both had a 99-run partnership. Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the pick of the bowlers for SRH. Cummins (1/47) also got a wicket.

Mumbai Indians' fragile fate was dependent on the result of the SRH vs LSG match of the IPL 2024 on May 8 as Hyderabad's defeat would have meant that Mumbai still had hopes of qualifying to IPL playoffs.\n\nMumbai Indians have been the most under-performing team in the IPL 2024 season so far as they have only managed to win four games out of the 12 matches that they have played. Given the pedigree of players they have in their team, they would be very disappointed to find themselves out of the tournament.\n\nAfter taking over the team's captaincy from Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya found himself in the firing line of fans' wrath as Sharma won the IPL trophy for Mumbai Indians on five occasions. Hardik's performance, too, was below-par as he could not perform with either bat or the bowl for the Mumbai-based franchise. Mumbai Indians have just two matches left as they will lock horns with Kolkata Knight Riders and Lucknow Super Giants in their next fixtures. They would hope to put up a good show and finish the IPL 2024 season on a high.\n\nRead: SRH vs LSG, IPL 2024 Highlights: Head & Abhishek's Blazing 50s Hand Lucknow 10-Wicket Defeat\n\nIn the SRH vs LSG match of the IPL 2024, SRH successfully chased down LSG's target of 166 runs in only 9.4 overs. Travis Head reached his half-century in just 16 balls, while Abhishek Sharma achieved the same milestone in 19 balls, guiding SRH to a remarkable victory over Lucknow. This win propels SRH to the third position in the IPL 2024 points table.\n\nDuring their batting innings, Head and Abhishek began with eight runs in the first over, which turned out to be their lowest scoring over as they consistently scored over 14 runs in each over after that, ultimately reaching the target of 166 runs in just 9.4 overs. Travis Head concluded with an unbeaten 89 runs off 30 balls, including eight sixes and eight fours.

Abhishek played a 75-run knock from 28 balls.\n\nSpeaking on JioCinema, Abhishek recalled how Head played shots against LSG spinner Krishnappa Gowtham and said not all batters can do that.\n\n\"I don't think anyone plays better spin than Travis. The shots he hit off K Gowtham, normally batters can't do that, that shows how special he is. He's very clear, whenever I talk to him, the way he compliments me, I have always been a big fan of his over the last year...I have followed him. When our understanding was established and our partnership improved, we became good friends off the pitch and have started spending more time,\" Abhishek said.\n\nThe 23-year-old opener talked about his performance and said he started this attacking approach from the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.\n\n\"I think this approach was something I took on during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. I feel when I play this way, look at the ball, and react, my shots come off better and the bowler comes under pressure. I always thought if I play in the IPL, I'll try to maintain this. Our support staff and Pat (Cummins), the way they think, I have never seen anyone else think like that. They're like, 'Go out there and express yourself. Play as aggressively as you can, we'll back you.' I think that matters a lot,\" he added.\n\nSummarizing the match, LSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in the first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of just 29 runs.\n\nIn the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55*) and Nicholas Pooran (48*) turned things around with a 99-run stand helping put a score of 165/4 for LSG.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the top bowler for LSG. Pat Cummins also got a wicket.\n\nIn the run-chase of 166 runs, openers Travis Head (89*) and Abhishek Sharma (75*) launched what seemed like a never-ending assault on LSG ballers, helping SRH chase the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket.\n\nSRH are at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points. LSG are at the sixth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points.

The Australian batter certainly showed no leniency against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in Match 57 of IPL 2024 in Hyderabad.\n\nHead gained momentum during the third over, when he smoked three sixes and a four off Krishnappa Gowtham. He then took out 10 runs against the wily spinner, Ravi Bishnoi.\n\nIn the fifth over, Head put away Naveen-Ul-Haq's deliveries to all corners of the ground, as he garnered 23 runs, hitting four fours and a six. In this over, Head completed his stroke-filled half-century and put the SunRisers on the frontfoot.\n\nWith this knock, Head also completed 500 runs in the IPL 2024 season and climbed to the third position in the batting charts.\n\nWatch Travis Head's sensational knock below:\n\nInterestingly, the home team hit more sixes in the powerplay than the Super Giants (4) in the entire innings.\n\nAlong with Head, Abhishek Sharma was terrific with his ball-striking to complete his half-century off 19 balls.\n\nThe explosive duo went on to seal the chase inside 10 overs to secure an unprecented victory for the SRH team. Sharma remained unbeaten on 75 off 28, while Head slammed 89* off 30.\n\nWith seven victories in 12 games, Hyderabad now have one foot in the IPL 2024 playoffs.\n\nSRH vs LSG: Lucknow Super Giants made a comeback to score 165\n\nThe SunRisers Hyderabad bowlers were impressive with their accuracy and variations to reduce the Lucknow Super Giants to 57/3 in 10 overs. KL Rahul (29 off 33) tried well, but could not convert his start to provide acceleration to his side.\n\nHowever, Nicholas Pooran (48*) and Ayush Badoni (55*) did all the hard work to stage a fightback for the LSG team. The duo added an unbeaten 99-run stand to help the Lucknow-based side post a respectable 165 on the board.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar was the pick of the bowlers for the SRH side with figures of 2/12 in four overs.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tejas_rathi@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Tejas Rathi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnappa_Gowtham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Krishnappa Gowtham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bishnoi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

Both the teams are still in contention for the playoffs and will be looking to bolster their chances of progressing ahead. While a defeat in the upcoming game will not end any of the two team's playoffs chances, a win will put them in the driver's seat to progress ahead.\n\nSRH are coming into this game after suffering a seven-wicket defeat against Mumbai Indians. Opener Abhishek Sharma and the middle-order once again failed to deliver although SRH still managed to finish on a competitive 173/8. However, Mumbai chased down the total inside 18 overs by losing three wickets thanks to Suryakumar Yadav's stunning century.\n\nThe defeat has further extended SRH's slump in form in recent times. They began their season by winning five of their first seven games. However, they have managed to win just one of their last four games and the win was a 1-run victory over Rajasthan Royals. SRH cannot afford more slip ups and will be eyeing a victory against LSG.\n\nLSG suffered a heavy 98-run defeat against Kolkata Knight Riders in their last game. LSG have struggled for consistency this season and will be desperate for a win over SRH to bolster their chances of making it to the playoffs for the third time in a row.\n\nBoth SRH and LSG have six wins and five losses so far. However, SRH are ahead of LSG due to their better net run-rate.

The trailblazing SRH showcased to the entire world why they are to be the most feared batting line-up in the entire IPL, as they chased down 166 runs in less than 10 overs, to clinch an utterly dominating 10-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants.\n\nSRH's chase of 166 in 9.4 overs, or 58 balls, would in fact become a historic landmark, as the 167 scored by SRH would become the highest total ever registered after the first 10 overs of the IPL.\n\nTheir 58-ball win would help them register the biggest win with most balls to spare in IPL history.\n\nLSG won the toss and elected to bat first, a decision that skipper KL Rahul may just regret right now.\n\nAfter a horror show of a start, it was the Badoni-Pooran duo who played through the rough period of LSG with attacking intent to muster up a 99-run partnership within 9 overs, as Badoni and Pooran ended their innings with scores of 55* and 48* respectively to power LSG to a total of 165 runs.\n\nLSG stepped onto the pitch in Hyderabad for the second innings, hoping to defend their total. But, little did they know about the hell that SRH openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head would rain down on them.\n\nK Gowtham started with the new ball and got off to a good start, conceding just 8 runs. But, that would turn out to be the only instance in the entire chase in which any LSG bowlers would concede anything less than 14 runs.\n\nAfter Abhishek Sharma's onslaught of Yash Thakur, which would see the opener find 4 fours in a row, Head would go on to rain havoc on Gowtham in his second over, blitzing the unsuspecting spinner for a whopping 22 runs.\n\nHead would lace his strokes with venom as he would run rampage in the over that would see the Aussie pummel the spinner for 3 sixes and 2 fours.\n\nIn a move of desperation, LSG brought in Ravi Bishnoi early, and after a massive six from Abhishek Sharma, negligence would leas to the likes of Yash Thakur dropping a catch to dismiss Abhishek, a mistake the visitors would go on to resent.\n\nHead was nowhere near done with his onslaught though, as the Aussie would go on to slash Naveen Ul-Haq for the same 22 runs as he did Gowtham earlier, and in the process, reach his fifty in just 16 balls, and surpass 500 runs for SRH in this IPL season.\n\nYash Thakur would finally be brought in to finish off the powerplay on some glimpse of hope, but it would all turn out to be disaster for the pacer again, who would get ravaged by Abhishek Sharma for 20 runs off the over, as SRH would end up putting on 107-0 in the powerplay.\n\nTheir 107-run stand would go on to become the second-highest powerplay total scored in the history of the IPL, succeeded only by a 125-run stand put up by the Sunrisers themselves this season in their encounter against Delhi Capitals earlier in the season.\n\nThere would be no slowing down the opening duo though, who would continue to pile on the misery every next over.\n\nThe only real competition that ensued was between Head and Abhishek as to who would steal the limelight. And before you knew it, Abhishek reached his fifty as well in a mere 19 balls, 3 balls more than Head tonight.\n\nKL Rahul and co. was merely rendered spectators as the duo dealt only in fours and sixes throughout, wreaking havoc upon all bowlers thrown their way.\n\nAnd before you knew it all, Abhishek Sharma would end it in style, smashing a six over extra covers from a delivery off Yash Thakur to seal the deal and create history.\n\nWith their win, SRH leap all the way up to third place in the IPL table, whilst LSG are pushed down to sixth place, below Delhi Capitals.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Thakur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yash Thakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bishnoi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

The duo helped the side chase down 166 with 62 balls to spare, and significantly propelled their Net Run Rate, moving to the third spot on the points table. 30 of the 58 balls the duo faced were hit for boundaries as they secured their team a 10-wicket win.\n\nThe difference\n\n80 runs separated the two teams in the powerplay. SRH smashed eight sixes in this period, twice of what LSG managed in their entire innings. If with the ball courtesy of Bhuvneshwar Kumar's efforts, SRH gained momentum in the contest, with the bat, they completely killed the chase in this phase.\n\n- LSG KKR Score 27/2 107/0 Run-Rate 4.60 17.83 4s/6s 0/1 13/8\n\nLucknow Super Giants\n\nPowerplay: LSG top-order stuck in grapple-hold\n\nLSG: 27/2 (RR:4.50, 0x4s, 1x6s)\n\nLed by Bhuvneshwar Kumar's fine spell upfront, well aided by Shahbaz Ahmed, SRH managed to restrict LSG to their lowest-ever powerplay score. The batters struggled to find timing and never had the rhythm to get going, losing two crucial wickets - Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis - in this period.\n\nMiddle overs: LSG stutter but fight back\n\nLSG: 75/2 (RR: 8.22, 6x4s, 3x6s)\n\nKrunal Pandya's assault on Jaydev Unadkat, which included two sixes down the ground, allowed LSG to get some much-needed momentum in their innings. However, he didn't find ample support from the other end. Rahul holed out to T Natarajan at long leg and soon after Krunal himself was run out while attempting a quick single. Unlike Bhuvneshwar, however, the other bowlers weren't as threatening. Cummins rotated his resources well and LSG couldn't find the flourish they were looking for.\n\nDeath overs: Badoni, Pooran guide LSG to respectability\n\nLSG: 63/0 (RR: 12.60, 10x4s, 0x6s)\n\nBadoni and Pooran stepped on the accelerator in the death overs and countered SRH's plans of using the slower balls on the hard lengths by attacking the shorter part of the boundary. They couldn't send any of those shots over the rope, including the last one which was superbly defended by Nitish Reddy at sweeper cover. Nonetheless, Badoni used some unconventional strokes and powered along to his fastest IPL half-century and in the company of Pooran, extended their partnership to 99 runs helping the side to a respectable total.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad\n\nPowerplay: Head, Abhishek blow LSG away\n\nSRH: 107/0 (RR: 17.83, 13x4s, 8x6s)\n\nIn the first eight balls of the run-chase, SRH were moving along at run-a-ball, far slower than their standards, and then Abhishek Sharma cut loose. Yash Thakur lost his line, and as the attack continued from both ends - as Travis Head and Abhishek have done for most of this season - LSG ran out of plans. K Gowtham, who bowled an effective first over, was taken to the cleaners in his second, butchered for three sixes and a boundary. The duo exploded and hammered 99 runs in the next 28 balls, which killed the contest. Head, who led the assault, powered along to his joint-fastest half-century, reaching the mark in only 16 balls - his fourth fifty within the powerplay this season, most by any batter ever in IPL.\n\nMiddle: The onslaught continues\n\nLSG: 60/0 in 3.4 overs (RR: 17.65, 3x4s, 6x6s)\n\nThe middle overs started with a six by Travis Head and the chase ended with a six by Abhishek Sharma. The two southpaw continued their relentless attack in the never-ending six-fest as SRH managed to post the highest-ever score within the first 10 overs in the IPL (playing two balls less). Badoni's part-time offbreaks were smashed for 19, Ravi Bishnoi was taken apart for 17, Naveen ul Haq bowled a few effective slower balls but was still carted away for 14. The chase was done and dusted in 58 balls.\n\nWith that win, SRH not only gave their NRR a boost but also knocked out Mumbai Indians from the qualification race.\n\nBrief Scores: Lucknow Super Giants 165/4 in 20 overs (Ayush Badoni 55*, Nicholas Pooran 48*; Bhuvneshwar Kumar 2-12) lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad 167 for no loss in 9.4 overs (Travis Head 89*, Abhishek Sharma 75*) by 10 wickets", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cricbuzz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Ahmed_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shahbaz Ahmed (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

The Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Hyderabad was a witness to his exhilarating contest.\n\nThe KL Rahul-led side opted to bat first, which didn't augur well for them. Bhuvneshwar Kumar got rid of Quinton de Kock (2) and KL Rahul (3) early. Although KL Rahul (29) and Krunal Pandya (24) started on a fine note, they couldn't convert their starts.\n\nNevertheless, Ayush Badoni (55*) and Nicholas Pooran (48*) were impactful with their knocks to steer LSG to a modest total of 165.\n\nIn response, SRH openers, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma blew away the visitors, continuing their blistering form to dominate every bowler. The ground seemed to be too small for both southpaws, as they finished the chase in less than 10 overs. It is now the most runs scored by an IPL team in the first 10 overs of an innings.\n\nOn that note, let's take a look at the three best moments from the SRH-LSG game:\n\n#1 Bhuvneshwar Kumar's double-strike cripple LSG\n\nHaving garnered only 13 runs in the first two overs, Lucknow Super Giants opener, Quinton de Kock tried to up the ante in the third over. However, De Kock could only send Bhuvneshwar Kumar's half-tracker to the throat of the square leg area.\n\nIn his next over, Bhuvneshwar pitched a short ball to Marcus Stoinis, but the Australian all-rounder failed to make a good connection. Sanvir Singh plucked a stunning catch to send Stoinis back into the dugout. With this double-wicket strike, LSG were reduced to 21/2 in the fifth over.\n\nWith these wickets, KL Rahul and Krunal Pandya played it safe and could only finish on 57 runs in 10 overs.\n\n#2 Nicholas Pooran-Ayush Badoni stage a fightback\n\nAfter the LSG top-order couldn't be potent enough with their performances, they needed a crucial partnership to steer them to a defendable total. The duo of Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran just did that, as they assessed the conditions well and found odd boundaries to keep the team in good stead.\n\nThe duo stitched together an unbeaten 99-run stand, with 65 coming in the last five overs. In the last over bowled by Pat Cummins, Badoni hit a single four, while Pooran slammed three boundaries to provide a perfect flourish to the LSG side.\n\n#3 Unstoppable Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma make a mockery of the opposition\n\nThe most explosive opening pair in IPL 2024, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma proved their mettle once again, as they provided a tantalizing start to the home team.\n\nIt was the second over of the innings, where it all started, as Sharma hit four boundaries and got the ball rolling for the SRH side. The following over witnessed Travis Head smacked three sixes and a four to make his intentions clear.\n\nThe fifth over of the innings bowled by Naveen-ul-Haq proved to be an expensive affair, as Head took 23 runs from it while completing the half-century off 16 balls. Meanwhile, Sharma continued his onslaught to reach his fifty off 19 balls.\n\nTaking advantage of the hapless bowling unit, Head (89* off 30) and Sharma (75* off 28) sealed the chase in just 9.4 overs. With his knock, Head climbed to the third position in the batting charts with 533 runs, while Sharma is at 11th with 401 runs.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tejas_rathi@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Tejas Rathi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

The Sunrisers' dugout watched in amazement as the openers showcased their exceptional batting prowess.\n\nScoring 167 runs in 9.4 overs, SRH set a new record for the highest total in the first 10 overs of an IPL match, demonstrating their ability to break records effortlessly.

Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals seem relatively secure in their positions.\n\nThe scramble for the remaining playoff spots intensifies, with Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Lucknow Super Giants vying for contention. It will be a must-win game for both sides to keep their hopes alive to make it into the playoffs.\n\nSRH began the season impressively, showcasing a bold batting approach that led to early victories. However, recent form has been less consistent, with struggles evident in batting performances.\n\nWhile the bowling unit, led by Pat Cummins, has shown resilience, the team needs to rejuvenate its batting lineup to maintain momentum.\n\nMeanwhile, LSG started the season strongly, securing victories in three of their first four games. However, inconsistency has plagued their journey since then, with alternating wins and losses.\n\nThe team's captain, KL Rahul, hasn't consistently delivered with the bat, adding to their challenges. Despite a strong all-round squad, LSG's performance has lacked synchronization between the batting and bowling departments.\n\nMay 13, 2023: Lucknow Super Giants won by 7 wickets at Hyderabad.\n\nApril 7, 2023: Lucknow Super Giants won by 5 wickets at Lucknow.\n\nApril 4, 2022: Lucknow Super Giants won by 12 runs at Mumbai.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad (Probable Playing XI): Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen(wk), Glenn Phillips, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat/Umran Malik.\n\n[Impact sub: T Natarajan]\n\nLucknow Super Giants (Probable Playing XI): KL Rahul(c), Quinton de Kock, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Deepak Hooda, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohsin Khan, Naveen-ul-Haq, Yash Thakur.\n\n[Impact sub - A Kulkarni]\n\nThe match will be played at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium. The venue has been high-scoring in the ongoing season with no respite for the bowlers just like the other pitches have been in this season so far. SRH have been posted some huge totals batting first and one can expect something similar in this one as well.\n\nBatters will look to play aggressive shots and utilize the powerplay upfront. The pitch is likely to get better to bat on as the match progresses. Teams would want to chase here which makes the toss very crucial.\n\nWhere to watch?

The match, which will be crucial in the context of the playoffs qualification, is being played at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad on Wednesday (8th May).\n\nThis will be the first time that Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will be squaring off with Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in IPL 2024. The two teams had played each other just three times in the history of the league and going into the game, the KL Rahul-led side will be high on confidence because they have won all previous three games against Orange Army.\n\nBoth SRH and LSG have played magnificent brands of cricket and both are very much in contention for the playoffs. The Hyderabad-based franchise has revolutionised the batting in the league while Lucknow has been consistent as always in the league.\n\nCurrently, SRH is at No.4 on the points table with 6 wins and 5 defeats from the 11 games. They have 12 points under their belt. On the other hand, LSG is 6th on the points table with the same number of wins and defeats in 11 games. But what separates them is their NRR.\n\nBoth SRH and LSG will be entering the game on the back of defeats. While the Pat Cummins-led side suffered a thrashing 7-wicket loss against Mumbai Indians at Wankhede Stadium, the KL Rahul-led side were hammered by 98 runs by Kolkata Knight Riders at their home ground.\n\nBoth SRH and LSG will be desperate for the win in the match. A win there for both teams will strengthen their position in the points table. However, a loss might hamper their chances, especially with the kind of competition that has been there in the league.\n\nLucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul won the toss and opted to bat first in the game against SRH. The skipper admitted that it's an important game for both teams and claimed that they will be focused on one thing at a time. Speaking at the toss, he stated:\n\n\"We will bat first. That plus a couple of games that have been played here. It is hard to complete forget how important this game for both the sides, but we have played enough cricket. We will focus one thing at a time, bat first and put up the runs on the board. Playing at home becomes a difference, but we play so much cricket that we know how the conditions will be. Quinton comes in, Mohsin misses out and there are a few other changes.\"\n\nPat Cummins on the other hand also expressed his desire to bat first in the game against LSG. He also spoke about the importance of the game and stated:\n\n\"Thank You (for the birthday wishes). My body feels 31. We would have batted as well. But we have won both ways here and hence not too upset. Hard to know (a good score) as it has been pretty high scoring. It is pretty tough (to qualify for the playoffs) and you have to keep winning till the end, we have not nailed it in the last couple of games and it is time to change that. We have a couple of changes - Sanvir comes in for Agarwal and Viyaskanth makes his debut and replaces Marco.\"\n\nSRH: Glenn Phillips, Umran Malik, Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Washington Sundar\n\nLSG: Manimaran Siddharth, Yudhvir Singh, Devdutt Padikkal, Ashton Turner, Amit Mishra\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Travis Head, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Sanvir Singh, Pat Cummins(c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, T Natarajan", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

The Super Giants lost the match by 10 wickets, which means they were completely outplayed. Following the loss, LSG owner Sanjeev Goenka was visibly upset and was spotted scolding captain KL Rahul. The incident took place after the post-match presentation was over. Rahul just kept listening as Goenka went on ranting. It was visible as it happened in front of everyone.\n\nHere is the clip that is now going viral on social space:\n\n\"Am lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on tv. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills. They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one,\" Rahul said at the post-match presentation.\n\nEarlier, Travis Head hammered 30 balls 89 and Abhishek Sharma slammed 75 off 38 as Sunrisers Hyderabad thrashed Lucknow Super Giants by ten wickets and chased down the target of 166 runs in just 9.4 overs.\n\nAbhishek and Travis completely destroyed the LSG bowling attack.\n\nSRH in this season of IPL have scored with an economy of 11.37 in the power play overs, and yet again reached 100 under six overs only. LSG opened their bowling with Krishnappa Gowtham and Yash Thakur expectedly, but SRH got off to a flyer.\n\nTravis hits Gowtham for 22 runs followed by Abhishek taking four fours off Thakur.\n\nThe hitting never stopped even after the fifties, as both batters were on a destructive mode to help SRH chase down the target in less than 10 overs.\n\nHead smashed a half-century and this time in just 16 balls. It was some astonishing hitting from Head, who was just picking his spots and sending them there no matter where the ball is pitched, no matter the pace. One of the incredible was a back-foot off-drive off Ravi Bishnoi for a huge six over long-off.\n\nThen there was a swat down the wicket straight of mid-off off Naveen-ul-Haq. He was 58 off 18 now, and went past 500 for the tournament, and also had hit the most fours in this IPL. SRH were 87 for 0 in five overs.

( Image Source :IPLT20 )\n\nSRH vs LSG Head-To-Head Record in IPL: Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will be up against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in the mid-week Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 faceoff on Wendesday (May 8). The two teams will meet for the first this season at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. With both SRH and LSG alive in the race to the Playoffs, this promises to be an excitig contest with a victory essential for both the teams to proceed to the IPL 2024 Playoffs.\n\nHyderabad-led by Pat Cummins, a new IPL captain, have played with a refreshing approach. The team which was not even close to qualifying in the last few seasons took everyone by surprise with the way they went about their business, breaching the 250-plus run mark on multiple occasion, thanks to their fearless approach to batting. That may not have worked on all occasions but they remain in the reckoning for a Playoffs berth.\n\nAs far as LSG are concerned, their approach has more been on the traditonal lines but equally effective as 12 points against their name suggests. A win here would see them jump to the third place on the IPL 2024 points tally, surpassing Delhi Capitals (DC), SRH and even the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) who are all tied at 12 points at this stage.\n\nREAD HERE | Fans React As KL Rahul Gets Excluded From India's T20 World Cup 2024 Squad\n\nWill it be SRH who will taste their maiden win against LSG in IPL history or will LSG bounce into top four?

Rahul, who was watching the beyond-believable show of big-hitting from behind the stumps, said he was lost of words as SRH scripted a new T20 record for chasing the most number of runs in the first 10 overs of a match. SunRisers, thanks to Head's 30-ball 89 and Abhishek's 28-ball 75, chased down the target in just 58 deliveries.\n\nSRH vs LSG: Highlights\n\n\"I am lost for words. We have watched that batting on TV, but that was unreal,\" KL Rahul said after finishing on the losing side. SRH moved to the 3rd spot in the IPL 2024 points table with a huge boost in Net Run Rate after their record-breaking chase against LSG at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.\n\n\"Everything was hitting the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skill, they (Head and Abhishek) have worked very hard on their six-hitting. They didn't give a chance to see what the wicket was playing like, it didn't change much, but that mindset and freedom to tee off from ball one... the only way to stop them was wickets in the powerplay and we didn't do that,\" Rahul said.\n\nTravis Head and Abhishek Sharma hit 14 sixes and 16 boundaries as they helped SRH script a new IPL record for the fastest successful chase -- winning with 62 balls to spare.\n\nSunRisers posted 107 for 0 in the first 6 overs while LSG had managed just 27 for 2 after a criminally slow approach from KL Rahul. The difference of 80 between the two teams in the powerplay is the highest in IPL history.\n\nIPL 2024 Full Coverage | IPL 2024 Points Table and Standings | 2024 IPL Full Schedule\n\nBarring the first over in which Head and Abhishek assessed the conditions, none of the other 8 overs went for less than 15 runs as there was no hiding place for the LSG bowlers. Krishnappa Gowtham, who gave 29 runs in 2 overs, was the most economical LSG bowler on Wednesday.\n\nSunRisers, who have 14 points in 12 matches, are well-placed now to reach the playoffs. On the other hand, LSG's Net Run Rate took a huge hit after their 10-wicket loss.\n\nKL Rahul's men need to win their last two matches and hope other results go their way if they are to qualify for the playoffs.

However, at the end of the over, he was dismissed by the SRH captain for a sluggish 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six. T Natrajan took the catch. LSG was 57/3 in 10 overs.\n\nLSG's situation became worse, with Cummins running out Krunal for 24 in 21 balls, with two sixes. LSG was 66/4 in 11.2 overs.\n\nThe 14th over bowled by Natrajan proved to be an expensive over for SRH, with Ayush Badoni hitting him for four boundaries and taking a total of 17 runs from the over.\n\nA boundary from Badoni helped Lucknow reach the 100-run mark in 15 overs. At that point, LSG was 102/4, with Badoni (23*) and Nicholas Pooran (18*) unbeaten.\n\nBadoni continued to pierce through the gaps, mainly targeting Natrajan. He brought up his fourth IPL fifty in 28 balls, with eight fours. At the end of 19 overs, LSG was 146/4, with Badoni (50*) and Pooran (34*) unbeaten.\n\nLSG ended their innings at 165/4 in their 20 overs, with Pooran-Badoni getting 19 runs in the final over. Badoni was unbeaten at 55 in 30 balls, with nine fours while Pooran scored 48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six. Both had a 99-run partnership.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the pick of the bowlers for SRH. Cummins (1/47) also got a wicket.

MI, however, endured a forgettable start to their campaign, losing their first three matches before clinching wins against Delhi Capitals (DC) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB). However, the Mark Boucher-coached side continued to be inconsistent, losing four matches in a row that hurt their chances big time.\n\nOn Monday, however, MI had revived their slim hopes with a seven-wicket win over SRH, courtesy an unbeaten century from Suryakumar Yadav as they chased 174.\n\nMI next take on Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on Saturday before rounding off their campaign against Lucknow Super Giants at home on 17 May.\n\nGujarat Titans are in 10th place with eight games as well, albeit having played a game less than MI.\n\nComing to the SRH vs LSG game, the Pat Cummins-led side were set a target of 166. Openers Abhishek Sharma (75*) and Travis Head (89*) employed their merciless batting approach yet again as SRH chased down the total in only 9.4 overs.\n\nEarlier, LSG had won the toss and opted to bat. It was a rather slow start from Lucknow Super Giants as they were restricted to 27/2 in the powerplay. Bhuvneshwar Kumar had removed Quinton de Kock in the third over and he struck once again a couple of overs later to see off Marcus Stoinis, who was caught by Sanvir Singh at mid-on.\n\nKL Rahul then attempted to revive the visitors and all he could do was forging a 36-run stand with Krunal Pandya before being dismissed for 29 by Pat Cummins in the 10th over.\n\nLSG seemed to be in trouble at 66/4 in the 12th over when Pandya was run-out by Cummins at the non-striker's end, but what followed was a valiant fightback from Nicholas Pooran (48*) and Ayush Badoni (55*) who forged a 99-run stand for the fifth wicket. LSG were restricted to 165/4 from 20 overs.\n\nFor Head and Abhishek, it was all about aggression from the word go. SRH reached 107/0 in the powerplay phase, which was the second-highest powerplay score of this season after their score of 125/0 against Delhi Capitals earlier this season. From then on, it took less than four overs for SRH to chase down the total against LSG.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanvir_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanvir Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

In the process, SRH scripted a new T20 record for chasing the most number of runs in the first 10 overs of a match.\n\n\"I am lost for words. We have watched that batting on TV, but that was unreal,\" KL Rahul said after the match. \"Everything was hitting the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skill, they (Head and Abhishek) have worked very hard on their six-hitting. They didn't give a chance to see what the wicket was playing like, it didn't change much, but that mindset and freedom to tee off from ball one... the only way to stop them was wickets in the powerplay and we didn't do that,\" Rahul added.\n\nHead smashed a half-century in just 16 balls after an astonishing display of batting. One of his incredible shots was a back-foot off-drive against Ravi Bishnoi for a huge maximum over long-off. Then there was a swat down the wicket straight of mid-off to Naveen-ul-Haq. On the other hand, Sharma reached his fifty in 19 balls with a straight six off Ayush Badoni.\n\nThe stunning win boosted SRH's Net Run Rate (NRR) from -0.065 to 0.41 with an early finish.

We kind of complement each other. He is very very enjoyable to be around. He is very very excited and thinks about the game,\" Head said at a post-match press conference.\n\nThe powerplay, a phase of the match the Sunrisers have dominated in the tournament so far, set the stage for this victory. They scored an incredible 107 runs during the powerplay overs, practically snuffing out any hopes of a comeback that Lucknow may have entertained and took their team to within a touching distance of the target in under 10 overs.\n\nThe persistent and ferocious assault by the SRH openers was simply too much for the LSG bowlers to handle.\n\nAfter posting a reasonable and fighting target of 167 on the board, the Sunrisers, riding on the exploits of the opening duo, cantered home in just 9.4 overs. The fireworks by the willow-wielders yet again reaffirmed the team's formidable batting lineup, which is arguably among the most feared this ongoing IPL season.\n\n\"Yeah, very happy with how we operate in power play and also glad to see how we scored runs outside of power play today. At time out we spoke about NRR (Net Run Rate) being important. Very pleased that checked out,\" he added.\n\nLSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got off to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in the first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six.\n\nIn the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55* in 30 balls, with nine fours) and Nicholas Pooran (48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six) turned things around with a 99-run stand, putting a score of 165/4 in 20 overs for LSG.\n\nIn the run-chase of 166 runs, openers Travis Head (89* in 30 balls, with eight fours and eight sixes) and Abhishek Sharma (75* in 28 balls, with eight fours and six sixes) launched what seemed like a never-ending assault on LSG batters, helping SRH chase down the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket.\n\nSRH is at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points.

Visuals of Sanjiv Goenka and KL Rahul chatting along the boundary rope at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, minutes after LSG's 10-wicket defeat, went viral on social media.\n\nSRH vs LSG: Highlights | Scorecard\n\nThe disappointment in the Lucknow camp was evident as owner Sanjiv Goenka, captain KL Rahul and the rest of his teammates looked gutted following the loss, which hampered the team's chances of reaching the IPL 2024 playoffs. LSG had headed to Hyderabad with high hopes of extending their perfect record against former champions SunRisers. However, SRH were on top of their game, limiting LSG to 165 and then chasing down the total in just 9.4 overs to set a new T20 record.\n\nLSG slipped to the sixth spot in the points table and their Net Run Rate took a huge hit after the one-sided game in Hyderabad. Lucknow have 12 points in as many games, 2 fewer than third-placed SunRisers.\n\nKL Rahul paid the price for being timid on the field. While he won the toss and opted to bat, lack of intent in the powerplay cost the visiting team. LSG managed just 27 runs and lost 2 wickets at the end of the powerplay while SunRisers, thanks to Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head's ruthless knocks, reached 107 at the end of their powerplay. The 80-run difference between the two teams' totals in the powerplayis also the highest in IPL history.\n\nIPL 2024 Full Coverage | IPL 2024 Points Table and Standings | 2024 IPL Full Schedule\n\nKL Rahul was criticised by a section of fans and pundits. The LSG captain played an uncharacteristically slow knock -- 29 off 33 balls. Thanks to Ayush Badoni's fifty and Nicholas Pooran's 4quick-fire 48, LSG were able to post 165 and give their bowlers something to work with.\n\nHowever, SRH openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma were in the mood to hit some big ones. Head hit 8 sixes and as many boundaries for his 30-ball 89 while young Abhishek smashed 6 sixes and 8 boundaries for his 28-ball 75. The duo added 167 runs for the opening partnership and steered SRH past the finish line in record time.\n\nKL Rahul echoed the emotions of millions of cricket fans who watched SunRisers make a mockery of the 166-run target, acknowledging the incredible big-hitting show from Head and Sharma.\n\n\"I am lost for words,\" he said while talking to the broadcasters after the one-sided contest.\n\n\"We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six-hitting skills. They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings,\" he added.\n\nLSG will look to bounce back and return to winning ways when they take on Delhi at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on May 14. They will end the league stages with a trip to Mumbai on May 17. Rahul and LSG have a proud record to keep up as the Lucknow-based franchise have never failed to make the play-offs in their nascent IPL history.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

Ayush Badoni (55*) and Nicholas Pooran (47*) combined for 99 runs off 52 balls to make this possible. The LSG top-order did not get started at all. They were 57/3 when KL Rahul (29 off 33 balls) holed out in fine leg off Pat Cummins' bowling with the penultimate delivery of the tenth over.\n\nAround that time, Hayden \"called out\" the lack of intent among LSG batters.\n\n\"I have to call them out. This is not a 5 runs per over wicket. Somebody needed to show intent. They had one of the slowest powerplays. That took the innings nowhere. When the opposition team has Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen, your intention should be to go at 10s and over. 160-170 will never be enough,\" Hayden said on commentary.\n\nThe way LSG batted, many believed the pitch was extremely slow and it was difficult to bat on. However, SRH in their chase of 166, dismissed those notions in the way they batted.\n\nTravis Head and Abhishek Sharma hammered the LSG bowlers to all parts of the Hyderabad ground as they chased down the total in 9.4 overs or 62 balls to spare.

After the first 7 games, it looked like SRH were one of the favourites to enter the playoffs list, but now, in the business end of the tournament, they are struggling to sneak into the final two spots. With KKR and RR more or less set for the playoffs spots, the race is mainly between CSK, LSG, DC and SRH to compete for the remaining two. Out of those four teams, two will play on Wednesday, 8 May at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\n\nSRH have made it difficult for themselves by losing 3 out of their last 5 matches and they will hope to grab a crucial win against KL Rahul's LSG on Wednesday. It is Pat Cummins' birthday today and the skipper will hope to inspire the side with a quick turnaround from the loss vs MI.\n\nIPL 2024 Full Coverage | IPL 2024 Points Table and Standings | 2024 IPL Full Schedule\n\nSRH played their last match a day before, so fatigue will be the biggest question mark on the side. Pat Cummins will hope for a better show from the middle-order, who have not shown any kind of character once the openers have gotten out early in the innings.\n\nOn the other hand, LSG would hope to forget their 98-run hammering against KKR if they wish to keep their playoffs hope alive. The team has reached the top 4 in back to back seasons and it will be a body blow for them if they fail to achieve the same result, if not better it, in 2024.\n\nSRH vs LSG: Hyderabad Weather Report\n\nThis is the first and only time that the teams will face each other in the group stage of the Indian Premier League 2024. LSG hold the historical advantage over SRH with a 3-0 record, and they will back themselves to deliver once again at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium.\n\nSRH will need to rethink their No. 3 spot. They have tries Mayank Agarwal, Anmolpreet Singh, Rahul Tripathi and Aiden Markram in the position, but none of them have delivered. Mayank Agarwal failed in Mumbai, so it might be a good time to bring back Rahul Tripathi in the mix.\n\nFor LSG, there are no injury concerns bar Mayank Yadav, who has been ruled out of the tournament and the team is expected to field the same line-up.\n\nThe Hyderabad pitch has been a paradise for batters in the IPL 2024 season.It is expected to play the same on Wednesday as well. The real question will be how the weather turns out on Wednesday. Thundershowers lashed on Hyderabad on Tuesday and some rain is expected to fall on Wednesday as well.\n\nSRH Predicted XI\n\nTravis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Rahul Tripathi, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen(wk), Glenn Phillips, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat/Umran Malik.\n\nKL Rahul(c), Quinton de Kock, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Deepak Hooda, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohsin Khan, Naveen-ul-Haq, Yash Thakur.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

The SRH openers, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, showcased their batting prowess by chasing down a target of 166 in just 9.4 overs at a record-breaking pace.\n\nA post-match video captured an animated discussion between LSG's franchise owner Sanjiv Goenka and team skipper KL Rahul, reflecting the intensity and pressure of the moment. The duo of Head and Sharma not only contributed to one of the highest powerplay scores in T20 history but also secured a century stand within the powerplay for the second time this IPL season.\n\nAfter setting what seemed a competitive target of 167, LSG could only watch as Head and Sharma tore through their bowling lineup with what Rahul described as \"unreal\" batting. \"Am lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six-hitting skills,\" Rahul expressed, overwhelmed by the sheer skill level displayed by the SRH openers.\n\nThis significant defeat not only handed LSG their sixth loss of the IPL 2024 season but also dealt a severe blow to their net run rate, dropping them below Delhi Capitals in the rankings.\n\nRelated Items:Abhishek Sharma, fastest T20 scores, IPL 2024, Lucknow Super Giants, record-breaking innings, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Travis Head Recommended for you IPL 2024: \"Am lost for words\" : KL Rahul after 10-wicket defeat IPL 2024: SRH Demolishes LSG with Record-Breaking Chase Sanju Samson Reflects on Narrow Loss to Delhi Capitals", "source": {"uri": "liveindia.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "Live India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Travis Head (89* off 30) and Abhishek Sharma (75* off 28) then featured in a sensational stand of 167* as Hyderabad gunned down the total in 9.4 overs.\n\nThe first over of SRH's chase bowled by Krishnappa Gowtham went for eight runs, but what followed was absolute carnage. Abhishek took on Yash Thakur in the second over and clubbed four fours. Head then went after Gowtham and clobbered three sixes and a four.\n\nThe four and sixes just kept flowing as Head raced to 50 in 16 balls. He got there in the fifth over bowled by Naveen-ul-Haq, which cost Lucknow Super Giants 23 runs. Head ended up striking eight fours and eight sixes, while Abhishek clubbed eight fours and six maximums.\n\nFittingly, the winning runs came via a six as Abhishek launched a slot ball from Thakur over extra cover.\n\n(Click here to download the Cric Rocket app and get the latest scores and live updates on IPL 2024)\n\nBadoni, Pooran lift LSG to 165-4\n\nBatting first after winning the toss, LSG recovered from 66-4 to post 165-4 courtesy of an unbroken fifth wicket stand of 99 between Ayush Badoni (55* off 30) and Nicholas Pooran (48* off 26).\n\nQuinton de Kock (2) fell to Bhuvneshwar Kumar attempting the pull. He was caught at deep backward square leg by Nitish Kumar Reddy, who pulled off a brilliant rebound catch near the ropes. Marcus Stoinis (3) fell to another stunning piece of work in the field. He miscued a pull off Bhuvneshwar and Sanvir Singh took a well-judged catch, diving forward at mid-on.\n\nKrunal Pandya launched Jaydev Unadkat for consecutive sixes in the eighth over, the second of which was the 1000th six in IPL 2024. LSG, however, suffered a major setback as skipper KL Rahul (29 off 33) was dismissed at exactly the halfway stage of the innings. He clipped a good length ball from Pat Cummins to deep backward square leg.\n\nKrunal (24 off 21), who was looking good out in the middle, was run out by a brilliant direct hit from Cummins, attempting at risky single. At 66-4 in the 12th over, Lucknow were in deep trouble. However, Badoni and Pooran featured in a brilliant rearguard stand. Badoni struck nine fours in his knock, while Pooran hit six fours and a six.\n\nThe duo combined to hammer T Natarajan for 15 runs in the 19th over and followed it up with 19 runs in the last over bowled by Cummins - Pooran striking three fours in the last four balls.\n\nSRH vs LSG: Who won Player of the Match in yesterday's IPL 2024 match?\n\nBhuvneshwar was outstanding with the ball for SRH, registering figures of 2-12 in his four overs.

Ayush Badoni (55*) and Nicholas Pooran (47*) added an unbeaten 99 runs off 52 balls for the fifth wicket. Sunrisers Hyderabad chased down the target with 10 wickets in hand in just 9.1 overs.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar made early breakthroughs by dismissing Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis inside the powerplay. The visiting team managed to score just 27 runs for the loss of two wickets in the first six overs. Skipper KL Rahul failed to accelerate as he was dismissed for 29 runs off 33 balls.\n\nDuring the match, Matthew Hayden, who was on commentary, criticized the Lucknow Super Giants' top order due to their sluggish run-scoring rate in the batting power play. Hayden emphasized the need for more aggressive intent, stating that their slow powerplay hindered the team's progress.\n\n\"I have to call them out. This is not a 5 runs per over wicket. Somebody needed to show intent. They had one of the slowest powerplays. That took the innings nowhere. When the opposition team has Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen, your intention should be to go at 10s and over. 160-170 will never be enough,\" Hayden said in commentary.\n\nTravis Head and Abhishek Sharma added a 166-run stand in just 9.4 overs, setting a new record for the highest score by any team in 10 overs in IPL history. Head scored an unbeaten 89 off just 30 balls, including eight fours and six sixes. Abhishek scored 75* off 28 balls, featuring eight fours and six sixes.\n\nSRH moved to the third position in the standings with 14 points from 12 games. LSG is in the sixth spot with 12 points from an equal number of matches. The Pat Cummins-led team enhanced their playoff prospects, while LSG must win their remaining two matches to stay in contention for a playoff spot.\n\nIn a post-match interview, KL Rahul stated that he was at a loss for words after the opposition's batting performance. Rahul highlighted that the SRH openers showed an aggressive approach right from the start without giving a chance.\n\n\"I am lost for words. We have watched that batting on TV, but that was unreal. They didn't give a chance to see what the wicket was playing like, it didn't change much, but that mindset and freedom to tee off from ball one... the only way to stop them was wickets in the powerplay and we didn't do that,\" Rahul said.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Hayden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_de_Kock", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quinton de Kock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Nine runs later, Cummins ran out Pandya for 24 to leave LSG reeling at 66 for 4 in the 12th over. Badoni and Pooran then shared an unbeaten 99-run stand to take their team to a challenging total.", "source": {"uri": "sportzwiki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportzwiki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bishnoi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Thakur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yash Thakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naveen-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnappa_Gowtham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krishnappa Gowtham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

Well, that's what KL Rahul said a couple of years back. He probably has changed his take on that after looking at Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma up close at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, in Hyderabad. The opening duo of Sunrisers Hyderabad defined modern-day T20 cricket and smashed the ball all across the park to pick up a massive victory over Lucknow Super Giants at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. The visitors had no clue with the bat and looked amateur with the ball, as SRH won the game by 10 wickets.\n\nBatting first, Lucknow lost two early wickets of Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis and following this, skipper KL Rahul played one of the slowest knocks in IPL history. Even though the pitch was a batter paradise, Rahul made 29 runs off 33 balls. Being a skipper, he should have led by example but the opener never looked comfortable and that put pressure on LSG.\n\nHowever, Nicholas Pooran and Ayush Badoni took control of the situation and bailed LSG out of trouble. Badoni made 55* runs off 30 balls, while Pooran smashed 48* runs off 26 balls as LSG put 165 runs on the board in the first innings.\n\nEven though it never looked enough but SRH made it look ridiculously small. Head and Abhishek smashed 107 runs in the powerplay and even after that, they didn't stop and chased the total down in just 9.4 overs. Head hit 89* runs off 30 balls while Sharma smashed 75* runs off 28 deliveries as SRH picked up a massive win.\n\n1. KL Rahul - The Villain\n\nVillian may seem to be a harsh word but eventually, it turned out to be the bad guy. Being an opener, on that kind of pitch, Rahul should have played better cricket but the opener looked clueless. Having a strike rate of 87.88 is extremely poor and no team can afford that from their opener. Even in the second innings, when SRH were hitting boundaries for fun, he handed the ball to Ayush Badoni, which made little sense at that time. Overall, it was a tough day for KL Rahul.\n\n2. Pooran, Badoni rescued LSG\n\nPooran and Badoni's partnership of 99 runs rescued Lucknow. The other batters were extremely poor and just when it looked like LSG would not post a defendable total, Pooran and Badoni played some good cricket to put a respectable total on the board. Even though it wasn't enough in the end but it surely saved LSG from a humiliating defeat.\n\n3. Freak show of ridiculousness\n\nTravis Head and Abhishek Sharma changed T20 cricket. It is now safe to say that. The openers once again smacked boundaries for fun and broke many records in the process. They looked flawless which later KL Rahul appreciated as well and if the duo keeps up with the momentum, they can very well challenge for the title.\n\nAm lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on tv. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills. They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one. Once you are on the losing side, there are questions marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum. Ayush and Nicky batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well.\n\n(On did he change the pitch) Maybe Travis and Abhishek did. We just let them go, they are two guys who are very positive and I'm a bowler, it is tough for me to give them any inputs. He's been like this for 2 years, he hits the tough areas, hits the middle a lot, might not be super conventional. Just an incredible player of spin and pace. With just 2 fielders out, it is really difficult for the bowlers against them. I think the scores have gone up, and when the wickets are good, it is tough to come up with answers against batters when they get going. The boys have had a fantastic season, but to win this with less than 10 overs played in unreal.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

SRH, however, ruled the roost as Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma combined together to hammer 167 runs in just a matter of 58 balls.\n\nKL Rahul (3.5/10): The LSG skipper was simply disappointing with his innings of 29 that came at a miserable strike rate of 87.88.\n\nQuinton De Kock (2/10): Unfortunate to get dismissed courtesy of a sensational catch by Nitish Reddy.\n\nMarcus Stoinis (2/10): A poor show by the mighty Australian. He looked off colors and made only three runs.\n\nNicholas Pooran (8.5/10):\n\nPlayer with the highest strike rate (184.62) for LSG, Pooran did what he is known for - finishing innings with aplomb.\n\nAyush Badoni (8.5/10): The young talent hammered his 4th IPL fifty as he was crucial for LSG's first-innings.\n\nDeepak Hooda (5/10): Hooda didn't get any opportunity to bat or bowl vs SRH.\n\nKrunal Pandya (7/10): Came to bat at No.4 and made a decent 24 off 21. He should've played for more overs in order to capitalize on his start.\n\nKrishnappa Gowtham (4/10): Included in the team for this game, Gowtham didn't inspire much confidence.\n\nYash Thakur (4/10): Thakur was hammered for 47 runs in his 2.3 overs as he lacked penetration.\n\nRavi Bishnoi (4/10): The wily leg-spinner was tasked to bowl inside the powerplay against the fiery SRH duo but failed completely.\n\nNaveen-ul-Haq (4/10): Among the other LSG bowlers who had a tough night, the Afghani pacer also went for runs as he gave away 37 runs in his 2 overs.\n\nTravis Head (10/10): Batting for 30 balls, Head nearly struck at an astronomical rate of 300! He completely wreaked havoc, smashing 8 fours and as many sixes. The mighty southpaw hit 89* and won the POTM award.\n\nAbhishek Sharma (10/10):\n\nThe duo of Abhishek and Head ran the show at Uppal. The youngster, playing his 100th T20 match, clubbed 75* off 28, smashing some outstanding strokes in the process.\n\nNitish Reddy (7.5/10): While he didn't get any chance to bat or bowl, Reddy bagged an impressive catch at deep fine-leg.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen (5/10): Klaasen didn't get any chance to bat.\n\nShahbaz Ahmed (8/10): The wily left-arm spinner bowled just two overs but leaked just nine runs in the process.\n\nSanvir Singh (7.5/10): Similar to Reddy, there were no batting or bowling opportunity for Sanvir but he claimed a great diving catch to dismiss Stoinis.\n\nPat Cummins (6/10): A rare off day for SRH skipper, leaking 47 runs in his quota of 4 overs.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (9/10): 4-0-12-2 - these were the figures of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who bowled at his best vs LSG.\n\nJaydev Unadkat (7/10): Bowled just two overs but gave away 19 runs.\n\nVijayakanth Viyaskanth (8/10): A decent IPL debut for the Sri Lankan spinner. He looked calm in his spell of 0/27.\n\nT Natarajan (5/10): The left-armer, who was enjoying a stellar IPL 2024, had a terrible day at the office.

As we head into the final leg of IPL 2024, Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals are the only teams who look to be sitting with any degree of comfort. The other two spots are still up for grabs, with Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants among the frontrunners to claim them.\n\nWednesday's clash between SRH and LSG in Hyderabad is potentially a straight shootout as the winner shall gain a significant edge in the playoffs race, particularly with CSK boasting of a vastly superior net run rate at this point. All three teams have six wins and five losses apiece from their 11 games, and there isn't a lot to choose between the net run rates of SRH and LSG. All this points towards a potential high-voltage clash that could have a lot riding on it. Not surprisingly, both sides have endured a similar graph in terms of performances.\n\nSRH started the season with a bang, winning five of their first seven games and seemed to have gotten a head start to the playoffs race. Their refreshing high-intent approach with the bat blew teams away, leading to record-breaking totals and made them a side that nobody wanted to bowl at. However, the home side have just one win from their last four games, and that also was a very narrow one-run win against Rajasthan Royals at home. While Travis Head continues to motor along, the form of his opening partner Abhishek Sharma and middle-order enforcer Heinrich Klaasen appears to have dwindled.\n\nSRH were also forced to drop the out-of-form Aiden Markram for all-rounder Marco Jansen but that is another move which hasn't worked. The batting has tapered off a bit, particularly on relatively testing surfaces and Pat Cummins' men need to step it up before things go out of hand. While the batting has stagnated a bit, the bowling unit has certainly warmed up to the task led by Cummins himself with great support from Bhuvneshwar Kumar and T Natarajan. If SRH can rediscover their batting mojo, they could be hard to stop, especially at Hyderabad.\n\nLucknow Super Giants also began the season well, notching up three victories in their first four games but have struggled for consistency thereafter with alternate wins and losses. KL Rahul's side haven't had a winless drought as such but they have also suffered from lack of winning momentum which is crucial in the T20 format. The skipper himself hasn't really fired on a regular basis and while he is in the Orange Cap race once again, the opening batter hasn't had the impact that one would expect of him. Injuries have forced changes in LSG's bowling combinations as well with rookie speedgun Mayank Yadav lasting barely lasting three games.\n\nMohsin Khan also suffered an injury early on but has come back towards the latter half of the season. The problem for LSG has been the lack of sync in performances between the batting and bowling departments. When one part of their game has clicked, the other hasn't and their most recent clash against KKR saw them being blown away across all facets of the game. They do have a strong all-round side with all bases covered, so it should be about translating the squad potential into consistent on-field performances.\n\nIn such a high-stakes encounter, small margins may well decide the outcome of the game. There are several possible sub-plots in this fixture but how LSG's wily bowling fares against SRH's batting will be the main event.\n\nWhen: Wednesday, May 8 at 19:30 IST\n\nWhere: Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad\n\nWhat to expect: Surfaces at this venue have been extremely good for batting in recent times, starting from the ODI World Cup late last year to the ongoing IPL season. Average score batting first this season has been a shade above 212 with the 200-run mark breached thrice in the four games.\n\nHead to head: SRH 0-3 LSG. The visitors chased down 183 to win last year's fixture at this venue.\n\nTeam watch:\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad\n\nInjuries and availability: SRH don't have any concerns with respect to fitness and availability.\n\nTactics and matchups:\n\nPat Cummins has been outstanding in the middle overs this season. The SRH captain may have only picked six wickets during this phase (overs 7-15) but has an exceptional economy rate of 7.39 across 18 overs bowled - a tremendous stat considering the high-scoring season that this year has been. Cummins' role will be pivotal against LSG's enforcers in Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran and Deepak Hooda. SRH will be tempted to bring in Glenn Phillips who has been due to get a game for some time now. Marco Jansen will be the one to make way in such a scenario with Jaydev Unadkat expected to slot back in. There could also be a temptation to unleash the x-factor of Umran Malik.\n\nProbable XI: Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen(wk), Glenn Phillips, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat/Umran Malik. [Impact sub: T Natarajan]\n\nLucknow Super Giants\n\nInjuries/Availability: Apart from Mayank Yadav who is unlikely to play a part in the season finale, LSG have no concerns with injuries.\n\nTactics and matchups:\n\nMohsin Khan has been devastating against left-hand batters with seven wickets from 54 deliveries at an economy of 8.14. The left-arm seamer has also been potent with the new ball with five wickets in the PowerPlay and an economy of just 8.14. So, LSG will hope he can tie down SRH's dynamic left-left opening pair of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma. LSG will ponder about bringing back Quinton de Kock into their line-up, which could see Ashton Turner sitting out.\n\nProbable XI: KL Rahul(c), Quinton de Kock, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Deepak Hooda, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohsin Khan, Naveen-ul-Haq, Yash Thakur. [Impact player - Arshin Kulkarni]\n\nDid you know?\n\n- Nitish Reddy has been an under-rated middle overs enforcer for SRH, striking at 164.4 during this phase (overs 7-15) with eight fours and 11 sixes.\n\n- Marcus Stoinis has demolished pace this season, averaging 105 against them at an impressive strike rate of 161.54 with 23 fours and eight sixes.\n\nWhat they said:\n\n\"It's pretty clear for us, if you want to get to the top four, you got to win all the games.

on.\n\nSanvir first looked a bit far from the ball but did well with the full-length dive and held onto the catch at the same time.\n\nStoinis had a discussion with the on-field umpire but had to head back to the pavilion for just three runs in five balls.\n\nFor SRH, Bhuvneshwar picked up two wickets for just 12 runs in his four overs whereas skipper Pat Cummins took a wicket as well.\n\nALSO

Travis Head (89 off 30 balls) and Abhishek Sharma (75 off 28 balls) chased down the target in just 9.4 overs to help Sunrisers register a massive victory to strengthen their playoffs chances. On the other hand, this is the second-successive big loss for LSG in this season. LSG has suffered a humiliating defeat in hands of Kolkata Knight Riders earlier, getting bowled out for just 137 while chasing a mammoth 236 runs to win.\n\nOwner of the LSG team, Sanjiv Goenka, was clearly upset when he met captain Rahul after the match. Goenka was seen publicly showing anger over the cricket LSG played on the night and at times Rahul was seen explaining things to his boss. But to no avail as Goenka fumed in anger. English commentators said that maybe the owners needed to show their disappointment and ask for answers behind the walls of the dressing room. Even social media was not happy with the way Rahul was being slammed in public.\n\nCheck out how fans reacted to Goenka's outburst on Rahul and his team's poor show below:\n\nLSG had earlier won the toss and opted to bat first. The decision was not backed by a quick start by Lucknow as Rahul took 33 balls to score 29. This was the same pitch wherein Head and Abhishek smashed 160+ in less than 10 overs together. Quinton de Kock got out for just 2 and Marcus Stoinis could not do much either, scoring 3 off 5. Krunal Pandya played a slow knock of 24 off 21 balls. Nicholas Pooran (48 off 26) and Ayush Badoni (55 off 30) played wonderful knocks to take the team to a decent total of 165 for 4 in 20 overs.\n\nLucknow have defended these totals before, but not at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. Head and Abhishek displayed one of the rare batting performances in IPL, smashing 16 sixes and 14 fours to chase down the target in no time. The way LSG defended the total and how Rahul batted at the start may have angered the owner of the team. Later, the owner was also seen speaking, in an animated way, with coach Justin Langer, with Rahul looking on.\n\nLucknow have slipped to sixth spot with two more matches remaining. They have 12 points and the best they can get to is 16 points. They are still not out of the competition but will need big wins in the remaining matches.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Goenka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Goenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Langer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Langer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_de_Kock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quinton de Kock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krunal_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Krunal Pandya"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Coaching_and_Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Coaching and Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/05/09/1402473-untitled-design-2024-05-09t081327.125.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 17, "textEnd": 22}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The duo showed off their six-hitting skills against LSG chasing down the target of 166 runs in just 9.4 overs. LSG skipper KL Rahul tried five bowling options during this period but couldn't pick a single wicket as SRH romped in a crucial clash.\n\nThe Head-Abhishek duo slammed 16 fours and a staggering 14 sixes in the partnership of 58 balls to leave the Super Giants reeling defending the total which many felt was competitive. After the match, Rahul admitted that he felt helpless as they didn't give a chance for LSG to make a comeback in the contest. However, in this case, the visitors have themselves to blame for as they dropped Abhishek twice in the innings. But even then, his dismissal wouldn't have made much difference in the game.\n\n\"Am lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on tv. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills. They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one,\" Rahul said after the match.\n\nMoreover, the LSG skipper's decision to bat first is also being questioned now as the batters found it a little tough to get going on what seemed like a slow surface to start with. But despite not being any dew, the way SRH openers batters, the surface was certainly a belter. Responding to the decision at the toss, Rahul backed his decision but admitted they were around 50 runs short at the halfway mark.\n\n\"Once you are on the losing side, there are questions marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum. Ayush and Nicky batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well,\" the LSG captain added.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aditya_kukalyekar@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Aditya Kukalyekar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

The same goes with the Super Giants, and a loss in this game for any of these teams will push them away from the playoff spot.\n\nThe Sunrisers lacked skill in the game against the Mumbai Indians. Since the fall of their second wicket, they fell like a pack of cards, losing their four wickets for just 28 runs in the middle order. The lower order looked a little weak, quite surprisingly at this stage of the tournament. The form of Marco Jansen is another concern for them here.\n\nBefore the SRH vs LSG encounter, Lucknow lost to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), and that too by a 98-run margin damaged their net run rate quite heavily. Even in a 235-run chase, they started like a tortoise, and when wickets fell regularly, they lacked the sense of steadying the ship.\n\nThe Hyderabad side missed some firepower in the top order in the last IPL. Both Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma have offered them that, as well as Heinrich Klassen in the lower order. However, they would be little concerned about the form of their prime bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar.\n\nAlso Read: 'How Do You Fit Him In?'- Josh Hazlewood On Jake Fraser-McGurk T20 World Cup Omission\n\nHead and Sharma will continue to do the damage at the start of the innings. The former is fourth fourth-highest run-getter of the IPL 2024 with 444 runs at a strike rate of 189.74, while Abhishek has managed 326 runs at a strike rate of close to 200. Coming at number four or five, Heinrich Klassen too has shown his muscle for his 339 runs at a strike rate of 186.26.\n\nIn the bowling department, Thangarasu Natarajan has led the attack for his 15 wickets as the third highest-wicket taker of the season at an economy of just nine, especially bowling in the death overs coming into the SRH vs LSG clash. Pat Cummins too have offered them the gel of picking up wickets at the crucial juncture, with 13 scalps in 11 innings at an economy of 9.02. Bhuvneshwar Kumar, however, has struggled for his nine wickets so far in the tournament, at an economy of 9.73.\n\nMarco Jansen, in whatever little games he has played, looked to be losing his radar quite a bit, before the SRH vs LSG face-off. Wides and no ball have become his friends, which may push the team management to go with Fazalhaq Farooqi. The Afghanistan left-arm pacer has notched up six wickets in seven games of the IPL with an economy of 8.96.\n\nSRH's line-up vs LSG: Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klassen (wk.), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Sanvir Singh/ / Washington Sundar, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Marco Jansen/ Fazalhaq Farooqi (Impact Sub: T Natarajan)\n\nOne of the biggest struggles for the Lucknow team has been the off form of Quinton de Kock, who has managed 236 runs in this IPL in nine innings at a strike rate of 136.42 with three fifties. KL Rahul sits at number five in the most run-scoring list with 431 runs at a strike rate of 141.31.\n\nAlso Read: 'They Used MS Dhoni's Own Medicine Against Him'- Navjot Singh Sidhu On Master Stroke\n\nMarcus Stoinis has developed his numbers in the second half of the tournament. As they head into the SRH vs LSG clash, the Australia all-rounder has managed 352 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of 153.71 with a couple of fifties and one century.\n\nThe bowling has been their main issue, with only Yash Thakur in the top 20 wicket-takers list with 11 scalps at an economy of 8.85. Naveen-ul-Haq has done a decent job for his 10 wickets at an economy of 8.53. Ravi Bishnoi hasn't looked in good touch with just seven wickets at an average economy of 8.49.\n\nLSG's line-up vs SRH: KL Rahul (c & wk.), Kyle Mayers/ Arshin Kulkarni, Marcus Stoinis, Deepak Hooda, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Ashton Turner/Krishnappa Gowtham, Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-Haq, Mohsin Khan/ Yudhvir Singh.

Reddy made the catch look easy as he lobbed the ball back in when stepping over and came back in to claim it. Kumar struck again to dismiss dangerous Marcus Stoinis (3) as Sanvir Singh took a low catch diving forward at mid-on.\n\nLSG scored 27 runs in the Power Play-their slowest before this was 45. Debutant Vijayakanth Viyaskanth came for his first over and hit some perfect areas and gave only three in his first. First impressions of a leggie quick through the air, didn't turn any of the balls big, but showed his variations: the wrong'un, the front-of-the-hand ball.\n\nFirst impressions of a leggie quick through the air, didn't turn any of the balls big, but has shown his variations: the wrong'un, the front-of-the-hand ball. Skipper KL Rahul on the other end played the anchor role and was struggling with 20 runs in 25 deliveries but Krunal Pandya showed intent to score big when he launched back-to-back sixes to Jaydev Unadkat in the eighth over.\n\nA slower bouncer from Jaydev Unadkat, almost head high, but Pandya flat-batted it for a six over long-on. The next one was more orthodox, a drive back over Unadkat's head as he pitched it up and gave the pace. LSG were reeling on 45 for 2 in eight overs.\n\nSkipper Pat Cummins got the prize wicket of Rahul as he bowled on pace, sliding onto the pads, Rahul felt he had to have a swing at it and flicked it in the air, trying to go behind square on the leg side, but was caught at deep square, and went for 29 off 33. Cummins hit down the middle stump to get rid of Pandya on 24.\n\nFinally, the run rate went past six an over with Ayush Badoni maneuvering T Natarajan for three boundaries in the 14th over. Then Nicholas Pooran smashed a six of the debutant and Badoni ended the over with a boundary as Viyaskanth ended his spell without a wicket giving away 27 runs. T Natarajan went for 35 runs in three overs as Badoni moved around in the crease and managed to place him in the gaps. Badoni is not a power-hitter but in a game where the seven and over might be the going rate, his pitch was right up his alley.\n\nHe was 35 off 19, and the partnership went to 59 off 33 with Pooran. Both the batters collected 15 off Natarajan's last over and with a boundary on the very first ball of Cummins LSG went par 150. Badoni reached his fifty off just 28 balls and kept LSG alive in this contest. He has manipulated fields and the lines of the bowlers by moving around in the crease and has also played some orthodox shots just hard enough to clear the field. Unfortunately, Natarajan also got his fifty, conceding 15 in the 19th over.\n\nThe 52-ball 99-run partnership for the fifth wickets between Badoni and Pooran-highest for LSG for the fifth wickets- helped them to recover from 66 for 4 to 165 for 4 at the end of 20 overs. Badoni remained unbeaten on 55 as Pooran struck 26 balls 48.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitish_Kumar_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nitish Kumar Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanvir_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanvir Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

As we head into the final leg of IPL 2024, Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals are the only teams who look to be sitting with any degree of comfort. The other two spots are still up for grabs, with Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants among the frontrunners to claim them.\n\nWednesday's clash between SRH and LSG in Hyderabad is potentially a straight shootout as the winner shall gain a significant edge in the playoffs race, particularly with CSK boasting of a vastly superior net run rate at this point. All three teams have six wins and five losses apiece from their 11 games, and there isn't a lot to choose between the net run rates of SRH and LSG. All this points towards a potential high-voltage clash that could have a lot riding on it. Not surprisingly, both sides have endured a similar graph in terms of performances.\n\nSRH started the season with a bang, winning five of their first seven games and seemed to have gotten a head start to the playoffs race. Their refreshing high-intent approach with the bat blew teams away, leading to record-breaking totals and made them a side that nobody wanted to bowl at. However, the home side have just one win from their last four games, and that also was a very narrow one-run win against Rajasthan Royals at home. While Travis Head continues to motor along, the form of his opening partner Abhishek Sharma and middle-order enforcer Heinrich Klaasen appears to have dwindled.\n\nSRH were also forced to drop the out-of-form Aiden Markram for all-rounder Marco Jansen but that is another move which hasn't worked. The batting has tapered off a bit, particularly on relatively testing surfaces and Pat Cummins' men need to step it up before things go out of hand. While the batting has stagnated a bit, the bowling unit has certainly warmed up to the task led by Cummins himself with great support from Bhuvneshwar Kumar and T Natarajan. If SRH can rediscover their batting mojo, they could be hard to stop, especially at Hyderabad.\n\nLucknow Super Giants also began the season well, notching up three victories in their first four games but have struggled for consistency thereafter with alternate wins and losses. KL Rahul's side haven't had a winless drought as such but they have also suffered from lack of winning momentum which is crucial in the T20 format. The skipper himself hasn't really fired on a regular basis and while he is in the Orange Cap race once again, the opening batter hasn't had the impact that one would expect of him. Injuries have forced changes in LSG's bowling combinations as well with rookie speedgun Mayank Yadav lasting barely lasting three games.\n\nMohsin Khan also suffered an injury early on but has come back towards the latter half of the season. The problem for LSG has been the lack of sync in performances between the batting and bowling departments. When one part of their game has clicked, the other hasn't and their most recent clash against KKR saw them being blown away across all facets of the game. They do have a strong all-round side with all bases covered, so it should be about translating the squad potential into consistent on-field performances.\n\nIn such a high-stakes encounter, small margins may well decide the outcome of the game. There are several possible sub-plots in this fixture but how LSG's wily bowling fares against SRH's batting will be the main event.\n\nWhen: Wednesday, May 8 at 19:30 IST\n\nWhere: Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad\n\nWhat to expect: Surfaces at this venue have been extremely good for batting in recent times, starting from the ODI World Cup late last year to the ongoing IPL season. Average score batting first this season has been a shade above 212 with the 200-run mark breached thrice in the four games.\n\nHead to head:SRH 0-3 LSG. The visitors chased down 183 to win last year's fixture at this venue.\n\nTeam watch:\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad\n\nInjuries and availability:SRH don't have any concerns with respect to fitness and availability.\n\nTactics and matchups:\n\nPat Cummins has been outstanding in the middle overs this season. The SRH captain may have only picked six wickets during this phase (overs 7-15) but has an exceptional economy rate of 7.39 across 18 overs bowled - a tremendous stat considering the high-scoring season that this year has been. Cummins' role will be pivotal against LSG's enforcers in Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran and Deepak Hooda. SRH will be tempted to bring in Glenn Phillips who has been due to get a game for some time now. Marco Jansen will be the one to make way in such a scenario with Jaydev Unadkat expected to slot back in. There could also be a temptation to unleash the x-factor of Umran Malik.\n\nProbable XI:Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen(wk), Glenn Phillips, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat/Umran Malik. [Impact sub: T Natarajan]\n\nLucknow Super Giants\n\nInjuries/Availability: Apart from Mayank Yadav who is unlikely to play a part in the season finale, LSG have no concerns with injuries.\n\nTactics and matchups:\n\nMohsin Khan has been devastating against left-hand batters with seven wickets from 54 deliveries at an economy of 8.14. The left-arm seamer has also been potent with the new ball with five wickets in the PowerPlay and an economy of just 8.14. So, LSG will hope he can tie down SRH's dynamic left-left opening pair of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma. LSG will ponder about bringing back Quinton de Kock into their line-up, which could see Ashton Turner sitting out.\n\nProbable XI:KL Rahul(c), Quinton de Kock, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Deepak Hooda, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohsin Khan, Naveen-ul-Haq, Yash Thakur. [Impact player - Arshin Kulkarni]\n\nDid you know?\n\n- Nitish Reddy has been an under-rated middle overs enforcer for SRH, striking at 164.4 during this phase (overs 7-15) with eight fours and 11 sixes.\n\n- Marcus Stoinis has demolished pace this season, averaging 105 against them at an impressive strike rate of 161.54 with 23 fours and eight sixes.\n\nWhat they said:\n\n\"It's pretty clear for us, if you want to get to the top four, you got to win all the games.

SRH openers took their side to 167/0, becoming the first team in IPL history to chase down a target with the most balls to spare, 62 to be precise.\n\nThe Lucknow-based franchise had posted a total of 165/4 after being put in to bat first, thanks to knocks from Ayush Badoni (55 off 30) and Nicholas Pooran (48 off 26). However, little did they know the storm coming their way in the chase.\n\nHead (89* off 30) and Abhishek (75* off 28) took the LSG bowling attack to the cleaners from the very first ball. They put up a 100-run opening stand under the powerplay itself. The onslaught left the LSG camp shell-shocked.\n\nAlso read: LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka seen bickering with KL Rahul post SRH drubbing\n\nHead, awarded the Player of the Match, admitted they couldn't have expected to chase it down so dominantly.\n\n\"I don't think we could have ever expected chasing it like that. It looked like a tough wicket in the first innings, it looked like it was holding and a slow pitch. I guess, knowing that as a batter, you know that the powerplay is important. Trying to maximize that and we played beautifully, we were able to get ahead of the rate, which is nice,\" Head said at the post-match press conference.\n\nThis was SRH's third-century opening stand of the season, making them the only team with multiple 100+ partnerships. Head was full of praise for his aggressive opening partner, Abhishek. \"Nice to get a go, nice to be performing, and the partnership with Abhi has been fantastic. He's such an exciting talent for Indian cricket, he's exceptional,\" he added.\n\nAfter last night's win, SRH inch closer in the playoffs race, and with 14 points find themselves at the third position, below Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals.\n\nThe difference between the two teams' powerplay scores was the defining factor, according to LSG consultant Adam Voges.\n\n\"I think we're all in awe of what we've just seen. Sometimes you have to tip your hat and say well played to the opposition. (They) might have mis-hit one or two balls in the nine and bit overs that we bowled at them. Incredible batting, incredible hitting, clearly we didn't have an answer for,\" said Voges as quoted by Cricbuzz.\n\nAlso read: Pat Cummins passes witty remark after SRH demolish LSG in 9.4 overs\n\n\"What do you say, 2 for 20 odd as opposed to 100 for none, and that's the game in itself.

Pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar made them regret this decision by striking twice in the powerplay. First, in the third over, he removed an out-of-form Quinton de Kock for just two runs in five balls with Nitish Kumar Reddy taking a catch at deep backward square leg.\n\nIn the fifth over, Sanvir took a fine diving catch near mid-on, removing the in-form Marcus Stoinis for just three and giving Bhuvneshwar his second wicket. LSG was 21/2 in 4.2 overs.\n\nSkipper KL Rahul and Krunal Pandya joined forces, getting their team through the remainder of the powerplay. At the end of six overs, LSG was 27/2, with KL (19*) and Krunal (2*) unbeaten.\n\nIn the seventh over bowled by Jaydev Unadkat, Krunal relieved some pressure by smashing him for two sixes and getting his team a total of 15 runs out of it.\n\nBy drilling Cummins for a four towards mid-off, KL brought LSG to the 50-run mark in 9.1 overs. However, at the end of the over, he was dismissed by the SRH captain for a sluggish 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six. T Natrajan took the catch. LSG was 57/3 in 10 overs.\n\nLSG's situation became worse, with Cummins running out Krunal for 24 in 21 balls, with two sixes. LSG was 66/4 in 11.2 overs.\n\nThe 14th over bowled by Natrajan proved to be an expensive over for SRH, with Ayush Badoni hitting him for four boundaries and taking a total of 17 runs from the over.\n\nA boundary from Badoni helped Lucknow reach the 100-run mark in 15 overs. At that point, LSG was 102/4, with Badoni (23*) and Nicholas Pooran (18*) unbeaten.\n\nBadoni continued to pierce through the gaps, mainly targeting Natrajan. He brought up his fourth IPL fifty in 28 balls, with eight fours. At the end of 19 overs, LSG was 146/4, with Badoni (50*) and Pooran (34*) unbeaten.\n\nLSG ended their innings at 165/4 in their 20 overs, with Pooran-Badoni getting 19 runs in the final over. Badoni was unbeaten at 55 in 30 balls, with nine fours while Pooran scored 48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six. Both had a 99-run partnership.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the pick of the bowlers for SRH. Cummins (1/47) also got a wicket.

Follow Sportskeeda for top-notch ball-by-ball commentary from the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium for Live Score Updates\n\nFour teams, namely the Chennai Super Kings, the Delhi Capitals, the Lucknow Super Giants and the Sunrisers Hyderabad are now on 12 points. Of these, three (CSK, LSG and SRH) could get up to 18 points. However, only two can realistically make it to that 18-point mark.\n\nWhy, you may ask? Well, it is because LSG and SRH are on a collision course, and will clash on Wednesday, with only one of them getting up to 14, and retaining hopes of possibly ending the league campaign with 18 points.\n\nThis game, thus, already feels important. It will not be all doom and gloom for the team that loses, but given how much a shot in the arm this result and two points could be, neither would really want to lose this game. For the winner, the incentive and the reward is obvious - a step closer to the top four.\n\nSRH return home having been chastened away to Mumbai. Batting first, they could only muster 172 and then watched in disbelief as Suryakumar Yadav took the game away from them. As pitches have gotten tired, their batters have not hit the heights they did earlier in the season.\n\nThat particular downturn is embodied by Abhishek Sharma, who was so good in the first half but has huffed and puffed since. Travis Head, luckily for SRH, has been going strong, alongside the likes of Heinrich Klaasen and Nitish Kumar Reddy. SRH might also be tempted to include an extra overseas batter, especially at home. In that case, one of Aiden Markram or Glenn Phillips could get a look-in.\n\nBowling wise, they were brilliant for the first few overs against Mumbai. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Pat Cummins got the ball to move. Once the movement disappeared, though, they were left scurrying for answers. The bowling attack, cumulatively, will have to get their act together, given the Super Giants have a fearsome batting line-up themselves.\n\nSpeaking of LSG, they have also not been able to put together a string of victories. A win has usually been followed by a defeat and vice versa. Now, though, they have to keep on winning.\n\nFor that, they will hope their captain KL Rahul fires at the top of the order. Quinton de Kock could also get a recall if he has regained full fitness. Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran could be crucial on what has been a six-hitting ground this season, with Deepak Hooda's role, especially against spin, also vital.\n\nWith the ball, they will be tested. But LSG will hope the likes of Krunal Pandya, Mohsin Khan and Ravi Bishnoi can hold their own. Naveen-ul-Haq is likely to feature as their only overseas pacer and how he handles himself when SRH come hard at him, could decide how many runs SRH score.\n\nWherever you look, there is an intriguing sub-plot, and that ties into this home stretch of the IPL. The stakes are high, and both teams know the pitfalls of another defeat.

Both teams have 12 points in 11 matches and are in the race for the playoffs.\n\nHost SRH lost their last game against the Mumbai Indians (MI) by seven wickets. Batting first, SRH posted 173 runs, with Travis Head (48) scoring the most. Hyderabad got off to a good start as they picked up three wickets for 31 runs. However, after that, it was all about Suryakumar Yadav who scored a brilliant century.\n\nThe Indian batter remained unbeaten on 102 and guided MI to an easy victory. SRH will be hoping for better performances from their players when they face LSG and take two important points for a place in the playoffs.\n\nOn the other hand, LSG lost their last game to the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) by 98 runs. Chasing 236 runs, no batter got going for LSG, as their highest scorer was Marcus Stoinis with 36 runs.\n\nIf we look at the head-to-head record, both teams have faced each other three times, with LSG coming on top on all occasions. In these three matches, we have seen some good performances, and in this article, we will look at the top three knocks in SRH-LSG matches in the IPL.\n\nTop 3 knocks in SRH-LSG IPL matches\n\n#3 Nicholas Pooran went berserk to win it for LSG (44* off 13 balls)\n\nSRH won the toss and chose to bat first in the 58th match of the IPL 2023, held in Hyderabad. Thanks to decent innings from Heinrich Klassen (47) and Abdul Samad (37*), SRH posted 182 runs in 20 overs.\n\nIn reply, LSG lost Kyle Mayers early. Prerak Mankad and Marcus Stoinis then stitched together a good 73-run partnership before the latter got out on 40 runs. Nicholas Pooran came to bat when LSG needed 56 off 27 balls.\n\nThe West Indian batter hit three sixes on his first three balls. Pooran went on to score 44 runs off just 13 balls with the aid of three fours and four sixes. Meanwhile, Mankad remained unbeaten on 64 runs as the duo guided LSG to a win.\n\n#2 Prerak Mankad played a sensible knock to take LSG home (64* off 45 balls)\n\nIt was in the same match that Pooran went berserk. However, in the initial stages, it was Prerak Mankad who formed good partnerships with other batters. He stitched together a 42-run partnership for the second wicket with Quinton de Kock and 73 runs with Marcus Stoinis for the third.\n\nThe Indian batter remained unbeaten on 64 off 45 balls. His knock was studded with seven fours and two sixes. Mankad stayed at the crease till the end with Nicholas Pooran to help LSG emerge victorious.\n\n#1 Captain KL guiding LSG to a decent total (68 off 50 balls)\n\nLSG was asked to bat first in the 12th match of IPL 2022, played at Dr. DY Patil Stadium. LSG lost three wickets for 27 runs. However, KL Rahul and Deepak Hooda (51) forged a good partnership to steady the ship for Lucknow after early blows. Rahul scored 68 runs off 50 balls with the help of six fours and one six to guide LSG to a 169-run total.\n\nIn response, Avesh Khan led the way for LSG as he took four wickets.

Head and Abhishek smashed the LSG bowlers to a pulp, coasting to a facile 10-wicket win and chasing down the target of 166 runs in just 9.4 overs in the City of the Nizams on Wednesday.\n\nAt the post-match press conference, Head opened up about his record-breaking partnership with Abhishek, who struck a whirlwind 75 off just 28 balls. Head lauded his opening partner with whom he stitched their third 100-plus opening stand of the season.\n\n\"Abhishek Sharma is an exciting talent for Indian cricket, kind of exceptional. We kind of complement each other. He is very very enjoyable to be around. He is very very excited and thinks about the game,\" Head said at a post-match press conference. The powerplay, a phase of the match the Sunrisers have dominated in the tournament so far, set the stage for this victory. They scored an incredible 107 runs during the powerplay overs, practically snuffing out any hopes of a comeback that Lucknow may have entertained and took their team to within a touching distance of the target in under 10 overs.\n\nThe persistent and ferocious assault by the SRH openers was simply too much for the LSG bowlers to handle. After posting a reasonable and fighting target of 167 on the board, the Sunrisers, riding on the exploits of the opening duo, cantered home in just 9.4 overs. The fireworks by the willow-wielders yet again reaffirmed the team's formidable batting lineup, which is arguably among the most feared this ongoing IPL season.\n\n\"Yeah, very happy with how we operate in power play and also glad to see how we scored runs outside of power play today. At time out we spoke about NRR (Net Run Rate) being important. Very pleased that checked out,\" he added. LSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got off to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in the first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six.\n\nIn the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55* in 30 balls, with nine fours) and Nicholas Pooran (48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six) turned things around with a 99-run stand, putting a score of 165/4 in 20 overs for LSG. In the run-chase of 166 runs, openers Travis Head (89* in 30 balls, with eight fours and eight sixes) and Abhishek Sharma (75* in 28 balls, with eight fours and six sixes) launched what seemed like a never-ending assault on LSG batters, helping SRH chase down the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket.\n\nSRH is at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points.

Fourth-placed Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and fifth-placed Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) will lock horns in Hyderabad. Both teams currently have 12 points from 11 matches, and this match will be crucial to both teams' fortunes as they only hang in the middle of the table.\n\nThe only scheduled fixture between these two teams comes at the most crucial juncture in the season for both of them. The loser of this game will put their playoff chances in serious jeopardy. Both these teams are also coming off dire losses in their respective last matches. This match starts a streak of three consecutive home matches for SRH, who have completed all their home matches, and three consecutive away games for LSG, who have finished all their home matches.\n\nIn their last match, which was at Lucknow, LSG lost by a completely comprehensive 98 runs to KKR who had put up the highest T20 total at Lucknow with help from Sunil Narine. Narine returned to share the spoils in a team bowling effort that took KKR to the top of the points table.\n\nSRH were also beaten rather comprehensively in their last match against Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium. Travis Head and Pat Cummins added respectability to a total that was never going to be enough even though SRH gave themselves hope with early inroads. But Suryakumar Yadav's century completely stole the show as SRH slumped to a loss.\n\nPitches that are not explicitly flat are ruling the norm in the second half of IPL 2024. The pitch at Hyderabad is also following this pattern, making batting not as easy as the early season made it seem. This is the same stadium where SRH piled 277, but that is only the exception. Even though 200 was posted in both innings in the last game, the pitch still poses enough challenges for the batters.\n\nOut of 75 matches played, 34 games have been won batting first without a match ending in a no result. The average first innings score at the renowned Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium has been 162.\n\nChasing seems to be a more favourable setting to be on as far as this pitch is concerned. There will be early movement, especially in the powerplay that will be tough for the batters to navigate. SRH's heavy batting seems to have mellowed down the last few matches, something that LSG can exploit.\n\nSRH don't have the best track record chasing this season either and that will play an important role in this match. The important matchups for this match are KL Rahul vs Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Marcus Stoinis vs Pat Cummins, Yash Thakur vs Travis Head, Mohsin Khan vs Abhishek Sharma, and Krunal Pandya vs Heinrich Klaasen, respectively.\n\nThe nature of the pitch means that the openers will face problems early. And KL Rahul will have to navigate the challenges posed by Bhuvneshwar Kumar. So far in the IPL, Rahul has scored 98 runs off 81 balls against Kumar with just one dismissal at a strike rate of 120.98 and an average of 98.\n\nMayank Agarwal's return to the SRH playing XI did not go as expected, and going by history, Marcus Stoinis looks to be the person who has the best chance of keeping that way. In 21 balls, Agarwal has scored 32 runs off Stoinis while being dismissed twice at a strike rate of 152.38 and an average of 16.\n\nWhile he terrorized bowling lineups on flat pitches, Travis Head has also been SRH's most consistent batsman once the pitches slowed down. He will again need to bring his consistency to the table to ensure SRH's respectability with the bat.\n\nMarcus Stoinis has been consistently delivering for LSG with both bat and ball, and he will be required to bring out the stops once again and save LSG's potentially debilitating fortunes.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Narine", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Narine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Result_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Result (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohsin_Khan_(Indian_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohsin Khan (Indian cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Thakur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yash Thakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Agarwal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Agarwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

Both teams are coming off losses and would be desperate to get back on the winning track as the race to the playoffs heats up. Sunrisers are placed at No. 4 on the points table, with six wins and five losses from 11 games. Lucknow are placed right below them at No. 5, with an identical win-loss record but an inferior net run rate (NRR).\n\nAlso Check: IPL 2024 Points Table\n\nSRH will be playing their last three games of the season at their home ground. They have been arguably the most formidable batting side in the tournament. Travis Head is the fourth-highest run-getter in the tournament, having amassed 444 runs in 10 innings at an average of 44.40 and a strike rate of 189.74. Abhishek Sharma had a fantastic start to the season but his performances have dipped in recent games. Heinrich Klaasen, meanwhile, has been in scintillating form, scoring 339 runs from 11 games at an average of 42.38 and a strike rate of 186.26.\n\nT Natarajan has been the standout bowler for SRH. The left-arm pacer has bagged 15 wickets in nine matches at an average of 21.29. He has bowled some excellent overs at the death and has a strike rate of 19. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and skipper Pat Cummins have also given some solid performances in some of the games. However, the absence of a quality spinner is visible.\n\nAlso Check: IPL Purple Cap - Most Wickets\n\nLucknow's star performer with the bat has been captain KL Rahul. He hasn't looked at his mesmerising best but has managed to accumulate 431 runs from 11 innings at an average of 39.18 and a strike rate of 141.31. Meanwhile, Marcus Stoinis has played some fantastic knocks, including the match-winning century against Chennai Super Kings that helped LSG track down a daunting 211-run target in Chennai. In 11 matches, he has scored 352 runs at an average of 39.11 and has a strike rate of 153.71. The Australian cricketer has also bagged four wickets in seven innings.\n\nRavi Bishnoi's abysmal form has hurt Lucknow's campaign this season. Yash Thakur and Naveen-ul-Haq have bowled well in patches, picking up 11 wickets from nine matches and 10 wickets from seven matches. Krunal Pandya has managed only five wickets from 11 matches but has been relatively economical, conceding runs at 7.63 per over.\n\nAlso Check: SRH vs LSG Match 57 Prediction - Who will win?\n\nThe Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium has been a paradise for the batters this season. In the four games that have been played this season, 213 is the average first innings score. Three out of the four games have been won by teams batting first. In the last two games, captains who won the toss chose to bat first and it paid dividends. Batting first could be a good option but posting a target in excess of 200 would be crucial. Anything less than 200 could be a cakewalk if the surface is similar to the ones that the colossal venue has offered in IPL 2024.\n\nMayank Agarwal was brought back into the side in place of Anmolpreet Singh in SRH's last game against Mumbai Indians. However, the move didn't work as the veteran batter departed cheaply. If the pitch turns out to be a belter, Sunrisers could opt to bolster their bowling resources and recall Mayank Markande. Rest of the team should remain unchanged.\n\nPredicted XI: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (WK), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins (C), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markande, Jaydev Unadkat\n\nImpact Player: T Natarajan\n\nLucknow suffered a shambolic 98-run defeat against Kolkata Knight Riders in the last game. 19-year-old Arshin Kulkarni came in as the Impact Player and opened alongside KL Rahul but failed to make a mark once again. However, LSG will want to give the talented youngster a longer rope before looking for replacements. Mayank Yadav was ruled out of the last match due to injury. If he recovers in time, he would come in for Yudhvir Singh Charak, who played his first match of the season in the last game.\n\nPredicted XI: KL Rahul (C & WK), Marcus Stoinis, Deepak Hooda, Nicholas Pooran, Ashton Turner, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-Haq, Mohsin Khan, Yash Thakur", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

But then the LSG's bowling attack brutally failed, as the SRH's dangerous opening pair of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma hammered them cruelly.\n\nThe SRH duo wasted no time in their onslaught, with Head (89 runs off 30 balls) reaching his half-century in just 16 balls, and his opening partner Abhishek (75 runs off 28 balls) closely following him by achieving the same feat in just 19 deliveries to chase down the target of 166 runs in just 9.4 overs.\n\nHowever, this embarrassing defeat was not enough for the Lucknow camp, as the post-match drama escalated at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium with cameras capturing LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka engaging in a heated exchange with captain KL Rahul after the match.\n\nHowever, it is still unknown what was being said between the two during the intense conversation, but the LSG owner, Goenka, looked too angry while talking to the skipper, Rahul. While Mr. Goenka was animated while expressing his emotions, Rahul maintained his composure and calmly heard him out while replying to some of the owner's suggestions.\n\nAs all this happened on Live TV, this unexpected controversy quickly garnered attention and criticism online, with many commentators slamming Goenka for expressing his anger at the skipper Rahul in front of the media and the whole world.\n\nSpeaking on the live controversy, one commentator opined on the Jio Cinema: \"You always feel these conversations should be happening behind closed doors. There are so many cameras around the stadium and they miss nothing. You know KL Rahul is now gonna go to press conferences and other things and potentially explain what's been discussed here.\"\n\nOn the other hand, former New Zealand cricketer and commentator Scott Styris hailed Rahul for his professionalism and his ability to handle the situation with maturity. Styris said: \"He has done well to keep his cool here. I think you are bang on.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rahul said at the post-match press conference: \"I am lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six-hitting skills (on Head and Abhishek). They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one.\"\n\nThe LSG skipper admitted that teams are often criticized after the loss. Rahul further said that the LSG fell short by 40-50 runs due to early wickets during the powerplay phase.

LSG needs to defend 166 runs to get their seventh win of the tournament.\n\nAfter winning the toss, LSG opted to bat first. Pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar made them regret this decision by striking twice in the powerplay. First, in the third over, he removed an out-of-form Quinton de Kock for just two runs in five balls with Nitish Kumar Reddy taking a catch at deep backward square leg. In the fifth over, Sanvir took a fine diving catch near mid-on, removing the in-form Marcus Stoinis for just three and giving Bhuvneshwar his second wicket. LSG was 21/2 in 4.2 overs.\n\nSkipper KL Rahul and Krunal Pandya joined forces, getting their team through the remainder of the powerplay. At the end of six overs, LSG was 27/2, with KL (19*) and Krunal (2*) unbeaten. In the seventh over bowled by Jaydev Unadkat, Krunal relieved some pressure by smashing him for two sixes and getting his team a total of 15 runs out of it.\n\nBy drilling Cummins for a four towards mid-off, KL brought LSG to the 50-run mark in 9.1 overs. However, at the end of the over, he was dismissed by the SRH captain for a sluggish 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six. T Natrajan took the catch. LSG was 57/3 in 10 overs. LSG's situation became worse, with Cummins running out Krunal for 24 in 21 balls, with two sixes. LSG was 66/4 in 11.2 overs.\n\nThe 14th over bowled by Natrajan proved to be an expensive over for SRH, with Ayush Badoni hitting him for four boundaries and taking a total of 17 runs from the over. A boundary from Badoni helped Lucknow reach the 100-run mark in 15 overs. At that point, LSG was 102/4, with Badoni (23*) and Nicholas Pooran (18*) unbeaten.\n\nBadoni continued to pierce through the gaps, mainly targeting Natrajan. He brought up his fourth IPL fifty in 28 balls, with eight fours. At the end of 19 overs, LSG was 146/4, with Badoni (50*) and Pooran (34*) unbeaten. LSG ended their innings at 165/4 in their 20 overs, with Pooran-Badoni getting 19 runs in the final over. Badoni was unbeaten at 55 in 30 balls, with nine fours while Pooran scored 48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six. Both had a 99-run partnership.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the pick of the bowlers for SRH. Cummins (1/47) also got a wicket.

Following a low scoring target of 166, the pair, who were both left-handed specialists, hit the target with ease in just 9.4 overs, sealing an emphatic victory.\n\nChoosing to bat first, KL Rahul's LSG struggled to build momentum and suffered early losses in their innings. They ended the innings at 165/4 in 20 overs, despite late contributions from Nicholas Pooran (48) and Ayush Badoni (55). The most impressive player for the SRH was Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who took two wickets for just 12 runs in his allotted four overs.\n\nWith this overwhelming victory, SRH's standings position is strengthened and their net run rate (+0.406) is significantly increased, positioning them favourably for a postseason spot. With 12 games played and 14 points gained, they are well-positioned to solidify their standing with a win.\n\nThe Lucknow Super Giants, on the other hand, have only managed 12 points from 12 games and are mired in sixth place. Their plight was made worse with the loss in Hyderabad, when their net run rate fell to -0.769.\n\nIPL 2024 Points Table After SRH vs LSG\n\nIPL 2024: Orange Cap Race After SRH vs LSG\n\nAt the helm of the batting leaderboard stands Virat Kohli, showcasing his prowess with an impressive tally of 542 runs amassed from 11 innings, boasting an average of 67.75.

Positioned fifth on the points table with six wins in 11 matches, LSG is determined to secure victory and climb above SRH in the standings. Currently, both teams are tied at 12 points, with SRH occupying the fourth spot.\n\nAt this pivotal juncture in the IPL 2024 season, every aspect of a match is under intense scrutiny, given the profound impact each result holds, not only for the participating teams but for the tournament as a whole. As we approach the final stretch, Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals seem to be in a relatively comfortable position, while the race for the remaining two playoff berths remains fiercely contested. Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Lucknow Super Giants are among the top contenders vying for these coveted spots.\n\nThe upcoming clash between SRH and LSG in Hyderabad on Wednesday looms as a crucial showdown, potentially offering the victor a decisive advantage in the playoff race, especially considering CSK's significantly superior net run rate. With all three teams having secured six wins and suffered five losses in their 11 games, and with minimal disparity in the net run rates of SRH and LSG, the stage is set for a high-stakes encounter. Unsurprisingly, both sides have experienced similar fluctuations in their performances throughout the season.\n\nSRH kicked off the season with an impressive display, securing victory in five of their initial seven matches, establishing themselves as frontrunners in the playoffs race. Their dynamic batting approach proved to be a force to be reckoned with, as they set new records with their aggressive intent, making them a formidable opponent for any team. However, their recent form tells a different story, with just one win in their last four games, narrowly clinching a victory against Rajasthan Royals at home by a mere run.\n\nWhile Travis Head continues to impress, the performances of his opening counterpart Abhishek Sharma and middle-order mainstay Heinrich Klaasen have faltered. The decision to replace the out-of-form Aiden Markram with all-rounder Marco Jansen has yet to yield the desired results, further adding to their batting woes. Particularly on challenging pitches, their batting prowess seems to have diminished, necessitating a resurgence before matters escalate. On the brighter side, the bowling department has shown promise, spearheaded by the leadership of Pat Cummins, ably supported by Bhuvneshwar Kumar and T Natarajan. If SRH can reignite their batting prowess, especially on their home ground in Hyderabad, they could pose a formidable challenge for their opponents.\n\nLucknow Super Giants also had a promising start to the season, securing three victories in their first four matches. However, they have struggled to maintain consistency since then, alternating between wins and losses. KL Rahul's team hasn't experienced a prolonged winless streak, but they have lacked the essential winning momentum crucial in T20 cricket. While Rahul himself is in contention for the Orange Cap once again, his performances haven't been as impactful as expected, particularly as an opening batsman.\n\nInjuries have disrupted LSG's bowling combinations, with rookie speedster Mayank Yadav lasting only three games before succumbing to injury. Although Mohsin Khan suffered an injury early on, he has made a comeback in the latter half of the season. The main challenge for LSG lies in synchronizing performances between their batting and bowling units. Often, when one aspect of their game excels, the other falters, as evidenced in their recent defeat against KKR where they struggled in all facets of the game. Despite possessing a well-rounded squad, LSG must translate their potential into consistent on-field performances.\n\nIn a match of such high stakes, the outcome may hinge on small margins. While there are various intriguing subplots, the pivotal battle between LSG's crafty bowling and SRH's batting lineup is likely to take center stage.\n\nThe Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad offers a batting paradise for teams. With a surface conducive to stroke play, runs flow freely, setting the stage for potentially high-scoring encounters. Given the favorable conditions, the team winning the toss is likely to choose to bat first, aiming to set a formidable total.\n\nConsistently, surfaces at this venue have favored batsmen, evident from the recent ODI World Cup late last year to the ongoing IPL season. The average score batting first this season has exceeded 212, with the 200-run milestone surpassed thrice in four games, highlighting the pitch's propensity for producing high-scoring contests.\n\nSRH has no concerns regarding fitness or availability, ensuring they can field their best possible lineup for the upcoming match.\n\nPat Cummins has showcased his prowess in the middle overs throughout this season, despite only securing six wickets in the crucial phase spanning overs 7-15. What's truly remarkable is his exceptional economy rate of 7.39 across 18 overs bowled, a standout statistic considering the high-scoring nature of this year's IPL. His role becomes even more pivotal as Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) gear up to face formidable enforcers in Lucknow Super Giants' (LSG) lineup, including Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, and Deepak Hooda.\n\nIn light of their recent performances, SRH might be inclined to introduce Glenn Phillips into the playing XI, a move long overdue for the talented batsman. Should Phillips be given the nod, it's likely that Marco Jansen would make way, potentially making room for Jaydev Unadkat's return to the side. Additionally, there's a tantalizing prospect of unleashing the x-factor of Umran Malik, adding an extra dimension to SRH's bowling arsenal.\n\nExcept for Mayank Yadav, who is unlikely to participate in the season finale, Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) have no injury concerns heading into the crucial match.\n\nMohsin Khan has emerged as a formidable force against left-handed batters, claiming seven wickets from just 54 deliveries at an impressive economy rate of 8.14. Additionally, his effectiveness with the new ball is evident, having snared five wickets in the PowerPlay while maintaining an economy rate of just 8.14. Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) will rely on his prowess to contain Sunrisers Hyderabad's (SRH) dynamic left-left opening pair of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma.\n\nConsidering Khan's proficiency, LSG may contemplate reintroducing Quinton de Kock into their lineup. This strategic move could potentially see Ashton Turner being omitted from the playing XI as LSG seeks to bolster their batting prowess.\n\nIn the upcoming game against Lucknow Super Giants, all eyes will be on Sunrisers Hyderabad's Travis Head, who has emerged as a standout performer with the bat. Having amassed 444 runs in his last 10 matches, Head ranks among the highest run-scorers of the tournament. His stellar performance will be instrumental for Sunrisers Hyderabad against LSG, given his consistent contributions throughout the season. Notably, Head has already notched up three half-centuries and one century in this edition of the IPL, further highlighting his batting prowess and significance in the upcoming clash.\n\nIn the upcoming game against Sunrisers Hyderabad, all eyes will be on Lucknow Super Giants' Naveen-ul-Haq, who has been in stellar form with the ball. The Afghan pacer has been a key contributor for his side, claiming 10 wickets in his last seven matches. Known for picking crucial wickets at crucial moments, Naveen-ul-Haq's presence will be crucial for LSG's bowling attack against SRH. With a confidence-boosting performance in the previous game, where he picked up three wickets against Kolkata Knight Riders, Naveen-ul-Haq will be eager to replicate his success in the upcoming encounter.", "source": {"uri": "technosports.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechnoSports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First-class cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Yadav", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Both teams look for their seventh victory in the 12th game of the season to stay ahead for the playoffs spot.\n\nWhat's important in the middle overs of the T20s is how the teams keep their good work in the powerplay intact, or if they have a tough start, how they get back into the game with a few big overs. Sunrisers Hyderabad have done a great job in this department.\n\nThe strike rate of 143.43 in the middle overs for the SRH is still the fourth best going into the SRH vs LSG clash, whereas the Lucknow team have a strike rate of 137.37, seventh in the rank of the ten teams. It's quite good given they have lost 28 wickets in this section across the 11 innings, while Hyderabad have lost 29 in the same number of games.\n\nThe issue for the hosts in the middle overs is their bowling. Their 9.67 economy is the second highest among the ten teams in 11 innings, while Lucknow have the third-best economy of 8.41 in this period.\n\nComing into the SRH vs LSG clash, the hosts have picked up 26 wickets in this period inside 11 innings, while the Super Giants have 23 wickets in their pocket. The spinners of Hyderabad haven't done a great job, with only 12 wickets so far, the least among all the teams, but at an economy of 11.72, the highest among all the franchises.\n\nAlso Read: 'They Used MS Dhoni's Own Medicine Against Him'- Navjot Singh Sidhu On Master Stroke\n\nThat pushes them to concede 48 sixes in that nine-over period, which is the third most of the IPL 2024, while Lucknow has given away 37 over boundaries in this tournament.\n\nEven though the game is in Hyderabad, if the Lucknow side could restrict the hosts for low overs in the middle phase of the game, they could come out on top in this SRH vs LSG clash.\n\nIn the last SRH vs LSG face-off, which coincidentally also took place in Hyderabad, the visitors gained a comfortable seven-wicket victory over the hosts. Batting first, Hyderabad reached 182/6 in 20 overs, thanks to Krunal Pandya restricting them to 2/24 in four overs. Lucknow made an easy chase, shouldering on the unbeaten 64-run knock from Prerak Mankad.\n\nAlso Read: Shaheen Shah Afridi Among Nominees For ICC Men's Player Of The Month Award For April\n\nIn the three encounters of the SRH vs LSG affair, the Lucknow side have a 3-0 winning margin over the Sunrisers.", "source": {"uri": "sportzwiki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportzwiki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_playoff_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Page playoff system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MS Dhoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prerak_Mankad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prerak Mankad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navjot_Singh_Sidhu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Navjot Singh Sidhu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krunal_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Krunal Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaheen_Afridi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaheen Afridi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sportzwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GC_17jFXsAAvZxQ-1-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Lucknow easily blew away Hyderabad with seven wickets in hand in Hyderabad in 2023.\n\nBowling with the new ball in the powerplay sets the game for the team, and the trend so far suggests the same in this IPL 2024. Hyderabad have picked up 19 wickets in 11 innings so far during the first six overs of this IPL, whereas Lucknow stands neck-to-neck with the same number of wickets (19), before the SRH vs LSG encounter.\n\nHyderabad have gone for runs in the powerplay at an economy of 9.64, which has been quite average in this tournament, while on the other hand, Lucknow's economy of 9.02, is the fourth-best of the competition so far in this period.\n\nThey also have conceded only 16 sixes so far, the second best in this IPL 2024, while Hyderabad bowlers have been smashed for 28 over boundaries in the tournament so far, in the powerplay.\n\nAlso Read: 'RCB Made Even A 150-run Chase Interesting'- Deep Dasgupta Points RCB's Sudden Collapse\n\nFor the Sunrisers, Bhuvneshwar Kumar seems to have got his mojo back with eight wickets so far inside the powerplay, but at a terrific economy of 7.85 in 11 innings. Mohsin Khan stands tall for the LSG, but his five powerplay wickets have come at a high economy of 8.88, going into the SRH vs LSG face-off.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad Probable XI: Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klassen (wk.), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Sanvir Singh/ / Washington Sundar, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Marco Jansen/ Fazalhaq Farooqi\n\nImpact Sub: T Natarajan.\n\nLucknow Super Giants Probable XI: KL Rahul (c & wk.), Kyle Mayers/ Arshin Kulkarni, Marcus Stoinis, Deepak Hooda, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Ashton Turner/Krishnappa Gowtham, Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-Haq, Mohsin Khan/ Yudhvir Singh.\n\nImpact Sub: Yash Thakur/ Arshad Khan.\n\nAlso Read: DC vs RR Dream11 Prediction, Match Preview, Points Table, head to Head, Match info, Weather & Pitch report, Fantasy Stats and Match Prediction for Match 56 in IPL 2024\n\nBest Batter Prediction: Travis Head\n\nThe dynamic Australia batter Travis Head has notched up 444 runs so far in this IPL 2024 at a strike rate of 189.74. His record in Hyderabad has been excellent with 182 runs in five innings at a strike rate of 155.6 with a couple of fifties. He looked a bit out of touch in the last few games, but this is he could go berserk.\n\nBest Bowler Prediction: Bhuvneshwar Kumar.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar has looked in supreme touch in this IPL 2024, especially in the powerplay with the new ball.

Nice to get this done in 10 overs. Abhi and I have had a few partnerships like this. Just concentrate on getting in good positions, watch the ball hard and try to maximise the powerplay.\n\n\"(On his spin hitting) It is something I have been working on, it will be a big part in the Caribbean as well. It is important to go 360 in the modern game. (On fearless cricket) The last 12 months, that's how they wanted me to play in the Aussie team, and that's what I've been told to do here as well. Nothing much that I have to change.\n\n\"(On Abhishek Sharma) I know how hard he works and how deep he thinks, his spin play is second to none. We compliment each other very well. Nice to see him back amongst the runs after missing out the last couple of game.\n\n\"(On NRR) We didn't think about it till the Timeout, but after that the boys came out and told us to score quickly. The crowd was exceptional tonight, that's what we needed after losing the last two.\n\n\"(On David Warner) I haven't got many things over him, so that's good to know that I have more runs than David Warner did in his first SRH season. We start again whenever we come out here for the next game.\"\n\nPat Cummins: \"(On did he change the pitch) Maybe Travis and Abhishek did. We just let them go, they are two guys who are very positive and I'm a bowler, it is tough for me to give them any inputs.\n\n\"(On Travis Head) He's been like this for 2 years, he hits the tough areas, hits the middle a lot, might not be super conventional. (On Abhishek Sharma) Just an incredible player of spin and pace. With just 2 fielders out, it is really difficult for the bowlers against them.\n\n\"(On where the game is headed) I think the scores have gone up, and when the wickets are good, it is tough to come up with answers against batters when they get going. The boys have had a fantastic season, but to win this with less than 10 overs played is unreal.\"\n\nAbhishek Sharma: \"I would never think of coming to such a tournament and playing at such a strike rate, but thanks to the team management. The message was clear from them and I backed myself. All the credit goes to him (Head).\n\n\"The way he starts against all bowlers.. he goes after them from the start and takes the pressure off. The bowlers told us (during the innings break) that it was getting better, but myself and Travis thought it was not doing much. I think the hard work I put in before the tournament is showing now, thanks to Yuvi Paaji, Brian (Lara) as well and my father, who is my first coach.\"\n\nKL Rahul: \"I am lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on tv. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills.\n\n\"They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one. Once you are on the losing side, there are questions marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short.\n\n\"When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum. Ayush and Nicky batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well.\"\n\nBowling: Bhuvneshwar Kumar 4-0-12-2, Pat Cummins 4-0-47- 1, Shahbaz Ahmed 2-0-9-0, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth 4-0-27-0, Jaydev Unadkat 2-0-19-0, T Natarajan 4-0-50-0.\n\nBowling: Krishnappa Gowtham 2-0-29-0, Yash Thakur 2.4-0-47-0, Ravi Bishnoi 2-0-34-0, Naveen-ul-Haq 2-0-37-0, Ayush Badoni 1-0-19-0", "source": {"uri": "mykhel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myKhel.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Warner_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Warner (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

They come into the contest, to be played at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Wednesday, May 8, with similar recent form and aspirations.\n\nHyderabad have won only two of their last five matches, and that figure could've been even worse if not for Rovman Powell missing a full toss off the last ball from Bhuvneshwar Kumar. In their most recent game, they were comprehensively outdone by a Suryakumar Yadav masterclass despite threatening to curtail the chase early.\n\nLucknow, meanwhile, have fared slightly better of late, with three wins in their last five. They too are on the back of a defeat, though, with the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) making a mockery of their bowling at the Ekana Stadium.\n\nBoth SRH and LSG have 12 points from 11 matches, making this a vital context in the top-four race. The Super Giants' net run rate took a big hit in their last game, so they find themselves two spots below the SunRisers, who are fourth. They don't have any more wiggle room.\n\nCan SRH make the most of the beginning of their home run to round off the league stage? Or will LSG move into third place with a win?\n\nIPL 2024, SRH vs LSG Win Probability: Hyderabad bank on home venue to secure two points\n\nSRH's red-hot batting unit has cooled off after a bright start. Abhishek Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen have produced barely any returns over the last few matches, with the former yet to record a half-century in IPL 2024. Travis Head hasn't been his fluent best, either.\n\nHowever, a return to the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium could bring the best out of SRH's power-hitters. LSG haven't been too penetrative in the powerplay, and if Head and Abhishek set a platform, the middle order could do its job in the middle overs.\n\nRavi Bishnoi has experienced a slight upturn in form, but it's hard to see the Lucknow spin attack being able to contain Hyderabad's batters. And with their pace attack not inspiring much confidence either, the visitors could be in for a long night.\n\nThe SunRisers also have the bowlers to make the most of the conditions in Hyderabad. While they'd ideally like more options in the spin department, their pacers have used cutters and slower balls effectively so far. Pat Cummins has led the way in that regard, and the same can be expected this time around as well.\n\nLSG are an unpredictable team that generally find a way to get things done, and SRH's form hasn't been too convincing of late.

Fans sound off on the stumper\n\nIt was an absolute horror show for the Lucknow Super Giants when they visited Uppal as the Sunrisers Hyderabad mauled them. Even though LSG came to bat first, they could not post a towering 200 score and were summed up at 165. KL Rahul, the LSG skipper, could not put up big numbers as he lost his wicket rather early. Hyderabad, who rose to prominence this year after using their high-stakes attacking strategy, were like a beast unleashed after their openers blasted off runs with the bat to reach the target. Openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma put off a solid outing for the team. After the match, the fans lambasted KL's performance and believed that Head's innings gave a reality check on Rahul.\n\nAlso Read: WATCH: KL Rahul gets a dressing down from LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka in front of everyone\n\nKL Rahul's intent under scrutiny after Travis Head exposes him during SRH vs LSG clash\n\nThe Lucknow Super Giants were fighting a struggling battle as they aimed to keep their case for the playoffs. But the Sunrisers Hyderabad were like a freight train that derailed their ambitions when they entered Uppal. Skipper KL Rahul was touted as the savior of the Super Giants, but his defensive approach did not help the team. The Stumper lost his wicket after scoring 29 off 33 balls. But Travis Head put on a run-fest in what looked like a slow pitch after the LSG skipper's outing.\n\nA similar juncture happened at the forgettable ODI World Cup Final when KL Rahul's innings failed to help the Men in Blue, while Travis Head's attacking spree helped claim Australia the World Cup title. Fans on Twitter bodied KL's innings against the Sunrisers, which also gave a reality check on why he was shunned from the T20 World Cup squad. A user vented his frustration on KL via X (Formerly Twitter) and also thanked Ajit Agarkar for keeping him off the T20 World Cup squad\n\nKeeping KL Rahul off the T20 World Cup squad was probably long-term planning for chief selector Ajit Agarkar and the selection board after the stumper's showcase in the ODI World Cup final. India has this one chance under Rohit Sharma to end the title drought, and they are leaving no stone unturned for the job.\n\nAlso Read: 'What the hell just happened.

AP\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad chased down a below-par 166 run target against Lucknow Super Giants on Wednesday in IPL 2024. Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma were at the forefront of the quickfire chase at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\n\nNeeding 166 to win, SRH cruised past the finish line in just 9.4 overs and with 10 wickets to spare. In the process, they became the first team to chase down 150-plus total in less than 10 overs in the history of T20 cricket.\n\nA look at the numbers from the blitz:\n\n62 balls remaining: SRH won with 10.2 overs remaining - the biggest such margin in chases of 150-plus runs in T20s. The previous biggest win was when Brisbane Heat successfully chased down 157 against Melbourne Stars with 60 balls to spare in the 2018-19 BBL.\n\n167: SRH's total is the highest by any team by the end of the tenth over in men's T20s. The previous highest was Worcestershire's 162 against Northamptonshire in 2018.\n\n107: SRH were on 107 at the end of the powerplay. It is the second highest in men's T20s. The highest also belongs to SRH, when they smashed 125/0 against Delhi Capitals last month.\n\n146: SRH have now accounted for 146 of 1000-plus sixes in the ongoing IPL season, the most maximums by a team in any T20 tournament. The previous highest was 145 sixes by Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2018.\n\n80: The difference in powerplay scores reveals the difference in the two sides. Batting first, LSG were 27/2 after six overs. SRH, meanwhile, were 107/0. It's the largest difference in powerplay scores in IPL history\n\n27 - LSG's 27/2 in the powerplay was their lowest total in first six overs in IPL history\n\n3 - Travis Head has now scored three IPL fifties while needing fewer than 20 balls. Delhi Capitals' Jake Fraser-McGurk is the only other batter with three sub-20-ball fifties. Head has two 16-ball fifties, the joint fastest for Sunrisers in the IPL\n\n17.27 - SRH's run rate in the 167 runs total was staggeringly more than 17 per over. It is the highest for a 150-plus partnership in the IPL, and the second highest in all T20s\n\n2 - SRH have won two IPL matches now by 10 wickets when chasing a 150-plus target. The first came against Mumbai Indians in 2020\n\n30 - Overall, SRH struck 30 boundaries from the 58 balls they faced. It included 16 fours and 14 sixes -the most in the first ten overs of a men's T20 match. LSG, meanwhile, hit 16 fours and four sixes for a combined 20 boundaries in their entire innings. Head and Abhishek had more than that in the powerplay alone", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bash_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Bash League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcestershire_County_Cricket_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northamptonshire_County_Cricket_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northamptonshire County Cricket Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Travis-Head-Abhishek-Sharma-SRH-AP-1200-2024-05-cd4fec2f40fd50a04c46ad537e8df263-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The five-time champions' fate was sealed following Lucknow Super Giants' defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad.\n\nSRH thrashed LSG by ten wickets to move to the third spot in the IPL 2024 points table. After suffering a seven wicket loss in their previous game against Mumbai Indians, SRH bounced back in style to blow LSG away. Batting first, LSG recovered from 66 for 4 in the 12th over to post a competitive total of 165 for 4 in 20 overs. Ayush Badoni (55*) and Nicholas Pooran (48*) rescued LSG after their dismal start.\n\nHowever, SRH openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma made a mockery of the target as they hit blazing half-centuries to take their team home in just 9.4 overs. Head smashed 89 runs of just 30 balls with the help of eight fours and as many sixes. On the other hand, Sharma remained unbeaten on 75 off 28 balls with the help of eight fours and six sixes.\n\nThe win was SRH's seventh of the season in 12 games and took them to the third spot in the points table. The Pat Cummins-led side has all but sealed its place in the playoffs. On the other hand, LSG are at the sixth spot with six wins and as many losses and now face a herculean task to qualify for the next stage.\n\nSRH's win against LSG confirmed Mumbai Indians' fate in IPL 2024. They will exit the competition at the league stage. With four wins from 12 games, Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians are currently languishing at the ninth spot in the points table.\n\nEven if they win their remaining two games, they will finish with 12 points. Three teams - Kolkata Knight Riders, Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad - already have 14 points. With Delhi Capitals and LSG set to face on May 14, one of them would also get 14 points. It means Mumbai Indians will not be able to make it to the top four.\n\nThe victory for SRH has also made the forthcoming game between Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru a do-or-die clash. The losing team will be knocked out of IPL 2024. Both the teams have four wins from 11 games so far and can finish with a maximum of 14 points.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/Mumbai%20Indians%20IPL%202024.webp?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 30, "textEnd": 35}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 1813, "textEnd": 1819}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Head struck 89* off 30 balls, inclusive of eight fours and sixes alike while Sharma smashed 75* runs off just 28 deliveries laced with eight fours and six sixes. Both stitched a 167-run stand as they clinically chased the target in just 9.4 overs and registered a commanding win over LSG.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amit_sharma@news9live.com", "name": "Amit Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

I just wanted to take it deep and just play normal cricketing shots. I didn't want to throw my wicket away. It's not a wicket where you can go from ball one.\n\nHe continued:\n\n\"The bowlers were bowling short slower balls, so I was looking to find the gap on the shorter side.

SRH's dominant performance restricted LSG to 165/4 in 20 overs, with impressive bowling from Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shahbaz Ahmed. However, the real spectacle unfolded during SRH's innings, as they chased down the target without losing a single wicket. Travis Head's outstanding unbeaten 89 off 30 deliveries and Abhishek Sharma's explosive 75 off 28 powered SRH to a stunning victory, with 62 balls to spare. Travis Head's exceptional performance earned him the well-deserved \"Player of the Match\" title.\n\nAbhishek Sharma reveals the support he gets from SRH that helps him to perform at his best\n\nThe unwavering support from skipper Pat Cummins and the entire think-tank played a big role in his success in the on-going IPL, reckoned Sunrisers Hyderabad opener Abhishek Sharma.\n\nThe 23-year-old Punjab left-hander fired from all cylinders for Hyderabad this season, making 401 runs from 12 matches and those runs have come at an awesome strike-rate of 205.\n\n\"Our support staff and Pat (Cummins), the way they think, I have never seen anyone else think like that,\" Abhishek said on JioCinema Match Centre Live after their record 10-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants here on Wednesday.\n\n\"They're like, 'Go out there and express yourself. Play as aggressively as you can, we'll back you.' I think that matters a lot,\" said Abhishek, who has hit 35 sixes so far, highest by any batter this season.\n\nThe SRH openers Abhishek (75 not out off 28 balls) and Travis Head (89 not out off 30 balls) scaled down 166 in just 9.4 overs, rewriting the record for the quickest chase of 150-plus in T20 cricket.\n\nSRH's total of 167 was also the highest by any team by the end of the tenth over in men's T20s.\n\n\"I think this approach was something I took on during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy,\" said Abhishek who played a key role in Punjab winning the domestic T20 title last season.\n\nAbhishek (485 runs from 10 matches) was the second highest run-getter behind Riyan Parag (510) of Assam in last season's SMAT.\n\n\"I feel when I play this way, look at the ball, and react, my shots come off better and the bowler comes under pressure. I always thought if I play in the IPL, I'll try to maintain this,\" he added.\n\n'Big fan of Head' With Head at his explosive best, SRH have smashed many batting records this season including the highest ever IPL total of 287/3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.\n\nAbhishek hailed the way Head played spin.\n\n\"I don't think anyone plays spin better than Travis. The shots he hit off (Krishnappa) Gowtham, normally batters can't do that, that shows how special he is.\n\n\"He's very clear, whenever I talk to him, the way he compliments me, I have always been a big fan of him over the last year that I have followed him.\n\n\"When our understanding was established and our partnership improved, we became good friends off the pitch and have started spending more time,\" he added.\n\nAbhishek then touched upon his strategy against the LSG bowlers, especially pacers.\n\n\"They were bowling cutters in the middle. I thought the cutters could slow down on their way, but Travis and I had planned to play it the way you would hit a spinner with the spin.\n\n\"So, if it's an off-cutter, we look to hit towards long-off covers. If it's a leg cutter, obviously we look at mid-wicket or mid-on,\" he added.\n\n(With PTI inputs)", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic World Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Ahmed_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shahbaz Ahmed (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_Match_awards_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Player of the Match awards (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed_Mushtaq_Ali_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyan_Parag", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riyan Parag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rbharatimage/abhisheksharmabreakssunilnarinebigrecordinipl-171238506724216_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The KL Rahul-led side was left clueless and they suffered a 10-wicket thrashing.\n\nLucknow Super Giants won the toss and opted to bat first. It seemed that they would post a big total on the board. However, that wasn't the case as they started off poorly with the bat. Quinton de Kock (2) and Marcus Stoinis (3) perished early and the team came under pressure.\n\nSkipper KL Rahul (29) struggled with his timing whereas Krunal Pandya (24) played a vital hand with the bat. Lucknow Super Giants were left tottering at 66/4 and it seemed that they would get all out early. However, after that, Ayush Badoni (55*) and Nicholas Pooran (48) brought their team back in the game.\n\nThe duo added unbeaten 99 runs and bailed Lucknow Super Giants out of trouble. Based on their collective effort with the bat, the home team posted a total of 165 runs on the board. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was the pick of the bowlers with his figures of 2/12 for his team.\n\nLucknow Super Giants looked clueless with the ball as Sunrisers Hyderabad batters Abhishek Sharma (75*) and Travis Head (89*) launched an attack on the bowlers right from the start. They made a mockery of the bowling lineup as almost every ball flew out of the park.\n\nThe duo added unbeaten 167 runs and chased the target inside 10 overs to help Sunrisers Hyderabad register their 7th win of the season. They also boosted their NRR and made sure that they made their case strong for the playoffs.\n\nThe loss against Sunrisers was the 6th loss for the Lucknow Super Giants in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024. They are currently placed 6th on the points table with 6 wins and 6 losses under their belt. They also have an NRR of -0.769, which isn't ideal for them in the context of playoffs.\n\nHowever, even after the loss against Sunrisers Hyderabad, they still have the chance to make it into the playoffs.

InsideSport will provide you with the top stories of IPL from a day before that you might have missed in the hustle and bustle of your busy life.\n\nThe Sunrisers Hyderabad chased down a target of 166 in just 9.4 overs! Yes, you read that correctly. Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head scored almost 3 runs per ball to take their side home. The two southpaws have made it a habit in the IPL 2024 to destroy the bowling line-ups and dreams of opposition fans as they pile on the pain.\n\nOn what seemed like a tough pitch when the Lucknow Super Giants were playing, the Pat Cummins-led side handed their skipper a perfect birthday gift by ending the match in just 58 balls. Apart from an early flight home, they also got a massive boost in the points table as they climbed to 3rd spot.\n\nAll not well in LSG camp?\n\nAfter the thrashing, KL Rahul admitted that they were outplayed and gave Head and Abhishek their flowers. However, it seemed like LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka wasn't too pleased with his skipper or the team. He was seen having a long animated chat with Rahul after the match, and it looked like he was giving the wicketkeeper opener an earful.\n\nHead & Abhishek make records fall like flies\n\nThe dynamic duo's 167-run stand saw them break multiple records. Due to their fireworks, SRH became the first team to chase a 100+ target in under 10 overs and broke their own record for most runs scored in the first 10 overs of an IPL match (previously 158). Travis Head broke his own record for the highest strike rate after playing 30 balls (296.66), and Head now also holds the record for the highest strike in the IPL for anyone who's scored more than 500 runs.\n\nMumbai Indians knocked out of IPL 2024\n\nThe Lucknow Super Giants weren't the only team to lose today. Hardik Pandya's Mumbai Indians suffered a heavier loss as they are the first team to be officially out of the IPL 2024. Sunrisers Hyderabad's massive victory means that MI are no longer in the reckoning, and Hardik's first stint as Mumbai's captain comes to an early end.\n\nBhuvi's back!\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar was at his best today. In a match where all of LSG's bowlers went at over 14.5 runs per over, Bhuvi ended up with the figures of 4-0-12-2. Apart from him, only Pat Cummins managed to get a wicket for SRH, and he went for 47 runs in his quota of four overs. He gave away just 7 runs for 2 wickets in the powerplay and then returned at the end of the 18th over and stopped Nicholas Pooran and Ayush Badoni from teeing off.\n\nUnhappy Samson fined\n\nSanju Samson has paid for his indiscretion. After arguing with the on-field umpire following his controversial dismissal, the Rajasthan Royals skipper has been handed a 30% match fee fine. Samson was involved in a controversial incident against the Delhi Capitals, and for showing his dissent, he's been punished by the BCCI.\n\nBadoni, LSG's only shining light?\n\nAyush Badoni's performance might be the only good thing to happen for LSG against Sunrisers Hyderabad. The 24-year-old was their highest run-scorer and lone half-centurion in a match where their batters and bowlers both failed. Nicholas Pooran might have ended up with a slightly better strike rate, but it was Badoni who gave Pooran time to settle as he continued to chip away and got them to 166.", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ansh_athani@insidesport.in", "name": "Ansh Athani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

We kind of complement each other. He is very very enjoyable to be around. He is very very excited and thinks about the game,\" Head said at a post-match press conference.\n\nThe powerplay, a phase of the match the Sunrisers have dominated in the tournament so far, set the stage for this victory. They scored an incredible 107 runs during the powerplay overs, practically snuffing out any hopes of a comeback that Lucknow may have entertained and took their team to within a touching distance of the target in under 10 overs.\n\nThe persistent and ferocious assault by the SRH openers was simply too much for the LSG bowlers to handle.\n\nAfter posting a reasonable and fighting target of 167 on the board, the Sunrisers, riding on the exploits of the opening duo, cantered home in just 9.4 overs. The fireworks by the willow-wielders yet again reaffirmed the team's formidable batting lineup, which is arguably among the most feared this ongoing IPL season.\n\n\"Yeah, very happy with how we operate in power play and also glad to see how we scored runs outside of power play today. At time out we spoke about NRR being important. Very pleased that checked out,\" he added.\n\nLSG elected to bat first after winning the toss.

Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six.\n\nIn the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran turned things around with a 99-run stand, putting a score of 165/4 in 20 overs for LSG.\n\nIn the run-chase of 166 runs, openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma launched what seemed like a never-ending assault on LSG batters, helping SRH chase down the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket.\n\nSRH is at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

The game will kick off at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad on May 8, Wednesday at 7:30 PM (IST).\n\nBoth teams have played against each other on three occasions so far. The Lucknow-based franchise won all three games and the Sunrisers who are yet to open their account will be hoping to get off the mark this time around at home.\n\nSRH are fourth on the league stage points table with 12 points at an NRR of -0.065. On the other hand, LSG are sixth on the table with 12 points with an NRR of -0.371. Let's delve deep into the names of four batsmen who can muster the most runs in Match 57 of the tournament.\n\n1. Travis Head: SRH's dynamic opening batter Travis Head has been in fine form this season ever since donning the orange jersey. He is certainly one of the players who is expected to go all guns blazing. The left-hander is the leading run-scorer for SRH with 444 runs in 10 games, laced with 1 century and three fifties.\n\n2. KL Rahul: LSG captain KL Rahul is one of the batters who has led the team's batting attack by example in the ongoing season. Having played 11 games so far, he scored 410 runs at an average close to 40 and a strike rate of 141.31, laced with three fifties. The Bengaluru-born who has a truckload of experience in IPL will be looking forward to posing a threat to the SRH side.\n\n3. Nitish Reddy: SRH's middle-order batter Nitish Reddy was at his impressive best against Rajasthan Royals in Hyderabad recently. He scored an unbeaten 76 off 42 balls including 3 fours and 8 sixes. Nitish drew plaudits for his performances and is expected to deliver the goods for SRH in the next game against LSG.\n\n4. Marcus Stoinis: LSG all-rounder Marcus Stoinis has been quite exceptional against pace this season. He has maintained a splendid batting average of 105 against the fast bowlers with an impressive strike rate of 161.54, laced with 23 fours and 8 sixes. He is one of the batters to watch out for in the upcoming game against SRH.", "source": {"uri": "mykhel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myKhel.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chaithanya_g@mykhel.com", "name": "Chaithanya G", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Tasked to smash sixes fearlessly at the top alongside Australian opener Travis Head, Abhishek is fulfilling his responsibility no doubt. The duo is having an incredible season for their franchise and their style of attacking right from ball one and taking their team to totals of 250 or more is something that could cause a paradigm shift in T20 cricket in the near future.\n\nAbhishek's fearless hitting at the top led to speculations that he could be one of the surprise entries to India's T20 World Cup squad. However, the 23-year-old all-rounder did not make it to the squad.\n\nHesson however, backs this youngster to be a part of India's plans following the tournament, because of his ability to attack spin in the powerplay and an improved game against pace.\n\n\"Oh, look, I think so (whether Abhishek will play for India following T20 WC). I mean, I think his ability to take on spin in the power play. And he has improved greatly against pace. He is a high-quality player. He is a boundary hitter. He is a six-hitter and no doubt post-World Cup, and he will start to make some changes, whether it be Yashasvi Jaiswal, himself or Shubman Gill. To be fair, there are a few. There is plenty of names, but he will definitely be one that will have plenty of people talking about,\" said Hesson on JioCinema.\n\nAbhishek is the 11th-highest run-getter with 401 runs in 12 matches at an average of 36.45 and a strike rate of 205.64, with two fifties. His best score is 75*.\n\nComing to yesterday's match between SRH and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), LSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in the first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six.\n\nIn the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55* in 30 balls, with nine fours) and Nicholas Pooran (48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six) turned things around with a 99-run stand, putting a score of 165/4 in 20 overs for LSG.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the top bowler for LSG. Pat Cummins also got a wicket.\n\nIn the run-chase of 166 runs, openers Travis Head (89* in 30 balls, with eight fours and eight sixes) and Abhishek Sharma (75* in 28 balls, with eight fours and six sixes) launched what seemed like a never-ending assault on LSG batters, helping SRH chase down the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket.\n\nSRH is at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points. LSG is in the sixth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points.

Sharma wasn't among the runs in the previous match but he has scored 326 runs in 11 IPL 2024 matches and will be hoping to get the better of LSG's bowlers.\n\nMayank Agarwal could prove to be a key top order player for SRH. Due to limited game time, Agarwal has managed just 64 runs in four matches but he's more than capable of taking any bowling unit to the cleaners.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy has shone for SRH this season. Reddy has scored 239 runs in eight matches while boasting an impressive strike rate of 152.23. He can also contribute as a bowler and has taken three wickets in IPL 2024.\n\nExplosive batter Heinrich Klaasen will be an important member of the SRH playing XI against LSG. Klaasen's lethal form with the bat has been every bowler's nightmare in IPL 2024. With a commendable strike rate of 186.26, the Protea wicketkeeper has amassed 339 runs in 11 matches and is likely to be among the runs in the upcoming match.\n\nProtea pacer Marco Jansen is an important part of Hyderabad's bowling attack. Due to limited time with the ball in hand, Jansen has only taken one wicket in three matches. He will be hoping to have more of an impact with the ball and can also chip in with some crucial runs.\n\nShahbaz Ahmed\n\nShahbaz Ahmed's inclusion to the playing XI will give some all-round balance to SRH. So far, Ahmed has scored 186 runs and taken three wickets in 11 matches. He will hope to leave his mark on the game against LSG on Wednesday.\n\nAbdul Samad\n\nAbdul Samad's ability to score important runs lower down the order makes him an important addition to the playing XI. With a strike rate of 181.93, Samad has scored 151 runs in 11 matches and is capable of scoring quick runs in the death overs.\n\nPat Cummins (captain)\n\nPat Cummins showcased his skills with the bat in the last game against Mumbai Indians. The SRH skipper played a vital knock of 35 runs off 17 balls while maintaining a mammoth strike rate of 205.88. With the ball, Cummins has taken 13 wickets in 11 matches and has led SRH well this season.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar\n\nKnown as the master of swing, Bhuvneshwar Kumar is known to get early breakthroughs. Bhuvi has taken nine wickets in 11 matches and the Indian pacer will be raring to make inroads against Lucknow's batting lineup come Wednesday.\n\nT Natarajan\n\nT Natarajan will lead SunRisers Hyderabad's bowling attack. With 15 wickets in just nine matches, Natarajan has been one of the most standout bowlers in IPL 2024. Moreover, he has recorded a four-fer in IPL 2024 and is known for restricting batters while bowling in pressure situations.\n\nLSG captain KL Rahul will open the innings against SRH. He has led from the front this season and is his team's top-scorer of the season with 431 runs in 11 matches. Rahul will be hoping to get LSG off to a quick start against SRH.\n\nArshin Kulkarni\n\nArshin Kulkarni looks set to join KL Rahul at the top of the order for the Super Giants. Despite not producing his best so far, the young batter boasts a strike rate of 158.53 in T20 cricket, indicating his potential with the bat. He can also roll his arm over and has accounted for four T20 scalps in his nascent career.\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nMarcus Stoinis is crucial for LSG having scored 352 runs in 11 matches, including a century. He has a commendable strike rate of 153.71 and has also taken four wickets. Stoinis will be hoping to produce another top quality performance against SRH.\n\nDeepak Hooda\n\nDeepak Hooda has accumulated 134 runs in eight matches at a strike rate of 142.55 in IPL 2024. While he hasn't been at his best this season, Hooda is a quality player who is capable of taking a game away from any opposition on his day.\n\nNicholas Pooran\n\nWest Indies batter Nicholas Pooran has made waves with the bat in IPL 2024. While boasting an average of 52.50 and a noteworthy strike rate of 159.09, Pooran has scored 315 runs in 11 matches and is yet to be dismissed in five of them. The wicketkeeper batter failed to score runs in the previous match and will be raring to set the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium ablaze.\n\nAyush Badoni\n\nAyush Badoni has managed to register a fifty-plus score and accumulate 152 runs in 11 IPL 2024 matches. He will be eager to produce a big knock against SRH and have a positive impact on the team's fortunes.\n\nAshton Turner\n\nAshton Turner has struggled to have an impact with the bat in IPL 2024. Due to limited game time, the Australian has only scored 21 runs in two matches. However, he can be devastating with the bat on his day and has accumulated 2872 runs in T20 cricket besides also claiming 31 wickets.\n\nKrunal Pandya\n\nKrunal Pandya's inclusion to the playing XI will aid LSG's batting and bowling. Pandya has scored 79 runs in 11 matches and has remained unbeaten on seven occasions this season. He has also taken five wickets and is crucial for the balance of LSG.\n\nRavi Bishnoi\n\nRavi Bishnoi has claimed seven wickets in 11 matches this season and has led the spin attack for LSG. He has taken eight scalps against SRH in the past and will be keen to add to that tally on Wednesday.\n\nNaveen Ul Haq\n\nNaveen Ul Haq has been a livewire in Lucknow's pace attack in IPL 2024. The Afghan pacer has taken 10 wickets in seven matches and has proven his ability to contain batters as well as add pressure on opposition batters during the powerplay and death overs.\n\nMohsin Khan\n\nWith nine wickets in seven matches, Mohsin Khan has done well for LSG in IPL 2024. Although he remained wicketless in the team's previous game against KKR, Mohsin is generally among the wickets and will aim to add more scalps to his tally for the season when Lucknow go up against SRH.", "source": {"uri": "sports.ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTVSports.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Agarwal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Agarwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T.

The match is set to take place at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Hyderabad. Both teams are in dire need of a win given how things have fared in the ongoing season so far. Teams below them are catching up and challenging the teams in the mid-table. A win in the upcoming match will be important for both teams for their chances in the season.\n\nBoth teams lost their last match and made things difficult for themselves. SRH lost the match to MI by 7 wickets and LSG lost to KKR by a huge margin of 98 runs at home. SRH has not been as impressive as a bowling unit. They have often depended on the batters to win matches for them. LSG would like to take advantage of it. On the other hand, the visiting side has been struggling with inconsistent batters. While their bowling is good, batting has been a big concern.\n\nBoth teams have some of the best players in the world. LSG has some good names like KL Rahul, Nicholas Pooran, Marcus Stoinis, Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, and others. SRH has some good players in their lineup. The key for them would be to make the most of the home conditions and perform to the expectations of the fans. A big challenge for SRH would be to prove themselves a capable unit to win the match with their bowling. That promises to be a good match between the two sides.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad are likely to continue with the same opening order. Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head are arguably the greatest opening combination this season. The two Southpaws have taken the tournament by storm with their brilliant batting performances. Both of them have been highly aggressive and helped SRH to gain early momentum in almost every game. It has allowed other batters coming after them to bat the way they want. However, there is a shortcoming in their approach.\n\nAlso Check: IPL 2024 Orange Cap\n\nWhile the duo has been brilliant while setting a total, they have not been that good while chasing. Barring the game against CSK where they were chasing 166, neither Head nor Abhishek have been that brilliant with the bat while chasing over 200 runs. If the duo can provide good starts to the side while chasing totals, SRH looks to be a different side. Come the game against RR, the duo would be hoping to make an impact even while chasing the totals.\n\nIn the middle order, SRH have some of the best batters in the world along with an emerging one. Number 3 has been a problematic spot for SRH. They have tried various players in the position like Aiden Markram, Abhishek Sharma, Rahul Tripathi, Mayank Agarwal, and Anmolpreet Singh. But none of them clicked. SRH needs to find ways to accommodate someone who can be consistent with the bat at the position. Heinrich Klaasen is likely to bat at number 4.\n\nThe batting positions depend on the match situation. Klaasen is one of the best IPL batters in the last couple of seasons. Even as a wicketkeeper, he has been doing a good job. The key for him would be to back his natural approach of going aggressive from his end. Blocking the ball doesn't help him or his team. Abdul Samad has been good for SRH. He is one of the designated finishers for the Orange Army. His form with the bat has come like a breath of fresh air for SRH.\n\nSRH have some of the most talented all-rounders in their lineup. Nitish Kumar Reddy will be the middle-order batter in the side. The young batter won the match for the home side with his batting while saving them from a collapse. In the last few matches, he has also been handy as a bowler. If required, he can deliver his full quota of overs. They have another talented all-rounder like Shahbaz Ahmed who has been good as a finisher and decent as a spinner.\n\nShahbaz needs to bowl better. He can deliver economical spells like he did against RCB. However, he needs to bowl those spells on a consistent basis. With the bat, he can finish the games well and anchor the innings in case of collapses. SRH has some good overseas players who can be handy with their all-round skills. They have Glenn Phillips and Marco Jansen in the squad who can contribute both with the bat and with the ball. Jansen has had a bad season and needs to step up.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad have a decent bowling lineup on paper. With the new ball, Bhuvneshwar Kumar has the ability to swing both ways. However, the heat wave has meant a lack of swing at many venues, especially in Hyderabad. Hence, he has been a bit ineffective with the new ball. To bowl alongside him is the pace duo of Jaydev Unadkat and T Natarajan. While the former relies mostly on slower ones and bouncers (with a change of pace), the latter has been very good with the ball.\n\nAlso Check: IPL 2024 Purple Cap\n\nUnadkat will be on the main side, while Natarajan might be used as the impact substitute. His death bowling has been good which has bound the team together. In the middle overs, SRH is reliant on the pace-spin duo of Pat Cummins and Mayank Markande. The SRH skipper has been their best bowler this season bowling well in almost every match. He can control the flow of runs and take wickets. In addition to it, Cummins is a handy batter too. Markande needs to be consistent as a bowler for the 2016 champions. He is a wicket-taking prospect.\n\nAbhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (WK), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins (C), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markande, Jaydev Unadkat", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bishnoi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

With six wins in 11 matches, LSG currently finds itself in the fifth position on the points table with 12 points to their name. The Lucknow-based franchise will be looking to win this game and go on top of SRH in the standings who are currently in the fourth position with 12 points.\n\nAlso Check: IPL 2024 Orange Cap\n\nThe surface at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad is a batting paradise.

This is the first time these two teams will face each other in the group stage of IPL 2024.\n\nThe two teams are currently tied on points (12) but separated by a whisker-thin Net Run Rate, as they find themselves embroiled in a fierce battle for a coveted playoff spot.\n\nSRH will be smarting from their recent loss to Mumbai Indians. However, they'll draw confidence from their dominant home record, having lost just one match at Hyderabad this season.\n\nLSG, on the other hand, will be looking to bounce back from a crushing defeat against Kolkata. Their batting lineup is packed with explosive firepower - KL Rahul and Marcus Stoinis in top-order, and the big-hitting Nicholas Pooran in the middle order. However, their bowling attack might find the Hyderabad wicket, known for its batting paradise reputation.\n\nAhead of tonight's big clash, let us take a look at three milestones that could be breached in the SRH vs LSG IPL 2024 match.\n\n#3 Quinton de Kock could become the first-ever South African to complete 1000 fours in T20s\n\nQuinton de Kock will have extra motivation when LSG take on his former team, SRH. The explosive left-hander sits on the cusp of a historic T20 milestone. He needs just six boundaries to become the first South African cricketer to notch up 1000 fours in the shortest format.\n\nThis achievement would be a testament to de Kock's consistent ability to find the boundary rope. Having amassed 994 fours in his 336 T20 matches, de Kock boasts an impressive strike rate of over 137.\n\n#2 Abhishek Sharma will play his 100th T20 match\n\nAbhishek Sharma has wreaked havoc with his blazing form this season. The talented youngster has been a revelation for SRH, having mustered 326 runs at an amazing strike rate of 195.21.\n\nThe match against LSG will mark Abhishek Sharma's 100th appearance in the shortest format of the game. Having made his T20 debut as a 17-year-old for Delhi Capitals back in 2018, Abhishek has featured across 99 T20 games thus far.\n\nIn this period, he has scored 2,513 runs and has taken 30 wickets as well.\n\n#1 KL Rahul could complete 400 fours in IPL\n\nKL Rahul, the Lucknow Super Giants captain, enters tonight's match against SRH on the cusp of a personal milestone. The Indian wicket-keeper batter sits just five fours away from joining an elite club of players with 400 fours in IPL history.\n\nAchieving this feat against SRH would make him only the 11th player to do so, a testament to his consistent and elegant strokeplay throughout the years.\n\nIn the 120 innings Rahul has played, he has hammered 4594 runs with the help of 395 fours and 183 sixes.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naman_jain@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Naman Jain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_de_Kock", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quinton de Kock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

The match between the two teams took place at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\n\nLucknow Super Giants were at the receiving end of 10-wicket hammering at the hands of Sunrisers Hyderabad. It not only would've hampered their confidence but also dented their chances to qualify for the playoffs as a win today surely would've put them in a strong position\n\nLucknow Super Giants, who opted to bat first, didn't have a great outing as they managed just 165 runs. They were reeling at 66/4 and it was Nicholas Pooran (48*) and Ayush Badoni (55*), who bailed them out of trouble and made sure that their team posted a respectable total of 165 on the board on account of their unbeaten 99-run stand.\n\nLucknow Super Giants then couldn't put pressure on the Sunrisers Hyderabad with the ball. They didn't know how to bowl to Abhishek Sharma (75*) and Travis Head (89*). The duo wreaked havoc across the opposition's bowling lineup and chased the target inside overs, which speaks about the mayhem it was.\n\nLucknow Super Giants skipper KL looked completely down on confidence and it wasn't helped by what seemed a scolding by the team owner Sanjiv Goenka. The franchise owner was seen having an animated chat with the captain of the team and seemed to be unhappy with something.\n\nIn the video that has gone viral on the internet, Sanjiv Goenka can be seen giving drubbing to KL Rahul. The LSG skipper, however, seemed clueless and held his calm. Here's the clip:\n\nIf this was not enough, Sanjiv Goenka then went on to bash head coach Justin Langer. The owner of the franchise seemed unhappy with the Australian coach. KL Rahul was also present there but he left after that.\n\nKL Rahul opened up about the loss his team faced in the game against SRH. He admitted that he was lost for words with the way Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma batted against them. The LSG skipper also admitted that they were 40-50 runs short.

Head and Sharma added another chapter to their remorseless domination over bowlers while carving lightning fast unbeaten fifties to power SRH to a convincing 10-wicket win over LSG in a crucial IPL match.\n\nLucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul on Wednesday said they were completely outplayed by the incredible power-hitting of Sunrisers Hyderabad's openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, terming it ''unreal batting.'' Head and Sharma added another chapter to their remorseless domination over bowlers while carving lightning fast unbeaten fifties to power SRH to a convincing 10-wicket win over LSG in a crucial IPL match. Chasing a modest 166, Head (89 not out, 30 balls, 8x4s, 8x6s) and Sharma (75 not out, 28 balls, 8x4s, 6x6s) toyed with LSG bowlers, finding boundaries and sixes at will to canter home in just 9.4 overs. ''I am at lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills. ''They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. It was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one,'' he said. This was after SRH bowlers started brilliantly before Badoni (55 not out off 30 balls) and Pooran (48 not out off 25 balls) stitched crucial 95-runs off 55 balls for the unbeaten fifth-wicket stand to guide LSG to a competitive 165 for four on a sluggish pitch. Rahul blamed the defeat on their poor display with the bat in powerplay, from which they scored just 27 runs for the loss of two wickets. ''Once you are on the losing side, there are question marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum. ''Ayush (Badoni) and Nicky (Nicholas Pooran) batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well,'' he admitted.\n\nSRH skipper Pat Cummins said that it was an ''unreal'' batting display from Head and Sharma. ''The boys (Head and Sharma) have had a fantastic season, but to win this with less than 10 overs played is unreal,'' he said. ''We just let them go, they are two guys who are very positive and I'm a bowler, it is tough for me to give them any inputs.'' Cummins was effusive in his praise for both Head and Sharma. ''He's (Head) been like this for 2 years, he hits the tough areas, hits the middle a lot, might not be super conventional. ''(Abhishek) Just an incredible player of spin and pace. With just 2 fielders out, it is really difficult for the bowlers against them,'' he said. Head, who was adjudged player-of-the-match for his pyrotechnics, said he was really enjoying batting with Sharma as they compliment each other well. ''Lots of fun today. Nice to get this done in 10 overs. Abhi (Sharma) and I have had a few partnerships like this. Just concentrate on getting in good positions, watch the ball hard and try to maximise the powerplay,'' he said.\n\n''I know how hard he (Abhishek Sharma) works and how deep he thinks, his spin play is second to none. We compliment each other very well. Nice to see him back amongst the runs after missing out in the last couple of games.'' Abhishek thanks Lara, Yuvraj ===================== After his hurricane fifty, Abhishek thanked two left-handers, who had thrilled the audience during their playing days, for his success in the on-going IPL -- Yuvraj Singh and Brian Lara. ''I think the hard work I put in before the tournament is showing now, thanks to Yuvi Paaji, Brian (Lara) as well and my father, who is my first coach,'' he said. Abhishek also thanked the SRH team management for the trust shown in him. ''I would never think of coming to such a tournament and playing at such a strike rate, but thanks to the team management. ''The message was clear from them and I backed myself.'' There was a special mention of his opening partner -- Head. ''All the credit goes to him (Head). The way he starts against all bowlers...he goes after them from the start and takes the pressure off me.''\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

However, LSG still have good chances to make it to the IPL 2024 playoffs if they secure victories in their last two league matches, but Hesson feels Lucknow faces an uphill task to save their playoff aspirations and revive their campaign due to their bowling attack.\n\nThe cricket expert on Jio Cinema further went on to suggest that LSG's campaign in the ongoing IPL 2024 has almost ended with their massive defeat against the SRH in Hyderabad on Wednesday.\n\nFurthermore, Hesson pointed out that injuries to key players like Mayank Yadav and Mohsin Khan have severely weakened LSG's bowling attack, mentioning the lack of an X-factor in their bowling lineup.\n\nHesson also said that Ravi Bishnoi's underwhelming performances in the ongoing IPL 2024 further weakened LSG's bowling arsenal. The former RCB coach also predicted a further decline for the LSG in the IPL, given their weak bowling attack, which played a major role in their struggles this season.\n\nMike Hesson said on Jio Cinema on being asked whether LSG's campaign has ended in the ongoing IPL 2024: \"I think yes.\" He further stated: \"With Mayank Yadav missing, they don't really have that X-factor in their bowling. Even Mohsin Khan didn't play today. Ravo Bishnoi hasn't been at his best this IPL. So, their bowling attack doesn't look threatening. Their slide will continue.\"\n\nMeanwhile, after being opted to bat first in Hyderabad, the Lucknow team managed to post 165/4 on the board, thanks to Nicholas Pooran's unbeaten 48 and Ayush Badoni's unbeaten 55 runs against the SRH. LSG's batting show led many to speculate that the pitch wasn't favorable to strokeplay, and the same sentiment was echoed by head coach Justin Langer.\n\nLanger considered 160 a competitive total. However, the match unfolded differently, with the SRH openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma chasing down the target with extreme ease. The dangerous SRH opening duo chased down 166 runs in a mere 9.4 overs, setting a new IPL record for the highest score by any team within the first 10 overs.\n\nHead's blistering innings of unbeaten 89 off just 30 deliveries comprised 8 fours and 8 sixes, while Abhishek Sharma was equally impressive, contributing an unbeaten 75 runs from 28 balls, featuring 8 fours and 6 maximums against the LSG.\n\nThis remarkable win propelled SRH to the third position in the IPL 2024 points table with 14 points from 12 matches, while LSG finds themselves struggling in the sixth spot with 12 points from 12 games in the tournament.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Head smashed 89 runs off just 30 balls, including eight fours and eight sixes, while Sharma contributed a rapid 75 off 28 balls, featuring eight fours and six sixes.

LSG posted a competitive total of 165 runs for 4 wickets in their allotted 20 overs while batting first.\n\nHowever, SRH responded with an emphatic chase, reaching the target of 167 runs in just 9.4 overs without losing a single wicket. Nevertheless, the reaction of SRH's owner, Kavya Maran, to a shot played by LSG batter Ayush Badoni against Pat Cummins has been grabbing significant attention.\n\nIn a crucial moment during the last over of LSG's innings, SRH captain Cummins assumed responsibility for the bowling attack. On the first delivery of Cummins' over, Badoni, the talented right-handed batter, showcased his batting prowess by executing a masterful reverse-lap shot. With precision and skill, Badoni directed a low full toss delivery to the boundary through the backward point region, demonstrating his exceptional ability under pressure.\n\nKavya's response to Badoni's reverse lap shot for a boundary was marked by disappointment, as evidenced by her baring her teeth in frustration and then slowly leaning her head back. This candid moment was quickly captured by the cameraman and has since garnered significant attention on social media platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma were the chief architect of victory of SRH. Chasing a target exceeding 160, Sunrisers achieved the daunting task with exceptional speed, reaching 166 runs without the loss of any wickets in just 9.4 overs. Head played a stellar innings, remaining unbeaten with 89 runs off 30 deliveries, smashing eight fours and eight sixes. Similarly, Abhishek showcased his batting prowess with an unbeaten 75 runs off 28 balls, comprising eight fours and six sixes.\n\nFollowing this triumph over LSG, SRH have surged to the third position in the standings, accumulating 14 points from 12 matches.

Chasing a modest target of 166, Head (89 not out, 30 balls, 8x4, 8x6) and Sharma (75 not out, 28 balls, 8x4, 6x6) toyed with LSG bowlers, finding boundaries and sixes at will to canter home in just 9.4 overs. The win propelled SRH to the third position in the standings with 14 points from 12 games, while LSG are struggling at the sixth spot with 12 points from the same number of matches.\n\nThe result also meant that five-time champions Mumbai Indians, currently ninth with eight points from 12 matches, are out of the play-off race.\n\nThe dance of destruction by Head and Sharma even left the legendary Sachin Tendulkar gushing.\n\n\"A destructive opening partnership would be an understatement tonight. Had these boys batted first, they would've scored 300,\" Tendulkar wrote in his X account.\n\nThe Head and Sharma show came after SRH bowlers started brilliantly before losing the plot a bit.\n\nAyush Badoni (55 not out off 30 balls) and Nicholas Pooran (48 not out off 25 balls) stitched crucial 95-runs off 55 balls for the unbeaten fifth-wicket stand to guide LSG to a competitive 165 for four on a sluggish pitch.\n\nBut the Head and Sharma took any hint of competition out of the match once they bludgeoned 107 runs in the Power Play.\n\nIt was an awesome hitting display from the Indo-Australian pair as they didn't spare a single LSG bowler, clobbering them to all parts of the ground.\n\nLSG's decision to start with Krishnappa Gowtham also backfired badly as both Head and Sharma, who are really good against spin, dismantled the off-spinner.\n\nSuch was the brutal assault that the likes Yash Dayal, Ravi Bishnoi and Naveen-ul-Haq were also taken to the cleaners, raining sixes and fours.\n\nEarlier, LSG were struggling at 27 for 2 at the end of the powerplay after opting to bat.\n\nThe visitors lost Quinton de Kock, who replaced an injured Mohsin Khan, early, caught brilliantly by Nitish Kumar Reddy at deep backward square-leg off Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) in the third over.\n\nBhuvneshwar struck again in the fifth over, dismissing the dangerous Marcus Stoinis but the credit for the dismissal should go to young Sanvir Singh, who took a stunning diving catch just inches from the ground at mid-on.\n\nThe pitch also didn't help LSG's cause as the ball was coming on to the bat a bit slow, as their batters found it difficult to find the timing.\n\nWhile skipper KL Rahul (29) held one end up, Krunal Pandya (24) took it on himself to up the ante.\n\nKrunal pummelled Jaydev Unadkat for a six over long-on and then hit the bowler straight over his head for another maximum to accumulate 15 runs in the eighth over.\n\nRahul hit the first boundary of LSG innings in the 10th over, slamming SRH skipper Pat Cummins over mid-off.\n\nBut Rahul never looked at his usual best as he struggled to get his timing and finally departed in search of quick runs, caught by T Natarajan at deep backward square leg in the final delivery of the same over.\n\nSRH were brilliant on the field as Cummins' direct throw from mid-on sent Krunal packing soon when the batter went for a quick single.\n\nBadoni pressed the feet on the accelerator soon with three boundaries of left-arm pacer Natarajan's 14th over which yielded 17 runs.\n\nThe Lucknow side finally got going as Pooran and Badoni struck a six and a four to accumulate 12 runs off the 15th over bowled by leg-spinner Vijayakanth Viyaskanth.\n\nThey showed intent from the word go and didn't hesitate to play their strokes when the opportunity was presented to them.\n\nIt was brilliant batting from Badoni as he swept and cut Natarajan for two consecutive boundaries in the 17th over.\n\nBadoni displayed some cheeky shots as the right-hander notched up his fifty in 28 balls.", "source": {"uri": "sports.ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTVSports.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

SRH's dominating win at home has given them a big lead in the playoffs race and once again it was their openers who played a crucial role in securing a vital win in IPL 2024.\n\nRead: Head, Sharma defy odds on slow Hyderabad track as SRH trounce LSG\n\nThe duo of Head and Sharma smashed 107 in the powerplay to register the record for the second-highest score in the first six overs of an IPL match and the record for most runs is also held by Sunrisers - when the openers smashed 125/0 against Delhi Capitals earlier this season.\n\nAlso read | SRH shatter records in rapid run-chase against LSG\n\nOf course, it takes the next level of coordination and trust among a batting duo to be able to produce such record-breaking performances on a trot and Abhishek Sharma spoke exclusively to JioCinema on Match Centre Live about his relationship with Head, his approach while batting, and how he tackled the LSG bowlers.\n\n\"I don't think anyone plays better spin than Travis. The shots he hit off K Gowtham, normally batters can't do that, that shows how special he is. He's very clear, whenever I talk to him, the way he compliments me, I have always been a big fan of him over the last year that I have followed him. When our understanding was established and our partnership improved, we became good friends off the pitch and have started spending more time.\"\n\nAlso Read | Rahul gets public rebuking from LSG team owner Goenka\n\nOn his fearless approach, Sharma said, \"I think this approach was something I took on during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. I feel when I play this way, look at the ball, and react, my shots come off better and the bowler comes under pressure. I always thought if I play in the IPL, I'll try to maintain this. Our support staff and Pat (Cummins), the way they think, I have never seen anyone else think like that. They're like, 'Go out there and express yourself. Play as aggressively as you can, we'll back you.' I think that matters a lot.\"\n\nSharma also discussed how he tackled the LSG bowlers: \"They were bowling cutters in the middle. I thought the cutters could slow down on their way, but Travis and I had planned to play it the way you would hit a spinner with the spin. So, if it's an off-cutter, we look to hit towards long-off covers. If it's a leg cutter, obviously we look at mid-wicket or mid-on.\"", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JioCinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JioCinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnappa_Gowtham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krishnappa Gowtham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed_Mushtaq_Ali_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Travis-Head-Abhishek-Sharma-2024-05-cba4bda9d5987dcdebe8d130441c3bdc-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Pic/PTI\n\nIt was raining sixes at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium last night as Sunrisers Hyderabad thrashed Lucknow Super Giants by 10 wickets with a whopping 62 balls to spare.\n\nOpener Abhishek Sharma continued his fine form (75 not out off 28 balls) while his Aussie counterpart Travis Head (89 not out off 30) was at his destructive best as SRH made a mockery of the LSG total.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEarlier, thanks to the fifth wicket stand of 99 runs in 52 balls between Ayush Badoni (55 not out) and Nicholas Pooran (48 not out), LSG put up 165-4 even though Bhuvneshwar Kumar (4-0-12-2) gave an exhibition of excellent swing bowling yet again.\n\nOpting to bat, LSG fumbled before Pooran and Badoni took charge on a sluggish pitch. Bhuvneshwar struck in his second over as Quinton de Kock perished to a brilliant on-the-line catch by the athletic Nitish Reddy at square-leg. The India swing bowler then removed the dangerous Marcus Stoinis, held nicely by a diving Sanvir Singh at mid-on. LSG were reduced to 21-2 in 4.2 overs.\n\nAlso Read: IPL 2024: Can Royal Challengers Bengaluru make it to the playoffs?\n\nSkipper Pat Cummins's decision to give three successive overs to Bhuvi paid rich dividends to SRH, who were on top.\n\nSkipper KL Rahul, who has come in for some flak for his strike-rate, could not force the pace in the first six overs as LSG scored only 27 runs. Bhuvi had a super first spell of 3-0-7-2. Incidentally, Rahul (33-ball 29) got his first four in the tenth over -- a lofted shot over mid-off off Cummins. But, the Aussie pacer ended Rahul's misery by having him caught in the deep.\n\nCummins was again in action when his direct throw at the non-striker's end from mid-off had Krunal Pandya (24) short of his crease. It was a horrendous call by Pandya, who hit it straight to Cummins and went for a run.\n\nThe advent of West Indies left-hander Pooran and young Badoni saw some acceleration in the LSG score. The duo seized the initiative from SRH bowlers with some innovative and bold batting. Bhuvi came back in the 18th over and conceded just five runs to keep LSG batters in check. But Pooran and Badoni flayed the SRH attack in the last two overs.\n\nRookie Lanka leg-spinner Vijaykanth Viyaskanth, who was signed up as a replacement for Wanindu Hasaranga, made a wonderful debut as he conceded just 27 runs in his four overs. Tall pacer Marco Jansen was left out and the team brought in Viyaskanth while Sanvir Singh came in for the out-of-form Mayank Agarwal.\n\nBrief scores\n\nSRH 167-0 in 9.4 overs (T Head 89*, A Sharma 75*) beat LSG 165-4 in 20 overs (A Badoni 55*, N Pooran 48*; B Kumar 2-12) by 10 wickets", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanvir_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanvir Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Both teams are coming here after facing a defeat. SRH, whose batters were thriving in the first half of the IPL, are now struggling. On the other hand, LSG is also not having a good outing in the last few games.\n\nLooking at the IPL 2024 points table, SRH is at the 4th spot after 6 games with 12 points, whereas LSG, after their last game against KKR where they were defeated by 98 runs, slipped to 6th. Ahead of the SRH vs LSG match, let's take a detailed look at the pitch report for the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium.\n\nThe pitch of Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi Stadium has so far favored the batters. However, on some occasions, it has also supported the bowlers. Taking the examples of the last few games, the bowl is surely getting some movements. In the match against RCB and SRH, the ball was getting stuck in the pitch and coming a bit slowly to the bat. But looking at the SRH scenario, they really look to get some more points. By which they can confirm their berth in the playoffs.\n\nSince batting is the strong suit of Hyderabad, the team will try to set big scores. If they win the toss, they might choose to bat first and defeat Lucknow by runs. SRH's weak point in the last few games was witnessed while they were chasing. The pitch, which helps the bowlers, makes the explosive batters of Hyderabad start struggling. So, it will be a tricky situation for them if they lose the toss and LSG sends them to bowl first.", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aman_verma@insidesport.in", "name": "Aman Verma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://d16f573ilcot6q.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/rajiv-gandhi-stadium-weather-nz-ned-featured-1696756651.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Inspired by his performance, SRH registered a thumping 10-wicket win against the LSG side at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\n\nThe Super Giants captain won the toss and opted to bat first in the contest. Their batters struggled to score freely in the first half of the innings. Impactful knocks from Ayush Badoni (55*) and Nicholas Pooran (48*) in the second phase took them to a competitive total of 165.\n\nHowever, it proved to be too low for SRH in the run chase. Travis Head continued his excellent form in the tournament and went on a carnage, setting the stage for a comprehensive win for his side inside the powerplay. Abhishek Sharma (75*) complemented him perfectly with an aggressive knock of his own as the duo scored more than 100 runs in the first six overs yet again.\n\nThey continued in the same vein even after the powerplay to win the game for SRH in just 9.4 overs. Travis Head was the protagonist for the home team with a splendid knock of 89 (30), which comprised eight sixes and as many fours.\n\nFans took note of Head's majestic performance against LSG in the chase and expressed their reactions on X. Here are some of the top reactions:\n\n\"It took 20 years to forget Ricky Ponting's assault and the way Travis Head played in recent times,it will take 40 years to forget. I can bet you even if you give Cheat Code to KL Rahul, he can't play like Travis Head in his dream.He is that good monster,\" a fan wrote on X.\n\n\"TRAVIS HEAD IS A MONSTER OF THIS IPL. He's just ridiculous, What a Striker of the ball,\" another fan wrote.\n\n\"I'm convinced Travis Head is just warming up for the T20 World Cup,\" a fan wrote.\n\n\"I was trying to get into position early and react to the ball\"- Travis Head\n\nAt the post-match presentation, Travis Head received the Player of the Match award for his sensational knock in the chase. He reflected on the win and said:\n\n\"It was a lot of fun. Abhi and I have forged along some good partnerships and it was great fun again batting with him. I was trying to get into position early and react to the ball. Got ahead of the rate in the first few overs and I felt we could maximise the powerplay. The last twelve months, the Australian team wanted me to bat like this and here it was the same thing.\"\n\nOn Abhishek Sharma's knock and their thought process during the chase, Head continued by saying:\n\n\"Yeah beautiful for him to get a good score today. He works very hard and nice to see him get some runs today. We complement each other so well. We didn't think about the net run rate till the time out when the guys told us about that. I want to take this pitch everywhere. Chasing has been a bit tough for us and hopefully we keep on the good work in the remaining games.\"\n\nSRH will be back in action on May 16 in IPL 2024 when they face the Gujarat Titans (GT) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

For those who are unaware, Sanjiv Goenka owns IPL franchise Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) which is led by KL Rahul. In a match against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) on May 8, LSG faced a humiliating defeat at Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi Stadium. Kavya Maran's SRH chased down the target set by LSG with 10 wickets in hand and 62 balls to spare. After the defeat, LSG owned Sanjiv Goenka was spotted having a heated chat with captain KL Rahul. Although the words of the discussion aren't audible, one can clearly feel the heat from the gestures. The video is now doing rounds on the internet.\n\nAfter winning the toss and electing to bat, LSG managed a below-par total of 164 runs. Captain Rahul's innings of 29 off 33 balls lacked momentum. However, Ayush Badoni (55 off 30) and Nicholas Pooran (48 off 26) rescued the Lucknow-based team with a strong 99-run partnership, providing a solid finish.\n\nIn response, Travis Head (89 off 30) and Abhishek Sharma (75 off 28) wreaked havoc on the Hyderabad-based team, chasing down the target in less than 10 overs with 62 balls to spare. SRH set numerous records while inflicting one of the most embarrassing defeats in IPL history on LSG.\n\nLSG now find themselves in sixth place on the table with only 12 points from 12 matches. They likely need victories in both remaining games to qualify, given their significantly impacted net run rate (NRR).\n\nSince their establishment, LSG have made the playoffs in both previous seasons, though they were eliminated in the eliminator in 2022 and 2023. Rahul was acquired by LSG through a pre-auction draft for the two new teams in 2022, securing a hefty salary of Rs. 17 crore, making him the IPL 2024's priciest Indian player.", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ayushmann_chawla@dnaindia.com", "name": "Ayushmann Chawla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

Image: X\n\nLucknow Super Giants suffered a crushing 10-wicket defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Wednesday. Batting first, LSG crawled to 165/4 in 20 overs. Hosts SRH romped home with 10 wickets and 10.2 overs to spare as Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma obliterated the bowlers.\n\nKL Rahul won the toss and decided to bat. LSG's struggles with the willow were visible early as they got their first boundary only in the 10th over albeit hitting a couple of sixes before it.\n\nKL Rahul himself struggled to unleash the shackles with a laboured 29 runs from 33 balls. It was only Nicholas Pooran (48 off 26 balls) and Ayush Badoni (55 runs in 30 balls) that gave the visitors some sense of respectability with the total - still well below par.\n\nIn the chase, Head and Abhishek had no trouble whatsoever. The Aussie struck 89 runs from 30 balls and Abhishek powered 75 runs from 28 balls with SRH getting the job done with utter ease.\n\nBeyond the massive defeat, video footage of LSG team owner Sanjiv Goenka with captain KL Rahul might not go down well with the squad. In the viral social media video, Goenka can be seen publicly and quite animatedly reprimanding the wicketkeeper-batter.\n\nIn the post-match presentation, KL Rahul was at a loss to describe SRH's comfortable chase.\n\n\"Am lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six-hitting skills,\" KL Rahul said after the match.\n\n\"They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one,\" he added.\n\nKL Rahul said SRH would have chased 240 runs also considering how well they were striking the ball.\n\n\"Once you are on the losing side, there are question marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum,\" KL said.\n\n\"Ayush and Nicky batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

SRH are at the number spot with 6 wins from 11 matches and a win will strengthen their chances for playoffs berth. LSG too have same number of points but their NRR has received a huge blow after big loss in the last match.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar led the way with figures of 4-0-12-2, conceding only singles, completely shutting down the LSG top order, which scored just 66 in the first 11.2 overs. That the top order had not been enterprising enough was underscored by the unbroken 99-run stand off 52 balls between Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran, which eventually proved to be hopelessly inadequate.\n\nMumbai Indians were collateral damage on the night, knocked out of contention for the playoffs by this result, the first team at IPL 2024 to be officially out.", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Coaching_and_Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Coaching and Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/i/cricket/cricinfo/1432919_900x506.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

In response, the home team successfully chased down the target of 166 runs in 9.4 overs, courtesy of explosive batting from Head (89 off 30) and Abhishek (75 off 28), for a crucial victory and moving to No. 3 in the standings.\n\nStay updated with the latest from IPL 2024, including top contenders for the IPL 2024 Orange Cap and IPL 2024 Purple Cap.

The shots he hit off K Gowtham, normally batters can't do that, that shows how special he is. He's very clear, whenever I talk to him, the way he compliments me, I have always been a big fan of him over the last year that I have followed him. When our understanding was established and our partnership improved, we became good friends off the pitch and have started spending more time,\" said Abhishek on Jio Cinema while speaking on his relationship with Head.\n\nAbhishek, who smashed eight boundaries and six maximums during his sensational knock against LSG, said his fearless approach was something \"he took on during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.\"\n\n\"I think this approach was something I took on during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. I feel when I play this way, look at the ball, and react, my shots come off better and the bowler comes under pressure. I always thought if I play in the IPL, I'll try to maintain this. Our support staff and Pat (Cummins), the way they think, I have never seen anyone else think like that. They're like, 'Go out there and express yourself. Play as aggressively as you can, we'll back you.' I think that matters a lot,\" he said.\n\nSharma also discussed how he tackled the LSG bowlers and said, \"They were bowling cutters in the middle. I thought the cutters could slow down on their way, but Travis and I had planned to play it the way you would hit a spinner with the spin. So, if it's an off-cutter, we look to hit towards long-off covers. If it's a leg cutter, obviously we look at mid-wicket or mid-on,\" he concluded.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [{"uri": "siddarth_sriram@news18.com", "name": "Siddarth Sriram", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed_Mushtaq_Ali_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnappa_Gowtham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krishnappa Gowtham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JioCinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JioCinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_cutter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leg cutter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/srh-vs-rr-live-score-ipl-2024-today-2024-05-c0ed19e9c73d25b0a8e61a9d93451b19-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The massive win lifted them to No. 3 on the points table with 14 points in 12 matches, and also gave them a much-needed net-run-rate boost. The chase was so brutal that LSG didn't even bother with their Impact Player.\n\nA lot will rightly be spoken of the explosive batting of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, who got to their fifties in 16 and 19 balls respectively, putting on a hundred between them inside the powerplay for the second time this IPL, both times the highest powerplay scores in all T20 cricket.\n\nHowever, it was with the ball that SRH set up the win. Bhuvneshwar Kumar led the way with figures of 4-0-12-2, conceding only singles, completely shutting down the LSG top order, which scored just 66 in the first 11.2 overs. That the top order had not been enterprising enough was underscored by the unbroken 99-run stand off 52 balls between Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran, which eventually proved to be hopelessly inadequate.\n\nMumbai Indians were collateral damage on the night, knocked out of contention for the playoffs by this result, the first team at IPL 2024 to be officially out.\n\nBhuvneshwar gets stuck in\n\nA word about the fear surrounding the SRH batters first. It was that fear which, in part, prompted LSG to bat first. And then they ran into Bhuvneshwar, who was unerring in his length and drew movement off the pitch. Quinton de Kock - 66 off 66 off Bhuvneshwar in T20 cricket overall - managed just 1 off 4 off him, those four balls inclusive of a near-dismissal and his wicket, caught superbly by Nitish Reddy at deep-square leg.\n\nIt was a sensational catch made to look easy as Reddy took it over his head, threw it back in the field of play, stepped out and came back to complete the catch, but Sanvir Singh soon outdid him with a low catch diving forward at mid-on to send back Marcus Stoinis. Bhuvneshwar ended the powerplay with 3-0-7-2. Add Shahbaz Ahmed's 2-0-9-0 to that, and LSG had had their worst powerplay of the year: 27 for 2.\n\nIPL debutant, the Sri Lanka legspinner V Viyaskanth, kept the lid on after the powerplay only for Krunal Pandya to inject some momentum into the innings by hitting Jaydev Unadkat for successive sixes, the tournament's 999th and 1000th. The first one was an extraordinary straight hook to a head-high slower bouncer over long-on. Little did we know the shot would become a mere footnote by the time the night was done.\n\nBadoni, Pooran rescue LSG\n\nKL Rahul, 29 off 33, perished trying to hit the pace of Pat Cummins, and Krunal was run out by the SRH captain and birthday boy as he tried to steal a single when the boundaries were not coming. It had taken 9.1 overs for the first four of the innings, but Badoni and Pooran found the boundary regularly.

PTI\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad face Lucknow Super Giants on Wednesday at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad with both teams still fighting for a place in the playoffs. Both SRH and LSG have 12 points from 11 matches but Hyderabad are at the fourth spot while Lucknow are at six due to a superior net run rate.\n\nBoth teams have three matches left which means SRH and LSG can reach a maximum of 18 points each. Only five teams can reach 18 points in IPL 2024 including leaders Kolkata Knight Riders, Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings.\n\nBut whoever loses on Wednesday will no longer be able to touch 18 points, giving a clear advantage to the winner of the match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. This means the team that wins on Wednesday will not only stay alive in the playoffs race but will also have control over its qualification. While the loser will only be able to reach a maximum of 16 points and as per current standings, six teams can finish on 16 or more points and in such a case you will have to depend on other results to go in your favour.\n\nAlso, the winner of today's game will qualify for IPL playoffs if it wins the next two matches as well.\n\nMumbai Indians to follow SRH vs LSG\n\nWhile Wednesday's match is between SRH and LSG, MI will be keenly following the contest. Mumbai are in a situation where they cannot go beyond 12 points and in such a scenario MI cannot afford to have the SRH sv LSG game washed out. In case of a washout, both Sunrisers and Lucknow will get one point each and move to 13 points respectively - this means MI will be knocked out as at least four teams will be assured of finishing higher than MI in the IPL table.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Pat-Cummins7-2024-05-a1b88f944e49d01af63c5010df10110c-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Both teams have lost their previous fixtures and will be desperate to return with two points as the race for the playoffs heats up.\n\nSRH currently occupy fourth place in the standings with 12 points from 11 games, including six wins and five defeats. They lost to the Mumbai Indians (MI) by seven wickets in their last outing.\n\nLSG, on the other hand, suffered a thumping 98-run loss to the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at home. They have slipped to sixth position with 12 points from 11 games, including six victories and five defeats.\n\nA win here will be imperative for both teams tonight as IPL 2024 enters the business end. The venue offers plenty of runs and batters will likely have a good outing tonight. On that note, let's take a look at three players who could score the most runs in today's SRH vs LSG match.\n\n#1 Travis Head - SRH\n\nThe left-handed opener has been an excellent addition to the SunRisers squad this year. Travis Head has made strong contributions at the top order, aggregating 444 runs in 10 matches at an average of 44.40 and a strike rate of 189.74. The southpaw has struck three fifties and one century so far in IPL 2024.\n\nHead has looked good in the last two matches despite the results not going his side's way. The Aussie cricketer will look to keep up the good work and steer Hyderabad to victory on Wednesday night.\n\n#2 KL Rahul - LSG\n\nThe LSG skipper has struggled for consistency this season. KL Rahul has got starts in plenty of matches but couldn't convert them into big knocks. He has aggregated 431 runs in 11 matches at an average of 39.18 and a strike rate of just over 140.\n\nRahul will be motivated to play a big knock against Hyderabad and lead his side to victory after he was left out of India's 2024 T20 World Cup team.\n\n#3 Heinrich Klaasen - SRH\n\nThe SunRisers wicketkeeper-batter is one of the fiercest strikers of the cricket ball. When on song, Heinrich Klaasen can destroy any bowling attacks single-handedly.\n\nAfter an excellent start to the IPL 2024 campaign Klaasen has had a couple of subdued games of late. The Protea cricketer will look to fire on all cylinders against the Super Giants and power his side to victory.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ankush_das@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Ankush Das", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Only a spirited fightback by Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran helped them finish on a competitive 165 as the two took 92 runs in the last seven overs during a partnership of 99 (52 balls).\n\nALSO READ: Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma make a mockery of LSG and IPL record books as SRH storm ahead\n\nHead and Sharma then put on some exhibition. Arguably the most explosive opening pair in the league finished the chase in 9.4 overs, crush LSG by 10 wickets to rise to third on the points table. Facing 42 balls each, Head's dazzling 89 not out (8 fours, 8 sixes) was matched by young Abhishek's 75 not out (8 fours, 6 sixes).\n\nThe win lifted SRH on the table with 14 points from 12 games. At 12 points from 12 games, LSG remained sixth and face a tough task to make it to the top four. Apart from needing to recover from the psychological scars of this drubbing, LSG play their last two games away.\n\nLSG captain KL Rahul watched in disbelief from behind the stumps. He was at the crease till the end of 10th over, but managed only one six and one four in a 33-ball 29. Head and Abhishek smashed 13 fours and eight sixes in just the first six overs, powering SRH to 107/0. They made a mockery of the target, reducing the equation to 59 off 84 balls.\n\nHead was brutal. The Australian batter had raced to 58 off 18 balls with seven fours and five sixes while Abhishek was close behind on 46 off 18 balls with six fours and three sixes.\n\nLooking at their early struggles, LSG were certain the pitch was too slow and began their defence with spinner Kishnappa Gowtham. Head and Abhishek gave Gowtham some allowance in the first over, content with eight runs. That was the only respectable over for the LSG bowlers. The opening pair went berserk after that. In his second over, Gowtham was smashed for three sixes and a four by Head before going after LSG's main leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi in a fourth over, scoring 17 runs. Rahul turned to the pace of Naveen-ul-Haq only for Head to smash him for four fours and a six. SRH's 100 was up in 5.4 overs.\n\nLSG had the dubious distinction of registering their slowest PP score of 27 runs. Their 100 came in the 15th over. SRH finished the chase inside 10 overs.\n\nEarlier, in a season where the fielding standards have seen a dip, SRH players produced an electric fielding display to provide an ideal start in their crucial game. They backed Bhuvneshwar Kumar's fine bowling with the new ball with two brilliant catches, by Nitish Reddy and Simran Singh. Captain Pat Cummins produced a stunning direct hit to cut short Krunal Pandya's promising innings.\n\nPutting on an exhibition of seam bowling, Bhuvneshwar finished with figures of 4-0-12-2.\n\nSRH gave a debut to Sri Lankan leg-spinner Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, who hails from Jaffna, making him the first cricketer born-and-bred from that northern city to play in an internationally televised game.\n\nIntroduced in the seventh over, he started with a tidy over, of just three runs, and would be pleased with figures of 4-0-27-0.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

The batting duo added a 167-run partnership to chase down the Lucknow Super Giants' total of 165 in just 9.4 overs at their home ground.\n\nAbhishek Sharma credited Travis Head for his aggressive batting style, stating that he often sets the tone for their partnerships. The 23-year-old batter also expressed gratitude to Yuvraj Singh, Brian Lara, and his father for their unwavering support in his cricketing journey.\n\n\"All the credit goes to him (Travis Head). The way he starts against all bowlers... he goes after them from the start and takes the pressure off. The bowlers told us (during the innings break) that it was getting better, but myself and Travis thought it was not doing much. I think the hard work I put in before the tournament is showing now, thanks to Yuvi Paaji, Brian (Lara) as well and my father, who is my first coach,\" Abhishek said.\n\nYuvraj Singh responded to Abhishek Sharma's gratitude and encouraged the young batter to maintain consistency and patience. Yuvraj stated that an opportunity for Sharma in international cricket is forthcoming.\n\n\"Well played @IamAbhiSharma4. Be consistent, be patient! Your time is around the corner! @travishead34 what planet are you batting on, my friend?

Openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma remained unbeaten as SRH cruised to 167/0 in 9.4 overs, in their chase of 166 runs.\n\nAbhishek, who slotted in as his side's Impact Player, smacked an unbeaten knock of 75 runs off 28 balls, packed with eight fours and six sixes. Meanwhile, Head clattered an unbeaten knock of 89 off 30 deliveries, slamming eight fours and eight sixes in the process.\n\nTheir batting display was simply sensational and also received plaudits from all corners. Meanwhile, India legend Sachin Tendulkar took to X, formerly known as Twitter, and called it 'an understatement'.\n\nHe wrote, \"A destructive opening partnership would be an understatement tonight. Had these boys batted first, they would've scored 300!\"\n\nInitially, a two-wicket haul from Bhuvneshwar Kumar saw SRH restrict LSG to 165/4 in 20 overs. Meanwhile, Ayush Badoni (55*) and Nicholas Pooran (48*) remained unbeaten for LSG. The result also meant that MI have been eliminated from the playoffs race.\n\nSRH won with 62 balls to spare, which also became the best win in IPL with most balls to spare in 100-plus targets. SRH's win is followed by DC's win vs Punjab Kings in 2022, where 57 balls were left to spare in a chase of 117 runs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Head and Abhishek faced the second-fewest balls in IPL history to get to their 100-run partnership, coming up against 34 deliveries. They are also on top of the leaderboard in this statistic, facing only 30 balls against DC this year. After the win, SRH climbed to third position in the standings with 14 points. Meanwhile, LSG remained in sixth with 12 points.\n\nLauding Head, Abhishek said, \"All the credit goes to him (Head). The way he starts against all bowlers.. he goes after them from the start and takes the pressure off. The bowlers told us (during the innings break) that it was getting better, but myself and Travis thought it was not doing much.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Aussie opener praised Abhishek. He said, \"I know how hard he works and how deep he thinks, his spin play is second to none. We compliment each other very well.

The destroyer-in-chief was the opening pair of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma who hit the LSG bowlers left, right, and centre to chase the 166-run target under a mere 10 overs.\n\nThe win also knocked out Mumbai Indians (MI) from the playoff race as the destructive duo took centre stage and launched an onslaught on LSG who could manage just 165 in their stipulated 20 overs. Post the victory, Head and Sharma recapped how they went for the chase and what approach they relied upon to wrap things up quickly. Just as they finished talking about the recap, they had a special mention as they dedicated the win to their skipper Pat Cummins.\n\nCummins celebrated his 31st birthday on May 8, Wednesday and had a perfect birthday present in the form of an explosive night brought by his opening southpaws. Sharma said, \"Special message from the team to Pat Cummins, Happy Birthday, this win is for you.\" Head added, \"Yes he is getting old. Happy Birthday, Pat, hope you enjoy it.\"\n\nAs LSG opted to bat first, they posted an average total of 165/4 in their stipulated 20 overs on a pitch that looked to have become batting-friendly as the game progressed. Skipper KL Rahul played a slow knock of 29 runs off 33 deliveries followed by Nicholas Pooran's crucial 48* and Ayush Badoni's 55*.

Avesh Khan", "body": "SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH) will clash with the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in Match 57 of Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024. The Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad will host this contest.\n\nSRH are currently fourth in the points table with six wins in 11 league matches. In their last outing, the SunRisers posted a modest score of 173 against Mumbai Indians (MI), with Travis Head scoring 48 off 30. Their bowling unit then failed to defend their score, as MI sealed the chase in the 18th over.\n\nLSG, on the other hand, are sixth in the standings with the same number of wins as their opponents but have an inferior net run rate. Their last outing was against Kolkata Knight Riders, who smashed 235 runs at a slow surface like Lucknow. The LSG batting unit couldn't handle the pressure, bundling out for 137.\n\nIt will be a crucial game for both teams as the side winning will have one foot in the IPL 2024 playoffs. On that note, let's take a look at the three best bowling performances in SRH-LSG matches in the cash-rich league.\n\n#3 Jason Holder - 3/34, IPL 2022\n\nThe Caribbean all-rounder did well in his only season with the Lucknow Super Giants in 2022.\n\nBatting first in Match 12, the Super Giants posted 169 on the board, with KL Rahul (68) and Deepak Hooda (51) emerging as the top contributors. For the SunRisers Hyderabad, Washington Sundar, Romario Shepherd and T. Natarajan picked up two wickets each.\n\nThe LSG bowling unit did well to take consistent wickets and keep SRH under pressure. With 16 needed off the last over, Jason Holder was handed the opportunity to defend it for Lucknow.\n\nOn the first delivery, Holder pitched it a good length area. Sundar tried to clear the fence but the long-on fielder Rahul came running to take a fine catch.\n\nThe fourth ball saw Holder delivering a slower delivery and Bhuvneshwar Kumar's top edge was caught by the keeper Quinton de Kock.\n\nOn the last ball, Shepherd could only hold out at the point region, and Holder managed to secure a 12-run victory for the LSG side. He finished with figures of 3/34 off four overs.\n\n#2 Krunal Pandya - 3/18, IPL 2023\n\nIn the 10th match of IPL 2023, LSG met SRH at the Ekana Stadium. The decision to bat first backfired SRH, as Krunal Pandya's impressive spell put them under pressure.\n\nIn the third over, Pandya came into the attack and got Mayank Agarwal caught at silly mid-off through a soft dismissal.\n\nThe eighth over saw Pandya trapping Anmolpreet Singh, who was steering the visitors at a comfortable rate. On the next delivery, the left-arm spinner breached through the defense of Aiden Markram to dismiss him for a golden duck. Pandya finished with figures of 3/18 off four overs, as SRH scored 121/8 in 20 overs.\n\nKL Rahul (35) and Krunal Pandya (34) were impressive with the bat to help LSG complete the chase in 16 overs.\n\n#1 Avesh Khan - 4/24, IPL 2022\n\nThe right-arm pacer returned with terrific figures of 4/24 in the same game, where Jason Holder secured a final-over victory for the LSG team.\n\nChasing 170, SRH were certainly under a bit of pressure and needed a few boundaries to get going. In the fourth over, Kane Williamson tried to be innovative by playing a scoop against Avesh's widish delivery but only ended up playing on Andrew Tye's throat in the short fine leg area.\n\nThen, Abhishek Sharma tried to be ambitious by trying to play a big shot in the seventh over but was caught near the point region.\n\nWith 27 needed off 16, Avesh dismissed Nicholas Pooran, who played a big shot straight into the hands of the long-off fielder. The next delivery saw the pacer inducing an edge of Abdul Samad and dismissing him for a golden duck. In doing so, he helped the LSG team secure a confidence-boosting victory.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tejas_rathi@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Tejas Rathi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avesh_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avesh Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

(On his spin hitting) It is something I have been working on, it will be a big part in the Caribbean as well. It is important to go 360 in the modern game,\" Head said. IPL 2024 Full Coverage | IPL 2024 Points Table and Standings | 2024 IPL Full Schedule\n\nLSG's plan to introduce spin early on in the innings backfired as Head took down Krishnappa Gowtham in the 3rd over of the chase for 22 runs. He slammed Ravi Bishnoi for massive fours and sixes as the entire LSG bowling attack looked hapless.\n\nHead talked about his fearless approach for his national team as well as the franchise side. With Pat Cummins being at the helm of affairs in the Test and ODI sides for Australia and at SRH, Head has found clarity in the role and has delivered it to perfection.\n\n\"The last 12 months, that's how they wanted me to play in the Aussie team, and that's what I've been told to do here as well,\" Head said.\n\nThe Australian opener scored 327 runs in the ODI World Cup 2023 for Australia at an average of 54.83. This also included a delightful knock of 137 runs in the final against India on November 19, 2023. Head continued his domination on the Indian tracks as he has slammed 533 runs in 11 matches at an average of 53.30 in the IPL 2024.\n\nHead opened up on his record-breaking partnership with Abhishek Sharma, who also scored a 28-ball 75 against LSG. He was happy after accumulating more runs than David Warner in his first season for SRH.\n\n\"Nothing much that I have to change. (On Abhishek Sharma) I know how hard he works and how deep he thinks, his spin play is second to none. We compliment each other very well. Nice to see him back amongst the runs after missing out the last couple of games. (On NRR) We didn't think about it till the Timeout, but after that the boys came out and told us to score quickly.\" Head said.\n\n\"The crowd was exceptional tonight, that's what we needed after losing the last two. I haven't got many things over him, so that's good to know that I have more runs than David Warner did in his first SRH season. We start again whenever we come out here for the next game,\" Head added.\n\nAbhishek and Head shared their 3rd 100-plus opening stand of the season as they helped SRH chase down the target of 167 runs within 9.4 overs.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSG_(band)", "type": "org",

SRH smashed eight sixes in this period, twice of what LSG managed in their entire innings. If with the ball courtesy of Bhuvneshwar Kumar's efforts, SRH gained momentum in the contest, with the bat, they completely killed the chase in this phase.\n\nLed by Bhuvneshwar Kumar's fine spell upfront, well aided by Shahbaz Ahmed, SRH managed to restrict LSG to their lowest-ever powerplay score. The batters struggled to find timing and never had the rhythm to get going, losing two crucial wickets - Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis - in this period.\n\nKrunal Pandya's assault on Jaydev Unadkat, which included two sixes down the ground, allowed LSG to get some much-needed momentum in their innings. However, he didn't find ample support from the other end. Rahul holed out to T Natarajan at long leg and soon after Krunal himself was run out while attempting a quick single.\n\nBadoni and Pooran stepped on the accelerator in the death overs and countered SRH's plans of using the slower balls on the hard lengths by attacking the shorter part of the boundary. They couldn't send any of those shots over the rope, including the last one which was superbly defended by Nitish Reddy at sweeper cover.\n\nIn the first eight balls of the run-chase, SRH were moving along at run-a-ball, far slower than their standards, and then Abhishek Sharma cut loose. Yash Thakur lost his line, and as the attack continued from both ends - as Travis Head and Abhishek have done for most of this season - LSG ran out of plans. K Gowtham, who bowled an effective first over, was taken to the cleaners in his second, butchered for three sixes and a boundary.\n\nThe duo exploded and hammered 99 runs in the next 28 balls, which killed the contest. Head, who led the assault, powered along to his joint-fastest half-century, reaching the mark in only 16 balls - his fourth fifty within the powerplay this season, most by any batter ever in IPL.\n\nThe middle overs started with a six by Travis Head and the chase ended with a six by Abhishek Sharma. The two southpaws continued their relentless attack in the never-ending six-fest as SRH managed to post the highest-ever score within the first 10 overs in the IPL (playing two balls less). Badoni's part-time off-breaks were smashed for 19, Ravi Bishnoi was taken apart for 17, Naveen ul Haq bowled a few effective slower balls but was still carted away for 14. The chase was done and dusted in 58 balls.\n\nWith that win, SRH not only gave their NRR a boost but also knocked out Mumbai Indians from the qualification race.

This scenario could see SRH and LSG entering the top four in the standings, intensifying the playoff race among the six remaining contenders: CSK, LSG, SRH, DC, RCB, and PBKS.\n\nCSK could swiftly re-enter the playoff race by winning their next match against GT on May 10, potentially displacing LSG from the top four.\n\nIf tonight's SRH vs LSG match is washed out, SRH stands to benefit the most, especially considering their slightly better net run rate compared to LSG and DC. However, a potential washout could make it challenging for RCB and PBKS to secure playoff berths.\n\nBoth SRH and LSG are likely hoping for an uninterrupted game or, at the very least, a five-over-per-side match.

Meanwhile, this is now the highest stand (any wicket) against LSG in the competition's history, surpassing the 142-run stand shared between Shubman Gill and Wriddhiman Saha for Gujarat Titans in IPL 2023.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnappa_Gowtham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krishnappa Gowtham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wriddhiman Saha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shubman Gill"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l63920240508232236.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Travis Head and KL Rahul", "body": "We are almost into the final few days of IPL 2024 and Wednesday would be the first time that SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Lucknow Supergiants (LSG) will play against each other this year. And they couldn't have picked up a more enthralling time - both are level on points after 11 games, fighting for the top four.\n\nBoth teams are coming off big losses. While LSG have been marred by injury concerns and an unstable batting order, SRH's playing 11 changes after their back-to-back losses in the middle of the season haven't worked too well.\n\nBut just to demonstrate the quality these two sides possess, we have picked a combined 11 from their squads. It brings together their best qualities with minimum weaknesses, by including the most in-form players. It's a hypothetical team but we have limited to players who are available for selection. Check it out:\n\nTop order: Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, and KL Rahul (WK)\n\nIt's hard to break the opening combination of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma this IPL. Thanks to them, SRH's powerplay run rate of 11.04 is only behind Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).\n\nWhile Head has smashed 444 runs at a strike rate of 189.74, Abhishek has 234 runs at a strike rate of 188.70. The two left-handers like to take on the bowlers from the first over itself and when they get going, they are almost impossible to stop.\n\nLSG have made it easier to keep them intact at the top of the order by dropping Quinton de Kock from their 11. Youngster Arshin Kulkarni hasn't been able to grab his opportunities yet while skipper KL Rahul has had his usual strike-rate issues where he has failed to get off the blocks quickly, apart from a couple of games.\n\nRahul, though would be the perfect number three for this team. The right-hander has scored 431 runs this season at an average of 39.18. Shifting him a position down the order would allow Head and Abhishek to continue as they have and give more steel to the middle order. Rahul's skills of moving the game with him, especially against spin, would work well for the big hitters following him.\n\nRahul's display of some exceptional wicketkeeping skills this year makes him the best option to take the gloves as well.\n\nMiddle order: Nicholas Pooran, Heinrich Klaasen, Nitish Reddy, and Abdul Samad\n\nThis would make one of the most fearsome middle orders in all IPL. Left-handed Nicholas Pooran has scored 315 runs at a strike rate close to 160 while Heinrich Klaasen has collected 339 runs, striking at over 186. The former's ability to take down all kinds of spinners would dovetail with the latter's unmatched pace-hitting skills.\n\nThey would be followed by two promising SRH youngsters Nitish Reddy and Abdul Samad. Reddy has been impressive with both bat and ball in IPL 2024, rescuing his team multiple times from a batting collapse. Apart from 239 runs at a strike rate of 152, he also has three wickets, making him a handy pace option.\n\nSamad, meanwhile, has shown the same promise he showed in his debut season which went missing in the last three years. More than his 151 runs at a strike rate of 181.93 which have provided crucial finishing touches for SRH, it's his willingness to take the responsibility to attack that makes him a stand-out batter.\n\nLSG also have some decent options for number five, especially someone like Marcus Stoinis who could be great value to the team. However, there has been a lot of shuffling and no one has scored runs as consistently as the SRH group.\n\nBowlers: Pat Cummins (C), Ravi Bishnoi, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and T Natarajan\n\nSRH captain Pat Cummins was the obvious choice for captain as well as the leader of the bowling attack. Although Rahul has been great with a young team, Cummins is just more qualified and experienced to lead such a star-studded team.\n\nHis bowling has been superb too, much better than what most expected when he was signed. He has 13 wickets in 11 games, bowled the most important overs more often than not, and taken the key wickets even on the flattest tracks.\n\nHis pace partners at SRH, T Natarajan and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, are easy choices too. Natarajan has 15 wickets in nine games at 21.20. He has time and again shown that he's one of the best death bowlers in IPL, thanks to his ability to bowl pin-point yorkers at will and beat the batters with his slingy actions and variations.\n\nAlthough LSG have some excellent pacers in their ranks, like Mohsin Khan and Yash Dayal, neither have been at their best. Mayank Yadav would have been a sure-shot entrant but he has likely been ruled off the season due to injury.\n\nThis gives a slight edge to Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who has recently shown vintage form with five wickets in the last three games. His new ball skills and the kind of death-over experience he showed against Rajasthan Royals is hard to leave out.\n\nFinally, spin bowling. This has been an issue for both SRH and LSG. SRH's Mayank Markande was doing well but they chose to drop him. LSG's Ravi Bishnoi, thus, takes the spot despite not being at his best.\n\nHis economy rate and confidence in big duels have been decent but the leg-spinner has just lacked the usual consistency with his lines and lengths. As soon as he finds that, he'll be back picking a ton of wickets again.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rudransh_khurana@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Rudransh Khurana", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

Nice to get this done in 10 overs. Abhi (Abhishek Sharma) and I have had a few partnerships like this. Just concentrate on getting in good positions, watch the ball hard and try to maximise the powerplay.\n\n\"It is something I have been working on (spin-hitting), it will be a big part of the Caribbean as well. It is important to go 360 in the modern game. The last 12 months, that is how they wanted me to play in the Aussie team, and that is what I have been told to do here as well.\"\n\nPraising his opening partner Abhishek for his hard work and \"deep thinking\", Head said: \"We complement each other very well. We didn't think about it till the Timeout, but after that, the boys came out and told us to score quickly.\n\n\"The crowd was exceptional tonight, that is what we needed after losing the last two. I haven't got many things over him, so that is good to know that I have more runs than David Warner did in his first SRH season,\" he concluded.\n\nAbhishek thanks Lara, Yuvraj\n\nIMAGE: Abhishek Sharma clobbered 75 off just 28 balls.

Both players dominated the game, not allowing the LSG bowlers any respite.\n\nLucknow's Early Promise and Fielding Struggles\n\nLucknow had initially bowled a good first over, putting pressure on the batters. However, once the SRH batsmen settled in, they took full advantage of the bowling attack, punishing any loose deliveries. Lucknow's fielding was also lacklustre, with several dropped chances that may have been crucial in changing the course of the match. KL Rahul's decision not to use an impact player was surprising and may have affected the outcome.\n\nExceptional Batting from Sharma and Head\n\nThe batting display from Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head was remarkable, both reaching their half-centuries in under 20 balls. Sharma scored 75 runs from 28 balls, while Head notched up 89 from 30 deliveries. Their explosive partnership propelled SRH to a rapid victory, lifting them above Chennai in the standings and boosting their net run rate significantly.\n\nSRH's Strong Bowling Start\n\nIn the earlier stages of the match, SRH's bowlers made good use of the pitch to take quick wickets and apply pressure on Lucknow. Bhuvneshwar Kumar led the bowling attack with two wickets and an economy rate of just 3.00. Despite this, Nicholas Pooran and Ayush Badoni provided some resistance for LSG, stabilising their innings and pushing the team's total above 160.\n\nOverall, SRH's dominant performance in both batting and bowling outshone LSG, allowing them to secure a commanding victory. This result not only elevates SRH's position in the league standings but also serves as a valuable boost to their net run rate, which may prove essential in the later stages of the tournament.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/05/20240508171325_sunriserswin.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Chasing a target of 166, SRH achieved victory in just 9.4 overs, highlighting their dominance with the bat.\n\nSRH's aggression was evident right from the powerplay, where they amassed a staggering 107 runs, setting the tone for their commanding chase. The left-handed opening duo started cautiously, managing only eight runs in the first over, but quickly shifted gears, unleashing a barrage of boundaries and sixes.\n\nAbhishek's assault on Yash Thakur in the second over, followed by Head's onslaught on K Gowtham in the third over, left the LSG bowlers reeling. Despite attempts to stem the flow of runs by introducing Ravi Bishnoi and Naveen-ul-Haq, SRH continued to pile on the pressure, with Head reaching a blistering half-century off just 16 balls.\n\nAs the field spread out, there was no respite for LSG as Head and Abhishek continued their onslaught, reaching their respective fifties in style. The duo exhibited fearless batting, smashing boundaries at will and securing victory for SRH with plenty of overs to spare.\n\nHead remained unbeaten on 89 off 30 balls, while Abhishek finished on 75 not out off 28 balls, guiding SRH to victory with an impressive display of strokeplay, comprising 16 fours and 14 sixes.\n\nEarlier in the match, SRH's bowlers had laid the foundation for victory by restricting LSG to 165 despite a late surge led by Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran. Bhuvneshwar Kumar's disciplined bowling, coupled with crucial breakthroughs in the powerplay, set the tone for SRH's dominant performance.\n\nDespite a spirited fightback from LSG's middle order, SRH maintained their composure, eventually cruising to victory in emphatic fashion. With this commanding win, SRH reaffirmed their position as strong contenders in the IPL 2024 tournament.\n\nThe match showcased the ruthlessness of SRH's batting lineup and the resilience of their bowling unit, leaving their opponents with much to ponder as the tournament progresses.

In a disappointingly one-sided encounter, SRH held LSG to 165-4 after being asked to bowl first. In the chase, they romped home in 9.4 overs, not losing a single wicket in the process.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar was brilliant with the ball for Sunrisers Hyderabad.

In the chase, Travis Head clobbered 89* in 30 balls, while Abhishek Sharma smashed 75* in 28 balls.\n\nFollowing the thumping win, Sunrisers Hyderabad find themselves at third position in the IPL 2024 points table.

They have eight points from 11 matches at a net run rate of -1.320. Winning their remaining three matches will take them to 14 points. However, that is not likely to be enough for them to reach the playoffs. Even if the run rate equation comes into play, Gujarat's chances of progressing are negligible.\n\nWhen Gujarat met Hyderabad in the first half of IPL 2024 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, they hammered Pat Cummins and co. by seven wickets. Bowling first, Gujarat Titans held Hyderabad to 162-8 as Mohit Sharma claimed 3-25. In the chase, good contributions from the top and middle-order took them home in 19.1 overs.\n\nGujarat have been in woeful form lately, having lost four of their last five matches, three of them in succession. In their last three IPL 2024 matches, they have gone down to Delhi Capitals (DC) by four runs and to Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) by nine wickets and four wickets respectively.", "source":

But Rahul never looked at his usual best as he struggled to get his timing and finally departed in search of quick runs, caught by T Natarajan at deep backward square leg in the final delivery of the same over.\n\nThe remorseless domination of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, who carved lightning fast fifties, helped Sunrisers Hyderabad mount the fastest chase of a 160-plus target en route their convincing 10-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL match here on Wednesday. Chasing a modest target of 166, Head (89 not out, 30 balls, 8x4, 8x6) and Sharma (75 not out, 28 balls, 8x4, 6x6) toyed with LSG bowlers, finding boundaries and sixes at will to canter home in just 9.4 overs. The win propelled SRH to the third position in the standings with 14 points from 12 games, while LSG are struggling at the sixth spot with 12 points from the same number of matches. The result also meant that five-time champions Mumbai Indians, currently ninth with eight points from 12 matches, are out of the play-off race. The dance of destruction by Head and Sharma even left the legendary Sachin Tendulkar gushing. ''A destructive opening partnership would be an understatement tonight. Had these boys batted first, they would've scored 300,'' Tendulkar wrote in his X account. The Head and Sharma show came after SRH bowlers started brilliantly before losing the plot a bit. Ayush Badoni (55 not out off 30 balls) and Nicholas Pooran (48 not out off 25 balls) stitched crucial 95-runs off 55 balls for the unbeaten fifth-wicket stand to guide LSG to a competitive 165 for four on a sluggish pitch. But the Head and Sharma took any hint of competition out of the match once they bludgeoned 107 runs in the Power Play. It was an awesome hitting display from the Indo-Australian pair as they didn't spare a single LSG bowler, clobbering them to all parts of the ground. LSG's decision to start with Krishnappa Gowtham also backfired badly as both Head and Sharma, who are really good against spin, dismantled the off-spinner.\n\nSuch was the brutal assault that the likes Yash Dayal, Ravi Bishnoi and Naveen-ul-Haq were also taken to the cleaners, raining sixes and fours. Earlier, LSG were struggling at 27 for 2 at the end of the powerplay after opting to bat. The visitors lost Quinton de Kock, who replaced an injured Mohsin Khan, early, caught brilliantly by Nitish Kumar Reddy at deep backward square-leg off Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) in the third over. Bhuvneshwar struck again in the fifth over, dismissing the dangerous Marcus Stoinis but the credit for the dismissal should go to young Sanvir Singh, who took a stunning diving catch just inches from the ground at mid-on. The pitch also didn't help LSG's cause as the ball was coming on to the bat a bit slow, as their batters found it difficult to find the timing. While skipper KL Rahul (29) held one end up, Krunal Pandya (24) took it on himself to up the ante. Krunal pummelled Jaydev Unadkat for a six over long-on and then hit the bowler straight over his head for another maximum to accumulate 15 runs in the eighth over. Rahul hit the first boundary of LSG innings in the 10th over, slamming SRH skipper Pat Cummins over mid-off. But Rahul never looked at his usual best as he struggled to get his timing and finally departed in search of quick runs, caught by T Natarajan at deep backward square leg in the final delivery of the same over. SRH were brilliant on the field as Cummins' direct throw from mid-on sent Krunal packing soon when the batter went for a quick single. Badoni pressed the feet on the accelerator soon with three boundaries of left-arm pacer Natarajan's 14th over which yielded 17 runs. The Lucknow side finally got going as Pooran and Badoni struck a six and a four to accumulate 12 runs off the 15th over bowled by leg-spinner Vijayakanth Viyaskanth. They showed intent from the word go and didn't hesitate to play their strokes when the opportunity was presented to them. It was brilliant batting from Badoni as he swept and cut Natarajan for two consecutive boundaries in the 17th over. Badoni displayed some cheeky shots as the right-hander notched up his fifty in 28 balls.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T.

The match was all about the incredible power-hitting show put up by SRH's opening pair, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, which left Rahul and his team stunned.\n\nAfter the game, Rahul openly admitted that LSG was simply outplayed by the phenomenal batting display of Head and Sharma. He couldn't help but marvel at their batting, describing it as \"unreal,\" a sentiment shared by many who watched their aggressive onslaught on the bowlers. The duo's dominance added another remarkable chapter to their saga of destructive batting, leading SRH to a convincing 10-wicket victory over LSG in a crucial IPL showdown.\n\nThe chase, despite the modest target of 166 runs, turned into a nightmare for LSG as Head and Sharma unleashed an onslaught of boundaries and sixes with remarkable ease. Head's unbeaten 89 off just 30 balls, complemented by Sharma's blistering 75 off 28 deliveries, showcased a masterclass in power-hitting. Together, they tore apart the LSG bowling attack, achieving victory in just 9.4 overs and leaving their opponents utterly shell-shocked.\n\nPrior to SRH's batting onslaught, LSG had managed to post a competitive total of 165 for four, thanks to a blazing partnership between Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran. However, their efforts were overshadowed by the sheer dominance displayed by Head and Sharma.\n\nRahul highlighted LSG's downfall to their lackluster performance during the powerplay, where they could only muster 27 runs while losing two crucial wickets. It was a missed opportunity that proved costly against a team like SRH, known for their aggressive style of play right from the start.\n\nSRH skipper Pat Cummins praised the \"unreal\" batting exhibition displayed by Head and Sharma, recognizing their crucial role in securing the emphatic victory. Head, rightfully awarded the player-of-the-match accolade for his stellar performance, expressed his joy at batting alongside Sharma, emphasizing their strong partnership on the field.\n\nAs the IPL season unfolds, this match will be remembered for the breathtaking display of power-hitting by SRH's dynamic duo, leaving fans and opponents alike in awe of their batting brilliance.\n\nSEE ALSO: KL Rahul Advised To Walk Away As Owner's Temper Flares After SRH Defeat; Fans Call It 'Shameless'", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

The Commentators also felt that Lucknow was deflating, and Matthew Hayden pointed out that the visitors' batters were lacking in terms of intent.\n\nIndia's KL Rahul reacts after running between the wickets during the IPL 2024 match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium | Image: BCCI\n\n\"I have to call them out. This is not a 5 runs per over wicket. Somebody needed to show intent. They had one of the slowest powerplays. That took the innings nowhere. When the opposition team has Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen, your intention should be to go at 10s and over. 160-170 will never be enough,\" Matthew Hayden said while on the air.\n\nAlso Read: 'Should be done behind the camera': Foreign cricketers react to LSG owner lashing out at KL Rahul\n\nWhile LSG might still be eligible to remain in the race to the playoffs, Mike Hesson believes that LSG's chances have slimmed to the down, and they are out of the IPL, just like Mumbai Indians. While responding to a question during an appearance on JioCinema, Hesson feels LSG's campaign is over.\n\n\"I think yes. With Mayank Yadav missing, they don't really have that X-factor in their bowling. Even Mohsin Khan didn't play today. Ravi Bishnoi hasn't been at his best this IPL. So their bowling attack doesn't look threatening.

We complement each other so well.\"\n\nAbhishek joined the charge as he got to his fifty in 19 balls after the pair took Hyderabad to 107 in the first six overs of powerplay, when only two fielders are allowed outside the inner circle.\n\nHyderabad, who won the IPL in 2016 under David Warner, registered their seventh win in 12 matches to hand a perfect gift to birthday boy and captain Pat Cummins, who turned 31 on Wednesday.\n\nAbhishek hit the winning six as Hyderabad moved to third in the 10-team table with 14 points. Lucknow stay sixth after the bruising loss.\n\nTop four teams will make the play-offs with the final on May 26 in Chennai.\n\nCummins said Head's unconventional hitting does not \"surprise\" him anymore and praised Abhishek for being \"an incredible player of spin\" and pace.\n\nSeam bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar set up victory with impressive bowling figures of 2-12 in his four overs to restrict Lucknow to 165-4 after they elected to bat first. Lucknow lost regular wickets until Nicholas Pooran, who hit 48, and Ayush Badoni, who smashed 55, put on an unbeaten stand of 99 in 52 balls to boost the team total.

They recovered and posted 165/4, giving an impression they had done a good job on a tricky surface.\n\nTravis Head and Abhishek Sharma threw those assumptions out of the window. The duo ransacked LSG for 107 runs in the first six overs itself and didn't stop hunting despite the fielding restrictions lifted.\n\nSRH blazed away to the target in mere 9.4 overs, a chase that lasted 45 minutes.\n\nAustralia batting legend Matthew Hayden wasn't happy with LSG's approach with the bat and he 'called them out' for their slow scoring rate, especially against a side that has been breaking batting records this season for fun.\n\n\"I have to call them (LSG) out,\" Hayden said on air. \"This is not a five runs per over wicket. Somebody needed to show intent. They had one of the slowest Powerplays. That took the innings nowhere.

Even Mohsin Khan didn't play today. Ravi Bishnoi hasn't been at his best this IPL. So their bowling attack doesn't look threatening.

overs to give the Sunrisers Hyderabad a 10-wicket victory in their crucial match against the Lucknow Super Giants at the Rajiv Gandhi Cricket Stadium in Hyderabad on Wednesday.\n\nAustralian Head finished unbeaten on 89 from a staggering 30 balls with eight fours and eight sixes while Abhishek was just a whisper slower with 75 not out from 28 balls with an equal number of fours and six maximums.\n\nIn a season of breath-taking batting records, mostly set by the Sunrisers, this was the most extraordinary of all.\n\nLucknow's opening bowler, Krishnappa Gowtham, was the most economical of the five who were used - and abused - with figures of 2-0-29-0.\n\nThe other figures are best not published to protect the innocent.\n\nEarlier Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran added an undefeated 99 for the fifth wicket but the Lucknow Super Giants could only muster a well below-par total of 165-4 after choosing to bat first.\n\nThe visitors displayed an embarrassing excess of caution on a slowish pitch after losing two early wickets as they limped to a modest 27-2 after six overs in the Power Play.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar was yet again outstanding with 2-12 from his four overs as he removed big guns Quinton de Kock (2) and Marcus Stoinis (3) in his second and third overs with the new ball to unnerve the Super Giants.\n\nCaptain KL Rahul responded with an ultra-cautious 29 from 33 balls before opposite number Pat Cummins removed him with the last ball of the 10 over with the score a tepid 57-3.\n\nWhen Cummins ran out Krunal Pandya (24 from 21) with a brilliant direct hit from mid on the visitors were 66-4.\n\nBut Badoni's unbeaten 55 from 30 balls with nine fours and Pooran's 48 not out from 26 balls with six fours and a six proved that conditions were not remotely as awkward as the earlier batting had suggested.\n\nHead and Abhishek confirmed that it was, in fact, a batting paradise with their unbridled, unhinged and wild assault -- the like of which has never been seen before in the tournament.\n\nLog-leaders Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals are almost guaranteed places in the playoff matches with eight wins and 16 points from their 11 matches but the Sunrisers and the Super Giants were in a four-team scrap on 12 points looking for a place in the knockout phase.\n\nHaving massively improved their already dominant run-rate, the Sunrisers now move into sole possession of third place ahead of Chennai Super Kings, Delhi Capitals and Lucknow.\n\nSUNRISERS HYDERABAD: Travis Head, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (wkt), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz

The LSG boss vented it all on his skipper KL Rahul who conceded the 166-run target set by them in a mere 9.4 overs as SRH openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma made a mockery of the LSG bowling attack.\n\nLSG had opted to bat first and took a complete 20 overs to post 165/4 on the board. What took them more than an hour and a half was done and dusted by the SRH batters in less than an hour as they went all guns blazing and it seemed everything found the middle of the bat. Generally a team owner not happy with the performance of his side either refrains from expressing his displeasure or does it in a private space but that wasn't the case for RPSG group's founder chairman Goenka.\n\nThe 63-year-old boiled over KL Rahul seemingly for the performance of LSG in the match and was seen making some furious hand gestures as KL Rahul tried to plead his case and Goenka rebuffed it all. The animated chat signified his anger at the disappointing defeat which soon went viral on social media as fans started slamming the owner for not respecting Rahul and demeaning him publicly.\n\nThe fans and even commentators felt that the LSG owner could have waited for the players to return to the dressing room or could have opted a more private place to hold this conversation.\n\nKL Rahul was completely in shock and in awe of the duo of Head and Sharma. \"I am lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six-hitting skills,\" Rahul said.\n\nRahul felt that SRH didn't give them a chance to read the pitch in the second innings. \"Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one. Once you are on the losing side, there are question marks on the decisions taken,\" Rahul added.\n\n\"We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum. Ayush and Nicky batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well,\" the LSG skipper concluded.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amit_sharma@news9live.com", "name": "Amit Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

AP\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad vs Lucknow Super Giants preview: Coming off a seven-wicket defeat to Mumbai Indians (MI), Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will hope to boost their IPL 2024 playoff chances when they host Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in the 57th match of this season in Uppal.\n\nSRH, who had got their campaign off to a strong start with Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma firing on all cylinders, seem to have lost their mojo of late, with chasing in particular becoming a tough task.\n\nAnd although they batted first against MI on Monday, Travis Head (48) fell just short of a fifty and Abhishek (11) struggled for runs as they were restricted to 173/8. Suryakumar Yadav (102*) led an inspired fightback for MI to take them home with 16 balls to spare.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar was economical against MI, with figures of 1/22 but much will be expected from the likes of Marco Jansen and T Natarajan as far as their bowling is concerned.\n\nIt cannot be Head and Abhishek scoring a major chunk of the runs always for the former champions, and other batters will have to step up should the opening duo endure an off-day.\n\nAs far as LSG are concerned, Mohsin Khan had been hit on the head while fielding in LSG's last game and had been replaced by Yudhvir Singh Charak. Mohsin, has, however, travelled with the squad to Hyderabad but it remains to be seen if he would play any part in the game. With Quinton de Kock continuing to be out with a niggle, young Arshin Kulkarni will be expected to fill in as Impact Player once again for Lucknow.\n\nSquads:\n\nSRH: Abdul Samad, Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, Anmolpreet Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Glenn Phillips, Heinrich Klaasen, Marco Jansen, Mayank Agarwal, Mayank Markande, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Rahul Tripathi, Sanvir Singh, Shahbaz Ahamad (T), T.

We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills.\n\n\"They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. It was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one,\" he said.\n\nThis was after SRH bowlers started brilliantly before Badoni (55 not out off 30 balls) and Pooran (48 not out off 25 balls) stitched crucial 95-runs off 55 balls for the unbeaten fifth-wicket stand to guide LSG to a competitive 165 for four on a sluggish pitch.\n\nRahul blamed the defeat on their poor display with the bat in powerplay, from which they scored just 27 runs for the loss of two wickets.\n\n\"Once you are on the losing side, there are question marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum.\n\n\"Ayush (Badoni) and Nicky (Nicholas Pooran) batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well,\" he admitted.\n\nSRH skipper Pat Cummins said that it was an \"unreal\" batting display from Head and Sharma.\n\n\"The boys (Head and Sharma) have had a fantastic season, but to win this with less than 10 overs played is unreal,\" he said.\n\n\"We just let them go, they are two guys who are very positive and I'm a bowler, it is tough for me to give them any inputs.\" Cummins was effusive in his praise for both Head and Sharma.\n\n\"He's (Head) been like this for 2 years, he hits the tough areas, hits the middle a lot, might not be super conventional.\n\n\"(Abhishek) Just an incredible player of spin and pace. With just 2 fielders out, it is really difficult for the bowlers against them,\" he said.\n\nHead, who was adjudged player-of-the-match for his pyrotechnics, said he was really enjoying batting with Sharma as they compliment each other well.\n\n\"Lots of fun today. Nice to get this done in 10 overs. Abhi (Sharma) and I have had a few partnerships like this. Just concentrate on getting in good positions, watch the ball hard and try to maximise the powerplay,\" he said.\n\n\"I know how hard he (Abhishek Sharma) works and how deep he thinks, his spin play is second to none. We compliment each other very well. Nice to see him back amongst the runs after missing out in the last couple of games.\" Abhishek thanks Lara, Yuvraj ===================== After his hurricane fifty, Abhishek thanked two left-handers, who had thrilled the audience during their playing days, for his success in the on-going IPL -- Yuvraj Singh and Brian Lara.\n\n\"I think the hard work I put in before the tournament is showing now, thanks to Yuvi Paaji, Brian (Lara) as well and my father, who is my first coach,\" he said.\n\nAbhishek also thanked the SRH team management for the trust shown in him.\n\n\"I would never think of coming to such a tournament and playing at such a strike rate, but thanks to the team management.\n\n\"The message was clear from them and I backed myself.\" There was a special mention of his opening partner -- Head.\n\n\"All the credit goes to him (Head).

Head and Sharma added another chapter to their ruthless dominance over bowlers, creating lightning-fast unbeaten fifties to propel SRH to a comprehensive 10-wicket victory over LSG in a key IPL game. Chasing a modest 166, Head (89 not out, 30 balls, 8x4s, 8x6s) and Sharma (75 not out, 28 balls, 8x4s, 6x6s) tormented LSG bowlers, hitting boundaries and sixes at leisure to cruise home in 9.4 overs.\n\n\"Sometimes you need to tip your hat and say well played to the opposition,\" LSG's Adam Voges said in the post-match press conference after SRH hammering. Hyderabad were off to a flier courtesy of the destructive pair of Head and Sharma. Both the batters didn't allow any bowler to get any breathing room. We felt that 165 could be a par score on this pitch but the intent these two southpaws showed in this game was unreal. Both got to their half-centuries in under 20 balls each and gave no chances to any bowler. Abhishek Sharma scored 75 runs in 28 balls while his partner scored 89 off just 30 deliveries. The boundaries never stopped coming off their bat. With this performance, they now climb over Chennai and improve their NRR, which might help them.\n\nIPL 2024 Full Coverage | IPL 2024 Points Table and Standings | 2024 IPL Full Schedule\n\nLucknow bowled a decent first over but after the first one, all the bowlers were taken to the cleaners every time the batters got a chance. They were poor in the field and dropped some chances, which might have hurt them more. The shocking part is that KL Rahul didn't opt for the option of the impact player. The bowlers did try their best but the batters were just too good and in the end, it was a tough defeat to face. Lucknow's NRR has taken a big hit and it might come back to haunt them in the later stages.\n\nEarlier in the innings, we saw Hyderabad make full use of the pitch in the initial phases of the game. They managed to take quick wickets and put Lucknow under pressure early. However, the pair of Nicholas Pooran and Ayush Badoni ensured the visitors managed to bounce back into the game. They dominated the slog overs and pushed their team's total above 160, which looked competitive.

Tasked to smash sixes fearlessly at the top alongside Australian opener Travis Head, Abhishek is fulfilling his responsibility no doubt. The duo is having an incredible season for their franchise and their style of attacking right from ball one and taking their team to totals of 250 or more is something that could cause a paradigm shift in T20 cricket in the near future.\n\nFormer Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) Director of Cricket Mike Hesson and cricket coach Mike Hesson backed young Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) opener Abhishek Sharma to open for Team India after the ICC T20 World Cup this year in West Indies and USA. Abhishek is having a wonderful Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 with the Orange Army. Tasked to smash sixes fearlessly at the top alongside Australian opener Travis Head, Abhishek is fulfilling his responsibility no doubt. The duo is having an incredible season for their franchise and their style of attacking right from ball one and taking their team to totals of 250 or more is something that could cause a paradigm shift in T20 cricket in the near future.\n\nAbhishek's fearless hitting at the top led to speculations that he could be one of the surprise entries to India's T20 World Cup squad. However, the 23-year-old all-rounder did not make it to the squad. Hesson however, backs this youngster to be a part of India's plans following the tournament, because of his ability to attack spin in the powerplay and an improved game against pace.\n\n\"Oh, look, I think so (whether Abhishek will play for India following T20 WC). I mean, I think his ability to take on spin in the power play. And he has improved greatly against pace. He is a high-quality player. He is a boundary hitter. He is a six-hitter and no doubt post-World Cup, and he will start to make some changes, whether it be Yashasvi Jaiswal, himself or Shubman Gill. To be fair, there are a few. There is plenty of names, but he will definitely be one that will have plenty of people talking about,\" said Hesson on JioCinema. Abhishek is the 11th-highest run-getter with 401 runs in 12 matches at an average of 36.45 and a strike rate of 205.64, with two fifties. His best score is 75*.\n\nComing to yesterday's match between SRH and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), LSG elected to bat first after winning the toss. The visitors got to a slow start, getting just 57 runs in the first 10 overs and losing three wickets. Skipper KL Rahul played a sluggish knock of 29 in 33 balls, with a four and a six. In the second half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55* in 30 balls, with nine fours) and Nicholas Pooran (48* in 26 balls, with six fours and a six) turned things around with a 99-run stand, putting a score of 165/4 in 20 overs for LSG.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) was the top bowler for LSG. Pat Cummins also got a wicket. In the run-chase of 166 runs, openers Travis Head (89* in 30 balls, with eight fours and eight sixes) and Abhishek Sharma (75* in 28 balls, with eight fours and six sixes) launched what seemed like a never-ending assault on LSG batters, helping SRH chase down the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket.\n\nSRH is at number three in the table with seven wins, five losses and 14 points. LSG is in the sixth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points.

Early in the innings, Sharma unleashed a barrage of boundaries against Yash Thakur, taking 17 runs off a single over. Not to be outdone, Head dominated the next over from Krishnappa Gowtham, hammering three sixes and a four to snatch 22 runs. The onslaught continued with Head striking massive blows over long-on and long-off, quickly bringing up his half-century in just 16 balls, eventually scoring 89* off 30 balls.\n\nAbhishek Sharma complemented Head's explosive batting with a brilliant half-century of his own, scoring 75* off 28 balls, as the duo amassed 107 runs by the end of the powerplay. This marked one of the fastest chases in IPL history, with SRH notching 167/0 in under 10 overs.\n\nEarlier, LSG had set a target of 166, led by Ayush Badoni's half-century and Nicholas Pooran's strong finish, which helped them reach a modest total of 165/4. Despite their efforts, LSG's bowlers struggled to contain SRH's aggressive batting.\n\nReflecting on the match, SRH skipper praised his openers for their match-winning partnership. \"The openers were outstanding today. They took the game away from the opposition very early and maintained the pressure throughout, making it an easy chase for us,\" he noted.\n\nThis victory positions SRH as a strong contender for the playoffs, now sitting third in the league standings, while LSG contemplates adjustments after a tough loss.\n\nRelated Items:Abhishek Sharma, Cricket Highlights, feature, IPL 2024, Live India, LIVE INDIA LIVE, Live India News, quick run chases, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Travis Head Recommended for you Cate Blanchett Joins Cast of 'Alpha Gang' in Pivotal Role Ammy Virk and Sonam Bajwa Unveil First-Look Posters from 'Kudi Haryane Val Di' Archna Puran Singh wraps up filming for Kapil Sharma's Netflix series with laughter-filled moments", "source": {"uri": "liveindia.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "Live India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Thakur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yash Thakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnappa_Gowtham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krishnappa Gowtham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_playoff_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Page playoff system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://liveindia.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SRH-vs-LSG.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

KL Rahul won the toss and chose to bat first and made a few changes. Quinton De Kock and Krishnappa Gowtham came into the side for LSG.\n\nFor the SRH side it was Sri Lankan spinner Vijaykanth Viyaskanth made his debut while Sanvir Singh made his first start of the season. Pat Cummins was given a tremendous ovation as the Hyderabad skipper was celebrating his 31 birthday on Wednesday.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar was in his element once more as he got two wickets early to dent the LSG team. Quinton De Kock fell early when Nitish Reddy took an amazing catch at the boundary. Sanvir Singh then took a smart low catch to dismiss Marcus Stoinis as KL Rahul yet again failed to get going with the bat and was scoring slowly.\n\nKrunal Pandya decided to break free as Lucknow batters were struggling on a sluggish pitch. Two sixes from two balls of Jaydev Unadkat made sure that the Giants came back into the and also hit the 1000 six in IPL in just 57 games.\n\nAfter losing two early wickets, LSG skipper KL Rahul found it tough to time the ball. SRH bowlers kept it tight as they made sure that LSG didn't get easy runs on the board. Krunal Pandya though came in with a positive mindset and gave his team some boost.\n\nKL Rahul hit the first ball of the 10 over to bring up the 50 as Lucknow finally seemed to be getting some momentum. After just 27 runs in the first 6 overs, the next 3.1 overs yielded 26 runs without loss of any wicket.\n\nNicholas Pooran and Ayush Badoni came out with aggressive intent and began scoring boundaries to ease the pressure off the visitors. The 100 came in 15 overs as the two were getting ready for an assault in the final five overs.\n\nPat Cummins played a crucial role in the two LSG wickets falling in quick succession. KL Rahul was out for 29 caught by T Natarajan. This was followed by the run-out of Krunal Pandya for 24 thanks to a direct hit by Pat Cummins.\n\nYoung Ayush Badoni came to his team's rescue after the Hyderabad bowlers had kept a tight lid on the run scoring.

Their partnership was like watching a symphony unfold, as they guided Sunrisers Hyderabad to a resounding 10-wicket victory over Lucknow Super Giants. Imagine fireworks on the cricket pitch - that's what their batting display felt like. They chased down a daunting target of 166 with such grace and ease, setting a new record for the fastest chase of a 160-plus target in IPL history.\n\nHead's innings was like poetry in motion - an unbeaten 89 off just 30 balls. Sharma, on the other hand, was a force of nature, smashing 75 not out from just 28 deliveries. The LSG bowlers could only watch in disbelief as boundaries and sixes rained down on them.\n\nThe win lifted Sunrisers Hyderabad to the third spot in the IPL standings, reaffirming their status as serious playoff contenders. Meanwhile, Lucknow Super Giants found themselves slipping to sixth place, despite having the same number of points.\n\nThe aftermath of the match was bittersweet. LSG captain KL Rahul, usually so composed, was left speechless by the onslaught from the SRH duo. A viral post-match video showed Rahul in a tense conversation with LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka, whose frustration was palpable.\n\nFans were divided in their reaction. While many criticized Goenka for publicly confronting Rahul, others empathized with the captain's predicament. They felt that such discussions should have been held in private, away from the prying eyes of the public.\n\nUnder Rahul's leadership, the Super Giants have been a consistent force in the IPL, making it to the playoffs in both seasons since their debut. However, this year poses a tougher challenge, especially after the humbling defeat to SRH. With just two matches left in the league stage, Rahul and his team need to pull off some miracles to secure a playoff berth.\n\nDespite Rahul's impressive batting stats this season, his strike rate has been a point of contention. The match against SRH only added fuel to the fire, with Rahul managing just 29 runs off 31 balls. As the pressure mounts, Rahul must find a way to lead his team to victory and silence his critics once and for all.\n\nSEE ALSO: Virat Kohli's Playful Side Shines Before PBKS Clash; Dharamsala Banter Delights Fans On Social Media", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "K.

Batting first, LSG recovered from 66 for 4 in the 12th over to post 165/4 in the allotted 20 overs thanks to an unbeaten 99-run stand between Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran.\n\nIn reply, SRH chased down the total in just 9.4 overs without losing a wicket as they created history by chasing down the highest total inside 10 overs. Head and Abhishek Sharma went all out against the LSG bowlers right from the word go. While the Australian completed his fifty in just 16 balls, his Indian partner did it in 19 balls.\n\nBoth the batters matched each other shot for shot to get SRH back to winning ways. Head smashed an unbeaten 89 runs off just 30 balls with the help of eight fours and as many sixes. On the other hand, Abhishek Sharma scored 75 off 28 balls with the help of eight fours and six sixes.\n\nWith Abhishek Sharma once again impressing with his hard-hitting skills, former India spinner Harbhajan Singh wondered if it is still not too late to add the Punjab batsman, at least to the travelling reserves of India's T20 World Cup 2024 squad.\n\nSoon after the game ended, the India great took to X to reveal that he was spellbound by Head and Sharma's batting before expressing his desire to see the latter in the India T20 World Cup squad.\n\n\"What just happened in Hyderabad! Travishead & IamAbhiSharma4 hitting sixes like taking singles. Chased 165 in 9.4 overs. Should Team India include Abhishek in the bench strength?\" wrote Harbhajan.\n\nAbhishek Sharma has impressed one and all with his aggressive batting in IPL 2024. Such has been his batting this season that many even wanted him to open the innings for Team India in the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nIn 12 games so far, he has scored 401 runs at a stunning strike-rate of 205.64. Among players who have scored more than 350 runs this season, only he and Head have a strike-rate of over 200. No player has hit more sixes than Abhishek Sharma this season as well.

Head (89) and Sharma (75) needed just 9.4 overs to surpass the target.\n\nLucknow lost Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis inside the powerplay overs with the pitch seeming to be on the slower side. Captain KL Rahul and vice-captain Krunal Pandya rebuilt the innings but Hyderabad struck in quick succession to leave Lucknow stuttering at 66/4 after 11.4 overs.\n\nAyush Badoni (55) and Nicolas Pooran (48) stitched together an unbeaten 99-run stand to rescue their side and post a competitive target.\n\nHowever, Head and Sharma came out all guns blazing in the chase. The pair blasted 107 runs in the opening six overs, a score which Lucknow took 16 overs to get to.\n\nHead, who has been in scintillating form this season, reached his half century in just 16 balls. Just to illustrate how destructive Head was, he physically ran his first run after having plundered 64 runs from boundaries.\n\nAt the other end, Sharma was equally devastating with the bat taking 19 runs to score his 50.

AFP\n\nOpeners Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma smoked half-centuries as Sunrisers Hyderabad crushed Lucknow Super Giants by 10 wickets on Wednesday to boost their play-off hopes in the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nChasing a modest 166 for victory, Head, who smashed 89, and fellow left-hander Abhishek, who hit 75, tore into the opposition attack to romp home with 10.2 overs to spare at their home in Uppal.\n\n\"I'm lost for words. We've watched that batting on TV but that was unreal,\" Lucknow skipper KL Rahul said of the bludgeoning by the Hyderabad openers.\n\n\"Everything was hitting the middle of the bat, kudos to their skill, they've worked very hard on their six-hitting.\" Australia's Head attacked with a flurry of fours and sixes as he reached his fifty in 16 balls and went past 500 runs this season.\n\nHead is now third in the batting chart behind Virat Kohli (542) and Ruturaj Gaikwad (541) with his fourth half-century -- he also has a ton -- in this edition.\n\nHe took on the spinners with aplomb and said the skill will be invaluable on the slow pitches in the West Indies during the T20 World Cup in June.\n\n\"Something I have been working on with spin, something I have been working hard on. It will be a big part in the Caribbean,\" said man of the match Head.\n\n\"Nice to get 360 (degrees) and get to the parts of the ground I have not been to. We want to maximise the powerplay. It is not going to work every time but we want to go for it.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old Head lauded his younger partner Abhishek, 23, and said: \"His spin game is something else. We complement each other so well.\"\n\nAbhishek joined the charge as he got to his fifty in 19 balls after the pair took Hyderabad to 107 in the first six overs of powerplay, when only two fielders are allowed outside the inner circle.\n\nHyderabad, who won the IPL in 2016 under David Warner, registered their seventh win in 12 matches to hand a perfect gift to birthday boy and captain Pat Cummins, who turned 31 on Wednesday.\n\nAbhishek hit the winning six as Hyderabad moved to third in the 10-team table with 14 points. Lucknow stay sixth after the bruising loss. Top four teams will make the play-offs with the final on May 26 in Chennai.\n\nCummins said Head's unconventional hitting does not \"surprise\" him anymore and praised Abhishek for being \"an incredible player of spin\" and pace.\n\nSeam bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar set up victory with impressive bowling figures of 2-12 in his four overs to restrict Lucknow to 165-4 after they elected to bat first.", "source": {"uri": "gulftoday.ae", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Gulf Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

Both teams are on equal terms as far as their IPL 2024 journey is considered. With 12 points in the bank, SRH are currently at no.4 in the table while LSG follow them at no.5.\n\nSRH were outclassed by the Mumbai Indians in their last encounter. The Orange Army had a struggle to post 173 runs on the board which the five-time former champions managed to chase in 17 overs courtesy of a magical century from Suryakumar Yadav. SRH's formidable opening order failed to deliver after their star opener Abhishek Yadav departed early while Travis Head stayed firm. However, as the latter departed at 48, the SRH batting line-up tumbled miserably.\n\nOn the other hand, the Lucknow Super Giants were beaten by the Kolkata Knight Riders in a dominating fashion. The team's bowling unit was blown away by KKR's southpaw Sunil Narine (81 off 39 balls) as he propelled the team to 235 runs. In reply, LSG could only manage to score 137 runs and were bowled out in the 17th over.\n\nTravis Head, Abhishek Singh, Mayank Aggarwal, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klassen (wk), Marco Jansen, Shahbaz Ahmed, Abdul Samad, Pat Cummins (c), Sanvir Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar\n\nTravis Head, Mayank Aggarwal, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klassen (wk), Marco Jansen, Shahbaz Ahmed, Abdul Samad, Pat Cummins (c), Sanvir Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T.

At time out we spoke about NRR (Net Run Rate) being important. Very pleased that checked out.\"\n\nThe foundation for this victory was laid in the powerplay, a phase where SRH has consistently dominated throughout the tournament. They amassed a staggering 107 runs in the powerplay itself, effectively sealing the match in the first six overs.\n\nThe LSG bowlers simply had no answer to the relentless assault by the SRH openers.\n\nWhile their eight-run start may have caused a flicker of hope for LSG, the unleashing began in the second over. Abhishek Sharma's four boundaries off Yash Thakur were just the beginning. Head joined the party in the third over, smashing three sixes and a four off K Gowtham. This onslaught forced LSG captain KL Rahul to introduce spin early, but Ravi Bishnoi proved equally ineffective. By the fifth over, Head had reached his blistering half-century, and the score had crossed 100.\n\nIn the post-match press conference, Travis Head praised his opening partner, highlighting Abhishek Sharma's exceptional talent and calling him an \"exciting talent for Indian cricket.\"\n\n\"Abhishek Sharma is an exciting talent for Indian cricket, kind of exceptional. We kind of compliment each other. He is very very enjoyable to be around. He is very very excited and think about the game.\"\n\nThe run-fest continued throughout the innings. Both Sharma and Head seemed determined to chase down the target within ten overs. Boundaries rained from both ends, with neither bowler able to contain the rampant duo. The winning moment arrived when Sharma launched a towering six over cover off Thakur.\n\nHead's comments echo the wider sentiment in the cricketing world. Sharma's explosive batting display has undoubtedly ignited excitement about his potential for the Indian national team. His consistent partnership with Head has solidified their position as one of the most dangerous opening pairs in the IPL.", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anukul_chauhan@insidesport.in", "name": "Anukul Chauhan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bishnoi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

The duo's remorseless onslaught saw them chase down a target of 166 with remarkable ease, mounting the fastest chase of a 160-plus target in IPL history.\n\nHead's blistering unbeaten 89 off just 30 balls, accompanied by Sharma's explosive 75 not out from 28 deliveries, left the LSG bowlers reeling as boundaries and sixes flowed freely.\n\nThis emphatic win catapulted Sunrisers Hyderabad to the third position in the IPL standings, firmly establishing their credentials as playoff contenders with 14 points from 12 games. Meanwhile, Lucknow Super Giants find themselves languishing at the sixth spot with the same number of points from an equal number of matches.\n\nThe visuals following the match showed a sorry state for LSG captain KL Rahul, who was at a \"loss for words\" after the incredible onslaught from the SRH opening duo. However, a post-match visual that went viral on social media platforms was that of Rahul conversing with LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka following the loss.\n\nGoenka was visibly displeased and had an animated chat with Rahul with rather exaggerated hand movements, signifying his anger at the disappointing defeat against the Sunrisers.\n\nThe fans, however, were not too pleased with Goenka choosing to lash out at Rahul publicly. Many fans believed the LSG owner could have waited for the players to return to the dressing room or a more private place to converse. They also urged Rahul to leave LSG, claiming disrespect from the franchise's owner.\n\nHere are some of the tweets:\n\nUnder KL Rahul's captaincy, the Super Giants, who debuted in the IPL in 2022, have reached the playoffs in both seasons. However, the side faces a mounting challenge to reclaim a spot in the top four this year following the latest defeat in Hyderabad; with only two matches remaining, Rahul's men will have to secure big wins and expect the other contenders to drop points.\n\nRahul has been the side's top-scorer this year, with 460 runs to his name in 12 matches; however, his strike rate of 136.09 has garnered significant criticism.

Chasing a target of 166, SRH did not lose a single wicket and completed the chase in just 9.4 overs. It was a big loss for LSG who were dealt a massive blow in their IPL 2024 playoff race. Following the match, LSG owner Sanjeev Goenka was caught on camera having a fiery chat with Rahul - something that has left the social media fuming. The video of the incident went viral and a lot of social media users were not pleased with the treatment from Goenka towards the LSG captain after the loss.\n\n\"Am lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on tv. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills. They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings.\"\n\n\"Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one. Once you are on the losing side, there are questions marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum. Ayush and Nicky batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well,\" Rahul said after the match.\n\n\"On did he change the pitch) Maybe Travis and Abhishek did. We just let them go, they are two guys who are very positive and I'm a bowler, it is tough for me to give them any inputs. (On Travis Head) He's been like this for 2 years, he hits the tough areas, hits the middle a lot, might not be super conventional. (On Abhishek Sharma) Just an incredible player of spin and pace. With just 2 fielders out, it is really difficult for the bowlers against them. (On where the game is headed) I think the scores have gone up, and when the wickets are good, it is tough to come up with answers against batters when they get going.

Both teams are locked in at 12 points from 11 games with SRH making the top four cut based on a slightly superior net run rate of -0.065 compared to LSG's -0.371....Read More\n\nThe Sunrisers find themselves in fierce competition for the top four spot with Kolkata Knight Riders (16), Rajasthan Royals (16) and Chennai Super Kings (12) stationed above them on the points table. The winners of this duel will take a major step in the playoff race. The Pat Cummins-led side has ample talent but has been unable to hold on to a winning run recently. Sunrisers have lost three of their last four matches, mainly because their destructive batting line-up hasn't delivered.\n\nIn their last match against Mumbai Indians, which they lost by seven wickets, they failed to put up a good target on the board, which has been their strong suit this season. Barring Travis Head, who has been their stand-out performer, the other batters in the side have faced a recent slump.\n\nAfter displaying his power-hitting ability, young opener Abhishek Sharma has breached the 30-run mark just once in the last four games. And while SRH head coach Daniel Vettori has conceded that the openers are not expected to do the job all the time, the middle order needs to step up.\n\nThe flamboyant Heinrich Klaasen has also been unable to strike the ball consistently and Nitish Reddy too has been patchy. The bowlers have fared better compared to their batting counterparts.\n\nT Natarajan has been consistent with the ball while seasoned seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar also seems to have found his mojo after his incisive spell helped SRH eke out a one-run win against RR. LSG, on the other hand, have to get over their overall lacklustre display against Kolkata Knight Riders, when they not only conceded the first-ever 200-plus score at the Ekana Stadium but also folded their innings at 137.\n\nIt was a day when skipper KL Rahul failed to anchor the innings while the likes of Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran were unable to get the big shots when needed. Ayush Badoni has had a subdued run in this IPL and the uncapped Indian player would be keen to shrug off the rustiness.\n\nLSG's struggles with the ball have been majorly due to the lack of firepower in their pace-bowling department. With tearaway pacer Mayank Yadav ruled out of the IPL and left-arm pacer Mohsin Khan also picking up an injury, the onus will be on Afghan quick Naveen-ul-Haq, young Yash Thakur, Stoinis and spinners Krunal Pandya and Ravi Bishnoi to deliver.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Vettori", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Vettori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Yadav", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

I think sometimes you've gotta tip your hat and say well played to the opposition. I think might have hit miss, hit one or two balls in the nine and a bit overs that we bowled at them. That was incredible batting and hitting. We clearly didn't have an answer,\" Voges said in a post-match press conference\n\nCourtesy of the explosive combination of Head and Sharma, Hyderabad got off to a flying start. No bowler was given any breathing room by either batter. Head and Abhishek both reached their half-centuries in less than 20 balls apiece and denied any bowler an opportunity. While Head hit 89 off just 30 deliveries, Abhishek Sharma scored 75 runs in just 28 balls and the dup never ceased pushing limits with their first swing.\n\n\"I haven't spoken to the guys yet about whether there was a difference in terms of the innings but clearly our powerplay compared to Sunrisers was at the two extremes. We were put under immense pressure with the ball right from the start. We weren't able to apply that same pressure with the bat, to begin with,\" he added.\n\nThe Super Giants were reeling at 66/4 in 11.2 overs when the pair got together the duo of Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran stitched up an unbeaten 99-run stand in 52 balls to give LSG slight hope of a competitive total. By moving around in the crease and controlling the field, Badoni spearheaded the attack and reached a fifty in 28 balls.\n\nVoges said Badoni and Pooran's partnership gave LSG a fighting chance however the total of 165 \"was clearly not enough.\"\n\n\"I thought our backend of the innings was really good. Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran's partnership got us, it was probably still under par total but it gave us a fighting chance at least. But that obviously was clearly not enough,\" Voges said.\n\nThe loss was LSG's sixth in the IPL 2024, and because of the wide margin of defeat, it severely damaged their net run-rate as well. They are currently ranked sixth after falling below Delhi Capitals in the most recent rankings.

All this while chasing a decent total of 166. What was even more surprising is that the duo remained unbeaten till the end, striking it big, at will.\n\nWhile Travis Head managed to score 89 from 30 at a strike rate of 296, Abhishek scored 75 from 28 at a strike rate of 267. That was enough to take the team to the third spot in the IPL points table, with seven wins. Interestingly, SRH's NRR also improved considerably in the match vs LSG. Prior to the match, it stood at -0.065, and after the carnage, it is at +0.406. But there are a few more records that were broken on the way.\n\nAbhishek Sharma & Travis Head Break Records Galore\n\nHead has been going great guns this IPL 2024. He now has the most sub 20-ball fifties in the tournament, along with fellow-Aussie Jake Fraser-McGurk. The next on the list is Sunil Narine, Kieron Pollard and Ishan Kishan -- two each. Not just that, Head also has the second-most scores of fifties inside the powerplay now -- 4 -- only surpassed by David Warner (6).\n\nComing to Abhishek, he has the most number of sixes in IPL 2024 -- 35. The next on the list is Narine at 32. That also make Sunrisers Hyderabad the team with most sixes in any year -- 146. Before this, CSK held the record at 145, that they made in 2018.\n\nAll Records Held by SRH in IPL 2024\n\nThat's not it. The highest-ever score in IPL, after 10 overs now also is under SRH's name. 167 in 9.4 overs beats the previous record SRH held, that was made in the match vs DC. In that match, the Men in Orange scored 158/4 in 10 overs. Also, in terms of most balls spared while chasing -- this record too stands broken. In the SRH vs LSG match, the target was achieved with 62 deliveries to spare, while the next best record is in the name of DC against Punjab Kings in 2022 (57 balls to spare).", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madhav_agarwal@insidesport.in", "name": "Madhav Agarwal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Narine", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Narine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Warner_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Warner (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishan_Kishan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ishan Kishan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieron_Pollard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kieron Pollard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home_Recording", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home Recording", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://d16f573ilcot6q.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/42.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Chasing a modest target of 166, SRH openers wreaked havoc on the LSG bowling attack, reaching the target in a mere 9.4 overs. This dismal performance was followed by another blow for LSG captain KL Rahul, who was caught on camera receiving a public dressing down from the team owner, Sanjiv Goenka.\n\nThe foundation for SRH's victory was laid by their openers, Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head. Their explosive batting display, featuring a combined 14 sixes and 16 fours, left the LSG bowlers helpless. Sharma's unbeaten 75 off 28 balls and Head's unbeaten 89 off 30 balls sealed the win for SRH.\n\nPrior to the bowling collapse, KL Rahul himself had a forgettable outing with the bat, scoring a sluggish 29 runs off 33 balls. LSG's batting was eventually rescued by Nicholas Pooran (48* off 26 balls) and Ayush Badoni (55* off 30 balls), who helped them reach a somewhat respectable total of 165 for 4.\n\nFollowing the crushing defeat, cameras captured Sanjiv Goenka engaging in a heated conversation with KL Rahul near the LSG dugout.\n\nThe animated exchange sparked outrage on social media, with many fans criticizing the public display of reprimand. Commentators even weighed in, suggesting such conversations are best held behind closed doors.\n\nCommentator on air said: \"You always feel these conversations should always be behind closed doors. There are so many cameras that miss nothing, and KL Rahul is not going to go at press conferences and various other things and probably potentially explain what is being discussed there. He has done well here to keep his cool.\"\n\nThe video of Sanjiv Goenka's outburst went viral, attracting strong reactions from fans. Terms like \"open dressing room\", \"in bad taste\", and \"unacceptable\" dominated social media discussions. Some fans even urged KL Rahul to consider leaving the LSG franchise.\n\nThis defeat pushes LSG down to the sixth position on the points table, with their playoff qualification chances hanging by a thread. With six losses in twelve matches, LSG needs a significant turnaround to secure a playoff spot.\n\nSRH, on the other hand, climbed to the third position with their dominant win, solidifying their place among the IPL frontrunners.", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anukul_chauhan@insidesport.in", "name": "Anukul Chauhan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

Their star performer, who was said to be the fastest bowler in IPL history Mayank Yadav has been ruled out of IPL due to an injury.

That (the pitch) plus a couple of games that have been played here. It is hard to complete forget how important this game is for both the sides, but we have played enough cricket.

Says, \"Am At Loss For Words\"", "body": "Lucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul on Wednesday said they were completely outplayed by the incredible power-hitting of Sunrisers Hyderabad's openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, terming it \"unreal batting.\" Head and Sharma added another chapter to their remorseless domination over bowlers while carving lightning fast unbeaten fifties to power SRH to a convincing 10-wicket win over LSG in a crucial IPL match. Chasing a modest 166, Head (89 not out, 30 balls, 8x4s, 8x6s) and Sharma (75 not out, 28 balls, 8x4s, 6x6s) toyed with LSG bowlers, finding boundaries and sixes at will to canter home in just 9.4 overs.\n\n\"I am at loss for words. We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills. They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. It was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one,\" he said.\n\nThis was after SRH bowlers started brilliantly before Badoni (55 not out off 30 balls) and Pooran (48 not out off 25 balls) stitched crucial 95-runs off 55 balls for the unbeaten fifth-wicket stand to guide LSG to a competitive 165 for four on a sluggish pitch.\n\nRahul blamed the defeat on their poor display with the bat in powerplay, from which they scored just 27 runs for the loss of two wickets.\n\n\"Once you are on the losing side, there are question marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum.\n\n\"Ayush (Badoni) and Nicky (Nicholas Pooran) batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well,\" he admitted.\n\n\"The boys (Head and Sharma) have had a fantastic season, but to win this with less than 10 overs played is unreal,\" he said.\n\n\"We just let them go, they are two guys who are very positive and I'm a bowler, it is tough for me to give them any inputs.\" Cummins was effusive in his praise for both Head and Sharma.\n\n\"He's (Head) been like this for 2 years, he hits the tough areas, hits the middle a lot, might not be super conventional.\n\n\"(Abhishek) Just an incredible player of spin and pace. With just 2 fielders out, it is really difficult for the bowlers against them,\" he said.\n\nHead, who was adjudged player-of-the-match for his pyrotechnics, said he was really enjoying batting with Sharma as they compliment each other well.\n\n\"Lots of fun today. Nice to get this done in 10 overs. Abhi (Sharma) and I have had a few partnerships like this. Just concentrate on getting in good positions, watch the ball hard and try to maximise the powerplay,\" he said.\n\n\"I know how hard he (Abhishek Sharma) works and how deep he thinks, his spin play is second to none. We compliment each other very well. Nice to see him back amongst the runs after missing out in the last couple of games.\"\n\nAbhishek thanks Lara, Yuvraj\n\nAfter his hurricane fifty, Abhishek thanked two left-handers, who had thrilled the audience during their playing days, for his success in the on-going IPL -- Yuvraj Singh and Brian Lara.\n\n\"I think the hard work I put in before the tournament is showing now, thanks to Yuvi Paaji, Brian (Lara) as well and my father, who is my first coach,\" he said.\n\nAbhishek also thanked the SRH team management for the trust shown in him.\n\n\"I would never think of coming to such a tournament and playing at such a strike rate, but thanks to the team management.\n\n\"The message was clear from them and I backed myself.\" There was a special mention of his opening partner -- Head.\n\n\"All the credit goes to him (Head).

Sharma regained his lost touch with an undefeated 75 off 28 balls.\n\nThe win lifted Hyderabad to No. 3 with 14 points and more importantly gave it a healthy net run-rate of 0.41 with two home games to go. The huge defeat has pushed Lucknow in the tight corner for the playoffs with 12 points from 12 games.\n\nEarlier, Ayush Badoni (55) and Nicholas Pooran (48) propelled Lucknow to 165-4 with a 99-run unbeaten fifth-wicket stand after Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2-12) gave away just 12 singles and dismissed the big hitters - Quinton de Kock (2) and Marcus Stoinis (3) - inside the power play.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad's Abhishek Sharma, left, celebrates his fifty runs with Travis Head during the Indian Premier League cricket match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants in Hyderabad, India, Wednesday, May 8, 2024. (AP Photo/Mahesh Kumar A.)\n\nHead and Sharma charged against pace and spin as Yash Thakur was smashed for 47 off his 16 balls while spinners Ravi Bishnoi and Krishnappa Gowtham gave away 63 runs off their four overs.\n\nLucknow had a moment to separate the destructive pair but Thakur couldn\u00b4t hold onto a sharp one-handed catch of Sharma at short third-man when the batter was on 18 in the third over. Sharma had another escape after completing his half-century when leg-spinner Bishnoi dropped a hard two-handed return catch.\n\nEarlier, Kumar had buckled down Lucknow 27-2 in the first six overs on a tacky wicket and Rahul struggled to give the innings momentum before pulled skipper Pat Cummins to deep backward square leg and got dismissed for struggling 29 off 33 balls.\n\nPooran and Badoni countercharged in the death overs with Badoni playing some orthodox shots on square of the wicket as pace duo of T Natarajan and Cummins conceded 34 runs off the final two overs.\n\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad's Travis Head plays a shot during the Indian Premier League cricket match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants in Hyderabad, India, Wednesday, May 8, 2024.

With this, Lucknow set a challenging target of 166 runs for Sunrisers Hyderabad to chase.\n\nOpting to bat first after winning the toss, Lucknow Super Giants' captain KL Rahul laid the foundation with a steady 29 off 33 balls, supported by Quinton de Kock, who returned to the side but departed early after scoring just two runs.\n\nThe middle order witnessed a minor stumble with Marcus Stoinis managing only three runs, while Krunal Pandya contributed a quickfire 24 off 21 balls, including 2 sixes. However, it was the partnership between Badoni and Pooran that provided Lucknow with a sigh of relief, enabling them to post a competitive total.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad, renowned for their aggressive batting lineup in the IPL 2024, will look towards Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma to kickstart their innings with a bang.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar emerged as the standout bowler for Sunrisers Hyderabad, claiming two crucial wickets while conceding just 12 runs in his spell of four overs.\n\nHowever, T Natarajan had a tough outing, leaking 50 runs in his four overs, emerging as the most expensive bowler for Hyderabad. Jaydev Unadkat, Shahbaz Ahmed, and Vijayakanth Viyaskanth remained wicketless in the encounter against Lucknow Super Giants.\n\nWith the stage set for an enthralling chase, all eyes are now on Sunrisers Hyderabad as they aim to chase down the target and secure a crucial victory in the IPL 2024 match against Lucknow Super Giants.

The other two spots are still up for grabs, with Chennai Super Kings (12), Sunrisers Hyderabad (12) and Lucknow Super Giants (12) among the frontrunners to claim them. Delhi Capitals (10) could also find themselves in the fray if they manage to win the remaining three games.\n\nAs such, Wednesday's clash between the Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants could be a potential shootout with the winner gaining a significant edge in the race to the playoffs. However, with CSK boasting of a superior net run rate of 0.700 at this point, both SRH (-0.065) and LSG (-0.371) will have one eye on improving their NRR in case if the teams end on same points after completion of the league stages.\n\nAnd quite expectedly, both sides have endured a similar graph in terms of performances winning six of their 11 matches so far. And both sides head into Wednesday's game on the back of loses in their respective previous matches.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad are coming off a 7-wicket loss to Mumbai Indians on Monday night, their third loss in four games, primarily because their destructive batting line-up hasn't fired as a unit. Against MI, the team struggled to put up a sizeable total, which has been their strongest point this season.\n\nBarring Travis Head, who has been their stand out performer this season, the other batters have faced a recent slump. Head's opening partner Abhishek Sharma has managed to score past 30 just once in the last four games while the flamboyant Heinrich Klaasen has also been unable to strike the ball consistently and Nitish Reddy too has been patchy.\n\nInstead their bowling unit has been an improved lot with skipper Pat Cummins leading the way, along with T. Natarajan's consistency at the death. The seasoned Bhuvneshwar Kumar also seems to have regained his touch after his incisive spell helped SRH eke out a one-run win against Rajasthan Royals.\n\nLSG, on the other hand, are also coming into the game on the back of a humiliating 98-run loss to Kolkata Knight Riders, when they not only conceded the first-ever 200 plus score at the Ekana Stadium but also folded their innings at 137.\n\nWhile Saturday's match turned out a collective failure of the side, the onus will now be again on skipper KL Rahul to marshal his troops to get the 5th-ranked side out of the mid-table logjam. For that, Rahul will be expected to make amends in his batting, with a slightly more aggressive intent. His new opening partner Arshin Kulkarni has failed to deliver in his first two games, and it remains to be seen whether the LSG management goes back to their tested pair of Rahul and seasoned South African Quinton de Kock.\n\nThe middle order comprising the likes of Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran and Deepak Hooda will be expected to add meat to their totals, something which they failed against KKR. Ayush Badoni has had a subdued run in this IPL and he would be keen to shrug off the rustiness.\n\nMore than their batting, LSG's struggles with the ball have compounded after the loss of their express pacer Mayank Yadav, who has been ruled out of the IPL and left-arm pacer Mohsin Khan also picked up an injury. Thus the onus will be on Afghan quick Naveen-ul-Haq, young Yash Thakur, Stoinis and spinners Krunal Pandya and Ravi Bishnoi to deliver.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Yadav", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

It will be a big part in the Caribbean,\" said man of the match Head.\n\n\"Nice to get 360 (degrees) and get to the parts of the ground I have not been to. We want to maximise the powerplay. It is not going to work every time but we want to go for it.\"\n\n'Incredible'\n\nThe 30-year-old Head lauded his younger partner Abhishek, 23, and said: \"His spin game is something else. We complement each other so well.\"\n\nAbhishek joined the charge as he got to his fifty in 19 balls after the pair took Hyderabad to 107 in the first six overs of powerplay, when only two fielders are allowed outside the inner circle.\n\nHyderabad, who won the IPL in 2016 under David Warner, registered their seventh win in 12 matches to hand a perfect gift to birthday boy and captain Pat Cummins, who turned 31 on Wednesday.\n\nAbhishek hit the winning six as Hyderabad moved to third in the 10-team table with 14 points.

Heavy rain has fallen in Hyderabad and its surrounding areas during the last 24 hours, with more expected today.\n\nRain is anticipated in the afternoon, but the match is scheduled to go on as planned under gloomy skies. Even if rain does fall, it is expected to be mild and pose no substantial threat to the game's continuity. Temperatures in Hyderabad are expected to start at 29 or 30 degrees Celsius and remain around 29 degrees during the match. Humidity levels are forecast to be very high, ranging between 65 and 75 percent.\n\nThe high humidity levels create worries about dew forming on the field and pitch in the final stages of the game. Wind patterns are expected to prevail from the southeast, with speeds ranging from 10 to 15 km/h. The surface at Hyderabad favours batsmen and provides generally favourable scoring circumstances. While bowlers may have some success with the new ball, batsmen becomes more comfortable as the ball aged.\n\nHistorical records from past matches at this venue show that the team batting first has a small edge, with three of the four matches ending in triumphs for the first batting side, while the team batting second has only won one match.\n\nAlso Read: Mathew Hayden praises Sanju Samson's heroic display in DC vs RR\n\nSRH vs LSG Squads\n\nSRH Squad: Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins(c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan, Sanvir Singh, Mayank Markande, Glenn Phillips, Jaydev Unadkat, Umran Malik, Aiden Markram, Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar, Anmolpreet Singh, Upendra Yadav, Jhatavedh Subramanyan, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Akash Maharaj Singh\n\nLSG Squad: KL Rahul(w/c), Arshin Kulkarni, Marcus Stoinis, Deepak Hooda, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Ashton Turner, Krunal Pandya, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-Haq, Yash Thakur, Mohsin Khan, Manimaran Siddharth, Krishnappa Gowtham, Devdutt Padikkal, Amit Mishra, Kyle Mayers, Quinton de Kock, Matt Henry, Prerak Mankad, Arshad Khan, Shamar Joseph", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aryan_suraj_chadha@republicworld.com", "name": "Aryan Suraj Chadha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Samad_(Indian_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abdul Samad (Indian cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanju_Samson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanju Samson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anmolpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anmolpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navjot_Singh_Sidhu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Navjot Singh Sidhu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Kolkata Knight Riders and the Rajasthan Royals occupy the top two spots in the points table and have more or less secured their playoff qualification.\n\nChennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and the Lucknow Super Giants occupy the next three spots in the points table with six wins and five losses in the 11 games they have played so far. CSK have the best net run rate among these three teams but they all need to keep winning to give themselves the best chance of qualifying for the playoffs.\n\nComing to the qualification scenario for the Sunrisers and the Super Giants, both teams have almost an equal chance of making it through to the playoffs. Their fate is in their own hands and if they win at least two of their remaining three matches, their chances of playoff qualification will increase drastically.\n\nRecent form of SRH and LSG\n\nThe Sunrisers Hyderabad have displayed an ultra-attacking batting approach this season, racking up massive scores of 287, 277, and 266. The opposition bowling attacks were taken to the cleaners by the opening duo of Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head.\n\nAfter blistering starts, SRH got momentum from Heinrich Klaasen and Nitish Kumar Reddy in the middle overs which helped them post massive totals.\n\nHowever, the scenario has changed in the last few games. Sunrisers have only managed to win one of their last four games which has pushed them to a corner where they need to win at least two of their last three games to go through to the playoffs.\n\nThe batting line-up has failed to deliver as a unit in the last few games which has resulted in SRH losing their way a bit. Had Pat Cummins and Bhuvneshwar Kumar not got them out of jail against the Rajasthan Royals, things would have been worse for the Sunrisers. They lost their previous game against the Mumbai Indians by seven wickets.\n\nThe batting department was restricted to a below-par score which was chased down by MI on the back of a splendid century from Suryakumar Yadav.\n\nSRH will definitely look to get back to winning ways in the coming matches but the batters need to rise to the occasion and help them post massive scores which can provide a cushion for their bowlers.\n\nComing to the Lucknow Super Giants, they are currently 5th in the points table but have an inferior net run rate when compared to Sunrisers. Their form has been indifferent to say the least.\n\nTheir performance during the 98-run loss against the Kolkata Knight Riders will surely raise a few eyebrows within the team management and the players.\n\nThe Ekana Stadium has become a fortress for LSG where they have unleashed their spinners to dismantle the opposition. However, it was totally different against a resurgent KKR batting line-up and the whole bowling cartel was dispatched to all corners of the park. A score of 235 was a massive one for a stadium like Ekana and it was evident from LSG's performance with the bat.\n\nLucknow started off their campaign with a defeat against the Rajasthan Royals. They got their campaign back on track with three consecutive wins against Punjab Kings, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, and the Gujarat Titans.\n\nA couple of defeats against Delhi and KKR followed before they again returned to winning ways against the Chennai Super Kings. They won both their matches against the yellow army before losing against the Rajasthan Royals. The win loss ratio highlights LSG's lack of consistency, but they are still very much within touching distance of making it through to the playoffs.\n\nUpcoming games for both teams\n\nLucknow and Hyderabad will square off against each other on May 8 (Wednesday) in a crucial encounter. The winning team will solidify their position in the points table and inch closer to the playoffs berth.\n\nLucknow will end their campaign with matches against the Delhi Capitals and the Mumbai Indians. The Capitals will try to keep their hopes alive and the only way that can happen is to keep winning. LSG can't afford a slip up at this stage of the tournament. They will play their final group game against the Mumbai Indians on May 17.\n\nHyderabad will be playing all their remaining three games in Hyderabad where they put up massive scores. The pitch has looked a belter and SRH will be hoping that the batting unit returns to their destructive best. After their clash against LSG, SRH will be up against the Gujarat Titans and the Punjab Kings in their final two games on May 16 and 19, respectively.\n\nWho has a better chance of qualifying through the IPL playoffs?\n\nIn a tournament where there are no easy games, it's very difficult to predict which team has a better chance of going through to the playoffs. With SRH and LSG slated to lock horns against each other on May 8, the result of this contest might well decide which team will go through to the playoffs.\n\nHyderabad will have the advantage as they will be playing in front of their home crowd and on a surface where they have plundered the opposition's bowling attacks.\n\nLucknow have to come prepared for the onslaught but the home advantage certainly gives the edge to Hyderabad. If they win this clash, they will have a better chance of qualifying for the playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri":

After winning the toss and opting to bat in Hyderabad, KL Rahul came up with a strange knock, not showing any bit of intent in the powerplay. LSG managed just 27 runs and lost two wickets in their first 6 overs as Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis failed to get going.\n\nKL Rahul hit only one boundary and a six for his 29 which came in 33 deliveries as LSG struggled to keep the scoreboard moving on a pitch that was not entirely conducive to spin bowling. It was surprising to see KL Rahul bat without intent even against debutant leg-spinner Vijayakanth Viyaskanth after Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Pat Cummins came up with miserly overs in the powerplay.\n\nIPL 2024, SRH vs LSG: Updates | Scorecard\n\nKL Rahul struggled to even rotate the strike as familiar problems came back to haunt the Super Giants captain on Wednesday.

LSG were at the sixth spot in the IPL 2024 points table with 12 points from 11 matches. A few fans even compared KL Rahul's slow knock to the 107-ball 66 that he hit against another Pat Cummins-led side --- Australia in the ODI World Cup final last year in Ahmedabad.\n\nKL Rahul was dismissed by Pat Cummins in the 10th over when LSG were 57. It came as a blessing in disguise for the visiting team as Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran added some impetus to their innings with their 80-plus stand for the 5th wicket.\n\nYoung Badoni showcased that there was not a lot wrong with the pitch with a 28-ball fifty, while Pooran chipped in with a quick knock, managing 48 off just 26 balls.

Had these boys batted first, they would've scored 300,\" Tendulkar wrote in his X account.\n\nThe Head and Sharma show came after SRH bowlers started brilliantly before losing the plot a bit.\n\nAyush Badoni (55 not out off 30 balls) and Nicholas Pooran (48 not out off 25 balls) stitched crucial 95-runs off 55 balls for the unbeaten fifth-wicket stand to guide LSG to a competitive 165 for four on a sluggish pitch.\n\nAs It Happened\n\nBut the Head and Sharma took any hint of competition out of the match once they bludgeoned 107 runs in the Power Play.\n\nIt was an awesome hitting display from the Indo-Australian pair as they didn't spare a single LSG bowler, clobbering them to all parts of the ground.\n\nLSG's decision to start with Krishnappa Gowtham also backfired badly as both Head and Sharma, who are really good against spin, dismantled the off-spinner.\n\nSuch was the brutal assault that the likes Yash Dayal, Ravi Bishnoi and Naveen-ul-Haq were also taken to the cleaners, raining sixes and fours.\n\nEarlier, LSG were struggling at 27 for 2 at the end of the powerplay after opting to bat.\n\nThe visitors lost Quinton de Kock, who replaced an injured Mohsin Khan, early, caught brilliantly by Nitish Kumar Reddy at deep backward square-leg off Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) in the third over.\n\nBhuvneshwar struck again in the fifth over, dismissing the dangerous Marcus Stoinis but the credit for the dismissal should go to young Sanvir Singh, who took a stunning diving catch just inches from the ground at mid-on.\n\nThe pitch also didn't help LSG's cause as the ball was coming on to the bat a bit slow, as their batters found it difficult to find the timing.\n\nWhile skipper KL Rahul (29) held one end up, Krunal Pandya (24) took it on himself to up the ante.\n\nKrunal pummelled Jaydev Unadkat for a six over long-on and then hit the bowler straight over his head for another maximum to accumulate 15 runs in the eighth over.\n\nRahul hit the first boundary of LSG innings in the 10th over, slamming SRH skipper Pat Cummins over mid-off.\n\nBut Rahul never looked at his usual best as he struggled to get his timing and finally departed in search of quick runs, caught by T Natarajan at deep backward square leg in the final delivery of the same over.\n\nSRH were brilliant on the field as Cummins' direct throw from mid-on sent Krunal packing soon when the batter went for a quick single.\n\nBadoni pressed the feet on the accelerator soon with three boundaries of left-arm pacer Natarajan's 14th over which yielded 17 runs.\n\nThe Lucknow side finally got going as Pooran and Badoni struck a six and a four to accumulate 12 runs off the 15th over bowled by leg-spinner Vijayakanth Viyaskanth.\n\nThey showed intent from the word go and didn't hesitate to play their strokes when the opportunity was presented to them.\n\nIt was brilliant batting from Badoni as he swept and cut Natarajan for two consecutive boundaries in the 17th over.\n\nBadoni displayed some cheeky shots as the right-hander notched up his fifty in 28 balls.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Notably, after opting to bat first, LSG were rocked by a couple of strikes by Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) who got rid of Quinton de Kock (2 off 5) and Marcus Stoinis (3 off 5) inside the powerplay to leave Lucknow reeling at 27/2 after six overs.\n\nAfter the early blows, captain KL Rahul got under his shell and tried to bide his time at the crease but was eventually dismissed for 29 (33) in the tenth over by Pat Cummins. However, the approach didn't go down well with Hayden, who called them out for not showing enough intent.\n\n\"I have to call them (LSG) out. This is not a five runs per over wicket. Somebody needed to show intent. They had one of the slowest power plays. That took the innings nowhere. When the opposition team has Travis Head and Heinrich Klaasen, your intention should be to go at 10s and over. 160-170 will never be enough,\" Hayden said on commentary.\n\nAfter losing their captain, LSG were further rocked by the run-out dismissal of Krunal Pandya (24 off 21) which left them further reeling at 66/4 after 11.2 overs. Seeing their team in trouble, Nicholas Pooran (48* off 26) and Ayush Badoni (55* off 30) bailed their team out of trouble with an unbeaten 99-run standoff 52 balls to get them to a total of 165/4 in 20 overs.\n\nHowever, the total didn't prove to be enough for SRH as they made a complete mockery of their score with their opening duo Abhishek Sharma (75* off 28) and Travis Head (89* off 30) chasing it down in just 9.4 overs. The LSG bowling was taken to the cleaners by the aggressive opening duo, who shattered the record for the highest total chased within the first ten overs in T20 cricket.\n\nFollowing the game, LSG owner Sanjeev Goenka was seen having a heated chat with captain KL Rahul as he openly expressed his discontentment with his team's shambolic loss. Meanwhile, LSG are now placed sixth in the points table with 12 points from as many games and will be desperate to win their remaining two fixtures to keep their hopes of playoff qualification alive.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Hayden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_de_Kock", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quinton de Kock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

In what turned out to be the perfect birthday gift for Head's teammate and Test captain Pat Cumminsthe SRH opener scored an outrageous 89 not out off just 30 balls to seal a crushing win over Lucknow Super Giants that left the cricket world stunned.\n\nHead hit eight sixes and eight fours in the extraordinary innings, while his opening partner Abhishek Sharma dismissed at the other end with an equally eye-catching 75 not out off 28 balls. The opening pair's fireworks saw the Sunrisers chase down Lucknow Super Giants' 4-165, playing less than half of their allotted 20 overs.\n\nThe staggering unbeaten opening stand of 167 runs came off just 9.4 overs at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad, giving SRH victory with 62 balls to spare, which is the largest margin for a chase of over 150 runs in history of the IPL. SRH's total of 167 runs is also the highest score by any team at the end of the tenth in the history of Men's T20.\n\nThe resounding victory was the perfect 31st birthday present for Cummins and his Sunrisers side, cementing their place at third on the ladder and boosting their play-off hopes. Defeated Lucknow skipper KL Rahul could only marvel at Head and Sharma's masterclass after the match and admitted that they had witnessed something quite incredible. I'm out of words. We saw that batting on TV but it was unreal, the Lucknow skipper said about the Hyderabad openers. Everything hit the middle of the bat, kudos to their skill, they worked really hard on their six-hitting.\n\nRELATED:\n\nHead's latest masterclass saw him move to third place on the IPL points table this season with a whopping 533 runs at an average of 53.30 and a strike-rate of 201.89. And Cummins echoed the thoughts of fans around the world after marveling at his Australian teammate's incredible ball-striking ability. \"It certainly doesn't surprise me anymore,\" Cummins said of Head. \"He's been like that over the years. He may not be super conventional, but he's got a good eye, he's hitting the middle of the bat a lot and he's having a great tournament.\"\n\nIn an ominous sign of his form ahead of next month's T20 World Cup in the US and Caribbean, Head scored 22 off Krishnappa Gowtham's second over and then increased it in the fifth over after hitting Naveen-ul-Haq bowled out for 24 runs in his six. deliveries. The audacious display of big strokes saw Head race past his half-century in just sixteen balls.\n\n\"A lot of fun,\" said a smiling Head of his stroke in the game. \"The last twelve months that I've been back with the Australian team, they wanted me to play like that and I'm not trying to change anything, I'm just trying to maximize that power play. It's not always going to work but I'm going to try to be as consistent as possible to give myself the best opportunities and hopefully do my bit for the team.\"\n\nSunrisers are now in a good position to make the play-offs with Hyderabad sitting at the third spot with 14 points and their net run-rate getting a serious boost from the huge win. Justin Langer-coached Lucknow, for whom Marcus Stoinis fell to an early three points, are now sixth in the standings and face an uphill battle to qualify for the play-offs.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Sharma regained his lost touch with an undefeated 75 off 28 balls.\n\nThe win lifted Hyderabad to No. 3 with 14 points and more importantly gave it a healthy net run-rate of 0.41 with two home games to go. The huge defeat has pushed Lucknow in the tight corner for the playoffs with 12 points from 12 games.\n\nEarlier, Ayush Badoni (55) and Nicholas Pooran (48) propelled Lucknow to 165-4 with a 99-run unbeaten fifth-wicket stand after Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2-12) gave away just 12 singles and dismissed the big hitters -- Quinton de Kock (2) and Marcus Stoinis (3) -- inside the power play.\n\nHead and Sharma charged against pace and spin as Yash Thakur was smashed for 47 off his 16 balls while spinners Ravi Bishnoi and Krishnappa Gowtham gave away 63 runs off their four overs.\n\nLucknow had a moment to separate the destructive pair but Thakur couldn't hold onto a sharp one-handed catch of Sharma at short third-man when the batter was on 18 in the third over. Sharma had another escape after completing his half-century when leg-spinner Bishnoi dropped a hard two-handed return catch.\n\nEarlier, Kumar had buckled down Lucknow 27-2 in the first six overs on a tacky wicket and Rahul struggled to give the innings momentum before pulled skipper Pat Cummins to deep backward square leg and got dismissed for struggling 29 off 33 balls.\n\nPooran and Badoni countercharged in the death overs with Badoni playing some orthodox shots on square of the wicket as pace duo of T Natarajan and Cummins conceded 34 runs off the final two overs.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Though the ball was skidding on better than in the first innings, when pace was taken off, it was sticking in the pitch. However, it made no difference to the SRH approach. Unlike Rahul and Quinton de Kock, who tried to play the orthodox way, Head and Abhishek looked to send every ball into the stands, which they almost did in the Powerplay which yielded 107 runs.\n\nThis is the second time this season Sunrisers have gone past 100 in the Powerplay. There was no respite no matter what was bowled at them as everything seemed destined for the stands.\n\nHead was the more dynamic at the crease, moving away at times or going further back inside it. One of his best shots of the night came when he went on the backfoot and clobbered Ravi Bishnoi into the stands over long-off.\n\nOn the other hand, Abhishek stood still at the crease and hit through the line, depositing balls into the stands. Head got to his half-century in 16 balls while his opening partner got there in 19.\n\nAs had been the case many times before this season, the bowling side was shell-shocked and short of ideas. The partnership not only ensured the win but also made sure SRH's net run rate (+0.406 after the game) shot up, taking them from the mid-table jam and into third position.\n\nLSG, who suffered a heavy defeat against Kolkata Knight Riders, endured more damage to their net run rate (-0.769 after Wednesday's game).\n\nBhuvneshwar starts well before Badoni blitz\n\nIt was the slowest surface in Hyderabad so far this season. The ball was taking an age to reach the batsmen. As a result, the Lucknow Super Giants top order struggled to score quickly.\n\nLSG batters hit only three sixes and one boundary in the first 10 overs, indicative of the slowness of the surface. Bhuvneshwar Kumar, after a slow start to the season, seems to have found his rhythm and looks close to his best. Despite there being minimal swing on offer, the 34-year-old bowled stump-to-stump and kept hitting the good length area.\n\nBhuvneshwar's discipline, accompanied by some electric fielding in the initial overs, contributed to LSG scoring their lowest Powerplay total of the season (27/2). First, it was Nitish Kumar Reddy who took a brilliant catch on the boundary to dismiss De Kock before Sanvir Singh at mid-on dived forward to take a low catch to dismiss dangerman Marcus Stoinis.\n\nHowever, young Ayush Badoni played a street-smart innings. He kept his weight on the backfoot throughout his knock, and let the ball come to him instead of trying to muscle it. With sublime wristwork, he played some cheeky shots square of the wicket to get boundaries.\n\nBadoni found an excellent ally in Nicholas Pooran, who played his part in their 99-run partnership. Though the wicket did not have enough pace to work with, the left-hander is blessed with one of the quickest bat-swings in world cricket which can overcome the slowness of the surface and slower balls. Both combined to take LSG to 165, a score that looked beyond them after the first 10 overs of the innings and felt like a fighting total.\n\nThe Badoni-Pooran partnership put SRH pacers, other than Bhuvneshwar, to the sword. Sri Lankan leg-spinner Vijayakanth Viyashkanth made an impressive debut. With Mayank Markande falling out of favour the performance from the 22-year-old is a confidence-booster for SRH as it provides an attacking option in the middle overs as surfaces would grip as the mercury rises.\n\nBrief scores: Lucknow Super Giants 165/4 in 20 overs (Ayush Badoni 55 not out, Nicholas Pooran 48; Bhuvneshwar Kumar 2/12) lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad 167 for no loss in 9.4 overs

PTI\n\nAt the end of Powerplay, Lucknow Super Giants were 27/2. Sunrisers Hyderabad, in pursuit of 166, were 107 without loss after six overs at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad on Wedneday.\n\nTravis Head (89 not out off 30 balls) and his opening partner Abhishek Sharma (75 not out off 28 balls) had already done more than three-fourth of the job for the Sunrisers as they eventually crushed the Super Giants by 10 wickets with a good 10.2 overs remaining. The game didn't even last three hours, courtesy Head and Sharma's onslaught which helped their team overhaul Lucknow's 165/4 in barely 45 minutes.\n\nSuch a commanding win propelled the Sunrisers to third in the points table alongside boosting their net run rate, while it also brought about the end of Mumbai Indians' campaign in this IPL. For MI to keep their playoffs hopes alive, Lucknow had to beat the Sunrisers.\n\nOn a slow surface, it was a struggle for the Lucknow batsmen early on as they were languishing at 66/4 in the 12 th over before Ayush Badoni's unbeaten 55 off 30 balls and Nicholas Pooran's 48 not out off 26 balls pushed the visitors past the 160-mark. But even though dew didn't seem to be a factor, the Hyderabad pitch certainly looked easier for batting as the game progressed, which Lucknow too found out during their defence of the total.\n\nIn the run chase, Head, in the form of his life at present, was on the ball right away, cashing in on anything had even a little bit of width and room. Sharma, too, did the same, making sure not to let go of even one loose ball.\n\nIn other words, it was just insane hitting by the Sunrisers openers as it seemed they were out there at a six-hitting practice session facing net bowlers. With due respect to the Lucknow bowlers, they were mediocre to say the least and often fed Head and Sharma with awfully poor deliveries.\n\nEarlier, Badoni produced an innings of quality improvisation that was pivotal in lifting the Super Giants total. At ease against both quicks and spinners, Badoni found the boundaries on both sides of the wicket as his unbroken 99-run stand with Pooran was massive in taking the Super Giants to a total that looked challenging, till the Sunrisers' run chase began.\n\nLucknow's turnaround began from the 14th over when Badoni's innovative shots earned 17 runs off T. Natarajan's over.\n\nThe Sunrisers, meanwhile, had given a debut to the Jaffna-based leg-spinner Vijayakanth Viyaskanth -- first in the IPL from Sri Lanka's northern tip, which used to be the epicentre of the civil war in the country. The 22-year-old finished wicketless, but was expensive only in his final over, not giving away much in his first three.\n\nBut at the end of the day, what mattered for the Sunrisers was their opening duo's amazing performance which came as an ideal birthday present to skipper Pat Cummins, who turned 31 on Wednesday.\n\nFor Head though, it was good fun batting with Sharma. \"It was a lot of fun. Abhi and I have had good partnerships. It was nice to get it done and yeah, very, very good fun.

MI had only won 4 matches so far in Hardik Pandya's first season as the skipper of the franchise didn't live up to expectations.\n\nWith 8 losses to their name already, MI can only get to 12 points if they do manage to win their last two matches. However, SRH's win meant that they went to 14 points on the table. With DC and LSG set to face on May 14, one of the two would also get 14 points.

Head scored his fifty off just 16 balls while Abhishek would match his partner in 19 balls. SRH scored 107 in the powerplay as LSG looked clueless in the end.

Both teams have fared similarly this season, having won six of their 11 games apiece. Hence, the winner of this duel will take a leap in the playoff race. Notably, SRH are coming off a thumping defeat against Mumbai Indians. Here is the match preview.\n\nHyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium will host this duel on May 8. The surface here will assist batters and one expects a competitive score on the board. Bowlers will want to count on their variations. The match starts at 7:30pm IST and one can watch it live on the Star Sports Network and stream on Jio Cinema.\n\nAs LSG made their debut only last season, the two sides have crossed swords just thrice. The Super Giants won all three games, including two in the last season. The Orange Army would be confident on breaking this streak as they have win three of their four matches in IPL 2024, as per ESPNcricinfo.\n\nBoth SRH and LSG have some thinking to do as their respective last outings weren't fruitful. LSG's recent struggles have been majorly due to the firepower in their pace-bowling department. KL Rahul's leadership has also come under the scanner. Meanwhile, SRH's destructive batting line-up hasn't delivered much in recent matches. Even their bowlers faltered during their recent loss against MI.\n\nSRH probable XI: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Mayank Agarwal, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan.

SRH dominated from the outset, achieving the fastest 10-over score in T20 history by chasing down a target of 166 in just 9.4 overs, securing a 10-wicket victory.\n\nThe match featured extraordinary performances from SRH's Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, who blasted their way to fifties in 16 and 19 balls, respectively, setting a record for the highest powerplay score in T20 cricket. Voges acknowledged the sheer scale of SRH's dominance, saying, \"I think we all are in awe a little bit of what we've just seen. I think sometimes you've gotta tip your hat and say well played to the opposition. That was incredible batting and hitting. We clearly didn't have an answer.\"\n\nWhile SRH's batsmen stole the show, Voges reflected on LSG's inability to exert similar pressure, stating, \"I haven't spoken to the guys yet about whether there was a difference in terms of the innings but clearly our powerplay compared to Sunrisers was at the two extremes. We were put under immense pressure with the ball right from the start. We weren't able to apply that same pressure with the bat, to begin with.\"\n\nDespite the challenging game, Voges highlighted a positive aspect for LSG: the partnership between Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran, who managed a 99-run stand that briefly gave LSG hope of a competitive total. \"I thought our backend of the innings was really good. Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran's partnership got us, it was probably still under par total but it gave us a fighting chance at least. But that obviously was clearly not enough,\" he admitted.\n\nThe defeat, LSG's sixth of the season, not only affected their standings, dropping them below Delhi Capitals, but also severely impacted their net run rate.\n\nRelated Items:Abhishek Sharma, Adam Voges, india, IPL 2024, Live India, LIVE INDIA LIVE, Live India News, Lucknow Super Giants, record-breaking T20, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Travis Head Recommended for you KL Rahul keeps calm in 'animated' chat with LSG owner after 10-wicket thrashing IPL 2024: \"Am lost for words\" : KL Rahul after 10-wicket defeat IPL 2024: SRH Demolishes LSG with Record-Breaking Chase", "source": {"uri": "liveindia.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "Live India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Voges", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Voges"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

In what proved to be the perfect birthday present for Head's teammate and Test captain Pat Cummins, the SRH opener belted an outrageous 89 not out off just 30 balls to set up a crushing win over Lucknow Super Giants that left the cricket world gobsmacked.\n\nHead bludgeoned eight sixes and eight fours in the extraordinary innings, with his opening partner Abhishek Sharma teeing off at the other end with an equally eye-catching 75 not out off 28 balls. The opening pair's pyrotechnics saw the Sunrisers chase down Lucknow Super Giants' 4-165 with less than half of their allotted 20 overs played.\n\nThe staggering unbeaten 167-run opening stand came off just 9.4 overs at Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, clinching the win for SRH with 62 balls still remaining, which is the biggest margin for a 150+ run chase in IPL history. SRH's 167-run total is also the highest score by any team by the end of the tenth over in men's T20 history.\n\nThe resounding win was the perfect 31st birthday present for Cummins and his Sunrisers side, cementing their spot in third on the ladder and strengthening their playoff hopes. Beaten Lucknow skipper KL Rahul could only marvel at the masterclass from Head and Sharma after the match, admitting they had witnessed something quite unbelievable. \"I'm lost for words. We've watched that batting on TV but that was unreal,\" the Lucknow skipper said of the Hyderabad openers. \"Everything was hitting the middle of the bat, kudos to their skill, they've worked very hard on their six-hitting.\"\n\nRELATED:\n\nCricket world loses it as Travis Head stars in record scenes\n\nHead's latest masterclass saw him move into third on the run-scoring charts in the IPL this season with a whopping 533 runs at an average of 53.30 and a strike-rate of 201.89. And Cummins echoed the thoughts of fans around the world after marvelling at his Aussie teammate's incredible ball-striking ability. \"It certainly doesn't surprise me any more,\" Cummins said about Head. \"He's been like this for the last few years. He might not be super-conventional but he's got a great eye, hits the middle of the bat a lot and he's having a wonderful tournament.\"\n\nTravis Head on fire ahead of T20 World Cup\n\nIn an ominous sign of his form ahead of next month's T20 World Cup in the USA and Caribbean, Head cracked 22 off Krishnappa Gowtham's second over and then stepped it up in the fifth over after dispatching Naveen-ul-Haq for 24 runs off his six deliveries. The brutal display of big-hitting saw Head race past his half-century in just 16 balls.\n\n\"Very, very good fun,\" a smiling Head said about his batting the game. \"The last 12 months being back in the Australian team, that's how they've wanted me to play and I'm not trying to change anything, just trying to maximise that powerplay. It's not going to work all the time but I'm going to try to be as consistent as I can, give myself the best opportunity and hopefully do my part for the team.\"\n\nSunrisers are now in a good position to make the playoffs, with Hyderabad third in the table on 14 points and with their net run-rate enjoying a serious boost from the massive win. The Justin Langer-coached Lucknow, for whom Marcus Stoinis fell early for three, now lie sixth in the standings and face an uphill battle to qualify for the playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "au.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!7 Sport"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_reid@au.sports.yahoo.com", "name": "Andrew Reid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Sunrisers have lost three of their last four matches, mainly because their destructive batting line-up hasn't delivered.\n\nIn their last match against Mumbai Indians, which they lost by seven wickets, they failed to put up a good target on the board, which has been their strong suit this season.\n\nBarring Travis Head, who has been their stand out performer, the other batters in the side have faced a recent slump.\n\nAfter displaying his power-hitting ability, young opener Abhishek Sharma has breached the 30-run mark just once in the last four games.\n\nAnd while SRH head coach Daniel Vettori has conceded that the openers are not expected to do the job all the time, the middle order needs to step up.\n\nThe flamboyant Heinrich Klaasen has also been unable to strike the ball consistently and Nitish Reddy too has been patchy.\n\nThe bowlers have fared better compared to their batting counterparts.\n\nT Natarajan has been consistent with the ball while seasoned seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar also seems to have found his mojo after his incisive spell helped SRH eke out a one-run win against RR.\n\nIMAGE: Lucknow Super Giants captain K L Rahul with head coach Justin Langer.

Head wasn't a part of SRH's playing XI in their season opener against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) but has batted at the top of the order since making his debut for the franchise in their second game.\n\nSRH will face the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in Hyderabad on Wednesday, May 8. With 12 points from 11 games, the hosts are placed fourth on the points table and a win against LSG will help them leapfrog the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) into third position.\n\nIn a video shared on his YouTube channel, Chopra chose Head and Abhishek as the first two SunRisers Hyderabad players to watch out for in Wednesday's game.\n\n\"If this team has to win, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma need to play for long and explosively because they do two things. One is they score runs and secondly, they attack you hard mentally. It just demotivates you the way they start. They start like a bullet train,\" he reasoned (5:20).\n\nThe former India opener noted that Head has shown different facets of his game in IPL 2024.\n\n\"Travis Head needs to be talked about first because he is in that kind of form. We have seen him playing differently a few times. He played slightly cautiously in the last match at home against Rajasthan because the pitch was like that. He started scratchily in the last match as well but eventually got close to his fifty,\" Chopra observed.\n\nWhile acknowledging that Abhishek fell cheaply in SRH's previous game, Chopra expects the Indian youngster to deliver the goods against LSG.\n\n\"Travis Head will once again be my guy in focus because you expect runs from him. When the business end of the tournament has come, Hyderabad is entrusted to you. The second player I am picking is Abhishek Sharma. He has batted well. He didn't score runs in the last match. I expect him to play well,\" he said.\n\nWith 444 runs at a strike rate of 189.74 in 10 innings, Head is SRH's highest run-scorer in IPL 2024. Abhishek is the franchise's third-highest run-getter this season, with his 326 runs in 11 innings coming at a strike rate of 195.20.\n\n\"I stand corrected\" - Aakash Chopra praises SRH skipper Pat Cummins for proving him wrong\n\nAakash Chopra picked Pat Cummins as the third SunRisers Hyderabad player in focus against the Lucknow Super Giants. He admitted that the Australian Test and ODI skipper has proved his pre-tournament skepticism wrong.\n\n\"The third, I am going with Pat Cummins. He is captaining well, even batting well now, and bowling in the right areas. When he was selected as a captain, I felt what were they doing as they were spending so much money and his IPL numbers were not great.

Pic/AFP; (right) Lucknow Super Giants's captain KL Rahul. Pic/AFP\n\nThe battle for the Playoffs is hotting up. Four teams, who are better placed than the bottom four are in the fray for the third and fourth spots as the league phase enters the final stretch. Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals are perched at the top.\n\nWednesday's match between hosts Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium is crucial as the winner will get one step closer to the Playoffs.\n\nBoth teams have 12 points each from 11 matches with six wins and five losses. Both will also keep an eye on the run-rate as it will be vital in the end as Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals are the other two potential contenders in the race.\n\nSunrisers have had a roller-coaster ride this season. Before losing to Mumbai Indians by a big margin they barely managed to squeak past RR by one run in their last home match.\n\nThis season, SRH have a 3-2 record at home. As Cummins said after the toss in Mumbai that they need to win at least two matches for a Playoffs place. Apart from this match, SRH have to play two more matches, both at home. They host Gujarat Titans (May 16) before winding up the league phase with a match against Punjab Kings (May 19). On the other hand, LSG face DC in Delhi (May 14) and MI in Mumbai (May 17).\n\nAlso Read: Clarke propounds 'fatigued' Rohit's rest as essential pre-World Cup strategy\n\nThe trio of Travis Head, Abhisekh Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen, who were devastating with their big-hitting skills, have not produced the same red-hot form consistently that helped SRH rattle up big scores.\n\nThey have been culled and SRH have choked. In a few matches, young Nitish Reddy stood up to the challenge and in the last match, Cummins took SRH to 173 with a late cameo.\n\nBut otherwise, it has been a disappointing show in the second half of the season with even former Indian opener Mayank Agarwal failing in his comeback match in Mumbai. The SRH batters will be hoping to find their mojo in their last three matches at home.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar was the hero of SRH's thrilling win over RR. He has found his rhythm and that is good news for SRH. H Natarajan has been good with his yorkers while Cummins has come up with useful spells.\n\nLSG skipper KL Rahul and Marcus Stoinis have been top performers with the willow, but the former has come in for some criticism for his strike-rate. The bowlers have been a big disappointment.\n\nSRH preferred to skip Wednesday's net session, but LSG, who were scheduled to have a practice session too opted out because of rain. LSG assistant coach Sridharan Sriram said: \"Unseasonal rain and thunderstorms are expected. Hopefully, we will have a full game.\"", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

Both LSG and SRH have 12 points each from 11 matches, but are sixth and fourth, respectively, on the basis of the net run rate.\n\nLucknow have had a mixed time lately in IPL 2024, winning three and losing two of their last five matches. In their previous clash, they went down to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) by 98 runs at the Ekana Cricket Stadium. Batting first, Lucknow Super Giants were bowled out for 137 in 16.1 overs.\n\nOpener Quinton de Kock, who missed the match against Mumbai Indians (MI) due to a niggle, was not picked for the game against KKR despite being fit. We analyze three reasons why the South African cricketer must be recalled for LSG's IPL 2024 match against SRH on Wednesday.\n\n#1 Quinton de Kock has the experience to deliver in crucial matches\n\nDe Kock has had a mixed run in IPL 2024. In nine matches, he has scored 236 runs at an average of 26.22 and a strike rate of 136.41, with three half-centuries. After kicking off the tournament with four against Rajasthan Royals (RR), he registered consecutive fifties against Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).\n\nAfter three low scores, he notched up another half-century against Chennai Super Kings (CSK), but it was followed up with scores of 0 and 8. Being one of the senior members of the team, De Kock has definitely disappointed with his inconsistent performances. However, LSG must back him as he has the experience to deliver in crucial matches.\n\nIt is no secret that if De Kock gets going, he can be unstoppable, which was witnessed during the 2023 ODI World Cup in India as well. In the IPL as well, he has had phases where he has been exceptional with the willow. Thus, there are enough convincing reasons for Lucknow Super Giants to hand him a recall.\n\n#2 LSG must play their best possible combination in crunch match\n\nThe Lucknow Super Giants vs Sunrisers Hyderabad IPL 2024 clash on Wednesday at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium would be extremely crucial keeping the playoffs scenario in mind.\n\nIf we look at the points table ahead of the game, Kolkata and Rajasthan occupy the top two slots with 16 points each. Apart from Lucknow and Hyderabad, Chennai and Delhi are also on 12 points each. The winner of the SRH vs LSG clash on Wednesday would move to 14 points. The loser of the contest would face a difficult task with regard to clinching a top four berth in the points table.\n\nConsidering how crucial the result of the match could prove to be in the context of qualification for playoffs, it will be important for Lucknow Super Giants to play their best possible combination against Sunrisers Hyderabad. And De Kock definitely fits into the picture in that context.\n\n#3 The Arshin Kulkarni experiment should be put on hold for now\n\nLucknow Super Giants have tried out young batter Arshin Kulkarni as opener in the last couple of matches. The 19-year-old was dismissed for a golden duck on his IPL debut against Mumbai Indians at the Ekana Cricket Stadium, trapped lbw by pacer Nuwan Thushara.\n\nIn the match against Kolkata Knight Riders, he fell for nine to a brilliant catch to Ramandeep Singh off Mitchell Starc's bowling. It would seem a bit unfair on Arshin to drop the youngster after just two failures. For now, though, Lucknow Super Giants need to focus on the bigger picture, which is qualification for the Indian Premier League 2024 playoffs.\n\nLSG's batting came a cropper in the match against KKR as the entire team folded up for 137. They have been dependent on Marcus Stoinis to deliver the goods with the willow in recent matches. Lucknow thus need to strengthen their batting department heading into the key clash against SRH. A comeback for De Kock is more or less mandatory in that sense.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Sunrisers have lost three of their last four matches, mainly because their destructive batting line-up hasn't delivered.\n\nIn their last match against Mumbai Indians, which they lost by seven wickets, they failed to put up a good target on the board, which has been their strong suit this season.\n\nBarring Travis Head, who has been their stand out performer, the other batters in the side have faced a recent slump.\n\nAfter displaying his power-hitting ability, young opener Abhishek Sharma has breached the 30-run mark just once in the last four games.\n\nAnd while SRH head coach Daniel Vettori has conceded that the openers are not expected to do the job all the time, the middle order needs to step up.\n\nThe flamboyant Heinrich Klaasen has also been unable to strike the ball consistently and Nitish Reddy too has been patchy.\n\nThe bowlers have fared better compared to their batting counterparts.\n\nT Natarajan has been consistent with the ball while seasoned seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar also seems to have found his mojo after his incisive spell helped SRH eke out a one-run win against RR.\n\nLSG, on the other hand, have to get over their overall lacklustre display against Kolkata Knight Riders, when they not only conceded the first-ever 200 plus score at the Ekana Stadium but also folded their innings at 137.\n\nIt was a day when skipper KL Rahul failed to anchor the innings while the likes of Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran were unable to get the big shots when needed.\n\nAyush Badoni has had a subdued run in this IPL and the uncapped Indian player would be keen to shrug off the rustiness.\n\nLSG's struggles with the ball have been majorly due to the lack of firepower in their pace-bowling department.\n\nWith tearaway pacer Mayank Yadav ruled out of the IPL and left-arm pacer Mohsin Khan also picking up an injury, the onus will be on Afghan quick Naveen-ul-Haq, young Yash Thakur, Stoinis and spinners Krunal Pandya and Ravi Bishnoi to deliver.\n\nSquads:\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen , Aiden Markram, Abdul Samad, Nitish Reddy, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins , Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, T Natarajan, Mayank Markande, Umran Malik, Anmolpreet Singh, Glenn Phillips , Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar, Upendra Yadav , Jhathavedh Subramanyan, Sanvir Singh, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Marco Jansen, Akash Maharaj Singh, Mayank Agarwal.\n\nLucknow Super Giants: Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul , Deepak Hooda, Ayush Badoni, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran , Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohsin Khan, Shamar Joseph, Yash Thakur, Manimaran Siddharth, Prerak Mankad, Arshad Khan, Krishnappa Gowtham, Amit Mishra, Kyle Mayers, Ashton Turner, Matt Henry, Naveen-ul-Haq, Devdutt Padikkal, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Mayank Yadav, Arshin Kulkarni.\n\nMatch starts 7:30pm IST.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Their bowlers stifled LSG's batting, restricting them to 165.\n\nThe chase was even more clinical. Openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma unleashed a record-breaking Powerplay assault, hammering 107 runs in just six overs.\n\nHead finished unbeaten on a staggering 89 off 30 balls, while Sharma smashed a blazing 75 off 28 deliveries. This ruthless display secured a 10 wicket win for SRH in a mere 9.4 overs.\n\nThe victory propelled SRH to number 3 on the points table with a significant boost to their net run rate.\n\nTravis Head\n\nThe night belonged to Travis Head. In a display of sheer dominance, Head led SRH to a crushing victory over LSG, chasing down the target of 166 with a record-breaking performance.\n\nHead wasted no time in dismantling LSG's bowling attack. He picked boundaries at will, showcasing his exceptional ability to handle both pace and spin. His off-driven six off Ravi Bishnoi's back foot was a clear example of his audacious strokeplay.\n\nHead's relentless assault continued throughout the innings. He ended unbeaten on 89 off just 30 balls, peppering his knock with 8 fours and 8 sixes. It was a masterclass in power-hitting, with his fifty coming off a mere 16 balls -- the joint-fastest in IPL history and his fourth fifty within the Powerplay this season, a new IPL record!\n\nHead wasn't alone in this carnage. Partnering with Abhishek Sharma, the duo formed a destructive opening partnership. They took advantage of LSG's decision to start with spin, dismantling Krishnappa Gowtham in particular.\n\nThe left-handed pair put on a hundred between them inside the Powerplay, a feat they've achieved twice this IPL, setting the record for the highest Powerplay scores in all T20 cricket on both occasions.\n\nHead continued his dominance throughout the innings, ensuring there was no possibility of a comeback from LSG. His record-breaking Powerplay assault effectively sealed the victory for SRH in just 9.4 overs.\n\nAbhishek Sharma\n\nSRH's chase began cautiously, but Abhishek Sharma was the spark that ignited a firework display. He wasted no time in dismantling LSG's bowling, starting with a powerful cut off Yash Thakur in the second over.\n\nThis set the tone for his explosive 75 not out off just 28 balls, peppered with 8 fours and 6 sixes. His aggressive style was a masterclass in power-hitting.\n\nHe formed a destructive partnership with his fellow opener, Travis Head. This duo, known for stunning bowlers throughout the season, picked up right where they left off. They displayed an uncanny ability to find the boundary regardless of pace, length, or field placement.\n\nNearly half of the balls they faced (30 out of 58) found the ropes, showcasing their dominance.\n\nBoth Head and Sharma were in a zone, leaving LSG bowlers with no answers. Their ruthless display effectively dismantled any plans LSG might have had, putting the chase firmly in SRH's control.\n\nAyush Badoni\n\nAfter a sluggish start for LSG, the middle overs became the Ayush Badoni show. In the 14th over, he unleashed his fury on T Natarajan's left-arm pace, hammering three boundaries and a staggering 17 runs. This fearless display marked a turning point, injecting much-needed momentum into the innings.\n\nPartnering with Nicholas Pooran, Badoni didn't hold back. They combined for a quickfire 99-run stand, showcasing their aggressive intent from the very first ball. Any loose delivery was met with punishment, showcasing his ability to capitalise on opportunities.\n\nThe youngster displayed a wide array of strokes, including some cheeky cuts and sweeps, en route to his fastest IPL fifty -- a mere 28 balls.\n\nThis redemption knock was long overdue for Badoni. After a season of waiting for his breakout moment, he finally delivered, silencing doubters and repaying the faith shown by LSG.\n\nBadoni's aggressive knock peppered with 9 boundaries breathed life into the LSG innings, taking them from a precarious position to a respectable total. It was a testament to his talent and ability to accelerate under pressure, even on a challenging pitch where the ball stopped and timing shots proved difficult for other batsmen.\n\nBadoni proved that with the right approach and adaptability, scoring runs was possible.\n\nNicholas Pooran\n\nElecting to bat, LSG found themselves in a precarious position at 66/4 after 11.2 overs. However, Nicholas Pooran stepped up to the challenge, forming a crucial unbeaten partnership with Badoni that revived their innings.\n\nPooran showcased his aggressive batting style, peppering the boundaries with aplomb. He was on the verge of a well-deserved fifty, needing just 6 runs off the last ball. Unfortunately, a powerful shot towards the ropes was brilliantly stopped by Nitish Reddy, denying Pooran his milestone by a whisker. While replays suggested it might have cleared the boundary, the umpires' call stood.\n\nDespite the last-ball heartbreak, Pooran's blistering 48 off just 26 balls was instrumental in LSG reaching a respectable total of 165/4 on a sluggish pitch.\n\nHe, along with Badoni, displayed exceptional adaptability, looking like they were batting on a different surface compared to their struggling team-mates.\n\nWHICH BATTER GETS YOUR VOTE!", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [{"uri": "laxmi_negi@rediff.com", "name": "Laxmi Negi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bishnoi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnappa_Gowtham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krishnappa Gowtham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

While Head remained unbeaten on 89 off just 30 balls, Sharma played a 28-ball 75-run unbeaten knock to double the hammering on Super Giants. The duo smashed 16 boundaries and 14 maximums enroute to their blazing knocks.\n\nHere's the updated points table list after SRH vs LSG clash:\n\nTravis Head has made a notable gain in the Orange Cap holder list after the SRH vs LSG game. With 533 runs to his name, Head has taken the third place with Virat Kohli and Ruturaj Gaikwad occupying the first and the second.\n\nThe Purple Cap holder list sees no change after the 57th game of the Indian Premier League.

In response, the home team successfully chased down the target of 166 runs in 9.4 overs, courtesy of explosive batting from Head (89 off 30) and Abhishek (75 off 28), for a crucial victory and moving to No. 3 in the standings.\n\n\"I don't think anyone plays better spin than Travis. The shots he hit off K Gowtham, normally batters can't do that, that shows how special he is. He's very clear, whenever I talk to him, the way he compliments me, I have always been a big fan of him over the last year that I have followed him. When our understanding was established and our partnership improved, we became good friends off the pitch and have started spending more time,\" said Abhishek on Jio Cinema while speaking on his relationship with Head.\n\nAbhishek, who smashed eight boundaries and six maximums during his sensational knock against LSG, said his fearless approach was something \"he took on during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.\"\n\n\"I think this approach was something I took on during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. I feel when I play this way, look at the ball, and react, my shots come off better and the bowler comes under pressure. I always thought if I play in the IPL, I'll try to maintain this. Our support staff and Pat (Cummins), the way they think, I have never seen anyone else think like that. They're like, 'Go out there and express yourself. Play as aggressively as you can, we'll back you.' I think that matters a lot,\" he said.\n\nSharma also discussed how he tackled the LSG bowlers and said, \"They were bowling cutters in the middle. I thought the cutters could slow down on their way, but Travis and I had planned to play it the way you would hit a spinner with the spin. So, if it's an off-cutter, we look to hit towards long-off covers.

As the clash approaches, it could be interesting to see how LSG bounce back after their loss against KKR.\n\nAbhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (WK), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins (C), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markande, Jaydev Unadkat", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitish_Kumar_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nitish Kumar Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Samad_(Indian_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abdul Samad (Indian cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Ahmed_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shahbaz Ahmed (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Markande", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Markande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1715017933024_SRH-mp-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 251, "textEnd": 256}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Photograph: BCCI\n\nLucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul on Wednesday said they were completely outplayed by the incredible power-hitting of Sunrisers Hyderabad's openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, terming it \"unreal batting.\"\n\nHead and Sharma added another chapter to their remorseless domination over bowlers while carving lightning fast unbeaten fifties to power SRH to a convincing 10-wicket win over LSG in a crucial IPL match.\n\nScorecard\n\nChasing a modest 166, Head (89 not out, 30 balls, 8x4s, 8x6s) and Sharma (75 not out, 28 balls, 8x4s, 6x6s) toyed with LSG bowlers, finding boundaries and sixes at will to canter home in just 9.4 overs.\n\n\"I am at lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills.\n\n\"They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. It was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one,\" he said.\n\nThis was after SRH bowlers started brilliantly before Badoni (55 not out off 30 balls) and Pooran (48 not out off 25 balls) stitched crucial 95-runs off 55 balls for the unbeaten fifth-wicket stand to guide LSG to a competitive 165 for four on a sluggish pitch.\n\nRahul blamed the defeat on their poor display with the bat in powerplay, from which they scored just 27 runs for the loss of two wickets.\n\n\"Once you are on the losing side, there are question marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum.\n\n\"Ayush (Badoni) and Nicky (Nicholas Pooran) batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well,\" he admitted.\n\nSRH skipper Pat Cummins said that it was an \"unreal\" batting display from Head and Sharma.\n\n\"The boys (Head and Sharma) have had a fantastic season, but to win this with less than 10 overs played is unreal,\" he said.\n\n\"We just let them go, they are two guys who are very positive and I'm a bowler, it is tough for me to give them any inputs.\"\n\nCummins was effusive in his praise for both Head and Sharma.\n\n\"He's (Head) been like this for 2 years, he hits the tough areas, hits the middle a lot, might not be super conventional.\n\n\"(Abhishek) Just an incredible player of spin and pace.

They will play their last three home matches over the next 11 days, with the first one scheduled to be held tonight against the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).\n\nSRH and LSG will meet only once in IPL 2024, and the match will take place tonight. The two franchises are alive in the race to the playoffs. Both teams have 12 points from 11 matches and are separated only because of net run rate.\n\nThe Orange Army played their previous IPL 2024 match earlier this week, where the Mumbai Indians defeated them by seven wickets. SRH will aim to get back to the winning track tonight. They will have to make some changes to their tactics to defeat the Lucknow Super Giants.\n\nIn this listicle, we will look at the three changes which SRH should make for their next match against LSG in IPL 2024.\n\n#1 Rahul Tripathi in for Mayank Agarwal\n\nThe number three batting position has been a headache for the Sunrisers Hyderabad. The opening pair of Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head has done its job to perfection, but if the opposition breaks the opening stand early, the Hyderabad-based franchise have not had a solid number three batter who can stabilize the innings.\n\nHyderabad have two capped Indian batters in their squad, namely Rahul Tripathi and Mayank Agarwal. Both batters have had a forgettable season so far. Tripathi, who made his T20I debut for India last year, has got to play only two matches, where he has aggregated 31 runs.\n\nAgarwal made his return to the match squad for the last match against Mumbai Indians and returned with five runs from six balls. Perhaps, Hyderabad should give one more opportunity to Tripathi because he showed enormous intent in the previous seasons. If Tripathi gets going, he can solve the top-order problem for Hyderabad.\n\n#2 Glenn Phillips in for Marco Jansen\n\nIt is a bit difficult to understand why Sunrisers Hyderabad picked five pace-bowling options in their match squad for the last two matches. Pat Cummins, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan, and Nitish Kumar Reddy have been regular members of the team.\n\nPace-bowling all-rounder Marco Jansen got to play against Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians but proved to be quite expensive on both occasions. Since the team already has quality options in the pace attack, they can think of leaving Jansen out for Glenn Phillips, who can add more muscle to the batting. Plus, he is a better fielder than Jansen and is also a handy part-time spinner.\n\n#3 SRH should use the Impact Player wisely\n\nIn the last match against Mumbai Indians, Hyderabad surprisingly introduced Sanvir Singh as an Impact Player to strengthen the batting in the 18th over.

Despite of that a team is yet to confirm qualification and none of them has been knocked out of the playoff race. KKR and RR are at the top two position, closest to the playoffs, followed by SRH, CSK and LSG who are still fighting out for the next two spots. DC is making a resurgent run after a poor start and is still in the mix. GT, RCB, PBKS and MI are the four teams who are in the bottom four and will need a miracle to change fortunes. A lot of the fate of the IPL 2024 points table will depend on the SRH vs LSG match. What Happens if SRH vs LSG IPL 2024 Match Is Washed Out? Know About All Possible Scenarios That Can Take Place.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad will host Lucknow Super Giants at their home at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad. They have won six games till now and suffered five losses. Lucknow Super Giants have also won and lost same number of games but their loss in the last game against KKR has pushed them down the table with a poor net run rate. If SRH wins the game, they will take a big step towards playoff qualification. Not only this win will push them forward in the competition, it will also eliminate a possible playoff contender in LSG as they will be able to reach a maximum of 16 points and will have to carry the poor net run rate.\n\nIf LSG wins, then they will return to level playing fields. They will remain in the mix of four teams who can reach the 18-point mark and that will compensate for their very poor net run rate. Although, the SRH vs LSG game will have it's impact beyond the two teams. If SRH wins, MI will be the first team to get knocked out of the playoff race. They can reach a maximum of 12 points and if SRH move to 14 point with their win over LSG, they will be knocked out as LSG is yet to play DC who are both at 12-point mark. One of them will definitely reach beyond 12 in that game. Happy Birthday Pat Cummins! Sunrisers Hyderabad Extends Heartfelt Wishes to Their Captain As He Turns 31.\n\nPBKS, RCB and GT have lost 7 games each and yet have the opportunity to make it to the 14 points mark and wait for other results to go in their favour. But if SRH win against LSG, the PBKS vs RCB game at Mullanpur becomes a knockout as the loser will be eliminated from the playoff race, as that team will make it to 12-point mark as the maximum. Gujarat Titans are also in a similar situation but with fixtures in their favour, despite of SRH winning, they will have remain alive with the condition of winning all their next games.

Pursuing a target of 166, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma unleashed a relentless onslaught on the LSG bowlers, guiding their team to victory in a mere 9.4 overs. This remarkable feat not only secured the win but also etched its place in history as the fastest 150+ run chase ever recorded in T20 cricket.\n\nSRH dominated the powerplay, reaching an impressive 107/0, nearly quadrupling LSG's meager score of 27/2 in the first six overs. This stands as the lowest powerplay total for LSG in their brief IPL history. Despite initial perceptions of a sluggish pitch, Head and Abhishek dispelled any doubts with their aggressive batting display, showcasing their dominance regardless of the conditions.\n\nFollowing the match, LSG's skipper KL Rahul expressed his belief that early wickets in the powerplay could have potentially altered the course of the game, but lamented LSG's failure to capitalize in that crucial phase. He noted that while the pitch conditions remained relatively unchanged, the aggressive mindset and freedom exhibited by Head and Abhishek made it challenging to contain them. Rahul emphasized that when batters are in such form and rhythm, it becomes exceedingly difficult to halt their momentum.\n\n\"I think the pitch didn't change too much, but when you have two batters coming in with that kind of mindset and freedom, and they just tee off from ball one and everything's connecting, it's really hard to stop them. The only way to stop teams like that is to get wickets in the powerplay. Unfortunately, if you don't do that, you're in trouble. And that's what we experienced today,\" Rahul said during the post-match press conference.\n\nHowever, KL Rahul conceded that despite falling short by 40-50 runs in the first innings, the aggressive intent displayed by SRH suggested that even a target of 240 would have been achievable on the night, ultimately sealing LSG's fate.\n\n\"Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one. Once you are on the losing side, there are questions marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum. Ayush and Nicky batted well to get us to 166. But even if we would have got 240, they could have chased it as well,\" the 32-year-old added.\n\nAfter the game, SRH's captain Pat Cummins humorously suggested the possibility of changing the pitch midway through the clash, implying that perhaps Head and Abhishek had already done so. Notably, while LSG were batting, the pitch seemed sluggish, but it appeared to undergo a significant transformation during SRH's innings, presenting a different challenge altogether.", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

He along with his opening duo Abhishek Sharma stitched up 166 runs opening partnership and hammered 107 runs in the power play in comparison to LSG's 27.\n\n\"I don't think we could have ever expected chasing it like that,\" acknowledged Head at the post-match press conference. \"It looked like a tough wicket in the first innings, it looked like it was holding and a slow pitch. I guess, knowing that as a batter, you know that the powerplay is important. (We were) trying to maximise that and we played beautifully, we were able to get ahead of the rate, which is nice. And once we got going in the first two or three overs, it was just about trying to maximise that as much as we can and I felt we picked our targets and played very well,\" he said.\n\nSRH obliterated LSG's challenge by first stifling them with the new ball and then launching a sensational chase of 166 in just 9.4 overs, the highest 10-over score in any T20. In all T20 cricket, only seven times 100 or more been scored in the powerplay, SRH have the two top scores, both in IPL 2024.\n\n\"You always want to perform, you always want to be consistent, you always want to try and be doing the job; it's not going to always happen in T20 cricket (but) I felt the way we have been playing is great. We're going to have ups and downs, we've had that. Nice to be able to chase a score tonight after being put under pressure by them batting (first).\n\n\"A couple of times we've chased throughout the season, we've been put under pressure. To be able to do the job tonight, and chasing, (it feels great). Looking forward to the next two games being at home as well,\" said Head.\n\nHead and Abhishek have combined for three century stands in the IPL with two of the, coming in the powerplay. SRH is the only side with more than one century opening stand in the IPL 2024.\n\n\"It's nice to just come here and contribute. I wasn't sure if I was going to play. Nice to get a go, nice to be performing, and the partnership with Abhi has been fantastic. He's such an exciting talent for Indian cricket, he's exceptional. We complement each other well and he's very, very enjoyable to be around. He's so excited and thinks about the game, he's got loads of energy, so he's a great partnership to be involved in,\" Head said of the opening stand before he added that the middle order has also played a key role for SRH.\n\n\"I guess the Kings game (against Punjab Kings) is a blueprint for us in the way we're able to go about the game. It's not always going to work at the top of the order, we are going to lose wickets, but we want to be brave through the whole middle.

PTI\n\nThe remorseless domination of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, who carved lightning fast fifties, helped Sunrisers Hyderabad mount the fastest chase of a 160-plus target en route their convincing 10-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL match here today.\n\nChasing a modest target of 166, Head (89 not out, 30 balls, 8x4, 8x6) and Sharma (75 not out, 28 balls, 8x4, 6x6) toyed with LSG bowlers, finding boundaries and sixes at will to canter home in just 9.4 overs.\n\n\"Nice to get 360 and get to the parts of the ground I have not been to. Dan and Pat have asked me to play that way. We want to maximise the powerplay. It is not going to work every time but we want to go for it,\" said Head.\n\nThe win propelled SRH to the third position in the standings with 14 points from 12 games, while LSG are struggling at the sixth spot with 12 points from the same number of matches.\n\nThe result also meant that five-time champions Mumbai Indians, currently ninth with eight points from 12 matches, are out of the playoff race.\n\nThe dance of destruction by Head and Sharma even left the legendary Sachin Tendulkar gushing.\n\n\"A destructive opening partnership would be an understatement tonight. Had these boys batted first, they would've scored 300,\" Tendulkar posted online.\n\nThe Head and Sharma show came after SRH bowlers started brilliantly before losing the plot a bit.\n\nAyush Badoni (55 not out off 30 balls) and Nicholas Pooran (48 not out off 25 balls) stitched crucial 95 runs off 55 balls for the unbeaten fifth-wicket stand to guide LSG to 165/4. But Head and Sharma took any hint of competition out of the match once they bludgeoned 107 runs in the powerplay.\n\n\"Thanks to the management for the faith they've shown in me, the environment is clear for the batters so I went to enjoy myself. All the credit to Travis, the way he starts, first two or three balls goes to the boundaries. So I just react to the ball,\" Sharma said. -- PTI\n\nDC: 221/8 in 20 overs (Fraser-McGurk 50, Porel 65; Ashwin 3/24) vs RR: vs 201/8 in 20 overs (Samson 86; Kuldeep 2/25, Khaleel 2/47, Mukesh 2/30)", "source": {"uri": "tribuneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Table_Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Table Tennis", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2024/5/2024_5$largeimg_1088543896.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Head smashed an unbeaten 89 off just 30 balls to help SRH make a mockery of the 166-run target set by LSG. Head hit eight sixes and eight fours to rise to the third spot in the IPL 2024 Orange Cap tally.\n\nHead, who has 533 runs in 11 matches, is only eight runs and nine runs shy of Chennai Super Kings captain Ruturaj Gaikwad (541) and Orange Cap holder Virat Kohli (542). The Royal Challengers Bengaluru batter has an average of 67 and a strike rate of 148. Kohli already has four fifties and a hundred in the 17th edition of the tournament.\n\nRajasthan Royals skipper Sanju Samson has slid up to the fourth position in the most run-scorer's list. He had scored 86 off 46 balls in his last match against that, which took his total runs to 471 in 11 matches.

Riyan Parag is at No.6 with 436 runs. Narine's opening partner Phil Salt (429) is at No.7 and Sai Sudharsan (424) is at 8th.

Playing at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad, Head struck unbeaten 89 runs off a mere 30 deliveries laced with eight fours and sixes alike with a strike rate nearing 300.\n\nHead was adjudged the Player of the Match for his exploits. Abhishek Sharma (75* off 28 balls; 8 fours, 6 sixes) partnered with him for 167 runs which pummeled the LSG bowling attack in a record IPL chase. Both have turned out to be one of the most explosive pairings in the IPL this season as they made a mockery of the the 166-run target by overhauling it in just 9.4 overs. LSG had posted just 165/4 in 20 overs and the duo replied with the highest 10-over score in the history of men's T20 cricket.\n\nHowever, it may take a while for 23-year-old Sharma to make it to the Indian team but 30-year-old Head is a seasoned batter who has now been doing this for years. He has been named in Australia's squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup, for all the right reasons. He is in sublime form in the IPL 2024, having amassed 533 runs in 11 innings at a soaring strike rate of 201.89.\n\nSpeaking at the post-match press conference, Head said, \"Whenever you're playing you want to be as consistent as you can, you want to be getting runs. It's nice to be among the runs been nice to be playing well. That's not going to guarantee anything in the West Indies but it gives me the best chance to be in a very good mindset.\"\n\nThe southpaw went on to reveal how he preparing for the World Cup in the training sessions, drawing parallels to conditions in the Americas. \"Working hard on training and I think we face a fair bit of spin in the Caribbean and wickets might become tougher as the tournament goes.

This season is certainly a breakthrough for the young opener, Abhishek, who is not looking less by any means than his Aussie opening partner, Travis Head, for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH).\n\nOpening for SRH, the 23-year-old batter has been performing exceptionally in the ongoing IPL 2024, and his incredible partnerships with Head have played a key role in the Orange Army's dominance so far in the tournament. Abhishek has yet again stolen the show with his incredible hitting this season.\n\nThe Amritsar-born hard-hitter once again unleashed his attacking mode and played a blistering knock of unbeaten 75 runs off 28 balls laced with 8 fours and 6 sixes at an amazing strike rate of 267 to help SRH successfully chase down the 166 runs against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) inside 10 overs.\n\nIt was a run-fest at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium on May 8, as Travis Head also smoked 8 fours and 8 sixes during his match-winning knock of 89 runs off 30 balls against the LSG in the 57th match of the ongoing IPL 2024.\n\nAfter SRH's historic chase against LSG, former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra heaped praise on the Indian batting all-rounder for his power-hitting. Chopra has described Abhishek's performance in the ongoing IPL 2024 as a compelling story.\n\nComparing his hitting style with Travis Head's, Chopra said that the young opener's technique is cleaner, and his smooth backlift reminds him of legendary all-rounder Yuvraj Singh's batting.\n\nThe commentator also praised the SRH opener's well-executed downswing and called his batting classy, featuring traditional shots. He also mentioned Head and Abhishek's strike rate and said that the India all-rounder is not far behind the Australian star while highlighting his finesse and power-hitting ability.\n\nAakash Chopra said in a video uploaded on his YouTube Channel: \"Abhishek Sharma is a very good story. If I compare their (Abhishek and Head's) hitting styles, Abhishek's style seems cleaner to me. The backlift comes nicely, it reminds you slightly of Yuvraj Singh, and the downswing is very good. You see class in his batting.\n\nIt seems like Head is taking people's class, as though he is just beating them up, and it seems just like an extension of cricketing shots in his (Abhishek's) case.

On a sluggish surface, the visitors opted to bat first in the hope of making better use of the pitch with the ball in the second half.\n\nHowever, it was a poor start from the Lucknow Super Giants as they could only muster 27 runs during the powerplay overs. Skipper KL Rahul had a dismal outing with the bat as he scored 29 runs from 33 balls. The side seemed to be struggling having lost four wickets at just 66 runs after 11 overs. But a much-need partnership between Nicholas Pooran and Ayush Badoni took the side to a fighting total of 165 after their 20 overs.\n\nIn reply, Sunrisers Hyderabad openers reminded everyone what they are capable of as they smashed all the bowlers during the powerplay. They were able to notch up 107 runs inside six overs with both batters completing their fifty in no time. The openers were unstoppable today as they chased down the total inside 9.4 overs to boost their net run rate.\n\nLucknow Super Giants drafted Quinton de Kock back into the playing XI at the expense of youngster Arshin Kulkarni. However, the opener could not do much with the bat as he struggled to time the ball and play his shots. The Sunrisers Hyderabad bowlers were all over him as the South African batter scored just two runs today.\n\nAfter such a poor innings, the team management have a decision to make as they intend to make the play-offs. Kyle Mayers had a great campaign while opening last season for the franchise but has not yet played a game for the team this season. This might be the right time for the franchise to draft the West Indies batter in the playing XI.\n\nToday, Ayush Badoni was the only one who had a great performance with the bat as he notched up a well-deserved fifty. He came to bat at a crucial time with his side reeling after the loss of four wickets and the batter took the initiative to take the innings forward. His amazing performance with the bat helped the side reach a fighting total at least.\n\nThis performance might surely prompt the Lucknow Super Giants to promote the young batter in the batting order. They still don't have a fixed batting order and with only a couple of games remaining for them, the decision to promote Badoni might turn out to be significant for the franchise.\n\nIt was a surprise that Lucknow Super Giants and KL Rahul decided to start Krishnappa Gowtham today. There was no apparent reason given by the skipper for bringing in the bowling all-rounder into the team. However, that move did not pay off well for the franchise as he conceded 27 runs inside two overs and the opposition batters got the momentum for the chase during his spell.\n\nFollowing this poor outing, the team might look to bring back Manimaran Siddharth into the playing XI as the spinner had a remarkable time during the few games he started this season. He even scalped the prized wicket of Virat Kohli in one of the earlier games and has the ability to trouble the batter with the variations he possesses.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

But both teams will have one match fewer to earn a playoff spot compare to the rest in the race like Chennai Super Kings. So, let's see which team benefits from a complete wash out.\n\nWhich teams will benefit in IPL 2024 playoff race if SRH vs LSG is washed out?\n\nKolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals currently occupy the top two spots on the IPL 2024 points table, and are the best placed teams to qualify for the IPL 2024 playoffs, while the remaining two spots will be contested for by at least four teams.\n\nChennai Super Kings, currently placed in third, will be battling for the spot with SRH, LSG and Delhi Capitals with Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings in with an outside chance of finishing in the top four.\n\nIf tonight's match is completely washed out, both SRH and LSG will topple CSK to finish inside the top four for now with 13 points each. CSK, however, can soon get back in the playoff conversation with a win, displacing LSG.\n\nSo, the only team benefitting from a wash out could be SRH, who have a little better Net Run Rate (NRR) compared to LSG and DC. The wash out could also make it impossible for RCB and PBKS to make the playoffs.\n\nSRH, however, would want at least a 5-over per side match as they will be aiming for the top two spots rather than just finishing in the top four. LSG also will hope there is chance of a full contest to decide the winner in Hyderabad tonight.\n\n16 points may be the magic number to take one of the spots in the IPL 2024 playoffs. So, SRH and LSG would not like to be the teams ending up with 15 points at the end of the league stage due to a washed out match.", "source": {"uri": "mykhel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myKhel.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_hoover@mykhel.com", "name": "Mark Hoover", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.mykhel.com/img/2024/05/ipl-2024-srh-vs-lsg-rain-ft-1715138639.jpg?08052024091748", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 356, "textEnd": 361}], "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

On the final ball of the 20th over, SRH captain Pat Cummins bowled a high full toss outside off to Nicholas Pooran and the latter sliced it towards sweeper cover.\n\nWhile the ball was looking destined to go for a six, Nitish Reddy made a brilliant effort to stop it from landing on the other side of the boundary cushion. The SRH allrounder timed his jump to perfection and caught the ball as well while being airborne. And as he was falling on the boundary cushion, he released the ball before falling on the rope.\n\nHe, however, could not release the ball with force. As a result, the ball ended up touching the boundary cushion. The umpires gave it as a four and KL Rahul was not happy with the decision. The LSG skipper wanted a six as he seemingly believed that the ball fell directly on the boundary rope and not on the ground at first. He was seen having an argument with the umpire at the start of the SRH innings.\n\nTalking about the game, LSG finished their innings on 165 for 4 in 20 overs after Rahul won the toss and opted to bat first.

All thanks go to the Sunrisers Hyderabad openers - Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, who went all guns blazing after Lucknow Super Giants set a target of 166 runs. The duo took only 9.4 overs to complete the chase as the Hyderabad-based side registered a commanding 10-wicket win in the crucial home fixture. The SRH batting unit featuring big hitters like Head, Abhishek and Heinrich Klaasen has looked quite invincible in this IPL.\n\nAfter the match against Lucknow Super Giants was over, a content creator shared a hilarious video on Instagram, referring to Hyderabad's scintillating display of batting. Anil Lobo, a Dubai-based social media influencer, portrayed the character of a random cricket fan, who wanted to take a break during the interval between two innings. The decision was proven costly as Anil missed the majority of SRH's batting.\n\nThe video opens with Anil going to the washroom after the Lucknow Super Giants wrapped up their innings. As the target looked challenging on the Hyderabad wicket, Anil felt the hosts might not be able to win the match at least in 10 overs. Upon coming out of the washroom, Anil was left with a shock. He saw Abhishek Sharma smashing the final six to secure the victory for Sunriser Hyderabad.\n\nThe video caught the attention of many IPL fans, who found the concept quite relatable. Since being shared on Instagram, the post has garnered more than 3,75,000 views and over 25,000 likes. One of the viewers was quick to acknowledge, \"I felt the same yesterday.\" \"Same thing. I just had juice and came back when they had scored half of the target,\" commented a fan. A person said the batting of Sunrisers Hyderabad looked more like \"highlights.\"\n\nBoth Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma batted at a 250-plus strike rate against Lucknow Super Giants. The visitors had to struggle a lot to breach the 150-run mark in the first innings. The wicket, however, looked completely different during the chase.

Together, they hit 16 boundaries and 14 sixes. The innings set a new IPL record for a score inside 10 overs.\n\n\"That was a lot of fun,\" Head said in the post-match presentation.\n\n\"I was just concentrating on trying to get into good positions, watch the ball hard and react to it. Once I got a flow on in the first couple of overs and got ahead of the rate a little bit, it felt like it was a great opportunity in the powerplay to try and maximise that.\"\n\nHead shocked commentators when he belted spinner Ravi Bishnoi for six over cover off the back foot. He said it was something he had been working on in the nets in preparation for the World Cup.\n\n\"It's something I've been working on with spin, they came with off-spin again today, so something I've been working hard with and I feel like it's going to be a big part ... of the World Cup,\" Head said.\n\n\"It was nice to be able to go 360 (degrees) tonight and get it into some parts of the ground that I don't normally get it to.\"\n\nRenowned commentator and analyst Harsha Bhogle said Head batted like a \"big boss\" and put it to him that he doesn't know the meaning of the word fear.\n\n\"The last 12 months, being back in the Australian team, that's how they've wanted me to play. Having Dan (Vettori, Australia assistant coach and Sunrisers head coach) and Pat (Cummins), they've expressed they want me to go about it the same way.\n\n\"So for me it's not trying to change anything, and to maximise the powerplay. It's not going to work all the time, but as long as I can be consistent in giving myself the best opportunity, hopefully I can do the part for the team.\"\n\nThe innings saw him eclipse David Warner's decade-old record for most runs for Sunrisers in a debut season at the club.\n\nEven Lucknow captain KL Rahul was stunned.\n\n\"I'm lost for words. We've watched that batting on TV - but that was unreal. Everything was hitting the middle of the bat, kudos to their skill.\"\n\nHead reached his fifty from just 16 balls. Sharma followed not long after when he reached his 50 off only 19 balls as they raced to century-stand inside the batting power play.\n\nThe win lifted Hyderabad to third on the ladder with 14 points with two matches to play, both at home. It also gave their net run-rate a healthy lift. The huge defeat has pushed Lucknow into a tight corner for the playoffs with 12 points from 12 games.\n\nEarlier, Ayush Badoni (55) and Nicholas Pooran (48) propelled Lucknow to 4-165 with a 99-run unbeaten fifth-wicket stand after Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2-12) gave away just 12 singles and dismissed the big hitters -- Quinton de Kock (2) and Marcus Stoinis (3) -- inside the power play.\n\nHead and Sharma charged against pace and spin as Yash Thakur was smashed for 47 off his 16 balls while spinners Ravi Bishnoi and Krishnappa Gowtham gave away 63 runs off their four overs.\n\nLucknow had a moment to separate the destructive pair but Thakur couldn't hold onto a sharp one-handed catch of Sharma at short third-man when the batter was on 18 in the third over. Sharma had another escape after completing his half-century when leg-spinner Bishnoi dropped a hard two-handed return catch.\n\nEarlier, Kumar had buckled down Lucknow 27-2 in the first six overs on a tacky wicket and Rahul struggled to give the innings momentum before pulled skipper Pat Cummins to deep backward square leg and got dismissed for struggling 29 off 33 balls.\n\nPooran and Badoni countercharged in the death overs with Badoni playing some orthodox shots on square of the wicket as pace duo of Natarajan and Cummins conceded 34 runs off the final two overs.", "source": {"uri": "wwos.nine.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "wwos.nine.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bishnoi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting,\" KL Rahul, the captain of Lucknow Super Giants, told the broadcasters at the post-match presentations, summing up the second innings carnage at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad. In what turned out to be a completely one-sided contest in Hyderabad, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma's belligerent batting was on display yet again as they needed just 9.4 overs to chase down a target of 166.\n\nThe Super Giants posted what appeared to be a competitive total on a pitch that didn't look easy for the batters. But the SRH openers didn't even bring the pitch into the equation thanks to their ultra-aggressive approach, as a result of which several T20 records were broken again. They raced past 100 in the powerplay, becoming the first side to do so on two separate occasions, and the difference in the powerplay scores - 80 runs - told the story as SRH won with 62 deliveries to spare, the earliest a team has reached a 150-plus target in T20 cricket.\n\n\"I don't think we could have ever expected chasing it like that,\" acknowledged Head at the post-match press conference. \"It looked like a tough wicket in the first innings, it looked like it was holding and a slow pitch. I guess, knowing that as a batter, you know that the powerplay is important. (We were) trying to maximise that and we played beautifully, we were able to get ahead of the rate, which is nice. And once we got going in the first two or three overs, it was just about trying to maximise that as much as we can and I felt we picked our targets and played very well.\"\n\nAdam Voges, the consultant for LSG this season, admitted that the gulf in the powerplay between the two sides was a big factor in the outcome of the game, and praised the SRH openers for their \"incredible batting\".\n\n\"I think we're all in awe of what we've just seen. Sometimes you got to tip your hat and say well played to the opposition. (They) might have mis-hit one or two balls in the nine and bit overs that we bowled at them. Incredible batting, incredible hitting, clearly we didn't have an answer for,\" said Voges. \"I haven't spoken to the guys yet whether there was a difference in terms of the innings but clearly our powerplay compared to the Sunrisers was at the two extremes.\n\n\"What do you say, 2 for 20 odd as opposed to 100 for none, and that's the game in itself. We were put under immense pressure with the ball right from the start, we weren't able to apply the same pressure with the bat to begin with. I thought the backend of our innings was really good, [Ayush] Badoni and [Nicholas] Pooran partnership got us to...it was probably still an under par total but gave us a fighting chance at least. But that obviously was clearly not enough. We thought we at least had a total to be able to defend, We probably thought we still were a little bit short but clearly we could have got 250 and I don't think that would have been enough.\" Voges said.\n\nThe template that has worked well for SRH this season has been to bat first and post very big totals, and then find a way to restrict the opposition. But they also suffered a couple of big losses while chasing earlier in this competition. That they were able to get over the line in the chase against LSG, and do so by making a statement, has pleased Head.\n\n\"You always want to perform, you always want to be consistent, you always want to try and be doing the job; it's not going to always happen in T20 cricket (but) I felt the way we have been playing is great. We're going to have ups and downs, we've had that. Nice to be able to chase a score tonight after being put under pressure by them batting (first). A couple of times we've chased throughout the season, we've been put under pressure. To be able to do the job tonight, and chasing, (it feels great). Looking forward to the next two games being at home as well,\" said Head.\n\nHead and Abhishek have now been involved in three century stands in this IPL, making up a third of the 100-plus opening partnerships this season, and SRH are the only team to have more than one century opening stand in IPL 2024. All three century partnerships have resulted in victories for the team, emphasising the importance of the Head-Abhishek combination for SRH.\n\n\"It's nice to just come here and contribute. I wasn't sure if I was going to play. Nice to get a go, nice to be performing, and the partnership with Abhi has been fantastic. He's such an exciting talent for Indian cricket, he's exceptional. We complement each other well and he's very, very enjoyable to be around. He's so excited and thinks about the game, he's got loads of energy, so he's a great partnership to be involved in,\" Head said of the opening stand before he added that the middle order has also played a key role for SRH.\n\n\"I guess the Kings game (against Punjab Kings) is a blueprint for us in the way we're able to go about the game. It's not always going to work at the top of the order, we are going to lose wickets, but we want to be brave through the whole middle. Nitish [Reddy] has played some unbelievable innings, obviously we've got Klassy [Heinrich Klaasen] and [Abdul] Samad tops it off for us...Everyone is high on confidence, everyone is playing well, we're not dependent on the top order. Yes we are playing well but I don't think it defines the team. I feel like we've got a really strong middle order...we're very well rounded at the moment,\" insisted Head.", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cricbuzz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Voges", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adam Voges"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

The KL Rahul-led side ended up losing the game by 98 runs in their own backyard. After Kolkata Knight Riders piled up a huge total of 235 runs, LSG were bowled out for just 137 runs.\n\nThe defeat not only dropped them out of the top four in the points table but also ruined their net run rate. And to make sure that the players give their best against SRH, Lance Klusener decided to motivate them with an animated speech just before the start of the game.\n\nThe former South Africa allrounder stood in the middle of the team huddle and was seen giving a speech to the players in an animated fashion. The LSG players were clearly taken aback by Lance Klusener's speech and Marcus Stoinis could not hold his laughter. Lance Klusener was then seen slapping the Australian in a playful manner before continuing his speech.\n\nLance Klusener's speech, however, did not make much of a difference as SRH thrashed the Lucknow-based outfit by 10 wickets to move to the third spot in the points table. Batting first, LSG were reeling at 66 for 4 in the 12th over before Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran rescued them.\n\nThe duo shared an unbeaten 99-run stand to power their team to a competitive total. Badoni scored 55 while Pooran remained unbeaten on 48. In reply, SRH chased down the total inside 10 overs thanks to blazing half-centuries from their openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma.

Photographs: BCCI\n\nThe unwavering support from skipper Pat Cummins and the entire think-tank played a big role in his success in the on-going IPL, reckoned Sunrisers Hyderabad opener Abhishek Sharma.\n\nThe 23-year-old Punjab left-hander fired from all cylinders for Hyderabad this season, making 401 runs from 12 matches and those runs have come at an awesome strike-rate of 205.\n\n\"Our support staff and Pat (Cummins), the way they think, I have never seen anyone else think like that,\" Abhishek said on JioCinema Match Centre Live after their record 10-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants in Hyderabad on Wednesday.\n\n\"They're like, 'Go out there and express yourself. Play as aggressively as you can, we'll back you.' I think that matters a lot,\" said Abhishek, who has hit 35 sixes so far, highest by any batter this season.\n\nThe SRH openers Abhishek (75 not out off 28 balls) and Travis Head (89 not out off 30 balls) scaled down 166 in just 9.4 overs, rewriting the record for the quickest chase of 150-plus in T20 cricket.\n\nSRH's total of 167 was also the highest by any team by the end of the tenth over in men's T20s.\n\n\"I think this approach was something I took on during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy,\" said Abhishek who played a key role in Punjab winning the domestic T20 title last season.\n\nAbhishek (485 runs from 10 matches) was the second highest run-getter behind Riyan Parag (510) of Assam in last season's SMAT.\n\n\"I feel when I play this way, look at the ball, and react, my shots come off better and the bowler comes under pressure. I always thought if I play in the IPL, I'll try to maintain this,\" he added.\n\n'Big fan of Head'\n\nWith Head at his explosive best, SRH have smashed many batting records this season including the highest ever IPL total of 287/3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.\n\nAbhishek hailed the way Head played spin.\n\n\"I don't think anyone plays spin better than Travis. The shots he hit off (Krishnappa) Gowtham, normally batters can't do that, that shows how special he is.\n\n\"He's very clear, whenever I talk to him, the way he compliments me, I have always been a big fan of him over the last year that I have followed him.\n\n\"When our understanding was established and our partnership improved, we became good friends off the pitch and have started spending more time,\" he added.\n\nAbhishek then touched upon his strategy against the LSG bowlers, especially pacers.\n\n\"They were bowling cutters in the middle. I thought the cutters could slow down on their way, but Travis and I had planned to play it the way you would hit a spinner with the spin.\n\n\"So, if it's an off-cutter, we look to hit towards long-off covers. If it's a leg cutter, obviously we look at mid-wicket or mid-on,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JioCinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JioCinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed_Mushtaq_Ali_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyan_Parag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riyan Parag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://im.rediff.com/cricket/2024/may/09srh.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The winner of the duel will take a leap in the playoff race.\n\nThe Pat Cummins-led side has ample talent but has been unable to hold on to a winning run recently. Sunrisers have lost three of their last four matches, mainly because their destructive batting line-up hasn't delivered. In their last match against Mumbai Indians, which they lost by seven wickets, they failed to put up a good target on the board, which has been their strong suit this season.\n\nBarring Travis Head, who has been their stand out performer, the other batters in the side have faced a recent slump. After displaying his power-hitting ability, young opener Abhishek Sharma has breached the 30-run mark just once in the last four games.\n\nAnd while SRH head coach Daniel Vettori has conceded that the openers are not expected to do the job all the time, the middle order needs to step up. The flamboyant Heinrich Klaasen has also been unable to strike the ball consistently and Nitish Reddy too has been patchy.\n\nThe bowlers have fared better compared to their batting counterparts. T Natarajan has been consistent with the ball while seasoned seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar also seems to have found his mojo after his incisive spell helped SRH eke out a one-run win against RR.\n\nLSG, on the other hand, have to get over their overall lacklustre display against Kolkata Knight Riders, when they not only conceded the first-ever 200 plus score at the Ekana Stadium but also folded their innings at 137. It was a day when skipper KL Rahul failed to anchor the innings while the likes of Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran were unable to get the big shots when needed.\n\nAyush Badoni has had a subdued run in this IPL and the uncapped Indian player would be keen to shrug off the rustiness. LSG's struggles with the ball have been majorly due to the lack of firepower in their pace-bowling department.\n\nWith tearaway pacer Mayank Yadav ruled out of the IPL and left-arm pacer Mohsin Khan also picking up an injury, the onus will be on Afghan quick Naveen-ul-Haq, young Yash Thakur, Stoinis and spinners Krunal Pandya and Ravi Bishnoi to deliver.\n\nSquads:\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen (wicket-keeper), Aiden Markram, Abdul Samad, Nitish Reddy, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins (captain), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, T Natarajan, Mayank Markande, Umran Malik, Anmolpreet Singh, Glenn Phillips (wicket-keeper), Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar, Upendra Yadav (wicket-keeper), Jhathavedh Subramanyan, Sanvir Singh, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Marco Jansen, Akash Maharaj Singh, Mayank Agarwal.\n\nLucknow Super Giants: Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul (captain & wicket-keeper), Deepak Hooda, Ayush Badoni, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran (wicket-keeper), Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohsin Khan, Shamar Joseph, Yash Thakur, Manimaran Siddharth, Prerak Mankad, Arshad Khan, Krishnappa Gowtham, Amit Mishra, Kyle Mayers, Ashton Turner, Matt Henry, Naveen-ul-Haq, Devdutt Padikkal, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Mayank Yadav, Arshin Kulkarni.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

They were 57/3 when KL Rahul (29 off 33 balls) holed out in fine leg off Pat Cummins' bowling in the last ball of the 10th over. Around that time, Hayden \"called out\" the lack of intent among LSG batters.\n\n\"I have to call them out. This is not a 5 runs per over wicket. Somebody needed to show intent. They had one of the slowest powerplays. That took the innings nowhere. When the opposition team has Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen, your intention should be to go at 10s and over. 160-170 will never be enough,\" Hayden said in commentary.\n\nInterestingly, the way LSG batters batted made many believe that the pitch was not good for strokeplay. Even LSG head coach Justin Langer said that 160 would be a good total. But as it turned out, it was nowhere near being enough.\n\nTravis Head and Abhishek Sharma chased it down in record quick time. The dynamic SRH opening pair scored 166 runs in 9.4 overs - the most by any team inside 10 overs in the history of IPL. Head hit eight fours and as many sixes to remain undefeated at 89 off just 30 balls. His uncapped Indian was not too far behind. Abhishek blasted 75* off 28 balls, hitting eight fours and six sixes.\n\nThe win propelled SRH to the third position in the standings with 14 points from 12 games, while LSG are struggling at the sixth spot with 12 points from the same number of matches.\n\nThe result also meant that five-time champions Mumbai Indians, currently ninth with eight points from 12 matches, are out of the playoff race.\n\nThis was LSG's second big loss on the trot. While they still have a decent chance of making it to the playoffs if they win their next two league games, former RCB coach Mike Hesson, said their campaign is more or less done. Hesson said injuries to Mayank Yadav and Mohsin Khan have rendered their bowling attack weak.\n\n\"I think yes,\" Hesson said on Jio Cinema when asked whether LSG' campaign has ended in this year's IPL. \"With Mayank Yadav missing, they don't really have that X-factor in their bowling. Even Mohsin Khan didn't play today. Ravo Bishnoi hasn't been at his best this IPL. So their bowling attack doesn't look threatening.

It was the highest ever 10 over score in history of men's T20 cricket.\n\nBoth the southpaws hit fours and sixes for fun in what was a sensational display of power-hitting.\n\n\"The partnership with Abhi has been fantastic, he's such an exciting talent for Indian cricket.\n\n\"We complement each other so well and he's very very enjoyable to be around, he's so excited and thinks about the game and yeah he's got a lot of energy so it's a great partnership to be involved in,\" said Head in the post-match press conference on Wednesday.\n\nHead is in top form ahead of the T20 World Cup in the Americas next month, having aggregated 533 runs in 11 innings at an astonishing strike rate of 201.89. Sharma too has been striking at over 200.\n\n\"Whenever you're playing you want to be as consistent as you can, you want to be getting runs. It's nice to be among the runs been nice to be playing well. That's not going to guarantee anything in the West Indies but it gives me the best chance to be in a very good mindset,\" said Head.\n\n\"Working hard on training and I think we face a fair bit of spin in the Caribbean and wickets might become tougher as the tournament goes. So very pleased with how I played spin tonight, things that I'm working on in training are somewhat working in the moment,\" he added.\n\nSharma had also earned high praise from West Indies legend Brian Lara, who is a former coach of SRH.\n\n\"Again he is someone who I met while I was batting coach of SRH. I spent two years there. I am allowed to a bit biased when I see a left-hander, I just love a left-hander.\n\nIPL 2024\n\n\"Myself and Abhishek have developed a very good relationship, these youngsters are very humble. they want to learn,\" Lara had said.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lara", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Lara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://im.rediff.com/cricket/2024/may/09head-abhishek.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

The winner will move to number three and keep qualification to the playoffs in their control. The loser would slip/remain out of the top four and would get heavily reliant on other teams' failures to move to the next round.\n\nAlthough both teams have relied heavily on their batting line-ups to win most of their games, this one, on one of the flattest tracks in the tournament, could be decided by which team bowls better. Below, we have predicted three bowlers who can take the most wickets and put up match-winning shows for their teams:\n\n3 bowlers who could pick up the most wickets in today's SRH vs LSG match\n\n#3 Naveen-ul-Haq\n\nDespite his struggles in the last game, Naveen-ul-Haq has been one of LSG's best bowlers in IPL 2024 with 10 wickets from seven games at an average of 23.40.\n\nAs LSG have found success with their Indian bowling contingent, Naveen has quietly picked up at least one wicket in six of these games. He doesn't have express pace, swing, or seam movement but is one of the most street-smart bowlers with a bag of tricks that keeps the batters guessing.\n\nThat's exactly what he used against Kolkata Knight Riders' biggest hitters Phil Salt, Andre Russell, and Rinku Singh in LSG's previous match. On Wednesday, he'll have the responsibility to get the wickets of Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, or both in the early stages, while also contributing in the middle and death overs. Thanks to his form, he'd have a good chance of coming on top.\n\n#2 Pat Cummins\n\nOn flat tracks, it's hard to overlook Pat Cummins for bowling predictions. The SRH captain is a master of meticulous planning and execution, bowls important overs, and picks important wickets even if other bowlers are struggling. He has shown that by picking six wickets from four games in Uppal in IPL 2024.\n\nFor a team struggling with its batting positioning, lacking in confidence, and relying on a couple of players to get them through, Cummis is the most difficult nemesis to face. He'll take the most difficult overs in the innings but they'll also be the ones who could get him the most wickets, depending on the match situation.\n\nKL Rahul has got out to him once in IPL while other LSG batters haven't faced the new version of him.\n\n#1 Bhuvneshwar Kumar\n\nAfter struggling for wickets in the first half of the season, Bhuvneshwar Kumar has roared back to form with five wickets in the last three games.\n\nHis best spell of the season came in Uppal against Rajasthan Royals -- a brilliant, Player-of-the-Match worthy 3/41. Against LSG, who have similar problems against swing, Kumar would have his tails up in the powerplay, also because he has a good IPL record against Rahul, Quinton de Kock, Marcus Stoinis, and Nicholas Pooran.\n\nHe'll also be happy to bowl two overs at the death to expose LSG's shallow batting order.

The 23-year-old praised skipper Pat Cummins and the think-tank for their encouragement, which enabled him to express himself and play aggressively. Abhishek's 401 runs with a strike rate of 205 make him the highest six-hitter in the tournament so far. SRH's record-breaking 10-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants showcased the openers' explosive power, with Abhishek and Travis Head chasing down the target in just 9.4 overs. Abhishek attributed his approach to the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, where he played a crucial role in Punjab's victory. He expressed admiration for Head's spin-playing skills, saying he's \"a big fan\" and that their understanding and friendship have contributed to their success. Abhishek also revealed their strategy against LSG's pacers, using their spins to hit long shots.\n\nThe unwavering support from skipper Pat Cummins and the entire think-tank played a big role in his success in the on-going IPL, reckoned Sunrisers Hyderabad opener Abhishek Sharma. The 23-year-old Punjab left-hander fired from all cylinders for Hyderabad this season, making 401 runs from 12 matches and those runs have come at an awesome strike-rate of 205. ''Our support staff and Pat (Cummins), the way they think, I have never seen anyone else think like that,'' Abhishek said on JioCinema Match Centre Live after their record 10-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants here on Wednesday.\n\n''They're like, 'Go out there and express yourself. Play as aggressively as you can, we'll back you.' I think that matters a lot,'' said Abhishek, who has hit 35 sixes so far, highest by any batter this season. The SRH openers Abhishek (75 not out off 28 balls) and Travis Head (89 not out off 30 balls) scaled down 166 in just 9.4 overs, rewriting the record for the quickest chase of 150-plus in T20 cricket.\n\nSRH's total of 167 was also the highest by any team by the end of the tenth over in men's T20s.\n\n''I think this approach was something I took on during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy,'' said Abhishek who played a key role in Punjab winning the domestic T20 title last season.\n\nAbhishek (485 runs from 10 matches) was the second highest run-getter behind Riyan Parag (510) of Assam in last season's SMAT.\n\n''I feel when I play this way, look at the ball, and react, my shots come off better and the bowler comes under pressure. I always thought if I play in the IPL, I'll try to maintain this,'' he added. 'Big fan of Head' =========== With Head at his explosive best, SRH have smashed many batting records this season including the highest ever IPL total of 287/3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.\n\nAbhishek hailed the way Head played spin.\n\n''I don't think anyone plays spin better than Travis. The shots he hit off (Krishnappa) Gowtham, normally batters can't do that, that shows how special he is. ''He's very clear, whenever I talk to him, the way he compliments me, I have always been a big fan of him over the last year that I have followed him.\n\n''When our understanding was established and our partnership improved, we became good friends off the pitch and have started spending more time,'' he added.\n\nAbhishek then touched upon his strategy against the LSG bowlers, especially pacers. ''They were bowling cutters in the middle. I thought the cutters could slow down on their way, but Travis and I had planned to play it the way you would hit a spinner with the spin.\n\n''So, if it's an off-cutter, we look to hit towards long-off covers. If it's a leg cutter, obviously we look at mid-wicket or mid-on,'' he added.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed_Mushtaq_Ali_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyan_Parag", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riyan Parag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/AdminFiles/UserFiles/22_11_2018_14_00_28_6024474.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

There's going to be very little help for the spinners,\" Graeme Swann and Sunil Gavaskar said ahead of the SRH vs RR match - the last game at the venue.\n\n\"The quicker bowlers, because it's a harder pitch, might be able to get a little more carry but this is a pitch where you can expect a lot of runs. What we have seen from the Hyderabad team is they have taken the initiative just about every time from the first ball. If they get going, this is their home pitch, if they bat first, you can be pretty certain that you'll get a score of 250 unless Rajasthan Royals pull out some magic tricks. This is a fresh pitch, never been used before,\" they added.\n\nIn the match, SRH opted to bat first and scored 201/3. All the three wickets were picked by RR pacers. In reply, RR lost by a run after losing seven wickets. All the seven wickets were taken by the SRH pacers.\n\nThe average score at the venue in last five T20s is 207.

Moody reckoned that Abhishek's career has raced up with the SunRisers in this season of the cash-rich league. Abhishek's scintillating knock of 75 runs was crucial in SRH thumping LSG by 10 wickets at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad on May 8, Wednesday. SRH uplifted themselves to the 3rd position in the points table with an emphatic win as they look to solidify their places in the top 4 with the race to the playoffs intensifying.\n\nMoody, while speaking to Star Sports, mentioned that it has been in SRH's DNA to trump the opposition this way. He was also happy with the rise of Abhishek as a player and how he has flourished while partnering with Travis Head.\n\nIPL 2024 Full Coverage | IPL 2024 Points Table and Standings | 2024 IPL Full Schedule\n\n\"It's part of their DNA. Abhishek Sharma, is a young emerging Indian player and an incredibly exciting player to have worked alongside Travis Head, who is at top of his game, be it international cricket or IPL in all formats. His career has been fast-tracked at million miles an hour,\" Moody said.\n\nHead and Abhishek shared their 3rd 100-plus opening stand of the season as they have been key contributors to SRH's success in the season so far. The duo latched onto the LSG bowlers as they plundered 167 runs within 9.4 overs. This was the highest total in the first ten overs of IPL after 10 overs.\n\nABHISHEK'S RISE WITH SRH\n\nMoody hailed Abhishek for continuing his good domestic form into IPL as well. He called Abhishek as a 'natural striker of the ball' and was happy with his progress with SRH so far. The all-rounder was roped in by SRH in 2019 and Abhishek finally repaid the years of trust showcased in him by the franchise.\n\n\"He is coming into this IPL with incredibly good domestic season. A successful one with Punjab so he is coming in-form. He has experienced IPL cricket for a number of years now he is a young emerging player.\"\n\n\"He is embracing IPL cricket, he is embracing the partnership he got with Travis Head. He is embracing the way the management has set the tone with how they wanna play. So, he is complimenting his game. He is a natural ball-striker, he is not doing anything extra-ordinary. He likes to hit sixes, he has always hits sixes. This brand of cricket is suiting him,\" Moody added.\n\nAbhishek was striking at 267.86 as he smacked 75 runs off just 28 balls. The SRH opener was dealing in boundaries as he slammed 8 boundaries and 6 sixes.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Moody", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Moody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Sports (Indian TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/abhishek-sharma-and-travis-head-085120347-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=hJFMy9qGxyCiNJE1TtVFYt7OBl6vNGtL", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 527, "textEnd": 532}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

However, he and his opening partner Quinton de Kock could not give their team a good start as the latter had to return to the pavilion for just 2 runs thanks to a stunning grab from Nitish Reddy near the deep backward square leg boundary in the third over.\n\nIn the fifth over, Sanvir Singh came up with a brilliant effort to send back the in-form Marcus Stoinis for just 3 and put his team in the driver's seat. On the second ball of the over, Bhuvneshwar Kumar bowled a short ball and Stoinis went for a pull.\n\nThe Australian allrounder, however, could not make a good connection although it looked like the ball would land safely between the fielders at mid-on and mid-wicket. However, Sanvir Singh ran across and dived in front to get his fingers underneath the ball at the last moment to complete a brilliant catch.\n\nBoth SRH and LSG will be desperate to win the ongoing game to bolster their chances of making it to the playoffs. While a defeat will definitely not put them out of the playoffs race, a win will definitely put them in the driver's seat.\n\nBoth the teams have six wins and five losses so far and a win will take the winner to the third spot in the points table with two games remaining. SRH are currently at the fourth spot while LSG are at the sixth spot. While both the teams have the same number of points, they are currently separated by net run rate.\n\nLSG as well as SRH suffered heavy defeats in their last games. SRH suffered a seven-wicket defeat against Mumbai Indians, with the five-time champions chasing down 174 runs inside 18 overs by losing three wickets.

Both teams are locked in at 12 points from 11 games with SRH making the top four cut based on a slightly superior net run rate of -0.065 compared to LSG's -0.371.\n\nThe Sunrisers find themselves in a fierce competition for the top four spot with Kolkata Knight Riders (16), Rajasthan Royals (16) and Chennai Super Kings (12) stationed above them on the points table. The winner of the duel will take a leap in the playoff race. The Pat Cummins-led side has ample talent but has been unable to hold on to a winning run recently. Sunrisers have lost three of their last four matches, mainly because their destructive batting line-up hasn't delivered.\n\nIn their last match against Mumbai Indians, which they lost by seven wickets, they failed to put up a good target on the board, which has been their strong suit this season. Barring Travis Head, who has been their stand out performer, the other batters in the side have faced a recent slump.\n\nAfter displaying his power-hitting ability, young opener Abhishek Sharma has breached the 30-run mark just once in the last four games. And while SRH head coach Daniel Vettori has conceded that the openers are not expected to do the job all the time, the middle order needs to step up. The flamboyant Heinrich Klaasen has also been unable to strike the ball consistently and Nitish Reddy too has been patchy. The bowlers have fared better compared to their batting counterparts.\n\nT Natarajan has been consistent with the ball while seasoned seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar also seems to have found his mojo after his incisive spell helped SRH eke out a one-run win against RR.\n\nLSG, on the other hand, have to get over their overall lacklustre display against Kolkata Knight Riders, when they not only conceded the first-ever 200 plus score at the Ekana Stadium but also folded their innings at 137. It was a day when skipper KL Rahul failed to anchor the innings while the likes of Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran were unable to get the big shots when needed.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Aiden Markram, Abdul Samad, Nitish Reddy, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, T Natarajan, Mayank Markande, Umran Malik, Anmolpreet Singh, Glenn Phillips (wk), Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar, Upendra Yadav (wk), Jhathavedh Subramanyan, Sanvir Singh, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Marco Jansen, Akash Maharaj Singh, Mayank Agarwal.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hans_india@thehansindia.com", "name": "Hans India", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Vettori", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Vettori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fazalhaq_Farooqi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fazalhaq Farooqi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umran_Malik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umran Malik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

With their trademark powerful batting performances, SRH replicated their earlier success by chasing down the target of 166 runs in just 9.4 overs, leaving KL Rahul's team struggling to keep pace.\n\nThe backbone of SRH's victory was none other than their dynamic opening pair, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, whose fearless approach to the game guided their team to victory without conceding a single wicket. Their exceptional performance garnered widespread praise, with cricket experts and fans alike hailing their partnership as \"destructive,\" with even Indian batting legend Sachin Tendulkar expressing his admiration on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).\n\nThe sheer magnitude of SRH's triumph left spectators in awe, as they marveled at the brilliance of Head and Sharma's partnership. However, the aftermath of the match saw a heated discussion between LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka and skipper KL Rahul, a moment captured by cameras and shared online, sparking controversy. Experts on Jio Cinema chimed in, suggesting that such discussions should remain private to avoid unnecessary distractions for the team.\n\nWith this crucial win, SRH surged to the third position on the points table, accumulating a total of 14 points and displacing Chennai Super Kings to fourth place with 12 points. Additionally, this victory marked the end of the road for five-time champions Mumbai Indians, who faced elimination from the tournament after suffering eight losses out of 12 matches, leaving them with a maximum attainable points tally of 12.\n\nAs the IPL 2024 season progresses, SRH's dominant performance serves as a testament to their formidable presence in the tournament, instilling fear in their opponents and bringing joy to their fans. With their explosive batting lineup and unwavering determination, SRH remains a force to be reckoned with as they strive for championship glory.\n\nSEE ALSO: Sunrisers Hyderabad's Record-Breaking 166 Chase Shakes LSG; KL Rahul Says 'Am At Loss For Words'", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JioCinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JioCinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Goenka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Goenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

The SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH) opening pair smashed the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) bowlers all around the park in their IPL 2024 clash in Hyderabad on Wednesday, May 8.\n\nLSG set SRH a 166-run target after opting to bat first. Head and Abhishek then stitched together an unbroken 167-run partnership in just 9.4 overs to help the hosts register a comprehensive win and climb to the third position on the points table.\n\nReviewing the game on Star Sports, Kaif pointed out that the Australian mindset has been instilled in the SRH lineup and that Head and Abhishek's batting approach threatens the bowlers' careers.\n\n\"Pat Cummins - Aussie captain, Travis Head - player from Australia. So this is the Aussie intent. I remember the 2003 World Cup final - Australia against India. The conditions were overcast. We won the toss and (Sourav) Ganguly said we would win the match as the ball would swing. Australia made 360,\" he said.\n\n\"This has not happened for the first time. We have seen in this entire IPL that bowlers are unable to stop these two batters. This is career-ending batting, that the bowler is dropped from the next match, they are batting like that,\" Kaif added.\n\nHead clubbed eight fours and as many sixes in his unbeaten 30-ball 89. Abhishek's unbeaten 75 off 28 deliveries was studded with eight fours and six maximums.\n\n\"This wasn't slogging but top-class batting\" - Mohammad Kaif on Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma's partnership\n\nMohammad Kaif noted that Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma's approach was in sharp contrast to the Lucknow Super Giants' top-order batters.\n\n\"The intent we should have seen from Lucknow in a big match was totally missing. They scored 27 runs in six overs and SRH reached 100 in six overs. This wasn't slogging but top-class batting. It's just watch the ball and hit the ball. They moved the right leg away and played shots off good balls,\" he observed.\n\nThe former India batter warned the Gujarat Titans and the Punjab Kings, who will be the SunRisers Hyderabad's opponents in their last two league games at home.\n\n\"I believe there was another test in today's game. Hyderabad showed that they can play like this when a do-or-die game comes. Winning the match by 10 wickets is a statement to the other teams who will come to play here. Gujarat will come to play the next match at this ground. Come with a plan,\" Kaif stated.\n\nSRH's crushing win against LSG helped them boost their net run rate to 0.406. A win in either of their two remaining league games will likely be enough to guarantee them a playoff berth.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kartik_iyer@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Kartik Iyer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Kaif", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Kaif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Sports (Indian TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/ec7a3-17152311813807-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 278, "textEnd": 283}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

We complement each other so well.\"\n\nAbhishek joined the charge as he got to his fifty in 19 balls after the pair took Hyderabad to 107 in the first six overs of powerplay, when only two fielders are allowed outside the inner circle.\n\nHyderabad, who won the IPL in 2016 under David Warner, registered their seventh win in 12 matches to hand a perfect gift to birthday boy and captain Pat Cummins, who turned 31 on Wednesday.\n\nAbhishek hit the winning six as Hyderabad moved to third in the 10-team table with 14 points. Lucknow stay sixth after the bruising loss.\n\nTop four teams will make the play-offs with the final on May 26 in Chennai.\n\nMORE COVERAGE\n\nLyon's teary Ashes heartbreak laid bare in new, confronting dressing room vision\n\nBatter up: Snubbed Smith's plan to return a week after World Cup final alongside ex-teammates\n\nAussie prodigy opens up on World Cup snub ... and reveals legend's advice that 'stuck' with him\n\nAussie skipper's injury recovery 'slower than expected' ahead of T20 World Cup\n\nCounty Wrap: Forgotten Aussie Test star's Lord's century; Lyon's winless team crumbles\n\nCummins said Head's unconventional hitting does not \"surprise\" him anymore and praised Abhishek for being \"an incredible player of spin\" and pace.\n\nSeam bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar set up victory with impressive bowling figures of 2-12 in his four overs to restrict Lucknow to 165-4 after they elected to bat first.\n\nLucknow lost regular wickets (including Marcus Stoinis for just three) until Nicholas Pooran, who hit 48, and Ayush Badoni, who smashed 55, put on an unbeaten stand of 99 in 52 balls to boost the team total.\n\nBut the score proved too little against a team which posted record totals of 277 and 287 in this high-scoring edition of the T20 tournament.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

Goenka seemed upset about the team's annihilating loss and had an animated chat with Rahul. LSG suffered a thumping defeat by 10 wickets as they lost their 2nd game on the trot amid an intensifying race to the playoffs.\n\nGoenka had come to watch the encounter and show his support to the team. However, the team did let him down with their overall performance. After the match, Rahul seemed speechless while interacting with Goenka, who wasn't happy with the team's performance. The LSG skipper, known for his calm demeanour, quietly listened to the team's owner.\n\nThe experts on Jio Cinema seemed upset with Goenka's gesture, as Graeme Smith mentioned that such conversations should happen behind closed doors. Meanwhile, Scott Styris came out in Rahul's support and said that he had done enough to keep his cool in this situation.

In a surprising move, he named Steve Smith as the captain of the franchise in 2017 after the team had failed to qualify for the playoffs in the 2016 season.\n\nLSG had a forgettable outing against SRH as they were swept away by the storm of Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head. Batting first, LSG could not justify their toss decision as the team scored their lowest powerplay total of the season, just 27 runs for the loss of 2 wickets. Rahul's strike rate and approach yet again came under the scanner as he departed after scoring just 29 runs from 33 balls.

The Lucknow-based franchise are coming into this match after conceding a 98-run loss against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). Currently, LSG are holding the sixth place on the standings with 12 points.\n\nWhile the Sunrisers were in great form at the start of the tournament, however, they conceded three losses in their previous five matches. In their previous game, Pat Cummins-led SRH suffered a 7-wicket defeat against Mumbai Indians. They are standing in fourth place on the table with 12 points. While speaking at the toss, Cummins accepted that it would be tough to qualify for the playoffs of the tournament. He also confirmed that Vijayakanth Viyaskanth replaced Marco Jansen in the playing eleven.\n\n\"We would have batted as well. But we have won both ways here and hence not too upset. Hard to know (a good score) as it has been pretty high scoring. It is pretty tough (to qualify for the playoffs) and you have to keep winning till the end, we have not nailed it in the last couple of games and it is time to change that. We have a couple of changes - Sanvir comes in for Agarwal and Viyaskanth makes his debut and replaces Marco,\" Cummins said. While KL Rahul said they have made a few changes in the playing eleven. He confirmed Proteas batter Quinton de kock came back in the playing squad in place of Mohsin Khan.\n\n\"We will bat first. That (the pitch) plus a couple of games that have been played here. It is hard to complete forget how important this game is for both the sides, but we have played enough cricket. We will focus one thing at a time, first bat well and put the runs on the board. Playing at home becomes a difference, but we play so much cricket that we know how the conditions will be. Quinton comes in, Mohsin misses out and there are a few other changes,\" Rahul said. Lucknow Super Giants (Playing XI): Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul (Wk/C), Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Deepak Hooda, Krunal Pandya, Krishnappa Gowtham, Yash Thakur, Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-Haq.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Travis Head, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (Wk), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Sanvir Singh, Pat Cummins (C), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, T Natarajan.

The home team successfully chased down the target of 166 runs in 9.4 overs for a crucial victory and moved to No. 3 in the standings. Abhishek Sharma (75* runs) spoke exclusively to JioCinema on Match Centre Live about his relationship with Travis Head, his approach while batting, and how he tackled the LSG bowlers.\n\n\"I don't think anyone plays better spin than Travis. The shots he hit off K Gowtham, normally batters can't do that, that shows how special he is. He's very clear, whenever I talk to him, the way he compliments me, I have always been a big fan of him over the last year that I have followed him. When our understanding was established and our partnership improved, we became good friends off the pitch and have started spending more time.\"\n\nOn his fearless approach, Sharma said - \"I think this approach was something I took on during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. I feel when I play this way, look at the ball, and react, my shots come off better and the bowler comes under pressure. I always thought if I play in the IPL, I'll try to maintain this. Our support staff and Pat (Cummins), the way they think, I have never seen anyone else think like that. They're like, 'Go out there and express yourself. Play as aggressively as you can, we'll back you.' I think that matters a lot.\"\n\nSharma also discussed how he tackled the LSG bowlers - \"They were bowling cutters in the middle. I thought the cutters could slow down on their way, but Travis and I had planned to play it the way you would hit a spinner with the spin. So, if it's an off-cutter, we look to hit towards long-off covers. If it's a leg cutter, obviously we look at mid-wicket or mid-on.\"", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JioCinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JioCinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnappa_Gowtham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krishnappa Gowtham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed_Mushtaq_Ali_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1715235749551_Travis-Head-and-Abhishek-Sharma.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

LSG failed to accelerate despite losing just 4 wickets during their innings and ended up scoring just 165 runs in 20 overs. In response, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma took the LSG bowlers to the cleaners as SRH marched on to victory in just 9.4 overs. Hayden said on commentary that someone needs to show intent for LSG and after having one of the slowest powerplays, they just never recovered and ended up with a score that was absolutely below-par with respect to the playing surface.\n\n\"I have to call them out. This is not a 5 runs per over wicket. Somebody needed to show intent. They had one of the slowest powerplays. That took the innings nowhere. When the opposition team has Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen, your intention should be to go at 10s and over. 160-170 will never be enough,\" Hayden said in commentary.\n\n\"Am lost for words. We have watched that kind of batting on tv. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six hitting skills. They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings.\"\n\n\"Was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one. Once you are on the losing side, there are questions marks on the decisions taken. We were 40-50 runs short. When we lost wickets in the powerplay, we couldn't get any momentum. Ayush and Nicky batted well to get us to 166.

He has not been in good batting form this season having played just three games this season and scored 59 runs.\n\nThe right-hander will slot in at four. He has made a big impact for the side in the middle-order scoring runs for his franchise at a strike rate of 150.\n\nKlaasen will slot in at five. He has been the second-highest run-getter for the side and has hit the most sixes in the season so far. He has been very attacking especially against the spinners.\n\nSamad will slot in at six. He has been striking at a strike rate of almost 190 throughout the season. He has scored 148 runs this season so far.\n\nThe Bengal all-rounder will slot in at seven. He has played a few important cameos but not got regular chances with the bat. He has scored 176 runs for the season so far at a strike rate of 145.\n\nJansen will slot in at eight and extend the batting lineup for SRH. With the ball, he can be effective as well, especially with the new ball. He has yet to pick up a wicket this season.\n\nSkipper Cummins will slot in at nine. He has taken 12 wickets in the season so far. He has been brilliant as captain so far and has found the support of his players.\n\nBhuvi will pair up with Cummins from the other end. He has picked up 8 wickets in this season so far and has bowled with an economy of over 10 which is unusual for him.\n\nNatarajan concludes the likely playing XI for SRH against LSG.

The 23-year-old Punjab left-hander fired from all cylinders for Hyderabad this season, making 401 runs from 12 matches and those runs have come at an awesome strike-rate of 205. \"Our support staff and Pat (Cummins), the way they think, I have never seen anyone else think like that,\" Abhishek said on JioCinema Match Centre Live after their record 10-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants here on Wednesday.\n\n\"They're like, 'Go out there and express yourself. Play as aggressively as you can, we'll back you.' I think that matters a lot,\" said Abhishek, who has hit 35 sixes so far, highest by any batter this season.\n\nThe SRH openers Abhishek (75 not out off 28 balls) and Travis Head (89 not out off 30 balls) scaled down 166 in just 9.4 overs, rewriting the record for the quickest chase of 150-plus in T20 cricket.\n\nSRH's total of 167 was also the highest by any team by the end of the tenth over in men's T20s.\n\n\"I think this approach was something I took on during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy,\" said Abhishek who played a key role in Punjab winning the domestic T20 title last season.\n\nAbhishek (485 runs from 10 matches) was the second highest run-getter behind Riyan Parag (510) of Assam in last season's SMAT.\n\n\"I feel when I play this way, look at the ball, and react, my shots come off better and the bowler comes under pressure. I always thought if I play in the IPL, I'll try to maintain this,\" he added.\n\nWith Head at his explosive best, SRH have smashed many batting records this season including the highest ever IPL total of 287/3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.\n\n\"I don't think anyone plays spin better than Travis. The shots he hit off (Krishnappa) Gowtham, normally batters can't do that, that shows how special he is.\n\n\"He's very clear, whenever I talk to him, the way he compliments me, I have always been a big fan of him over the last year that I have followed him.\n\n\"When our understanding was established and our partnership improved, we became good friends off the pitch and have started spending more time,\" he added.\n\nAbhishek then touched upon his strategy against the LSG bowlers, especially pacers.\n\n\"They were bowling cutters in the middle. I thought the cutters could slow down on their way, but Travis and I had planned to play it the way you would hit a spinner with the spin.\n\n\"So, if it's an off-cutter, we look to hit towards long-off covers.

While Sunrisers Hyderabad lost to Mumbai Indians by seven wickets at the Wankhede Stadium, LSG lost to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) by 98 runs.\n\nThe game promises to be intriguing as both outfits have contrasting styles of going about their business. While Sunrisers Hyderabad never take their feet off the gas, Rahul and co are known to change gears as per the situation of the game.\n\nSunrisers have ticked the most boxes in batting and therefore LSG's biggest challenge will be to keep them quiet.

Krunal Pandya and KL Rahul tried to soak up the pressure but failed to find boundaries barring two sixes by the former off Jaydev Unadkat. The pitch was on the slower side and LSG found their first four after 54 balls in the match before Cummins concluded the skipper's scratchy 33-ball 29 in the tenth over with the score 57/3. Following eight balls, Krunal Pandya followed back to the hut due to a run out paving the way for Nicholas Pooran and Aayush Badoni to stitch a 50-plus partnership. With the scorecard reading 102/5 in 15 overs, the pair switched gears to 29 runs in the next three overs before Badoni raced to a 28-ball fifty in the 19th over. Eventually, Pat Cummins got a birthday bashing for 19 runs in the last over to see LSG post 165 in 20 overs.\n\nIn reply, the tag team of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma were watchful in the first over before launching the ball around the park in the next five overs. Yash Thakur conceded 17 runs in the second over, followed by Gowtham, Ravi Bishnoi, and Naveen-ul-Haq leaking 22, 17, and 23 runs for the score to read 87/0 in five overs. Head raced to yet another 16-ball fifty and the duo stormed around the park to lead SRH into a 107-run powerplay. The batting fireworks compelled Rahul to opt for Ayush Badoni over Marcus Stoinis or Krunal Pandya for the seventh over, leaving them 40 runs short with 13 overs to go. The pair added 31 runs together with a score of 157/0 in nine overs.

The 57th match of the Indian Premier League 2024 edition witnessed what wasn't ever seen in an IPL game earlier.\n\nThe SRH duo started off with a bang, getting past 50 runs in just the fourth over of the innings as they kept on hammering the Super Giants bowlers for fours and sixes all through the stadium. It was absolutely a nightmare for the Lucknow side, who tried hard to post a modest total of 165 runs after an early collapse.\n\nAs soon as the opening pair landed on the crease, they had a clear intention in mind and that was to attack and get to the total as early as possible.

The 17th edition of the IPL has seen boundaries being struck with increasing frequency, setting a rapid pace of scoring unmatched in previous seasons.\n\nThe encounter between the Sunrisers Hyderabad and the Lucknow Super Giants at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad, although promising to be an exciting contest between two sides desperately eyeing a spot to be a part of the playoff, resulted in being a thoroughly one-sided affair, particularly in the second half of the fixture.\n\nThe openers of SRH, Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, clobbered their way to a stupendous victory in the end, making extremely light work of the 166-run target set by LSG. A host of records got eclipsed along the way; the difference in the powerplay totals by sides in a particular match (80-27/2 and 107/0), winning with the most number of deliveries to spare while chasing targets in excess of 100 (62), etc. These, along with a few more, were achieved in the second innings of the game.\n\nAlso Read: Watch: LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka seen bickering with KL Rahul post SRH drubbing, sends netizens into a frenzy\n\nA breakthrough feat was broken in the first innings after it was Krunal Pandya's second successive six off Jaydev Unadkat's slot delivery which the former stroked over the bowler's head for a maximum. That six marked the 1000th six in IPL 2024, which came in record time in terms of the number of deliveries (13,079), as compared to 2023 and 2022 - where this endeavour had taken 15,390 and 16,269 deliveries, respectively.\n\nAlso Read: IPL 2024, Match 57 Stats Review: SRH register highest total in the first 10 overs, Travis Head's batting heroics and other stats\n\nThe past couple of seasons have been surreal for batters, where extraordinarily turbo-charged batting has led to an upsurge in the rate at which runs were amassed. The previous couple of seasons saw a total of 1124 and 1062 sixes being hit, respectively.

Travis Head (89* off 30) and Abhishek Sharma (75* off 28) tore apart the opposition's bowling attack, including Yash Thakur, Gowtham, Naveen-ul-Haq, Ayush Badoni, and Ravi Bishnoi, dispatching the ball to all corners of the ground with relentless aggression.\n\nDespite Ravi Bishnoi creating a couple of opportunities, Lucknow Super Giants failed to capitalize as chances were missed, allowing the Sunrisers' onslaught to continue unabated. A staggering 148 of the 167 runs were amassed through boundaries, with Head smashing 8 fours and an equal number of sixes, while Abhishek Sharma contributed with 8 fours and 6 maximums.\n\nWith Lucknow Super Giants languishing at sixth place in the points table, their next encounter against Delhi Capitals looms crucial.

Reddy made the catch look easy as he lobbed the ball back in when stepping over and came back in to claim it. Kumar struck again to dismiss dangerous Marcus Stoinis (3) as Sanvir Singh took a low catch diving forward at mid-on.\n\nLSG scored 27 runs in the Power Play-their slowest before this was 45. Debutant Vijayakanth Viyaskanth came for his first over and hit some perfect areas and gave only three in his first. First impressions of a leggie quick through the air, didn't turn any of the balls big, but showed his variations: the wrong'un, the front-of-the-hand ball.\n\nFirst impressions of a leggie quick through the air, didn't turn any of the balls big, but has shown his variations: the wrong'un, the front-of-the-hand ball. Skipper KL Rahul on the other end played the anchor role and was struggling with 20 runs in 25 deliveries but Krunal Pandya showed intent to score big when he launched back-to-back sixes to Jaydev Unadkat in the eighth over.\n\nA slower bouncer from Jaydev Unadkat, almost head high, but Pandya flat-batted it for a six over long-on. The next one was more orthodox, a drive back over Unadkat's head as he pitched it up and gave the pace. LSG were reeling on 45 for 2 in eight overs.\n\nSkipper Pat Cummins got the prize wicket of Rahul as he bowled on pace, sliding onto the pads, Rahul felt he had to have a swing at it and flicked it in the air, trying to go behind square on the leg side, but was caught at deep square, and went for 29 off 33. Cummins hit down the middle stump to get rid of Pandya on 24.\n\nFinally, the run rate went past six an over with Ayush Badoni maneuvering T Natarajan for three boundaries in the 14th over. Then Nicholas Pooran smashed a six of the debutant and Badoni ended the over with a boundary as Viyaskanth ended his spell without a wicket giving away 27 runs. T Natarajan went for 35 runs in three overs as Badoni moved around in the crease and managed to place him in the gaps. Badoni is not a power-hitter but in a game where the seven and over might be the going rate, his pitch was right up his alley.\n\nHe was 35 off 19, and the partnership went to 59 off 33 with Pooran. Both the batters collected 15 off Natarajan's last over and with a boundary on the very first ball of Cummins LSG went par 150. Badoni reached his fifty off just 28 balls and kept LSG alive in this contest. He has manipulated fields and the lines of the bowlers by moving around in the crease and has also played some orthodox shots just hard enough to clear the field. Unfortunately, Natarajan also got his fifty, conceding 15 in the 19th over.\n\nThe 52-ball 99-run partnership for the fifth wickets between Badoni and Pooran-highest for LSG for the fifth wickets- helped them to recover from 66 for 4 to 165 for 4 at the end of 20 overs. Badoni remained unbeaten on 55 as Pooran struck 26 balls 48.\n\nBrief score:\n\nLucknow Super Giants 165 for 4 in 20 overs (Ayush Badoni 55 not out, Nicholas Pooran 48 not out; Bhuvneshwar Kumar 2-12, Pat Cummins 1-47) against Sunrisers Hyderabad.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitish_Kumar_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nitish Kumar Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanvir_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanvir Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_de_Kock", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quinton de Kock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

While SRH have been led by Australia's World Cup-winning captain Pat Cummins this year, LSG have entrusted their hopes in India wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul.\n\nRahul will open the innings for LSG in this game and is expected to come up against Cummins. If he manages to better Cummins by picking up his slower bouncers well and treating them like they are meant to be, LSG will be in the ascendancy.\n\nHowever, if Cummins manages to get the upper hand over Rahul, SRH will be able to dictate terms throughout the game.\n\nStar LSG bowler Naveen-ul-Haq, who picked up three wickets in his side's previous game, a disappointing defeat to KKR in Lucknow on Sunday, will have to contend with the marauding Travis Head in this game.\n\nThe latter is known to tuck into all bowlers who aim to come into the powerplay and deliver the goods.\n\nHead looks to make room for himself and carve deliveries up and over the cover fielder to pick up runs and this is where Naveen will have to be careful. He cannot afford to give Head the room and pace needed to play his shots or manufacture any to take SRH towards a big total.\n\nThe Afghan seamer will need to have his wits around him to compete against Head.\n\n#3 Nitish Kumar Reddy vs Ravi Bishnoi\n\nSRH's newfound sensation Nitish Kumar Reddy, who plies his trade for Andhra in domestic cricket, will have to compete against leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi in this game.\n\nReddy has shown excellent form of late, and he will have the responsibility of carrying the SRH middle order upon his shoulder in this game.\n\nBishnoi is a wily operator and he will know just exactly how much spin and bounce will be operable at the Uppal stadium on Wednesday. If Bishnoi manages to entrap Reddy in this game, LSG will have the upper hand over the hosts.\n\nHowever, if the latter manages to come good and showcase his wares, the visitors will have nowhere to hide.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mohul_bhowmick@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Mohul Bhowmick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

The shots he hit off Gowtham, normally batters can't do that, that shows how special he is.\n\n\"He's very clear, whenever I talk to him, the way he compliments me, I have always been a big fan of him over the last year that I have followed him.\n\n\"When our understanding was established and our partnership improved, we became good friends off the pitch and have started spending more time,\" he added.\n\nAbhishek then touched upon his strategy against the LSG bowlers, especially pacers.\n\n\"They were bowling cutters in the middle. I thought the cutters could slow down on their way, but Travis and I had planned to play it the way you would hit a spinner with the spin.\n\n\"So, if it's an off-cutter, we look to hit towards long-off covers.

After suffering a seven wicket defeat against Mumbai Indians in their previous game, SRH needed to win the game to bolster their playoffs chances and they won it in style.\n\nSet a target of 166 runs, the Hyderabad-based outfit chased down the total in just 9.4 overs to create history. They broke the record for the highest total chased inside 10 overs. Head and Sharma went all out against LSG to power their team to the seventh win of the season.\n\nBoth the batters came out all guns blazing right from the start. Head smashed a 16-ball fifty while Sharma did it in just 19 balls. Head went on to hit an unbeaten 89 runs off just 30 balls with the help of eight fours and eight sixes. On the other hand, Sharma remained unbeaten on 75 runs. His knock came off just 28 balls and was studded with eight fours and six sixes.\n\nHead and Sharma's whirlwind batting left everyone in the cricketing fraternity stunned. Not only the fans but present and former players were also stunned with their power-hitting. Sachin Tendulkar, arguably the most decorated batter in the history of the game, also had a similar reaction. The former India batsman stated that the SRH would have scored 300 runs if they batted first.\n\n\"A destructive opening partnership would be an understatement tonight. Had these boys batted first, they would've scored 300!\" Sachin Tendulkar wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nWhile Sachin Tendulkar was mighty impressed by Head and Sharma's batting, SRH's win has also knocked out Mumbai Indians out of IPL 2024. The former cricketer is currently a part of Mumbai Indians' support staff. Mumbai Indians are currently languishing at the ninth spot in the points table with 8 points from 12 games.\n\nEven if they go on to win their remaining two league games, they will finish on 12 points. However, at least four teams are confirmed to finish with at least 14 points this season. Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals have 16 points while SRH are on 14 points at present.\n\nOn the other hand, one between Delhi Capitals and LSG will go to 14 points after the game between them.

On Wednesday, during the SRH vs LSG match, where the Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, and after the match, Sanjiv Goenka and KL Rahul made the headlines, Bhuvi went about his business quietly.\n\nIn a match where Pat Cummins gave away 12.50 runs per over, Bhuvneshwar Kumar returned with miserly figures of 2/12. This, when he isn't considered to be at his best. In IPL 2024, Bhuvi has only 11 wickets in 12 games, at an average of 37, but he still does his job with an economy of 9.13. That too considering, he also bowls at the start of the innings, and also the death overs.\n\nIn his first spell itself, vs LSG, Bhuvi gave hints that it was going to be his day. First he removed LSG opener Quinton de Kock early for 2, and then got rid of Marcus Stoinis in the very next over. That meant, the opposition could only score 27/2 in the powerplay overs. If that was not enough to show Bhuvi's brilliance, then consider this. When the bowler wasn't operating in the middle overs, that was when the most runs were scored.\n\nTill the 16th over, Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran had taken the score to 112/4 at the end of the 16th over. That means runs in that period came at a much rapid pace of around 8.5. Then coming in to bowl the 18th over, the fast bowler gave away only five singles. The 19th over brought 15 runs, while the 20th brought 19. So, easily, Bhuvi emerged as the best bowler for SRH.\n\nThe out-of-favour India pacer, Bhuvi, despite a 'so-called' ordinary IPL 2024 season, is nothing short of a legend. He has 181 wickets in 172 matches at an average of 26. What's even better is his economy rate of 7.51. Forget the IPL, he has even better numbers in T20Is. In 87 matches, he has 90 wickets to his name, at an average of 23, and an economy of 6.96. That speaks volumes this UP player.\n\nBut then, as is the case in cricket. The batsmen hog all the limelight. This time it was Abhishek Sharma (75 from 28), and Travis Head (89 from 30), who stole Bhuvi's thunder. The duo achieved the 166-run target in only 9.4 overs. If that wasn't enough, the Sanjiv Goenka vs KL Rahul episode after the match, was the only talking point, after Lucknow succumbed to their worst-ever defeat.", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madhav_agarwal@insidesport.in", "name": "Madhav Agarwal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

This marks the first of three consecutive home matches for SRH and three successive away for LSG.\n\nSRH are precariously placed in fourth place after their net run rate suffered, courtesy of the recent defeat to the Mumbai Indians (MI) at the Wankhede Stadium. LSG, on the other hand, were battered in their final home game of the season by the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). KL Rahul and company were defeated by 98 runs and now find themselves in the sixth position in the points table.\n\nIn a way, this is a virtual knockout in the race to the playoffs, as the team losing today will have to hope for a miracle to qualify, considering there are so many teams in the race.\n\nAs far as the weather is concerned, rain is likely to have a say in the contest in Hyderabad. Parts of Telangana received rainfall on May 7, and according to the weather report, there is more than a decent chance of the contest being interrupted due to rain.\n\nThere is no downpour predicted in the morning, but the weather considerably worsens by the time the match nears. There is more than half a chance that precipitation makes its appearance over the course of the match, and there is no telling about its intensity.\n\nQualification scenario for SRH and LSG could get complicated with a washout in Hyderabad\n\nAlthough there is still a chance that the contest could be conducted, even a shortened one, the possibility of a washout also has to be considered. In the event of rain preventing any play, both teams will be awarded a point each, which will give both of them 13 points. However, it will not improve their net run rate, with only two matches remaining in their league schedule.\n\n\"We like playing at home, we'll wait and see what's ahead of us. Hopefully a few more fireworks,\" Cummins had said following SRH's loss to MI in Mumbai.\n\nSRH's batting has been a concern after a blockbuster first half of the season.

I mean, I think his ability to take on spin in the power play. And he's improved greatly against pace. He is a high quality player. He's a boundary hitter. He is a six hitter and no doubt post World Cup, and he will start to make some changes, whether it be Jaiswal, himself or Shubman Gill. To be fair, there's a few.

First impressions of a leggie quick through the air, didn't turn any of the balls big, but showed his variations: the wrong'un, the front-of-the-hand ball.\n\nFirst impressions of a leggie quick through the air, didn't turn any of the balls big, but has shown his variations: the wrong'un, the front-of-the-hand ball. Skipper KL Rahul on the other end played the anchor role and was struggling with 20 runs in 25 deliveries but Krunal Pandya showed intent to score big when he launched back-to-back sixes to Jaydev Unadkat in the eighth over.\n\nA slower bouncer from Jaydev Unadkat, almost head high, but Pandya flat-batted it for a six over long-on. The next one was more orthodox, a drive back over Unadkat's head as he pitched it up and gave the pace. LSG were reeling on 45 for 2 in eight overs.\n\nSkipper Pat Cummins got the prize wicket of Rahul as he bowled on pace, sliding onto the pads, Rahul felt he had to have a swing at it and flicked it in the air, trying to go behind square on the leg side, but was caught at deep square, and went for 29 off 33. Cummins hit down the middle stump to get rid of Pandya on 24.\n\nFinally, the run rate went past six an over with Ayush Badoni maneuvering T Natarajan for three boundaries in the 14th over. Then Nicholas Pooran smashed a six of the debutant and Badoni ended the over with a boundary as Viyaskanth ended his spell without a wicket giving away 27 runs. T Natarajan went for 35 runs in three overs as Badoni moved around in the crease and managed to place him in the gaps. Badoni is not a power-hitter but in a game where the seven and over might be the going rate, his pitch was right up his alley.\n\nHe was 35 off 19, and the partnership went to 59 off 33 with Pooran. Both the batters collected 15 off Natarajan's last over and with a boundary on the very first ball of Cummins LSG went par 150. Badoni reached his fifty off just 28 balls and kept LSG alive in this contest. He has manipulated fields and the lines of the bowlers by moving around in the crease and has also played some orthodox shots just hard enough to clear the field. Unfortunately, Natarajan also got his fifty, conceding 15 in the 19th over.\n\nThe 52-ball 99-run partnership for the fifth wickets between Badoni and Pooran-highest for LSG for the fifth wickets- helped them to recover from 66 for 4 to 165 for 4 at the end of 20 overs. Badoni remained unbeaten on 55 as Pooran struck 26 balls 48.\n\nBrief score:\n\nLucknow Super Giants 165 for 4 in 20 overs (Ayush Badoni 55 not out, Nicholas Pooran 48 not out; Bhuvneshwar Kumar 2-12, Pat Cummins 1-47) against Sunrisers Hyderabad.", "source": {"uri": "andhrawatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Andhrawatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvneshwar_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bhuvneshwar Kumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitish_Kumar_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nitish Kumar Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanvir_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanvir Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_de_Kock", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quinton de Kock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Mike Hesson predicted that Abhishek Sharma will become an opener for Team India following the T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nAbhishek Sharma showcased his batting prowess during the match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). Sharma scored an unbeaten 75 runs off 28 balls, including eight fours and six sixes. Along with Travis Head, he helped SRH chase the target of 166 in just 9.4 overs.\n\nTravis Head scored an unbeaten 89 runs off just 30 deliveries, including eight fours and eight sixes. Interestingly, SRH didn't even need their middle-order batsmen like Heinrich Klaasen and Nitish Kumar Reddy to bat. Abhishek and Head dominated the LSG bowlers with their powerful hitting abilities.\n\nAbhishek Sharma has amassed 401 runs in 12 matches with an average of 36.45 and an outstanding strike rate of 205.64, including two fifties. Notably, his strike rate is better than players like Virat Kohli, Sanju Samson, Rishabh Pant, Shivam Dube, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Suryakumar Yadav, and Rohit Sharma.\n\nSpeaking on JioCinema, Mike Hesson praised Abhishek's aggressive batting style and highlighted his ability to take on spin in the powerplay. Hesson stated that Abhishek could secure a spot in the India squad after the T20 World Cup. He described Abhishek as a high-quality player and boundary hitter.\n\n\"Oh, look, I think so. I mean, I think his ability to take on spin in the power play. And he's improved greatly against pace. He is a high-quality player. He's a boundary hitter. He is a six-hitter and no doubt post-World Cup, and he will start to make some changes, whether it be Jaiswal, himself, or Shubman Gill. To be fair, there's a few. There's plenty of names, but he will definitely be one that will have plenty of people talking about,\" Hesson told JioCinema.\n\nFollowing the T20 World Cup, Team India is scheduled to tour Zimbabwe for a five-match T20I series. If Abhishek Sharma secures a spot in the Indian squad, he could replace Rohit Sharma at the top. The selectors could pick the young team for the upcoming tour to the African nation in July.\n\nSRH skipper Pat Cummins praised opener Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma. Cummins described him as an incredible player against both spin and pace. He stated that it would be difficult for bowlers to face batters like Travis and Abhishek.\n\n\"(On did he change the pitch) Maybe Travis and Abhishek did. We just let them go, they are two guys who are very positive and I'm a bowler, it is tough for me to give them any inputs. (On Travis Head) He's been like this for 2 years, he hits the tough areas, hits the middle a lot, might not be super conventional. (On Abhishek Sharma) Just an incredible player of spin and pace. With just 2 fielders out, it is really difficult for the bowlers against them,\" Pat Cummins said.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"},

But Rahul never looked at his usual best as he struggled to get his timing and finally departed in search of quick runs, caught by T Natarajan at deep backward square leg in the final delivery of the same over.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad bowlers started brilliantly before losing the plot as Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran joined hands to guide Lucknow Super Giants to a competitive 165 for four on a sluggish pitch in an Indian Premier League match here on Wednesday. Electing to bat, LSG were in all sorts of trouble at 66 for 4 in 11.2 overs before Badoni (55 not out off 30 balls) and Pooran (48 not out off 25 balls) stitched crucial 95-runs off 55 balls for the unbeaten fifth-wicket stand. LSG were struggling at 27 for 2 at the end of the powerplay. The visitors lost Quinton de Kock, who replaced an injured Mohsin Khan, failed to deliver, caught brilliantly by Nitish Kumar Reddy at deep backward square-leg off Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) in the third over. Bhuvneshwar struck again in the fifth over, dismissing the dangerous Marcus Stoinis but the credit for the dismissal goes to young Sanvir Singh, who took a stunning diving catch just inches from the ground at mid-on. The pitch also didn't help LSG's cause as the ball was a bit slow and was stopping, as their batters found it difficult to find timing. While skipper KL Rahul (29) held one end up, Krunal Pandya (24) took it on himself to up the ante. Krunal pummelled Jaydev Unadkat for a six over long-on and then hit the bowler straight over his head for another maximum to accumulate 15 runs in the eighth over. Rahul hit the first boundary of LSG innings in the 10th over, slamming SRH skipper Pat Cummins over mid-off. But Rahul never looked at his usual best as he struggled to get his timing and finally departed in search of quick runs, caught by T Natarajan at deep backward square leg in the final delivery of the same over. SRH were brilliant on the field as Cummins' direct throw from mid-on sent Krunal packing soon when the batter went for a quick single single. Badoni pressed the feet on accelerator soon with three boundaries of left-arm pacer Natarajan's 14th over which yielded 17 runs. The Lucknow side finally got going as Pooran and Badoni struck a six and a four to accumulate 12 runs off the 15th over bowled by leg-spinner Vijayakanth Viyaskanth. They showed their intent from the word go and didn't hesitate to play their strokes when the opportunity was presented to them. It was brilliant batting from Badoni as he swept and cut Natarajan for two consecutive boundaries in the 17th over with the deck seemed to have got better. Badoni displayed some cheeky shots as the right-hander notched up his fifty in 28 balls.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T.

LSG have won all three previous games against SRH. The Super Giants are fifth on the points table heading into this game after losing to KKR. They lost the match by 98 runs which affected their NRR.\n\nLSG's batting was below par in the match against KKR. They were bowled out for 137 as the KKR bowlers gave them no chance of coming back into the game.\n\nLSG allowed the uncapped Arshin Kulkarni in place of experienced openers like Quinton de Kock and Kyle Mayers which became the talking point in the end. Lucknow skipper KL Rahul also admitted that the batters let them down in the game.\n\nSRH have managed to stay in the top four despite their loss to Mumbai Indians before taking on LSG at home. CSK's big win against Punjab Kings have helped them break into the top four creating some distance between the teams below them on the points table.\n\nAlso Read: PBKS vs RCB: \"It doesn't matter if Virat Kohli is in those 1st 6 overs..\"- Matthew Hayden's fresh tirade\n\nFor teams like LSG, SRH, and DC, the remaining games are crucial now with no chance of losing. MI, RCB, GT, and PBKS have a tough job in their remaining games.\n\nThe weather conditions on Wednesday will be mostly sunny in the daytime with temperatures close to 40 degrees. The conditions will be mostly sunny throughout the afternoon as well. The conditions will clear out by the evening with temperatures around 27 degrees. Humidity will be close to 70 percent and there is a five percent chance of rain as per Accuweather.\n\nHyderabad has been a high-scoring venue so far in the IPL. SRH won their previous game against Rajasthan by just one run as 201 was almost chased down. SRH posted 277 against Mumbai Indians at this very venue. They play three home games out of their remaining four games which gives them a very good opportunity to understand the conditions and play accordingly.\n\nThere is a 5 percent chance of rain that might interrupt the game. However, keeping the hot and humid conditions in mind, the chance of rain looks unlikely. The weather will clear out by the evening and the temperatures will be around 27 degrees which should be good enough.\n\nLSG and SRH both have a few must-win games to play. The challenge for LSG is that they will be playing home games while SRH plays three out of their last four games at home. Playing at home, they have a better understanding of the conditions and hence the players will look to maximize the home conditions.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

Sanjiv Goenka's anger reignites memories of RPS captaincy change", "body": "The post-match conversation between LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka and skipper KL Rahul has become the talk of the town, after the team suffered a heavy loss.\n\nCricket is a sport of great uncertainties; you win some, & you lose some. Try telling this to an IPL franchise owner, whose team underwent one of the worst losses in IPL history, where first the batsmen failed miserably to score, and then the bowlers could only hold the fort for 9.4 overs. That is exactly what happened in the match between SRH and LSG on Wednesday, in Hyderabad, where the visitors had no clue, as to what went wrong with them.\n\nBut the carnage just did not end there. LSG skipper KL Rahul was on the receiving end from the team owner Sanjiv Goenka, who perhaps reprimanded the latter, or just had an overtly animated chat after the match. In either case, it was just a little too much caught on the camera.\n\nAfter opting to bat first, Lucknow team struggled big time to get going. The pitch looked sluggish, and the batters could not get boundaries in the powerplay. In a poor display of batting, LSG could only score 27/2 in six overs. Rahul scored 29 from 33, while Quinton de Kock failed. It was only Nicholas Pooran (48 from 26) and Ayush Badoni (55 from 30), who took the team to a respectable total.\n\nBut the second innings was a complete turnaround. Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma went bonkers, and scored 107 in the powerplay itself. They achieved the target in only 9.4 overs and 62 deliveries to spare, giving a jolt to LSG, where it would be difficult for them to make a comeback in IPL 2024.\n\nWinning and losing might be part of the game, but visibly there was something disastrously wrong with LSG against SRH. The bowlers couldn't bowl, and the batter couldn't bat. In between, the skipper couldn't lead from the front. But does that really give the license to the owner to display such reactions with cameras around? Of course, a lot of money is invested, but these players earning million bucks, can make errors too.\n\nIf one was to read between the lines, this conversation between LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka and KL Rahul might just have some repercussions. No one knows what, but the team owner is already being called out on social media for his behaviour. But owners hardly care about these things, and for all you know, the current skipper might be demoted, or not retained for next year, before the mega auction.\n\nIf history is to go by..Dhoni was also sacked unceremoniously as the captain of Rising Pune Superginat by the same owners on account of non-performance. In 2016, the team finished second last, and at the start of the 2017 season Steve Smith was made the captain. Back then, many publications reported Sanjiv Goenka as saying, that the team wanted someone young and fit as the leader of the team.\n\nSuch was the situation that even Sakshi Dhoni had jumped into defend her husband on X. While there were no confirmed reports of the same, but a few publications suggested that the Pune management wasn't happy with Dhoni's behaviour. It was claimed that the latter would miss team meetings, and was not available on phone.

A video that quickly went viral shows Goenka engaging in a tense discussion with Rahul right after the match.\n\nThis public display of dissatisfaction from the franchise owner underlined the high expectations and pressures that accompany leading an IPL team. Commentary during the broadcast suggested that such exchanges are better suited for private settings, highlighting the unusual nature of this public interaction.\n\nThe dialogue between Goenka and Rahul hinted at significant concerns within the team dynamics and leadership, sparking a wave of speculation and commentary within the cricket community. The incident has brought to light the intense scrutiny and immediate accountability faced by players and management alike in high-stakes tournaments like the IPL.\n\nIn his post-match interview, a dejected Rahul commended the performance of SRH batsmen Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, who orchestrated the chase.\n\n\"I am at a loss for words. We have watched that kind of batting on TV. But this is unreal batting. Everything seemed to find the middle of the bat. Kudos to their skills. They have worked hard on their six-hitting skills,\" Rahul remarked, clearly impressed yet overwhelmed by the opposition's prowess.\n\nHe further elaborated on the challenges posed by such a rapid start from SRH, stating, \"They didn't give us a chance to know what the pitch played in the second innings. It was hard to stop them as they teed off from ball one.\" This acknowledgment highlights the exceptional nature of the SRH batting performance and the difficulties faced by LSG in curbing their aggressive play.\n\nThe video of the exchange between Goenka and Rahul stirred considerable debate on social media, with fans and experts expressing discomfort over the public nature of the reprimand. Many felt that such matters should be handled privately rather than in the full view of cameras, as it could undermine team morale and the captain's authority.\n\nTravis Head-Abhishek Sharma Partnership In Numbers as Sunrisers Duo Scripts History\n\nThe fallout from this match and the visible dissatisfaction of LSG's ownership could potentially act as a catalyst for strategic changes or shifts within the team as they strive to recover from this setback. With the IPL being not only a test of cricketing skill but also of strategic acumen and leadership under pressure, incidents like these underscore the intense emotional and professional pressures that team captains and owners navigate throughout the season.", "source": {"uri": "mykhel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myKhel.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

Abhishek left spectators in awe as he unleashed a breathtaking innings, scoring a scintillating 75 in just 28 balls, adorned with an array of eight boundaries and six maximums. His stellar performance not only sealed the win for SRH but also elevated his season tally to over 400 runs, cementing his status as a key contributor to the team's success.\n\nAbhishek's performance this season has been nothing short of exceptional, amassing 401 runs at an across 12 games. While this marks only his second half-century of the season, his impact for SRH has been monumental, contributing significantly to the team's record-breaking feats with the bat. Notably, SRH's remarkable run-chase of 167 runs in just 9.4 overs shattered the all-time IPL record for the most runs scored in the first 10 overs, showcasing Abhishek's instrumental role in the team's success. His partnership with Travis Head was equally remarkable, reaching the century mark in a mere 30 balls, establishing a new record for the quickest partnership to three figures in IPL history.\n\nThis season's performance has seen Abhishek elevate his game to new heights, surpassing his previous best tally in the IPL. With 401 runs in 12 matches, he trails only behind his exceptional 2022 campaign, where he amassed 426 runs in 14 matches for SRH. Boasting an average of 36.45 and a strike rate of 205.64, The 23-year-old has emerged as the season's leading six-hitter, with an impressive tally of 35 maximums to his name. His recent innings against LSG was a testament to his explosive batting prowess, comprising eight boundaries and six sixes, as he and Head wreaked havoc, accumulating 107 runs in the powerplay overs alone.\n\nAbhishek's consistent stellar performance throughout the season has ignited a fervent demand among fans for his inclusion in India's squad for the T20 World Cup 2024. Despite his explosive batting displays, Abhishek was notably absent from the recently announced 15-member squad for the tournament, set to take place in the West Indies and the United States of America (USA) in June. His omission from both the primary squad and the list of traveling reserves has left supporters clamoring for his inclusion. With the International Cricket Council (ICC) still allowing time until May 25 for any last-minute adjustments to the squad, hopes remain high among fans for Abhishek to secure a spot and showcase his talent on the global stage.", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Abhishek-Sharma.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 121, "textEnd": 126}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 2534, "textEnd": 2540}], "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Badoni joined Pooran in the middle when Lucknow Super Giants lost Krunal Pandya with the score reading 66/4 in 11.2 overs. The duo's brilliance helped LSG get to a respectable score. However, this wasn't enough as SRH (167/0) won.\n\nLSG were off to a slow start and losing wickets at key junctures hurt their cause. The wicket was pretty slow and the two players took the match until the end to provide their team with something. The two batters showed positive intent right from the start. Badoni finished with a half-century as Pooran missed out, scoting an unbeaten 48.\n\nBadoni managed 55* from 30 balls (4s: 9). He struck at 183.33. The youngster has surpassed 600 IPL runs (606) at 24.24. He smashed his 4th IPL fifty (SR: 133.48). Pooran managed 48* from 26 balls (4s: 6, 6s: 1). He has raced to 1,633 IPL runs at 30.81 (SR: 157.93). In the ongoing season, Pooran has scored 363 runs at 60.50 (SR: 162.05).\n\nAs per ESPNcricinfo, the 99*-run stand between the two is now LSG's highest tally for the fifth wicket in IPL history. The previous-best record was an 87-run stand between Deepak Hooda and Badoni versus GT in IPL 2022. This is also the 4th-best stand for LSG (any wicket) in the competition. It's also their best stand against SRH in the IPL.\n\nThis was LSG's eighth 50+ partnership for the fifth wicket or below in IPL. Notably, Badoni is part of five such partnerships.

However, the pitch isn't limited to favoring only one style of play. As the game progresses, it tends to offer more assistance to spin bowlers, a trend observed historically. This evolution in pitch behavior, reminiscent of patterns seen at numerous other venues, often gives the chasing team a slight edge.\n\nHyderabad Weather Forecast:\n\nThe likelihood of rain is high, casting doubt on the prospects for uninterrupted gameplay in the Hyderabad match. Expect pleasant temperatures, peaking at around 37 degrees Celsius. However, with gentle breezes blowing at 14 km/hr and moderate humidity at 53%, the conditions are not expected to be ideal for both players and spectators.\n\nAlso READ: IPL 2024: Suryakumar Yadav's wife Devisha Shetty shares a heartfelt post after her husband's record century for MI\n\nSquads:\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: Mayank Agarwal, Abhishek Sharma, Rahul Tripathi, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markande, T Natarajan, Travis Head, Glenn Phillips, Washington Sundar, Jaydev Unadkat, Anmolpreet Singh, Upendra Yadav, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Umran Malik, Jhatavedh Subramanyan, Tanvir Singh, Akash Maharaj Singh, Nitish Reddy\n\nLucknow Super Giants: KL Rahul (c), Ayush Badoni, Quinton de Kock (wk), Devdutt Padikkal, Nicholas Pooran (vc), Ashton Turner, Krishnappa Gowtham, Deepak Hooda, Arshin Kulkarni, Prerak Mankad, Kyle Mayers, Krunal Pandya, Marcus Stoinis, David Willey, Arshad Khan, Shamar Joseph, Amit Mishra, Mohsin Khan, Naveen-ul-Haq, Ravi Bishnoi, Shivam Mavi, Manimaran Siddharth, Mayank Yadav, Yash Thakur, Yudhvir Singh, Shamar Joseph\n\nAlso READ: IPL 2024 [WATCH]: Suryakumar Yadav unleashes beast mode; smashes century with a six during MI vs SRH clash", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vishesh_shukla@crickettimes.com", "name": "Vishesh Shukla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshad_Khan_(Indian_cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arshad Khan (Indian cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Yadav", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fazalhaq_Farooqi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fazalhaq Farooqi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umran_Malik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umran Malik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yudhvir_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yudhvir Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

But recent losses to the Royal Challengers Bengaluru at home, the Chennai Super Kings, and the Mumbai Indians away have rocked their boat.\n\nLSG, on the other hand, started modestly, only to pick up pace midway through the tournament and earn the right for a spot in the playoffs. At the time of writing, SRH are fourth in the table with 12 points while LSG are seventh with the same points as the former.\n\nThe race for qualification into the playoffs has been made interesting by Delhi Capitals' win over Rajasthan Royals at the Feroz Shah Kotla on Tuesday, through which they have climbed up to the fifth spot. They too have 12 points.\n\nHence, it has to be reiterated that both SRH and LSG need to take this game at Uppal seriously on Wednesday and try to come up with their best combinations. A place in the playoffs is on the line for both franchises.\n\nHowever, one must remember that these two franchises have met in Uppal just once in the past - in May last year.\n\nWinning the toss, SRH's then-skipper, and now out-of-favor batter Aiden Markram opted to bat first and was helped by cameos from most of his players to get to a decent total of 182/6 at the end of twenty overs.\n\nWhile fellow South African Heinrich Klaasen was the highest scorer with a 29-ball 47, Anmolpreet Singh, Rahul Tripathi, Abdul Samad, and Markram got starts to help their side get to this total.\n\nPrerak Mankad, Marcus Stoinis, and Nicholas Pooran starred for LSG\n\nIn response, LSG started poorly when they lost West Indian sensation Kyle Mayers for just 12 runs on the board. Quinton de Kock, Mayer's fellow opener, and No.3 batter Prerak Mankad then steadied the LSG ship and took them to the relative safety of 50 runs on the board after which the former fell.\n\nMankad was then joined by Marcus Stoinis at the crease.

After setting a 166-run target, LSG faced the wrath of SRH's opening duo of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, as they smashed the bowlers all around the park to chase the target down in just 9.4 overs.\n\nGoenka was displeased with how LSG were taken to the cleaners in the match and seemingly expressed his displeasure at Rahul after the match. The visuals from their interaction became viral on social media platforms, with many fans criticising the LSG owner for his rather aggressive chat publicly. Fans stated Goenka could have waited for the players to reach a private space to have the conversation, and during the live broadcast, the duo of Mike Hesson and Graeme Smith - both of whom have been associated with IPL franchises before - felt the same.\n\nHesson believed Goenka's displeasure was understandable, but he seemed surprised with the LSG owner choosing to express the sentiment publicly. He also stated that there was a gap in quality between the two teams and that the Super Giants were too conservative in their approach. While both SRH openers played at a strike rate well beyond 250, LSG captain Rahul scored 29 off 31 balls.\n\n\"He's on his head, isn't he? He's voicing his concerns, and KL is going, 'hang on, not quite sure what are you asking us to do'. Today was pretty clear: SRH were on from ball one in the field, and LSG were a bit conservative in terms of how they operate. If you compare that with how Sunrisers play, no doubt there was a distinct gap. He's voicing his displeasure,\" Hesson told JioCinema.\n\nGraeme Smith believed the owner was \"passionate\", but there is a time and place to have such conversations. He also sympathised with Rahul, adding that it will be difficult for the LSG skipper to answer potential questions about his chat with Goenka.\n\n\"It's the owner who is very passionate about his team. His team has taken an absolute drubbing, and the emotions have rolled over. You feel these conversations should be happening behind closed doors. There are so many cameras around; they're not missing anything.

For me, it's only about how I can win games for my team,\" Rahul, who was then the skipper of Kings XI Punjab, said in 2020.\n\nThree years later, the wicketkeeper-batter reiterated his stance ahead of the 2023 IPL season.

This wasn't really a surprising call made by Rahul, given how potent SRH have been when given the license to express themselves with the bat first.\n\nThe skipper could not capitalize and utilize the powerplay, ultimately perishing for a lingering 29 (33). Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis got dismissed for trivial scores, but a 99-run stand for the fifth wicket between Nicholas Pooran and Ayush Badoni, LSG's highest for that particular wicket in their entire history. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Sri Lankan debutant, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth were impressive with the ball, with the pacer not conceding a single boundary in his entire spell and picking a couple of wickets as well, and the young leggie exhibiting excellent control, going for only 27 runs in his four.\n\nAlso Read: Watch: Pat Cummins celebrates birthday with father and SRH teammates, video goes viral\n\nThe two SRH openers slaughtered LSG's bowlers, whacking every one to all parts of the ground. The first over bowled by Krishnappa Gowtham went for eight, post which every other bowler leaked runs like a burst dam, conceding the 166-run target in just 9.4 overs, shattering all sorts of records on the way. Impact Player, Travis Head, in combination with Abhishek Sharma, created absolute mayhem on the field as they didn't let anyone off the hook, ending up with psychedelic scores of 75*(28) and 89*(30), lacing 16 fours and 14 maximums en route to a massive confidence-booster of a victory for the home team.\n\nAlso Read: 'Probably creators are also his fans like me' - SS Rajamouli on resemblance of Bahubali character with MS Dhoni\n\nAfter being inflicted with a ruthless loss at the hands of SRH, LSG have it all to do in their remaining two matches, which will be against the Delhi Capitals and the Mumbai Indians, respectively. With their net run rate taking a toll due to the margin by which they lost against SRH, it's the least as compared to the five teams above them (-0.769).

And also, if left-arm pacer Jaydev Unadkat who was badly missed against Mumbai, is back, then the balance would be near-perfect for Sunrisers giving them the choice of having someone like the fiery Umran Malik as an Impact Player.\n\nThere is no doubt that Sunrisers bowling has been pretty inconsistent and largely depends on the experience of Bhuvneshwar Kumar at the top and the duo of Pat Cummins and left-arm pacer T. Natarajan, considered to be one of the best death overs specialists.\n\nLucknow Super Giants look for an overall, improved performance from the likes of pacers Mohsin Khan, Naveen-ul-Haq, and Marcus Stoinis to give the right kind of cushion for the spinners | Photo Credit: SANDEEP SAXENA/ The Hindu\n\nLucknow Super Giants look for an overall, improved performance from the likes of pacers Mohsin Khan, Naveen-ul-Haq, and Marcus Stoinis to give the right kind of cushion for the spinners | Photo Credit: SANDEEP SAXENA/ The Hindu\n\nOn the other hand, Lucknow captain and opener K.L. Rahul needs to stand up and lead by example if his team were to be in with a chance to move further in the points table. A solid start at the top is imperative for the big guns like Marcus Stoinis, Deepak Hooda, and Nicholas Pooran to turn the heat on and post challenging totals. But again, these batters have been inconsistent - one day dominating any bowling attack and looking very ordinary the next day.\n\nEven in bowling, Lucknow look for an overall, improved performance from the likes of pacers Mohsin Khan, Naveen-ul-Haq, and Marcus Stoinis to give the right kind of cushion for the spinners Krunal Pandya and Ravi Bishnoi to strike it big.\n\nBy all means, it should be a thriller from the spectators point of view given the fact that the two teams will go all out to pick those two crucial points and keep the hopes alive. Interestingly, after soaring temperatures in the last few days, overcast conditions greeted Lucknow Super Giants today evening at the venue with the covers on all over the ground while Sunrisers had no training session.\n\nLatest on SportstarDC vs RR Live Score IPL 2024: Delhi Capitals vs Rajasthan Royals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium as playoff race heats up; Toss at 7pm IST, squad, predicted XIsTeam SportstarDC vs RR Live Toss Updates, IPL 2024: Toss at 7 pm IST; Who will the coin flip favour in Delhi Capitals vs Rajasthan Royals?Team SportstarSRH vs LSG: IPL 2024 playoffs race gets tricky as Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants meet in the battle of equalsV.

This phenomenal stand, achieving the chase of 166 in just 9.4 overs, marked the fastest ever chase of a 160-plus target in IPL history.\n\nTravis Head, blasting 89 not out from 30 deliveries, and Abhishek Sharma, with 75 not out from 28 balls, made the evening at Hyderabad a spectacle of sheer dominance. Their partnership saw SRH propel to third in the IPL 2024 standings, leaving a trail of shattered records and awestruck fans.\n\nTravis Head-Abhishek Sharma Record-Breaking Performances\n\nThe duo's innings included some of the most memorable IPL records:\n\n1. Most 50+ Scores Inside Powerplay: Travis Head's aggressive start contributed to his tally for the season, placing him second only to David Warner with four 50+ scores in the powerplay-all scored in IPL 2024.\n\n2. Fewest Balls to 100-Run Partnership: The pair set a new benchmark for the fastest 100-run partnership, achieving the milestone in just 30 balls against LSG, beating their own previous record of 34 balls earlier in the season.\n\n3. Most Sub-20 Ball 50s in IPL: Travis Head also equaled the record for the most 50s scored in less than 20 balls, a testament to his explosive batting style that has been a hallmark of IPL 2024.\n\n4. Highest Total After First 10 Overs: SRH's 167/0 in 9.4 overs is now the highest total in the first 10 overs, surpassing multiple previous records set earlier in the season.\n\nTheir onslaught began from the powerplay, where they scored 107/0, marking it as one of the highest powerplay totals in IPL history. This explosive start was crucial in setting the tone for what was a record-breaking chase.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThis partnership wasn't just about winning a match but rewriting the history books. Such performances have turned Head and Sharma into icons of the T20 format, showcasing their ability to dominate bowling attacks mercilessly. Sachin Tendulkar, cricketing legend, praised the duo highly, suggesting that they could have scored 300 if they batted first, highlighting the destructive nature of their batting.\n\nThe chase left the opposition and cricket pundits in awe, as SRH not only secured a victory but did so by rewriting the annals of T20 cricket. The impact of this innings is likely to resonate throughout the IPL, as teams strategize to handle such explosive powerplays.", "source": {"uri": "mykhel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myKhel.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Warner_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Warner (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delivery_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delivery (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mykhel.com/img/2024/05/travis-head-abhishek-sharma-1200-1715192881.jpg?09052024005802", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

While Head scored 89 not out off 30 balls, Abhishek smashed 75* off just 28. The Punjab batter hit eight fours and six sixes during his exhilarating knock as the LSG bowlers had no answer to his onslaught.\n\nLegendary off-spinner Harbhajan was one of the many cricket enthusiasts who were stunned by Abhishek's ball-striking ability. The off-spinner floated the idea of adding Abhishek among the reserve players for India in next month's T20 World Cup.\n\n\"What just happened in Hyderabad! Travishead & IamAbhiSharma4 hitting sixes like taking singles. Chased 165 in 9.4 overs.

He has amassed 401 runs from 12 matches at an average of 36.45 and has a strike rate of 205.64. Abhishek has hit 30 fours and 35 sixes so far this season. No one has hit more sixes than him in the ongoing IPL.\n\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced a 15-man squad to represent the Men in Blue in the upcoming T20 World Cup next month. Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal were the two specialist openers picked in the side, with Virat Kohli expected to bat at No. 3.

Following a crushing 98-run defeat against the Kolkata Knight Riders, the team suffered another blow as the Sunrisers Hyderabad chased down 166 runs with 62 balls to spare. This alarming performance prompted franchise owner Sanjiv Goenka to express his disappointment, particularly directing his frustration towards team captain KL Rahul.\n\nRahul faced criticism after his 29-run innings off 33 balls on what appeared to be a challenging pitch in Hyderabad initially. However, any doubts about the pitch's difficulty were quickly dispelled by Travis Head's explosive 89 off 30 balls and Abhishek Sharma's blistering 75 off 28 balls. Their aggressive intent and high-quality strokeplay left no room for speculation about the pitch conditions.\n\nGoenka's demeanor towards KL Rahul was nearly scolding before coach Justin Langer intervened in their intense one-sided discussion. Rahul appeared visibly uncomfortable, and upon Langer's arrival, he promptly exited the scene. Goenka's behavior drew criticism for its lack of tact, with many feeling that disappointment could have been conveyed in a more private and respectful manner, particularly considering the public scrutiny with numerous cameras capturing the incident on the field.\n\nOn a pitch where the visiting team struggled to reach 165 runs, Sunrisers Hyderabad made a mockery of the total by achieving the highest-ever run-chase inside 10 overs in T20 cricket.\n\nAlso Read: IPL 2024: SunRisers Hyderabad Thrash Lucknow Super Giants By 10 Wickets\n\nWith six losses under their belt, the Lucknow Super Giants find themselves in a precarious position, needing victories in their upcoming matches against the Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians to keep their playoff hopes alive.

It turned out to be a one-sided 10-wicket victory against Lucknow Super Giants, and the match proved to be another stepping stone for SRH this season, where they have destroyed teams with their batting firepower.\n\nHead was equally destructive, slamming 89 runs off 30 deliveries, also clattering eight fours and eight sixes in the process. What is more scary for other teams that SRH didn't even Heinrich Klaasen, Shahbaz Ahmed or Nitish Kumar Reddy to come and bat as Abhishek, Head bamboozled LSG bowlers with their shot selection and power-hitting abilities.\n\nThis wasn't the first time, both have hogged the spotlight with their aggressive approach. Abhishek already has 401 runs in 12 matches at a strike rate of 205.64, packed with two fifties. His strike rate is better than the likes of Virat Kohli (148.08), Sanju Samson (163.54), Rishabh Pant (156.43), Shivam Dube (170.73), Yashasvi Jaiswal (157.63), Suryakumar Yadav (176.71) and Rohit Sharma (152.77), who have been selected for the upcoming T20 World Cup.\n\nSpeaking on JioCinema, Mike Hesson hailed Abhishek's action-packed batting approach and pointed out his ability to play spin in the powerplay. Hesson also made a massive prediction, stating that Abhishek could be in the Team India squad post-T20 World Cup.\n\n\"Oh, look, I think so. I mean, I think his ability to take on spin in the power play. And he's improved greatly against pace. He is a high quality player. He's a boundary hitter. He is a six hitter and no doubt post World Cup, and he will start to make some changes, whether it be Jaiswal, himself or Shubman Gill. To be fair, there's a few. There's plenty of names, but he will definitely be one that will have plenty of people talking about,\" he said.\n\nIf Abhishek finds himself in the Indian squad after the ICC tournament, it could mean the end for either Rohit or Kohli. A strong opener, he could replace Rohit and open with Jaiswal or Gill. Meanwhile, he could also play in Kohli's position.\n\nSRH have climbed to third position in the standings, with 14 points in 12 matches. Their performance this season has been a trend-setter, with all franchises trying to copy their batting template.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitish_Kumar_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nitish Kumar Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JioCinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JioCinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Ahmed_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shahbaz Ahmed (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yashasvi_Jaiswal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yashasvi Jaiswal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivam_Dube", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shivam Dube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishabh_Pant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishabh Pant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanju_Samson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanju Samson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Hesson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Hesson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shubman Gill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/09/1600x900/PTI03-05-2024-000157B-0_1709719904344_1715227424073.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

We've watched that batting on TV - but that was unreal. Everything was hitting the middle of the bat, kudos to their skill.\"\n\nIt would have been extraordinary if the IPL hadn't witnessed this sort of opening platform from the pair so often already this season, with captain Cummins saying of Head's performance: \"It certainly doesn't surprise me any more.\n\n\"He's been like this for the last few years. He might not be super-conventional but he's got a great eye, hits the middle of the bat a lot and he's having a wonderful tournament.\"\n\nLooking in the sort of form that will have all Australia's World Cup opponents concerned, Head cracked 22 off Krishnappa Gowtham's second over, and then pulverised the fifth over of the innings, bowled by Naveen-ul-Haq, for another 24, to race past his half-century in just 16 balls.\n\nHe went past 500 runs for the IPL season, and moved on to 533 runs at an average of 53.30 and a strike-rate of 201.89.\n\nNo wonder he was grinning afterwards: \"Very, very good fun.\n\n\"The last 12 months being back in the Australian team, that's how they've wanted me to play and I'm not trying to change anything, just trying to maximise that powerplay.\n\n\"It's not going to work all the time but I'm going to try to be as consistent as I can, give myself the best opportunity and hopefully do my part for the team.\"\n\nHead's daring has helped the 20-over game explore new limits this season. Incredibly, he and 23-year-old Abhishek plundered 107 in just the six-over powerplay alone.\n\nIt left Cummins, who'd earlier taken the key wicket of Rahul in his 1-47 and also ran out Krunal Pandya brilliantly with a direct hit, musing a mite ruefully: \"It's difficult coming up with answers when the batters are running so hot. It seems like it's happening more and more often, unfortunately.\"\n\nBut these astonishing 'Head starts' are putting his Sunrisers in a good position to make the playoffs, with Hyderabad now third in the table on 14 points and with their net run-rate having been seriously boosted.\n\nFor Justin Langer-coached Lucknow, though, for whom Marcus Stoinis fell early for three, it was a big setback as they now lie sixth.", "source": {"uri": "aap.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "AustralianAssociatedPress"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Commentators on Jio Cinema emphasized the need for discretion in such conversations, expressing concern over the public nature of the exchange.\n\n\"You always feel these conversations should be happening behind closed doors. There are so many cameras around the stadium and they miss nothing. You know KL Rahul is now gonna go to press conferences and other things and potentially explain what's been discussed here,\" remarked one commentator.\n\nAcknowledging Rahul's composed demeanor in the face of scrutiny, commentator Scott Styris praised the captain for his professionalism.\n\n\"He has done well to keep his cool here. I think you are bang on,\" Styris noted, highlighting Rahul's ability to handle the situation with maturity.\n\nThe match witnessed an extraordinary display of batting prowess from Hyderabad openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head. In a relentless assault on Lucknow's bowlers, the duo chased down LSG's target of 165 runs in a mere 9.4 overs, achieving the milestone without losing a single wicket. With a staggering total of 14 sixes and 16 fours between them, Head and Abhishek amassed 89* off just 30 balls and 75* off 28 balls, respectively.\n\nWhile Lucknow's batting lineup struggled, managing to put up a competitive score largely due to Nicholas Pooran's unbeaten 48* off 26 balls and Ayush Badoni's 55* off 30 balls, the team ultimately faltered in defending their total.\n\nWhile the controversy surrounding the exchange between Goenka and Rahul drew attention, it couldn't overshadow the remarkable performance showcased by Sunrisers Hyderabad.

Head and Sharma cranked 16 fours and 14 sixes in an extraordinary display of power-hitting in the first-ever IPL game that saw so many runs being scored inside the first 10 overs. Head has been scoring consistently for the batting power-house of Hyderabad this season and raced to his half-century off 16 balls before he eventually finished on an unbeaten 89 off 30 balls. Sharma followed the Australian left-hander soon when he reached his 50 off 19 balls as they raced to century-stand inside the batting power play.

As fans eagerly await the outcome, weather unpredictability heightens playoff race suspense.Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) are set to clash with Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Wednesday. With both teams tied at 12 points from 11 matches, the playoff race intensifies as they vie for a spot in the top four.\n\nHowever, their aspirations face a hurdle with the looming threat of a washout due to sudden thundershowers in Hyderabad. The city's heavy rainfall has drenched SRH's home ground, raising concerns about the match's fate.\n\nAccording to AccuWeather, cloudy weather is anticipated on the match day evening, with thunderstorms and winds expected after 8 pm, carrying a 50 per cent chance of rain.\n\nA washout would grant both SRH and LSG one point each, potentially elevating them above Chennai Super Kings in the top four standings. Nonetheless, if SRH emerges victorious against the Gujarat Titans in their upcoming encounter, they could solidify their position as top contenders alongside Rajasthan Royals and Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nThe Orange Army, despite a promising start to the season, has faced setbacks, losing three of their last five matches, including a defeat against Mumbai Indians. Conversely, Lucknow faced a significant defeat in their previous match against Kolkata Knight Riders, struggling to chase down a formidable total.\n\nCurrent Standings:\n\nWith the net run rate likely to play a decisive role, SRH holds a slight advantage over LSG with a net run rate of -0.065, securing the fourth position. Meanwhile, LSG occupies the sixth spot with a run rate of -0.371. The Delhi Capitals, positioned fifth with 12 points, also pose a threat to both teams' playoff aspirations.\n\nTwo days following Hyderabad's record-high temperature of 47.1 Celsius, heavy rains brought relief to the city, lowering the mercury to 40.2 Celsius. The downpour, averaging 38.5 mm, inundated various parts of Hyderabad, with Serillingampally and Kukatpally experiencing intense spells of 133.5 mm and 117.8 mm, respectively.\n\nHowever, the heavy rainfall resulted in traffic snarls and disruptions across key locations, exacerbating commuters' frustrations. Complaints of tree falling, water logging, power cuts, and air travel disruptions further complicated the situation, highlighting the challenges posed by the sudden deluge.\n\nAs cricket enthusiasts await the outcome of the crucial SRH vs. LSG encounter, the unpredictable weather adds an element of uncertainty to the playoff race, leaving fans on the edge of their seats.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukatpally", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kukatpally"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kukatpally"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-109948129,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-150212,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

When LSG started their innings, it appeared that the surface was slower than usual and it wasn't easy to score runs. They had horrible powerplay and if it wasn't for Ayush Badoni (55* off 30) and Nicholas Pooran (48* off 26), they would have struggled to even get past the 150-run mark.\n\nRahul lauded Badoni and Pooran's efforts towards the backend of their innings but said they were about 40-50 runs short. \"Once you're on the losing side, always question marks but we thought it was a good decision to put runs on the board. Ayush and Nicholas fought well to put 166 on the board. I felt we were 40-50 short, but even if we'd got 250, they would've chased it,\" Rahul said after the match.\n\nChasing a modest target of 166, Head (89 not out, 30 balls, 8x4, 8x6) and Sharma (75 not out, 28 balls, 8x4, 6x6) toyed with LSG bowlers, finding boundaries and sixes at will to canter home in just 9.4 overs.\n\nThe win propelled SRH to the third position in the standings with 14 points from 12 games, while LSG are struggling at the sixth spot with 12 points from the same number of matches.\n\nThe result also meant that five-time champions Mumbai Indians, currently ninth with eight points from 12 matches, are out of the play-off race.\n\nRahul said he was at a loss for words to describe what Head and Sharma did. \"I'm lost for words. We've watched that batting on TV but that was unreal. Everything was hitting the middle of the bat, kudos to their skill, they've worked very hard on their six-hitting. They didn't give a chance to see what the wicket was playing like in the second innings. The pitch didn't change much. When you have two batters coming so hard in the powerplay and connecting everything from the middle, it's difficult.

Both teams have had similar campaigns this season, having won six of their 11 games apiece. Meanwhile, both these sides suffered thumping defeats in their preceding last outing. Here we decode the key player battles that can be on display.\n\nAs Travis Head has enjoyed a dream IPL 2024, LSG would want to dismiss him early. According to ESPNcricinfo, the SRH opener has a powerplay strike rate of 207.59 this season. LSG's left-arm pacer Mohsin Khan, who operates with the new ball, will be challenged by Head. Though Mohsin boasts five powerplay wickets this year, his economy in this phase reads 8.87.\n\nRuns have dried up for Heinrich Klaasen, who was sensational in the initial half of the season. However, he still remains a threat for LSG bowlers. As leg-spinners have dismissed him twice this season, Ravi Bishnoi can be unleashed against him. Notably, Klaasen smashed Bishoi for 15 runs off seven balls in their solitary face-off in IPL.\n\nAs both Bhuvneshwar Kumar and KL Rahul open the proceedings in their respective departments, they are bound to tackle each other. The veteran pacer has only dismissed Rahul once in eight IPL meetings. However, the latter owns a paltry strike rate of 120.98 in this battle. Notably, both Bhuvneshwar and Rahul have blown hot and cold this season.\n\nLSG's designated finisher Nicholas Pooran has been in excellent form. His sensational striking in the end overs can largely impact the game. T Natarajan, who is known to nail yorkers at will, would have the onus to keep him quiet. Notably, Pooran owns 42 runs off 24 deliveries against the left-arm pacer in IPL without being dismissed even once.\n\nHyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium will host this duel on May 8. The surface here will assist batters and one expects a competitive score on the board. Bowlers will want to count on their variations. The match starts at 7:30pm IST and one can watch it live on the Star Sports Network and stream on Jio Cinema.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPNcricinfo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPNcricinfo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohsin_Khan_(Indian_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohsin Khan (Indian cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bishnoi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Have the rampaging Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma run out of steam? Why is Heinrich Klaasen not providing the fireworks at the death? And is SRH's under-par bowling in the tournament finally getting exposed?\n\nThe Sunrisers are in a bit of bother. They have lost three of their last four encounters. They have posted three below-175 totals at a run-rate of 8.6 which is the worst for any team during this time-frame. Their batting average has also come crashing down to 23.4 and is again the lowest in this period.\n\nThe bowling hasn't fared much better either. SRH's combined bowling average of 39.6 is the worst for any team in the last fortnight and they have conceded three 200-plus totals in their last four matches. A poor show with the bat and ball has meant that they also have a negative net run-rate.\n\nTravis Head and Abhishek Sharma took the season by storm revolutionizing batting in the powerplay, powering the Sunrisers to record-breaking scores at the end of six overs. No pair scored more runs than the duo's 404 in the first four weeks of the tournament (till SRH's seventh encounter on the 20th of April). Their exploits included two century stands and they blasted their runs at a stunning strike rate of 254! SRH smashed some all-time records and won five of their first seven encounters.\n\nHowever, things have gone south for them thereafter. SRH have recorded just one victory in their last four matches and lost a bit of fire and momentum. One of the biggest reasons for their downslide has been the sudden loss of form of Head-Sharma at the top of the order. The pair have added just 105 runs in these four encounters with just one fifty-partnership. Their scoring rate has also come down dramatically to just 136.4!\n\nWhile Head has scored 120 runs in four innings with one half-century at a strike rate of 143, Sharma's form has taken a major hit and he has mustered just 69 runs in the four innings with a high of 31.\n\nKlaasen was in devastating form in the first seven matches hammering 268 runs in seven innings at a strike rate of 198.5 with three fifties. If Head & Sharma were providing the fireworks in the powerplay, Klaasen was blasting the opposition bowlers at the death, taking SRH to record-breaking totals.\n\nHowever, Klaasen has also witnessed a sudden dip in his form with an aggregate of just 86 in the last five encounters. He has failed in four of these matches and his strike rate has also come plummeting down to 156.4. Without any significant contribution from their ace finisher, SRH have struggled in the death overs, especially in big 200+ chases.\n\nFive of SRH's six wins this season have come batting first. More significantly, three of their five losses have come chasing down targets in excess of 200. This suggests that while their batters have created carnage setting targets, they are wilting under scoreboard pressure batting second. Two of these losses have come in the last couple of weeks when almost their entire batting line-up has collapsed.\n\nHead has scored just 45 runs in three matches at a strike rate of 132 batting second. Klaasen's strike rate has gone down from 202.5 batting first to just 156.3 in chases. Even Nitish Kumar Reddy, who has impressed in the middle-order, has registered both his fifties when SRH have batted first and his strike rate has gone down drastically from 163 to 117 while chasing.\n\nSRH have bagged just 20 wickets in their last four matches and conceded at a rate of 10.2 making them the second-most expensive unit in this period. They have conceded 200-plus totals in three encounters while MI chased down the 174-run target in 17.2 overs - this basically means that the SRH bowlers have given away runs at a rate of above 10 in their last four encounters!\n\nT Natarajan has not been as effective at the death as before and picked just three wickets at an economy of 12.4 in the last four overs. Skipper, Pat Cummins has been a touch expensive and went for above 12 an over against CSK and RCB. Bhuvneshwar Kumar hasn't found his rhythm the entire season and has gone wicket-less in five innings in the tournament. He has also conceded above 10 an over in as many matches. Marco Jansen has picked just one solitary wicket while being tonked for 13 an over in the competition while the spinners Mayank Markande and Shahbaz Ahmed have gone at above 11 per over.\n\nThe silver lining for SRH, though, is that despite the recent loss in form, they are still at number 4 on the table. They will clash with fifth-placed Lucknow Super Giants in a massive encounter in Hyderabad on Wednesday - in a contest which could potentially turn out to be a shootout for a place in the playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

They represent the ebb and flow of athletic endeavours, shaping the narrative of athletes' journeys. Cricket is one of the many sports where there has to be a winning team and a losing one at the end of the day, both having their respective moments on the field, with the side having a greater count of better junctures usually prevailing over the other.\n\nDecimations are an elusive rarity to come by, especially in a franchise league such as the Indian Premier League, where no particular team can be written off at any stage, underscoring the profound competition deeply entrenched in the roots of the tournament, which had its inaugural season way back in 2008. However, Match 57 of IPL 2024 turned out to be a crucification for one team, and a record-shattering history-bending conquest for the other.\n\nIn a vital clash between the Sunrisers Hyderabad and the Lucknow Super Giants as far as the race for the playoffs is concerned, the KL Rahul-led LSG opted to bat first, which to be frank, did not come as a surprise to many, considering the lethal pyrotechnics the SRH batters have put up this season after getting opportunities to express themselves with the bat first.\n\nA record fifth-wicket stand for LSG in their nascent IPL history between Nicholas Pooran and Ayush Badoni set up a 166-run target for the visitors after a snail-paced Rahul never got going in a laggard innings of 29 (33), followed by disappointing outings for Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis. What ensued was utter mayhem, with southpaws Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head going berserk barring the first over of the innings, in which they only managed eight runs.\n\nWith 107 being bludgeoned in the powerplay itself, it was a stroll in the park for the power-packed duo, whose 75* (28) and 89* (30) helped SRH take down the total in two deliveries less than the halfway mark, not sparing anyone off the hook, battering Krishnappa Gowtham, Yash Thakur, Ravi Bishnoi, Naveel-ul-Haq, and Badoni to every inch of the ground and beyond.\n\nHowever, what ensued was a sight that staggered a few, left a few others dumbfounded, and reduced the bulk of the onlookers and viewers into extreme bitterness. Following the drubbing, the 63-year-old owner of LSG, Sanjiv Goenka, along with his wife Preeti, were seen with Rahul on the sidelines. Goenka was seen in a very animated persona and was purportedly seen schooling the likes of the seasoned Rahul like a literal schoolboy, which did not sit well with quite a lot of individuals.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bishnoi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Thakur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yash Thakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Goenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Goenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_de_Kock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quinton de Kock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnappa_Gowtham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Krishnappa Gowtham"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1715193783431_KL-Rahul.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

It was the highest ever 10 over score in history of men's T20 cricket.\n\nBoth the southpaws hit fours and sixes for fun in what was a sensational display of power-hitting.\n\n\"The partnership with Abhi has been fantastic, he's such an exciting talent for Indian cricket. We complement each other so well and he's very very enjoyable to be around, he's so excited and thinks about the game and yeah he's got a lot of energy so it's a great partnership to be involved in,\" said Head in the post-match press conference on Wednesday.\n\nHead is in top form ahead of the T20 World Cup in the Americas next month, having aggregated 533 runs in 11 innings at an astonishing strike rate of 201.89. Sharma too has been striking at over 200.\n\n\"Whenever you're playing you want to be be as consistent as you can, you want to be getting runs. It's nice to be among the runs been nice to be playing well. That's not going to guarantee anything in the West Indies but it gives me the best chance to be in a very good mindset,\" said Head.\n\n\"Working hard on training and I think we face a fair bit of spin in the Caribbean and wickets might become tougher as the tournament goes. So very pleased with how I played spin tonight, things that I'm working on in training are somewhat working in the moment,\" he added.\n\nSharma had also earned high praise from West Indies legend Brian Lara, who is a former coach of SRH.\n\n\"Again he is someone who I met while I was batting coach of SRH. I spent two years there. I am allowed to a bit biased when I see a left-hander, I just love a left-hander.\n\n\"Myself and Abhishek have developed a very good relationship, these youngsters are very humble. they want to learn,\" Lara had said.

The contest will be a crucial one for both teams as the league stage winds down.\n\nWith six wins in 11 matches, Hyderabad are currently placed third in the standings. They will play three consecutive matches at home to round off the league stage and will hope that they can harness that advantage to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nIt might also be time for SRH to ponder upon a couple of changes, with their recent form being rather disappointing.\n\nSRH's squad for IPL 2024: Aiden Markram, Abdul Samad, Rahul Tripathi, Glenn Phillips, Heinrich Klaasen, Mayank Agarwal, Anmolpreet Singh, Upendra Yadav, Nitish Reddy, Shahbaz Ahmed, Abhishek Sharma, Marco Jansen, Washington Sundar, Sanvir Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markande, Umran Malik, T Natarajan, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Travis Head, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, Pat Cummins (c), Jaydev Unadkat, Akash Singh, Jhathavedh Subramanyan.\n\nOn that note, here is SRH's predicted playing XII (including one impact sub) for Match 57 of IPL 2024 against LSG.\n\nOpeners: Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma\n\nSRH's opening combination started IPL 2024 strongly, but both Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma have cooled off a bit lately. While it does make sense to move Abhishek down to No. 3 and open with one of Mayank Agarwal, Rahul Tripathi and Aiden Markram, the SunRisers might be hesitant to make that change at their home venue. They can be expected to go in with the same partnership at the top.\n\nMiddle Order: Mayank Agarwal, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Glenn Phillips, Abdul Samad\n\nSRH opted to use Mayank Agarwal at No. 3 in the last game. The batter has looked woefully out of touch so far in IPL 2024, but dropping him after just one game might not be on the cards. While Tripathi could be a better bet for the spot, Mayank could be given another chance.\n\nBringing back Markram is a possibility, but the SunRisers could instead turn to the power and dynamism offered by Glenn Phillips. The Kiwi could take some of the load off Heinrich Klaaseen and Nitish Kumar Reddy in the middle order.\n\nShahbaz Ahmed has offered virtually nothing to SRH throughout IPL 2024, and they could consider dropping him to field an additional bowler.\n\nLower Order: Jaydev Unadkat, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan, Mayank Markande\n\nJaydev Unadkat didn't feature in the last game, but he could prove to be a key bowler in Hyderabad. If SRH want to beef up their batting following a collapse, Sanvir Singh could be brought in once again.\n\nIt's certain that Pat Cummins needs a leg-spinner to turn to in the middle overs. Mayank Markande could thus be drafted back into the side. Umran Malik might have to wait a bit longer to feature again in IPL 2024.\n\nSRH's predicted playing XII (inc. impact sub): Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Glenn Phillips, Abdul Samad, Jaydev Unadkat, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan, Mayank Markande.\n\nOther impact sub candidates: Rahul Tripathi, Anmolpreet Singh, Sanvir Singh, Umran Malik, Shahbaz Ahmed.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sai_krishna@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Sai Krishna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Agarwal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Agarwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Samad_(Indian_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abdul Samad (Indian cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Tripathi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Tripathi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Phillips_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Phillips (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fazalhaq_Farooqi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fazalhaq Farooqi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umran_Malik", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Umran Malik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

It was the highest ever 10 over score in history of men's T20 cricket.\n\nBoth the southpaws hit fours and sixes for fun in what was a sensational display of power-hitting.\n\n\"The partnership with Abhi has been fantastic, he's such an exciting talent for Indian cricket. We complement each other so well and he's very very enjoyable to be around, he's so excited and thinks about the game and yeah he's got a lot of energy so it's a great partnership to be involved in,\" said Head in the post-match press conference on Wednesday.\n\nHead is in top form ahead of the T20 World Cup in the Americas next month, having aggregated 533 runs in 11 innings at an astonishing strike rate of 201.89. Sharma too has been striking at over 200.\n\n\"Whenever you're playing you want to be be as consistent as you can, you want to be getting runs. It's nice to be among the runs been nice to be playing well. That's not going to guarantee anything in the West Indies but it gives me the best chance to be in a very good mindset,\" said Head.\n\n\"Working hard on training and I think we face a fair bit of spin in the Caribbean and wickets might become tougher as the tournament goes.

It requires players to fulfil dual roles of smashing the ball many a mile as well as weathering the storm in case of a batting collapse and the young Ayush Badoni of Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) is performing both without making much fuss.\n\nAt just 24 years of age, Badoni is making heads turn with the kind of maturity he has and has impressed the most keen watchers of the sport. When the Delhi-born came out to bat in the 57th fixture of the Indian Premier League (IPL) season 17 Lucknow were in deep trouble with 66 for the loss of four wickets.\n\nThey needed a rescue act of the highest order and it came from their crisis man. Aware of the task at hand, Badoni stitched a 99-run partnership with his vice-captain Nicholas Pooran and helped the team post a respectable total on the scoreboard.\n\nThe right-handed batter was a bit tentative to get off the blocks and understandably so but changed gears swiftly to leave the Sunrisers Hyderabad bowlers by surprise. Badoni finished unbeaten at 55 off just 30 balls, with the help of nine fours.\n\nHe was not guilty of wasting a lot of balls while trying to get his eyes in and outscored Pooran at the end at a strike rate of 183.33 with the help of nine fours.\n\nNotably, Badoni has been with Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) since their maiden season (IPL 2022). Lucknow Super Giants bought him at the IPL 2022 mega auction for Rs 20 lakhs.\n\nThe right-handed batter is in the budding stage of his career. He has played 40 games in the lucrative tournament and aggregated 606 runs at a strike rate of 133.48.

The right-handed batter scored an unbeaten 55 runs off 30 deliveries at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Wednesday, May 8, to help LSG post a competitive 165-4 in the first innings.\n\nThe visitors struggled on a slow pitch and were reduced to 66/4 in the 11th over, at which point, Ayush Badoni came out to bat. The youngster had Nicholas Pooran for company at the other end, and the pair had the task of repairing the innings, which at that moment arguably looked beyond repair.\n\nBadoni started cautiously as the situation demanded, before taking on T Natarajan for three boundaries in the 14th over. He continued his onslaught against the left-arm pacer, scoring three more boundaries against him. However, the highlight of his innings came in the final over, when he pulled off a reverse lap against Pat Cummins right after reaching the 50-run mark.\n\n\"Little pocket dynamite Ayush Badoni is reverse sweeping Patrick James Cummins with ease,\" another fan remarked.\n\n\"Badoni has given life to this game,\" one tweet read.\n\n\"It's not a wicket where you can go from ball one\" - Ayush Badoni\n\nNicholas Pooran and Ayush Badoni finished with strike rates of 184 and 183 respectively, but the next best strike rate was Krunal Pandya's 114 while the entire top order remained stuck in two digits.\n\n\"The wicket was on the slower side, just wanted to take it deep and just play cricketing shots, didn't want to throw my wicket away. It's not a wicket where you can go from ball one. The bowlers were bowling short slower balls, so I was looking to find the gap on the shorter square. It's a good score if the dew doesn't come, I think our bowlers will defend it. As of now, there's no dew,\" Badoni said during the innings break.\n\nAyush Badoni's innings has given LSG a chance in the must-win clash. The visitors began with Krishnappa Gowtham with the new ball against the left-handed duo of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma.

Lucknow scored 27/2 in the powerplay - which is their lowest in this season; they also managed to hit one boundary, which came off Rahul's willow in the second over with a majestic six off Pat Cummins' delivery. Meanwhile, the visitors had to wait till the 10th over to get their first four of the innings.\n\nIt turned out to be the second-slowest knock in the IPL this season after playing 30-plus balls.\n\nRahul was dismissed on the final ball of the 10th over as in the attempt to hit a big shot; he was caught by T Natarajan at long leg.\n\nThe fans on social media bashed him for his slow knock.\n\nLSG lost Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis early in the powerplay, which put Rahul on the backfoot, but he failed to up the ante when it was needed.\n\nEarlier, Rahul won the toss and elected to bat against Cummins and Co. in Hyderabad.\n\nRahul said they have made a few changes in the playing eleven.

This means even the smallest of mistakes are off the table. They need to be at their level best, starting with fielding their first 11 men in Hyderabad.\n\nAfter their losses to Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK), they made the big call to drop former captain Aiden Markram for all-rounder Marco Jansen. Now, even though Jansen is one of the most exciting and talented prospects in world cricket, he doesn't quite fit the needs of the current SRH setup.\n\nBelow, we make a case of why he needs to be dropped for the LSG game for a batter:\n\n#3 Too many pacers\n\nUsually in the second half of an IPL season, teams start to realize the importance of spinners as the pitches slow down and take a bit of turn. SRH have gone the opposite direction by not only dropping Mayank Markande but also playing as many as four specialist seamers despite having the luxury of boasting Nitish Reddy in their ranks.\n\nJansen has conceded almost 80 runs for just one wicket in two games. Markande, on the other hand, was finally coming to his own this season, with eight wickets in seven games. Before he got dropped, he had bowled spells of 2/46, 2/26, and 1/42.\n\nJansen has the x-factor with the new ball but SRH can replace that by bowling an over each from Pat Cummins and T Natarajan. It'll still leave them six overs for their best middle and death-overs pacer.\n\nWithout an attacking spinner, SRH couldn't break the monotony against MI, something that Kolkata Knight Riders did pretty well against a similar assault from Suryakumar Yadav in the previous game.\n\n#2 The batting wasn't broken, now it is\n\nSRH's whole identity at the start of the season was having one of the most fearsome batting lineups with a bowling attack that could back it up. Even Pat Cummins' body language and statements throughout the season said the same. By dropping Markram they upended that identity in the middle of the season.\n\nMarkram wasn't in great form but he gave confidence to Travis Head and Heinrich Klaasen on the other end and his 30s and 40s were crucial SRH's early wins.\n\nAnd it's not like SRH are completely committed to becoming a bowling-first side. They brought back Mayank Agarwal, who was in an even worse form in the initial games, in the Markram spot against MI, only to see him get out for 5 (6). Then, when the batting still didn't click, they brought in Sanvir Singh and didn't give him the ball in the second innings. The impact player just batted for eight balls.\n\nNow, SRH are still batting deep (because Jansen is a handy batter) but have given up the middle-order steel which bridged the ultra-aggressive top order with the likes of Abdul Samad, Shabaz, and Cummins in the lower order. The best aspect of their team is now broken when, despite the two losses, it didn't need to be fixed.\n\n#3 SRH have bigger match-winners available\n\nSometimes, more than the typical balance of a team, T20 sides prefer picking their biggest match-winners and building the team around them. SRH seemed to be doing the same in the first half of the season and Reddy's unexpected contributions with both bat and ball vindicated their strategy.\n\nJansen, despite his obvious quality, isn't a bigger match-winner than Glenn Phillips. The wicketkeeper-batter is not only one of the best middle-order hitters in T20s in the world but also a handy spinner and probably the best fielder in IPL 2024 with the ability to change games with his catches and out-fielding alone.\n\nIf Markram's form was the issue, SRH could have simply brought in Phillips, who would have played the same role better than Mayank without forcing them to go against the philosophy. If he replaces Jansen now, alongside Markande coming in for Mayank, it would strengthen both weak spots for SRH.\n\nThen, SRH can also bring back Jaydev Unadkat, who had eight wickets in as many games, for Sanvir Singh as their impact player to support Bhuvneshwar Kumar with the new ball. In this way, they'll have three spinners, three pacers, and a much better batting order alongside more flexibility for the impact player rule.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rudransh_khurana@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Rudransh Khurana", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

The young opener's knock of 75* off just 28 balls helped SRH chase down 166 in just 9.4 overs with all wickets intact.\n\nHis free-flowing stroke play drew comparisons from cricketer-turned-commentator Aakash Chopra to the batting style of Indian legend Yuvraj Singh. LSG posted 165/4 after electing to bat first, thanks to useful knocks from Nicholas Pooran (48* off 26) and Ayush Badoni (55* off 30) the visitors reached a defending total.\n\nWhile the total seemed competitive, it proved to be a cakewalk for SRH's openers Abhishek and Travis Head (89* off 30). The duo smashed an incredible 107 runs in the powerplay to register a comprehensive 10-wicket victory.\n\nAlso read: I and Travis Head have become good friends off the pitch, have started spending more time: Abhishek Sharma\n\nAnalysing the innings on his YouTube channel, Chopra was all in praise for the Punjab-born's clean hitting.\n\n\"Abhishek Sharma is a very good story. If I compare their (Abhishek and Head's) hitting styles, Abhishek's style seems cleaner to me. The backlift comes nicely, it reminds you slightly of Yuvraj Singh, and the downswing is very good. You see a class in his batting,\" he said.\n\nThe former India batter drew a contrast with Abhishek's opening partner, Head. \"It seems like Head is taking people's class, as though he is just beating them up, and it seems just like an extension of cricketing shots in his (Abhishek's) case. He also hits sixes. He hit six sixes and eight fours and scored 75 runs off 28 balls. If Travis Head had a strike rate of 296, he also had a strike rate close to 270,\" Chopra added.\n\nAlso read: Yuvraj Singh peps up Abhishek Sharma further after yet another blistering knock\n\nChopra felt Abhishek's exploits should soon earn him an India call-up. \"I feel Abhishek Sharma should be in the Indian team not too long from now. His name should come in the Indian team. We cannot say that we don't have strikers. We have many. You can see Abhishek Sharma. After that, Yashasvi Jaiswal hits at the top,\" he further added.\n\nSharma has repeatedly thanked the former India all-rounder for his assistance and guidance in nourishing his game. Yuvraj has been a huge supporter of Sharma and has been seen mentoring and coaching with the youngster on numerous occasions.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayush_Badoni", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayush Badoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pooran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Pooran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuvraj_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yuvraj Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yashasvi_Jaiswal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yashasvi Jaiswal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1715240132462_ABhishek-Sharma-and-Yuvraj-Singh.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

Was it a hurricane - a remnant of the one that lingered across the city's limits on Tuesday night - or was it the solidification of the qualification hopes of the franchise representing the Deccan in the Indian Premier League?\n\nWith this massive ten-wicket win that they achieved within ten overs over Lucknow Super Giants at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in the city on Wednesday, SunRisers Hyderabad sent a message to all their opponents in the league - they are here to win the title, or break a few bones.\n\nAbhishek Sharma (75*) and Travis Head (89*) quite gently undid what their bowlers had vicariously achieved in the slog overs by allowing Nicholas Pooran and Ayush Badoni to run amok on Uppal's lush green expanses.\n\nWhen, for long periods, it appeared as if SRH would restrict their opponents to a lowly total, their bowling imploded at the wrong time, sending a message to everyone at the ground - as well as those watching on TV - that they could not be trusted.\n\nHowever, all concepts of distrust in the side's ability to finish what they had started earlier this tournament seemed to vanish in thin air once Travis Head took two big strides to step out to Krishnappa Gowtham and launch into a massive hit over his head.\n\nHe repeated that more than a few times in that over, but by then, both LSG and the onlookers who had made the trip east from the city centre via metro owing to the shoddy weather, were deflated beyond relief. There did not seem to be enough empty seats - or variations in LSG's armoury - as the game drew to a close.\n\nBy then, Head's dance had just begun.\n\nAbhishek Sharma's elegance surpassed the floodlight failure\n\nAbhishek, from the other end, merely wanted to match his older teammate's antics on the field, but seemed to many, to outwit - and even outlast - the latter completely by the time the non-functioning of the floodlights was forgotten.\n\nHis cover drives glorious and inside-out shots devious, Abhishek appeared in all his glory - and for all intents and purposes - chasing down a total that far exceeded the paltry 166 LSG had set in his mind.\n\nNo sooner than Head had started dictating his authority from one end of the pitch than Abhishek was roused strongly enough to domineer that which he felt was rightfully his, and that which he would not let go, despite KL Rahul's awkward shrugs.\n\nSRH - if they had not done so before - have now earmarked themselves as the biggest contenders of the trophy this season. That which has eluded them since 2017 seems now to be close at hand, and all they can do to grasp it is by not believing in their own hype.\n\nTheir bowlers, who seemed at peace with their own bearings until the final few overs of the LSG innings, will need some soul-searching to make sure that the playoff berth - the first stop on the way to winning the title - is not fluffed. It may seem easier said than done.\n\nThe rest of their batters - many of whom have come up short when pushed to the wall in the rare case of a Head failure - will have to step up at the right time to ensure that the Chennai-owned franchise has a chance of tasting silverware again.\n\nLed by Pat Cummins - who has enough experience of winning titles to know that they are not done in a day - the Eagles will be perceptive enough to realise that with such intimidating performances, the eyes of everyone in the league will be upon them.

In the last fixture, Mumbai Indians defeated SRH by 7 wickets, currently the franchise is placed in the 4th position with 6 wins in 11 matches.\n\nIn contrast, LSG has registered their place in the 5th position while facing their last defeat by a massive margin of 98 runs against Kolkata Knight Riders. KL Rahul & Co. will want to win this match and get back their winning momentum.\n\nSo, as the teams are gearing up for another action-packed encounter, let's take a look at how the surface of the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium is expected to behave throughout the contest.\n\nThe pitch at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium is generally a flat and hard track with assists the spinners. The seamers are not likely to get much help from the surface.\n\nThere is a minimal amount of bounce available from the pitch that is likely helpful for the batters to play their shots easily particularly when facing the hard new ball at the initial stage of the game.\n\nBoth teams have plenty of hard hitters, so we can expect a high-scoring game. Ideally, the team winning the toss considers fielding first keeping in mind the dew factor in Hyderabad.", "source": {"uri": "cricket.one", "dataType": "news", "title": "OneCricket"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Chasing a target of 166, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma produced stunning performances to end the match in just 9.4 overs - the fastest ever in an 100+ run chase. After the end of the match, LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka was caught on camera having an animated conversation with Rahul - something that has left the internet fuming. Experts also weighed in on the topic on Jio Cinema with the opinion that such conversations should happen behind closed doors and these images are never helpful for any team.\n\n\"You always feel these conversations should be happening behind closed doors.

I'm very happy with the way we were able to go about it outside the PowerPlay, pick our targets, and grab it. Yeah, kept the job done,\" Head informed the media after the match.\n\n\"We spoke about net run-rate (NRR) being important and keeping the foot down. So, very pleased [with] how it turned out. I don't think you could have ever expected chasing it like that,\" he said.\n\nALSO READ: SRH vs LSG Match Highlights in Pictures\n\n\"You know that the PowerPlay is important. Trying to maximise that, and we played beautifully. We were able to get ahead of the rate, which was nice,\" the explosive opener from Australia said. \"We played really well here. It suited us and our game plan,\" he added.\n\n\"Once we got going in those first two or three overs, it was just about trying to maximise that as much as we can. But, we picked our targets and then played really well. You always want to perform, be consistent and try to be doing the job. Yes, it's not always going to happen in T-20 cricket,\" Head explained.\n\nOn his partnership with Abhishek, Head said he liked the way they had been playing. \"We are going to have ups and downs. We've had that.\"\n\n\"Partnership with Abhi's been fantastic. He's such an exciting talent for Indian cricket and exceptional. I think we complement each other so well and he's very, very enjoyable to be around. He's so excited and thinks about the game and got a lot of energy.\"\n\n\"So, nice to be able to do the job tonight. Chasing and looking forward to the next two games being at home as well. So, it's very exciting,\" Head added on playing the next two games also at home.\n\nReflecting on how SRH won tonight, Head said it was important to win at home. \" If you can win at home and then sneak a couple of away wins, you give yourself the best chance,\" he said.\n\nOn the next two games, Head informed that they would have a few days off now. \" We've got a pretty big break before our next couple of games, but I think that comes at a good time. Everyone goes into that break excited and energised and then we've got two home games,\" he said.\n\nOn his first season with SRH franchisee, Head said he loved it. \"Obviously, not knowing a lot before I came here and being fortunate to have a couple of familiar faces in Pat (captain Cummins) and Dan (head coach Daniel Vettori) and obviously hearing great things about the ground and the crowd and whatnot,\" he said.\n\nQuestioned whether IPL form is crucial ahead of the T20 World Cup, Head said it had been nice to be amongst runs and playing well.\n\n\"That's not going to guarantee anything in the West Indies, but it gives me the best chance of being in a really good mindset, working hard at training. I think we'll face a fair bit of spin in the Caribbean, and the wickets might become tougher as the tournament goes,\" he said about the World Cup.\n\nALSO READ: PBKS vs RCB head-to-head, IPL 24\n\n\"So, I'm very pleased with how I was able to play spin tonight, and the things that I'm working on at training are somewhat working at the moment. But, I'm trying to stay relaxed, as I have done for the last couple of years, and be ready to go.\"\n\nHead didn't agree that SRH fortunes depend a lot on the openers' success.\n\n\"I guess that Kings game is a good blueprint for us in the way we went about that game. It's not always going to work at the top of the order. We're going to lose wickets, but we want to be brave through the whole middle... I think we have got real consistency through,\" Head explained.\n\n\"So, I think we're not dependent on the top order. Yes, we're playing well, but I don't think it defines the team. I felt like we've got a really strong middle order, and when we're in those positions, we're able to find ourselves to get to a score.\"\n\nLatest on SportstarLSG vs SRH, IPL 2024: Head's form keeping him in a \"good mindset\" but says nothing is guaranteed in T20 World CupV.

Leading the Super Giants after his India snub for matchday 53 of the Indian Premier League 2024, Rahul recorded a forgetful outing against Shreyas Iyer's Kolkata Knight Riders at home. Hosts LSG were outplayed by KKR as Rahul and Co. scripted an embarrassing record in the IPL 2024.\n\nReflecting on LSG's painful loss to KKR in the ongoing edition of the cash-rich league, legendary Australian pacer Brett Lee questioned the batting intent of Lucknow skipper Rahul. Tasked to chase down a gigantic total of 235 against the mighty Knight Riders, LSG needed a rollicking start from openers Rahul and Arshin Kulkarni. While Kulkarni departed for 9 off 7 balls, Rahul perished for 25 off 21 balls.\n\nALSO READ: Gautam Gambhir straightaway sends out tactical message to Shreyas Iyer, erupts on Nicholas Pooran's dismissal vs KKR\n\n\"I think if you look at both opening batters from both sides, it's a complete contrast. KKR have got it right. They're out of the blocks quickly, they're scoring runs. And then you got KL Rahul on the other side, that's, you know, getting a run a ball and putting a lot of pressure on the back end. You know, we saw four games and I picked KL Rahul here, the first four games he played. His strike rate was 129, then he went to 150 and now he's come back and said, 'well, yeah, you know the bowlers have done a great job. I think there's a lot of pressure on him because he hasn't scored the runs he should be,\" Lee told Jio Cinema.\n\nRahul scored three boundaries and batted at a strike rate of 119 against the KKR bowlers. After Rahul's exit, Marcus Stoinis scored 36 off 21 balls as LSG surrendered for 137 in 16.1 overs. Star bowlers Harshit Rana and Varun Chakaravarthy shared six wickets to set up KKR's 98-run win over LSG at Lucknow. With the win over Rahul's men, KKR have replaced Rajasthan Royals at the top of the IPL 2024 standings.\n\nRahul was upstaged by Sanju Samson and Rishabh Pant for the wicketkeeper's spots in the Indian T20 World Cup squad. Pant and Samson scored runs with a better strike rate than Rahul when India picked its squad for the ICC event. Rahul has scored 431 runs in 11 games at the IPL 2024.

We complement each other so well and he's very very enjoyable to be around, he's so excited and thinks about the game and yeah he's got a lot of energy so it's a great parnership to be involved in,\" said Head in the post-match press conference.\n\nNotably, Head (89* off 30) and Abhishek (75* off 28) made a mockery of LSG's modest total of 165/4 by chasing it down in just 9.4 overs. The duo registered the fastest 100-run partnership in IPL history off just 30 balls and broke their own record. Both players have been striking at over 200 this season and have given sleepless nights to several bowling line ups.\n\nFurther speaking ahead, Head spoke about how his current form will affect his performance in the T20 World Cup 2024 and said that it doesn't guarantee anything. However, the southpaw is happy with his current form and the way he's been playing spin in the tournament so far.\n\n\"Whenever you're playing you wanna be as consistent as you can, you want to be getting runs. It's nice to be among the runs been nice to be playing well. That's not going to guarantee anything in the West Indies but it gives me the best chance to be in a very good mindset. Working hard on training and I think we face a fair bit of spin in the Caribbean and wickets might become tougher as the tournament goes. So very pleased with how I played spin tonight, things that I'm working on in training are somewhat working in the moment but fair to say reflexes that I've done for the last couple of years and be ready to go,\" he added.\n\nHead is the third-highest run scorer of the IPL 2024 so far, having 533 runs to his name from 11 innings at an average of 53.30 and a strike rate of 201.89 with one hundred and four fifties to his name. The 30-year-old has already won his team the World Test Championship and ODI World Cup with his remarkable performances. He will now be eager to stake claim on his third ICC trophy with another prolific run in the upcoming mega event.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC World Test Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/travis-head--abhishek-sharma-083938155-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=Sg0ibJmoOSGleVMpnPDyI.wOMIZ5_RBD", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 100, "relevance": 1}

If the game gets washed out, both teams will share a point each\n\nThe Sunrisers Hyderabad will look to inch closer to the knockouts as they host Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) on Wednesday evening at Uppal. Both teams have 12 points in their kitty but are placed differently on the table. SRH are positioned third at the moment with a Net Run Rate of -0.065 whereas Lucknow are sixth with -0.371 NRR. Whichever team wins will jump up to take the third spot, displacing defending champions Chennai Super Kings but the question looms over the conduct of the game as the weather is likely to play spoilsport.\n\nComplete List of T20 World Cup 2024 Squads\n\nThe capital city of Telangana has been facing a sudden thunderstorm lately. The showers have brought much-needed relief from the heat wave but it's likely to affect the Wednesday match results. Meanwhile, a video is going viral on social media in which Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi Stadium could be seen drenched in rain with covers all over the field.\n\nThe weather forecast raises concern as it predicts rain on match day as well. If the game gets washed out, both teams will share a point each and notch the third and fourth position based on their NRR. However, CSK will have a clear advantage. If the Ruturaj Gaikwad-led side wins their next game against GT on Friday, they will head back to third place with 14 points.\n\nBoth LSG and SRH will be then left with 2 more games and will have to exhibit their best in those matches to compete for the last two spots. On the other hand, RR and KKR are comfortably placed on the top half of the table, almost confirming their selection for the knockouts.\n\nThe Pat Cummins-led side has ample talent but has been unable to hold on to a winning run recently. Sunrisers have lost three of their last four matches, mainly because their destructive batting line-up hasn't delivered.\n\nLSG, on the other hand, have to get over their overall lacklustre display against Kolkata Knight Riders, when they not only conceded the first-ever 200-plus score at the Ekana Stadium but also folded their innings at 137.\n\nWith tearaway pacer Mayank Yadav ruled out of the IPL and left-arm pacer Mohsin Khan also picking up an injury, the onus will be on Afghan quick Naveen-ul-Haq, young Yash Thakur, Stoinis and spinners Krunal Pandya and Ravi Bishnoi to deliver.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Yadav", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohsin_Khan_(Indian_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohsin Khan (Indian cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bishnoi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Thakur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yash Thakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krunal_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Krunal Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naveen-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/hyderabad-weather-may-play-spoilsport-on-wednesday-2024-05-47e18313f6bbabe62129251451093c4b-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 99, "relevance": 1}

Rahul managed 29 off 33 balls before getting out against the SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Wednesday (May 8).\n\nLSG won the toss and opted to bat to put runs on the scoreboard in a must-win game for both teams. However, the decision backfired as Lucknow batters struggled to get going on a wicket that was slow and assisted spinners.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar was the first bowler to provide breakthroughs, dismissing Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis cheaply. However, Rahul held the innings tightly from one end to help his side crawl to 27/2 in the first six overs.\n\nKL Rahul stitched together a good partnership with Krunal Pandya before trying to take the attack to the opposition in the 10th over. He hit his counterpart, Pat Cummins, for a boundary of the first ball before holing out to T Natarajan at fine leg in the final delivery of the over.\n\nFans were extremely annoyed with KL Rahul's sluggish knock and slammed him on social media. Here are a few reactions:\n\nA few fans also asserted that Rahul is justifying the BCCI's decision to leave him out of India's 2024 T20 World Cup squad with his below-par performances in the IPL 2024.\n\n\"KL Rahul not even playing Run a ball, he is justifying BCCI for dropping him from world cup squad. Thank you Ajit Agarkar for saving us from this terror,\" a fan wrote.\n\n\"Thank You @BCCI for removing Parasite named KL Rahul urf BKL from India's T20 setup!! I hope they kick him out of ODIs & Tests too, we have Samson & Dhruv now to keep in those 2 formats. Remove this parasite from all formats!!\" another fan commented.\n\n\"KL Rahul showing why he was not an ideal Wicket Keeper option,\" wrote another fan.\n\nKL Rahul not named in India's 2024 T20 World Cup squad\n\nWith too many players vying for the wicketkeeper's slot, Indian selectors went with Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson as dedicated glovesmen for the 2024 T20 World Cup. They had to leave out the likes of KL Rahul, Dinesh Karthik and Jitesh Sharma.\n\nWhile Karthik should feel unlucky to miss out despite being in stellar form in the IPL, Jitesh went down in the pecking order due to worrying form for the Punjab Kings.\n\nKL Rahul, meanwhile, gave a good account for himself with the bat, but his inability to convert the starts into big knocks played a part in his ouster.

In the same game, KKR's openers, Phil Salt and Sunil Narine smashed 70 runs in the powerplay, of which Narine nailed 31 runs in 16 balls.\n\nIt was quite bizarre how KL Rahul just looked for the singles in the fifth over of the chase, and with the pressure of the required run rate, he smashed the ball straight into the hands of the deep point fielder. The team scripted an embarrassing defeat by 98 runs to LSG.\n\nAmong those who have played 50 balls in the first six overs of this IPL 2024 so far, KL Rahul's strike rate of 138.32 is the 19th highest among 28 players.

The 2007 champions, instead, went for Shubman Gill as the backup option.\n\n'You know, we saw four games, and I picked KL Raul here, the first four games he played.

A win against MI will help them leapfrog the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) into third position and improve their chances of qualifying for the playoffs.\n\nIn a video shared on his YouTube channel, Chopra picked Head as the first SRH player in focus in Monday's game. He urged the MI bowlers to bombard him with bouncers.\n\n\"Let's go with Travis Head. You will have Jasprit Bumrah, Nuwan Thushara or Gerald Coetzee in front of him. It will be a good contest. It will be worth seeing how Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma play together. I am still saying you should bowl bouncers if you see Travis Head. If you don't dent his confidence now, you will repent when the T20 World Cup comes,\" he reasoned (9:50).\n\n\"We have already repented a lot at the world events. Travis Head has hit us a lot. So please try to figure out a way to get him out. From Hyderabad's point of view, if Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma fire, they reach close to 100 in six overs and this will be that sort of pitch as well,\" the former India opener added.\n\nWith 396 runs at a strike rate of 194.11 in nine innings, Head is SRH's highest run-scorer in IPL 2024. The Australian left-handed batter smashed match-winning centuries in last year's World Test Championship and ODI World Cup finals against India.\n\n\"You will have to go towards him because he is that sort of player\" - Aakash Chopra on SRH's Heinrich Klaasen\n\nAakash Chopra chose Heinrich Klaasen as the second SunRisers Hyderabad player to watch out for against the Mumbai Indians.\n\n\"After that, Heinrich Klaasen, without doubt. You will have to go towards him because he is that sort of player. When you see the small ground, Piyush Chawla will be the only threat in the opposition. The rest of the spin will not be that attacking or effective,\" he explained (10:35).\n\n\"You will definitely use (Jasprit) Bumrah as a match-up but Heinrich Klaasen scored a 19-ball 42 in the last match he played and hit a lot of sixes in the 277-run match. So Heinrich Klaasen is my second guy,\" the renowned commentator added.\n\nChopra picked SRH skipper Pat Cummins as the crucial bowler for the visitors.\n\n\"The third is Pat Cummins. The Mumbai crowd is very partisan, there is deafening noise, but he keeps coming and saying that he enjoys silencing the crowd. Pat Cummins, small ground, let's see how he bowls. So Pat Cummins the captain and Pat Cummins the bowler,\" he elaborated.\n\nWith 12 scalps in 10 games, Cummins is SRH's second-highest wicket-taker in IPL 2024.

LSG welcomed the Kolkata Knight Riders at the Ekana stadium last night for the reverse fixture. The visitors after posting that target, eventually claimed victory and completed the double over LSG with a 98-run victory.\n\nWhile speaking to Jio Cinema after the Kolkata Knight Riders defeated Lucknow Super Giants, Brett Lee had quite a few things to say about KL Rahul. Lee started off by highlighting Rahul's slow approach and compared his 25-run knock to that of the KKR openers. He claimed that there was a contrasting difference between Rahul's and Salt-Narine's approach.\n\nBrett Lee then admitted that KL Rahul played extremely slowly right from the beginning of the match, scoring runs at a run-a-ball pace. Rahul's slow approach in turn impacted the game totally for LSG as the following batters gave away their wicket quickly in trying to smear every single ball.\n\nThe former right-arm pacer then claimed that KL Rahul is under immense pressure all because he has not been able to score runs in IPL 2024. If we talk about Rahul's figures this season, then he has scored 431 runs from 11 league matches so far at a strike rate of 141.31. He is averaging 39.18 and has 3 half-centuries to his name.\n\nAs a result of his poor form and slow approach, Rahul was not picked by the chief Indian selection committee for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup 2024. Instead of his inclusion as the wicket-keeper batsman, the selectors went with Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson and Delhi Capitals skipper Rishabh Pant in the 15-man squad.\n\n\"I think if you look at both opening batters from both sides, it's a complete contrast. KKR have got it right. They're out of the blocks quickly, they're scoring runs. And then you got KL Rahul on the other side, that's, you know, getting a run a ball and putting a lot of pressure on the back end.\"\n\n\"You know, we saw four games and I picked KL Rahul here, the first four games he played. His strike rate was 129, then he went to 150 and now he's come back and said, 'Well, yeah, you know the bowlers have done a great job. I think there's a lot of pressure on him because he hasn't scored the runs he should be.\" - Brett Lee said via Jio Cinema.\n\nWhile speaking in the post-match interview, KL Rahul shed light on his team's shambolic 98-run loss. He claimed that LSG were poor across all departments and that there were quite too many runs on the board to score. \"We didn't (hit our lengths on a consistent basis), just been a poor performance overall with bat, ball and in the field.\" - Rahul said.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

Still, 17 matches to go in the season, and we're on track to witness a record-breaking number of maximums in IPL history.\n\nThe ongoing match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants saw the 1000th six of the campaign. Opting to bat first, LSG lost Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis with the new ball as Bhuvneshwar Kumar struck twice in successive overs.\n\nThe visitors needed a build-up job and KL Rahul and Krunal Pandya answered the call. The duo counter-attacked and hit quickfire boundaries, including three sixes, to put the pressure back on SRH bowlers.\n\nThe landmark of 1000 sixes was achieved in the eighth over when Krunal Pandya hit back-to-back sixes off the bowling of Jaydev Unadkat. It is only the third time in the history of the tournament that 1000 sixes have been hit.\n\nIPL 2024 continued the trend of 1000+ sixes in a season after 1062 sixes in 2022 and 1124 in 2023.\n\nThe highest number of sixes (1124) was hit in the 2023 season but the mark was achieved in 74 matches and 15390 balls.

Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis has produced a couple of rescue acts in the middle, helping LSG remain in the top 4, but when it comes to the performances from the top-order, especially skipper Rahul, the franchise has been left wanting. Rahul, in the match against Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday where Lucknow were chasing a target of 236, could only score 25 off 21.\n\nAustralian cricket legend Brett Lee, mincing no words, feels Rahul's approach at the top is putting a lot of pressure on LSG's middle-order.\n\n\"I think if you look at both opening batters from both sides, it's a complete contrast. KKR have got it right. They're out of the blocks quickly, they're scoring runs. And then you got KL Rahul on the other side, that's, you know, getting a run a ball and putting a lot of pressure on the back end. You know, we saw four games and I picked KL Rahul here, the first four games he played,\" he said on Jio Cinema.\n\n\"His strike rate was 129, then he went to 150 and now he's come back and said, 'well, yeah, you know the bowlers have done a great job. I think there's a lot of pressure on him because he hasn't scored the runs he should be,\" Brett Lee added.\n\nAfter the game, Rahul himself admitted that his team failed to click in all three departments of the game - batting, bowling and fielding.\n\n\"It was a lot of runs to be scored in the second innings. When you are chasing a big total, you are trying to go too hard and you end up losing wickets. Just a poor performance overall. We didn't (hit our lengths on a consistent basis), just been a poor performance overall with bat, ball and in the field. Sunil Narine and Phil Salt, in the powerplay, we've seen how they bat and they do put a lot of pressure on the opposition. Our young bowlers couldn't handle that kind of pressure and he hit some really good shots. That's how IPL is, you come up against really good players and that's when your character is tested.

They are third in the league standings.\n\nHead's explosive batting has kept him third among the highest run scorers in the tournament, just behind India's former skipper Virat Kohli (542 runs) and Ruturaj Gaikwad (541).\n\n\"Whenever you're playing, you want to be as consistent as you can, you want to be getting runs,\" Head told reporters after Wednesday's victory.\n\n\"It's nice to be in the runs, it's nice to be playing well [but] that's not going to guarantee anything in the West Indies,\" he added, referring to the T20 World Cup which will be held in the United States and the Caribbean.\n\n\"But it gives me the best chance of being in a really good mindset [and] working hard at training.\"\n\nHead, whose century helped Australia beat India in the 2023 ODI World Cup final, expects turning tracks at the June 1-29 World Cup, unlike the flat tracks he is facing at the IPL on Indian soil.\n\n\"I think we'll face a fair bit of spin in the Caribbean, and the wickets might become tougher as the tournament goes,\" he said.\n\n\"So, I'm very pleased with how I was able to play spin tonight, and the things that I'm working on at training are somewhat working at the moment. But, I'm trying to stay relaxed, as I have done for the last couple of years, and be ready to go.\"\n\nHead said he is trying to maximize his performance during the powerplay and the batter proved that during Wednesday's victory, where he and his partner, Abhishek Sharma, smashed 107 runs in the six-over period.\n\n\"The last 12 months being back in the Australian team, that's how they've wanted me to play and I'm not trying to change anything, just trying to maximize that powerplay,\" Head said.\n\n\"It's not going to work all the time but I'm going to try to be as consistent as I can, give myself the best opportunity and hopefully do my part for the team.\"\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad captain and Head's Australian teammate Pat Cummins was in awe of his extraordinary display.\n\n\"It certainly doesn't surprise me anymore,\" Cummins said. \"He's been like this for the last few years. He might not be super-conventional but he's got a great eye, hits the middle of the bat a lot and he's having a wonderful tournament.\"\n\nAustralia open their T20 World Cup campaign against Oman in

How else do you explain, let alone justify the carnage left behind following their 10-wicket mauling of the Lucknow Super Giants last evening in Hyderabad? Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma - the two key men responsible for SRH's resurgence this season - spared no one, gunning down a target of 166 in just 9.4 overs. Not even 10. Let that sink in. 58 balls bowled in total out of which 14 were carted for sixes and another 16 for fours. It was game set and match just 45 minutes into the second innings.\n\nTravis Head was once again miraculous for his 89 not out off 30 balls, but his partner Abhishek Sharma showed selectors they may have made a mistake by leaving him out of India's T20 World Cup squad. The 23-year-old left-handed batter smashed an unbeaten 75 off 28 balls and after SRH made a mockery of LSG's total of 165, Sharma credited the man who's played a huge role in his career. The one and only Yuvraj Singh.\n\n\"I think the hard work I put in before the tournament is showing now, thanks to Yuvi Paaji, Brian (Lara) as well and my father, who is my first coach,\" he said after the match.\n\nShortly after, Yuvraj responded to the youngster. Sharing a spirited message for Abhishek on the social media platform, the two-time World Cup winner for India, urged the batter to stay positive. Abhishek was one of the talked-about names for India's T20 World Cup squad, but missed out. However, given his form, Yuvraj, who himself had said that Abhishek was not ready, pointed out his 'time will come' while also reserving praise for Head.\n\n\"Well played @IamAbhiSharma4. Be consistent be patient! Your time is around the corner! @travishead34 what planet are you batting my friend? Unreal!!! #SRHvsLSG #IPL2024,\" posted Yuvraj.\n\nWith 401 runs from 12 matches at an average of 36.45 and strike-rate of 205.6 including two half-centuries, Abhishek is 11th on the list of highest run-scorers of the season, while his opening partner Head is third, next only to Virat Kohli ad Ruturaj Gaikwad having amassed 533 runs including four fifties and a century. This is to go with an average of 53.3 and a strike-rate reading of 201.8.\n\nMore importantly, Head's incredible form is a warning sign for India at the T20 World Cup. Having already faced the opener's brunt twice in ICC finals - the World Test Championship and World Cup last year - the Men in Blue must devise a plan to stop a hat-trick of onslaughts should these two teams come face-to-face in the T20 World Cup.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuvraj_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yuvraj Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC World Test Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruturaj_Gaikwad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruturaj Gaikwad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/09/1600x900/abhishek-yuvraj-ani-getty_1715225066165_1715225074338.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 93, "relevance": 1}

Travis Head also played an excellent knock of 89* off 30 balls to help the former champions chase down a 166-run target with ease.\n\nOn the back of his superlative knock, Abhishek took his runs tally for the season beyond 400. The southpaw currently has 401 runs from 12 innings at an average of 36.45 and has a strike rate of 205.64.

The sensational hitting left many wondering why he wasn't picked in the India squad for the T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nThe answer is simple - Abhishek Sharma lacked credentials and the Indian top-order was already witnessing a traffic jam with a lot more experienced candidates in the queue. He smashed a fifty while batting at number three in his second outing of the IPL 2024, and then waited ten games to cross the landmark score for the second time.\n\nAbhishek Sharma, who is carrying a strike rate of 205.64, failed to cross the 20-run mark in his last three outings before India's T20 World Cup squad was picked. His mentor Yuvraj Singh also reckoned that the 23-year-old was still not ready for international cricket, leave apart a tournament as big as the World Cup.\n\n\"Abhishek is almost there but I don't think he is ready for the World Cup right now. For the World Cup, we have to take an experienced side. Obviously some guys have played for India. After the World Cup, he should be prepared to play for India. That is what he should focus on. Coming six months will be very important for Abhishek,\" Yuvraj recently told Cricbuzz.\n\nTalent and power is one thing, but consistently scoring those big runs is another. Yashasvi Jaiswal smashed five fifties and a hundred in IPL 2023 to break the selection doors, and become an India international.\n\nSomeone like Suryakumar Yadav waited for years before making his India debut at 31. A player like Rinku Singh, who has played the role of finisher to perfection for India and his IPL franchise KKR, missed out and found place only in the reserve list of T20 World Cup.

The skill sets of the big hitters, which are their strengths and weapons, principally revolve around timing, pressuring the bowler and doing the math.\n\nUsing an aggressive mindset they can control the bowler and make him deliver the ball the way you want it. But it's not just all about aggression today's cricketers invest heavily in the mental side of the game as it is not as easy as it seems to pull off those great shots.\n\nThe great Viv Richards once said that cricket has become a batsman's game and is far removed from the day when the likes of Malcolm Marshall, Joel Garner, Dennis Lillee, Allan Donald or Wasim Akram terrorised the batters on the pitch.\n\nRichards, one of the hardest hitters of the cricket ball, felt pity for the bowlers who were at the mercy of swords that the batsmen wielded, denied by batting-friendly pitches and small boundaries.\n\nWhile the flat decks at the ongoing IPL might have heavily favoured the batsmen, it is conceivable that the balance will be restored during this summer's ICC T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies.\n\nAs we saw during the 2010 T20 World Cup, the pitches in the West Indies are not tailored for high scoring. The climate and timing of the matches are also sure to have a huge impact and make it more challenging for the batters. The dry pitches in the Caribbean will rough up the ball quicker paving the way for spinners to work their magic and test the batters, unlike in the IPL.\n\nWith Royal Challengers Bengaluru, one of the most talent-rich sides to have never won the tournament, star batter Virak Kohli appeared to be feeling the weight of expectations when he hit out at expert commentators like Sunil Gavaskar for questioning his strike-rate and chinks against spin bowling.\n\nGavaskar hit back at the star batter for seeking 'appreciation for a strike-rate of 118' and also received the support of Pakistan cricket great Wasim Akram who felt that Kohli should not have said what he did.\n\n\"Both are proud Indians; both are greats. It's OK; they both will move in pretty quickly. I don't think either will take it personally. They will be fine, I know. I am telling you now. I know them both very well,\" Akram said.\n\nFor the record, Kohli's overall strike rate this season in the IPL is 148.08, which is very good for someone who has scored 542 runs.\n\nBut it's the intrepid style of players like Head, whose 533 runs in 11 matches have been scored at a mindboggling striking of 201.89, that has completely changed the dynamics of the game.\n\nIt's not going to be easy, though, to carry on with his cavalier style when the World Cup starts next month in the West Indies and the US.\n\nEven Head, whose 30-ball unbeaten 89 helped Sunrrisers chase down 165 in just 9.4 overs against Lucknow Super Giants on Wednesday, knows that it's going to be a different ballgame the World Cup.\n\n\"Whenever you're playing, you want to be as consistent as you can, you want to be getting runs. It's nice to be playing well (but) that's not going to guarantee anything in the West Indies,\" said Head.\n\n\"I think we'll face a fair bit of spin in the Caribbean and the wickets might become tougher as the tournament goes on.\"\n\nWhen there is a fair contest between the bat and the ball, it's the classy batters like Kohli that thrive.", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType":

Harbhajan Singh gives his verdict", "body": "Abhishek Sharma has been the find of IPL 2024, where the southpaw has amassed over 401 runs un 12 encounters for the SRH.\n\nIf there is one player who has impressed the most in the last few matches in IPL 2024, it has to be SRH's Abhishek Sharma. The southpaw opening batter scored 75 from 28 deliveries in the match against LSG on Wednesday and took his team to victory in only 9.4 overs. But it was no flash in the pan innings for the Punjab lad. In fact, this has been an excellent year for him, where he has amassed over 401 runs in 12 matches.\n\nWhether he makes it to the T20 World Cup 2024 squad as a reserve, remains to be seen, but then, the calls to include him have already started. Former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh is one of the them, and wants Abhishek Sharma on flight to USA & the West Indies, as part of the reserves for the T20 World Cup.\n\n\"What the hell just happened in Hyd #Travishead & @IamAbhiSharma4 Hitting sixes like taking singles. Chased 165 in 9.4 overs . Should Team India include Abhishek in the bench strength ?? @IPL @BCCI @SunRisers,\" he wrote on X.\n\nMeanwhile, Harbhajan isn't the only player to have such opinion. Former coach Mike Hesson also felt the same. \"Hesson would say that there will be a few changes to the Indian team after the World Cup and Abhishek would be in the mix with the likes of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill.\n\n\"Oh, look, I think so. I mean, I think his ability to take on spin in the power play. And he's improved greatly against pace,\" Hesson told JioCinema. \"He is a high quality player. He's a boundary hitter. He is a six hitter and no doubt post World Cup, and he will start to make some changes, whether it be Jaiswal, himself or Shubman Gill. To be fair, there's a few. There's plenty of names, but he will definitely be one that will have plenty of people talking about.\"", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madhav_agarwal@insidesport.in", "name": "Madhav Agarwal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbhajan_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harbhajan Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JioCinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JioCinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yashasvi_Jaiswal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yashasvi Jaiswal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Hesson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Hesson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shubman Gill"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d16f573ilcot6q.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2WYBWTN.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545175", "eventUri": "eng-9545175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 78, "relevance": 1}

Despite the pitch being on the slower side, fans expressed significant disappointment over Rahul's batting, which they felt bogged down the team's innings.\n\nThe match unfolded on a notably sluggish pitch, but fans argued that this did not justify Rahul's overly cautious approach. His performance became a flashpoint on social media, where fans voiced their frustration and concern over his form.\n\nOn Twitter, one fan expressed, \"Kl Rahul is so frustrating to watch lol, how does LSG fans survive through this week in and out?\" highlighting the exasperation among the spectators watching his defensive play.\n\nAnother echoed similar sentiments about the pitch conditions not being an excuse for such a slow scoring rate, stating, \"Pitch is slow But not this much,\" coupled with a critique of Rahul's recent performance against SRH.\n\nSome fans speculated on strategic play by opponents, with a tweet suggesting, \"Pat Cummins using the same do not get KL Rahul out when he's batting strategy,\" referring to a previous match where Cummins' Australian team benefited from Rahul's sluggish innings in the crucial World Cup Final 2023 last year.\n\nAccusations of selfish play were rampant. A Twitter user remarked, \"KL Rahul is so selfish player than Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma right now the way he is playing. Because of KL Rahul's selfish and slow way batting cause other batsmen trying to hit the ball and get out,\" criticizing Rahul for putting pressure on his teammates to compensate for his slow scoring.\n\nEven fans who have long supported Rahul expressed their disillusionment. One noted, \"I am a big KL Rahul fan, but now I can say thank you BCCI for not considering Rahul for this World Cup,\" pointing out his unsuitability for the fast-paced demands of T20 cricket.\n\nAnother bluntly stated, \"Kl Rahul is a stylish highly fckd up batsman.. happy he isn't selected for Worldcup.. man plays like he is the only batter in the team.. takes time and gets out..\"\n\nFurthermore, a fan pointed out strategic failures due to Rahul's batting style: \"This was the main reason why KL Rahul was dropped from the WC squad, even after falling wickets you must maintain a good strike rate at least 130 as it is T20 format and powerful players to come. He maintains pressure on upcoming batters as run rate will be low.\"\n\nThe collective sentiment paints a picture of disappointment and suggests that Rahul's conservative batting approach may be out of sync with the aggressive requirements of modern T20 cricket, leaving fans and critics questioning his role in the high-stakes games.", "source": {"uri": "mykhel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myKhel.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Super_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow Super Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

Both KL Rahul and Virat Kohli has faced a lot of criticism regarding their strike rates in this year's competition despite being among the Top 5 run-scorers in IPL 2024. Rahul also found himself out of the India squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup 2024 with skipper Rohit Sharma and chief selector Ajit Agarkar saying that they were looking for middle-order batting options while choosing wicket-keepers and that is the reason why they went with Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson.\n\n\"We will bowl first. I'm not a best reader of a wicket, we just like chasing. The good thing is we have been able to adapt really well and quickly to the conditions, there have been quite a few brilliant individual performances as well.

Ayush Badoni's (55 in 30) and Nicholas Pooran's (48 in 26) 99-run partnership gave the LSG a respectable finish.\n\nIn reply, Head (89 in 30) and Abhishek (75 in 28) wreaked havoc on the LSG bowlers as SRH chased down the target of 166 runs in just 9.4 overs.\n\nThe owner of LSG appeared visibly displeased after the match's outcome and was seen engaged in an intense discussion with skipper Rahul along the boundary line at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Wednesday night.\n\nAlthough the content of their conversation was inaudible, the animated exchange between the owner and captain, captured by the broadcaster, gained traction on social media following LSG's crushing 10-wicket defeat.\n\nHowever, fans were unsettled by the LSG owner's public gesture towards Rahul in the stadium, suggesting that discussions about the loss should take place in private rather than in front of spectators.\n\n\"A player of such calibre KL Rahul needing to bear the wrath of the team owner on field in national media is depressing to say the least ! #pathetic.

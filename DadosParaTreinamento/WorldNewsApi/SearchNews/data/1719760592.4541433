Taxpayers in dozens of counties and two tribal areas in California, Michigan, Maine, Washington state, Tennessee, and West Virginia are eligible for the extended June 17 deadline, according to the IRS.Specifically, the June 17 deadline applies to San Diego County in California; New London County, as well as the tribal nations of Mohegan and Mashantucket in Connecticut; and Eaton, Ingham, Ionia, Kent, Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, and Wayne counties in Michigan, according to the IRS. The agency said that the same deadline applies to taxpayers in the following counties: Androscoggin, Franklin, Kennebec, Oxford, Penobscot, Piscataquis, and Somerset in Maine; Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Gibson, Montgomery, Robertson, Stewart, Sumner, and Weakley in Tennessee; and Boone, Calhoun, Clay, Harrison, Kanawha, and Roane in West Virginia.Additional ExtensionsIn general, even though taxpayers can request an additional extension to file their tax return, they must still pay any taxes owed by the June 17 deadline. However, taxpayers who qualify for the extended June 17 deadline but for some reason are unable to file their tax returns by that date can request an automatic six-month extension. They can do so by filing Form 4868, an \u201cApplication for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.\u201d In some cases, taxpayers can get an extension greater than six months. Conditions for extensions longer than six months include meeting either the bona fide residence test or the physical presence test in order to qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion or to exclude or deduct the foreign housing costs. Such individuals must file IRS Form 2350, an \u201cApplication for Extension of Time to File U.S. Income Tax Return.\u201d Members of the military stationed abroad or in a combat zone during tax filing season may qualify for an additional extension of at least 180 days to file their tax returns and pay any taxes owed. In cases where taxpayers relinquished their U.S. citizenship or ceased to be lawful permanent residents of the United States in 2023, they must file a dual-status tax return and attach Form 8854, an \u201cInitial and Annual Expatriation Statement.\u201dOther DevelopmentsLast year, the IRS raked in a record $4.9 trillion in taxes from Americans, amid a tax enforcement crackdown.

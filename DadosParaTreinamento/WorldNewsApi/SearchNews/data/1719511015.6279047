Or disappointed?&#8217;: Chipotle says corporate is now telling them to look at customers&#8217; reactions when measuring scoops", "text": "A Chipotle worker made a viral post on Reddit alleging that the fast food chain was now telling its employees to, essentially, not skimp on portions. The Redditor, u/Infinitegdz, posted a screenshot of an email apparently sent by their bosses which asserted that it was important to Chipotle\u2019s leadership team that \u201cguests are getting a meal\u2026 that aligns with the price they are paying.\u201d As of Sunday morning, the post had 591 upvotes. \u201cI have always hated skimping out on you guys even if my [general manager] tells me to skimp,\u201d the worker, @Infinitegdz, wrote. \u201cI still give out good portions\u2026 mainly because I put myself in y\u2019all\u2019s position and wouldn\u2019t think it would be fair to pay for something and not receive what I paid for.\u201d The worker encouraged customers to \u201ckeep speaking out\u201d about Chipotle\u2019s infamously paltry portion sizes. The emailed screenshot was attached to the text from u/Infinitegdz. It\u2019s not immediately clear who wrote the email, but the text said that it wanted \u201cleaders\u201d of their respective Chipotles to take an online course on \u201cbuilding entrees.\u201d The text said that workers should ensure guests receive full portions. \u201cWhen you build entrees,\u201d the email read, \u201cthe final question we ask the guest is, \u2018Did we make this perfect for you?\u2019\u201d \u201cAt the front line, look at the guest\u2019s face,\u201d it continued. \u201cDo they look happy, or do they look disappointed?\u201d It then posed a question to workers: would you be happy if you received that entree in your bag?\u201d Is Chipotle adding more food now? Not necessarily. However, the text of the email said that Chipotle wants to ensure that customers are getting their money\u2019s worth. According to a separate Reddit post, the portioning for various toppings and meats varies. White or brown rice, for instance, should weigh four ounces; meat should be portioned out at four ounces, too. Topping like queso blanco should be measured out at two ounces. Shredded cheese should be one ounce. Some Chipotle customers have complained about being served smaller-than-average portions by the chain, however. Even foodie influencer, Keith Lee, has stated that Chipotle \u201chas not hit the same.\u201d In May, a customer walked out mid-order because he did not think his portions were big enough. Some others participated in boycotting the chain. Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung previously claimed that the restaurant\u2019s portion sizes are not shrinking. Still, customers are taking matters into their own hands. Beyond the boycott, others have advocated for recording Chipotle workers. Apparently, there\u2019s an unverified theory that employees are more generous with portions if they spot a camera. One user, Chuck (@firstinflightfoodie), recorded his order asking users if they think Chipotle is now giving better scoops due to the boycott. What\u2019s the phone rule? The Daily Dot previously reported on a TikTok by user Miss G (@tik.tok.teacher) who said she heard that Chipotle workers were instructed to overload burritos and bowls if guests were recording them being made. The video led a number of content creators to make videos joking about how they planned on bringing phones and tripods to their neighborhood Chipotle. The chain hasn\u2019t confirmed whether the phone rule is legit, but the Chipotle TikTok account recently posted a video poking fun at it. @chipotle i\u2019m working late, cuz i\u2019m Chipotle \u266c original sound \u2013 Chipotle Chipotle workers and customers weigh in U/Infinitegdz said he was thrilled that Chipotle leadership finally acknowledged the need for fair portions. In the past, though, other workers have defended Chipotle\u2019s portion sizes. Customers, however, haven\u2019t been convinced. Even this latest email screenshot from u/Infinitegdz didn\u2019t convince them that the company would live up to its word. \u201cI won\u2019t be happy until they are forced to weigh the protein portions,\u201d one Redditor commented. \u201cI don\u2019t trust this,\u201d another wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as using a measuring spoon,\u201d a third person said. Others encouraged customers to continue their boycott. \u201cThe corporate harassment seems to be working guys!\u201d one person wrote. \u201cKeep boycotting them,\u201d another agreed. \u201cI learnt how to make Chipotle at home.\u201d The Daily Dot has reached out to Chipotle by email.

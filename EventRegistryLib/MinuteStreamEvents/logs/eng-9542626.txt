And if another report holds up, Apple may spend some of that time talking about a high-end Apple Pencil.\n\nOn Monday, Apple updated its websites worldwide with a new animation of the \"Let Loose\" logo, one where you can erase the image if you move a cursor over it on a Mac, or erase it with your finger on the iPhone and iPad. According to an X post by @ribu_ap712, the updated Apple website in Japan had code that referred to an \"Apple Pencil Pro.\"\n\nThe existence of the code was confirmed by MacRumors, which also provided a translation of the code: \"Folded green, yellow, orange and blue paper forms the Apple logo. Inside the logo, you can see the creator's hand holding the Apple Pencil Pro and drawing.\" However, the \"Apple Pencil Pro\" mention was not spotted on the Apple website in other regions, including the U.S., so it's possible that the \"Apple Pencil Pro\" reference was a translation error. However, it's also possible that Apple will make this squeeze feature available on a Pencil that's designed specifically for the new iPad Pro, thus an Apple Pencil Pro.\n\nA month ago, the iOS 17.5 beta was revealed to have code that referred to a new squeeze gesture the Apple Pencil. Since the three current Apple Pencils do not have pressure sensors to support such a gesture, it's presumed that Apple will reveal a new Pencil during the \"Let Loose\" event. It's not clear if this new Pencil will be in addition to the three current models or if it will replace one (or more) of them.\n\nApple is expected to announce updates to the iPad Pro and iPad Air at the event, and a new Apple Pencil (as well as a new Magic Keyboard) could be part of the reveal.

This will be Apple's first event of 2024 where the giant will refresh its iPad Pro and iPad Air lineup. Yes, Apple's 'Let Loose' event on May 7 will mainly focus on iPads, but if we look at the logo, a new Apple Pencil is expected too, and now there's a hint for it as well.\n\nApple's website sheds light on what to expect. The code on Apple's official website for Japan has revealed multiple mentions of the name \"Apple Pencil Pro.\" All the mentions are in the page source and developer views of the site, with no publicly visible references yet. This was first shared by an X (aka Twitter) user.\n\nInterestingly, Apple's Let Loose event invite also features an Apple Pencil with the company's logo. In the morning, Apple updated its website for the upcoming event and added an erasable 'Let Loose' logo, indicating that we might see some announcements related to Apple Pencil at the event.\n\nCurrently, Apple sells three generations of Apple Pencil. These are Apple Pencil (1st-generation), Apple Pencil (2nd-generation), and Apple Pencil (USB-C). The anticipated \"Apple Pencil Pro\" would be a new as-yet-unannounced addition to the Apple Pencil lineup.\n\nIt's worth knowing that there are no mentions of the Apple Pencil Pro in the code for the US version of the website. Considering this, there are two possibilities. First, it could be an unfortunate copy error on the Japanese site. Second, it could be an accidental slip-up and a solid tip that Apple is planning to upgrade its stylus lineup tomorrow.\n\nWell, let's put aside this name confusion for a minute. Whatever the name is, the good news is that we're going to see a new Apple Pencil along with new iPads. For quite some time, there have been rumors that the new Apple Pencil would arrive with visionOS support and a new \"squeeze\" gesture for a more precise drawing experience.\n\nAlongside the new Apple Pencil, Apple is likely to announce new iPad Air and iPad Pro models. The new iPad Pro is expected to be a massive upgrade with cutting-edge OLED displays, the much-capable M4 chip, and an improved design. Coming to the new Air, Apple is likely increasing the size of its mid-range iPad lineup with the introduction of the first-ever 12.9-inch iPad Air.", "source": {"uri": "beebom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beebom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kanika_gogia@beebom.com", "name": "Kanika Gogia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stylus (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Apple-Pencil-Pro-leak.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542626", "eventUri": "eng-9542626", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 331, "textEnd": 336}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

Although the company doesn't usually discuss the topics of the event, the invitation artwork makes it clear that it will be all about iPad - as we can see an Apple Pencil in it. After Apple CEO Tim Cook hinted at a new Pencil coming tomorrow, Apple's website also leaked the name \"Apple Pencil Pro,\" adding more fuel to the fire.\n\nIn a post on X, Cook shared the artwork for the event with the caption \"Pencil us in for May 7!\" The executive also added a pencil emoji to the post, which further corroborates the fact that Apple will indeed launch new iPads and potentially a new Apple Pencil at its special \"Let Loose\" event.\n\nThe last time Apple launched a new generation Apple Pencil was in 2018 (excluding the cheaper USB-C version that was introduced last year). At the time, Apple Pencil was updated with a matte design, better grip, a new double-tap gesture, and magnetic charging. But what exactly can we expect from Apple Pencil 3?\n\nAccording to rumors, the new Apple Pencil could feature Find My integration. This would help users easily track and find their lost Apple Pencil, just like with AirPods and AirTags. Some rumors also suggest that Apple Pencil 3 will feature interchangeable magnetic tips.\n\n9to5Mac has also found multiple pieces of evidence suggesting the new Apple Pencil will support a \"Squeeze\" gesture of some sort. Potentially the new Apple Pencil will be able to detect when the user is pressing down on its surface to perform some quick actions, such as adding text or a signature.\n\nApple's homepage was updated on Monday with an easter egg that also hints at a new Pencil. You can erase the artwork for tomorrow's event with the mouse cursor or by swiping your finger across the image. Interestingly, this interactive artwork comes with the name \"Apple Pencil Pro\" hidden in the website codes.\n\nWill Apple launch a \"Pro\" version of the accessory rather than just updating the current Apple Pencil? Will it cost more than Apple Pencil 2? These are questions that Apple will answer tomorrow.\n\nOf course, an iPad event will feature new iPads. Apple is rumored to introduce both new iPad Air and iPad Pro models. While iPad Air 6 will feature the M2 chip and a larger version with a 12.9-inch screen for the first time, the new iPad Pro will be powered by a mysterious new chip and will feature OLED displays, as well as a slimmer design.\n\nWhy a mysterious chip? Although we all believed that the new iPad Pro would feature M3, rumors suggest that Apple may launch a brand new chip (such as M4) for it, with a focus on handling AI-based tasks.\n\nIn addition, there are reports of Apple having developed a redesigned Magic Keyboard that will make the iPad look more like a traditional laptop, ditching the current floating design.\n\nApple's special event will be online and take place at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "9to5mac.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Mac"}, "authors": [{"uri": "filipe_esposito@9to5mac.com", "name": "Filipe Esp\u00f3sito", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirTag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AirTag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPods", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AirPods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/iPad-Apple-Pencil.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542626", "eventUri": "eng-9542626", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 35, "textEnd": 40, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

Inside the logo, you can see the creator's hand holding the Apple Pencil Pro and drawing.\"\n\nWhile it's still unclear, the code seems to describe an image of the Apple Pencil Pro in action.\n\nRumours surrounding an upgraded Apple Pencil have been swirling for months now.

It's not just animated. It's also interactive. If you swipe your mouse cursor over it after an animation ends, it will erase the logo, causing it to disappear as if you were using an Apple Pencil.\n\nWhile this could simply be a fun way to drum up excitement about Tuesday's streaming-only event, it could also be a hint at one of the new features coming to the Apple Pencil: gesture and squeeze controls.\n\nRumors have been circulating for weeks now about the third-generation Apple Pencil getting squeeze sensitivity. That would open the door for a whole new library of controls that could make navigation with the Apple Pencil more streamlined.\n\nFor example, imagine working on some art on your iPad Pro using the Procreate app and simply being able to squeeze the Pencil to erase rather than tapping through a menu to change tools. This feature could also be used for things like zooming in and out or moving between apps.\n\nWe won't know for sure until Tuesday at 10 a.m. Eastern, but there are a few other rumored features to look out for.\n\nThe third-generation Apple Pencil is expected to replace the second-generation model, which is currently the most expensive, high-end Pencil. That means we can expect it to do everything the current second-generation Apple Pencil can do, along with some new capabilities. However, the design will most likely remain similar to the current model. It's tough to perfect the pencil's design, after all.\n\nAside from squeeze controls, one exciting feature rumored for the Apple Pencil 3 is haptic feedback. That might seem like a minor upgrade, but it could transform the Pencil experience by recreating the tactile feedback you feel with normal writing utensils. Even outside of writing and drawing, it would make gestures and squeeze controls more intuitive by letting you know when you've activated one.\n\nSqueeze controls aren't the only new control interface rumored for the Apple Pencil 3. It could also get swipe controls built into the Pencil itself. So, you might be able to swipe a finger along the flat edge of the Pencil to activate a button or change tools in a drawing app, all without taking your hand off the Pencil.\n\nThese new controls would transform navigation on the iPad and make the Apple Pencil a must-have accessory for everyone, not just students and artists. The Pencil could effectively function as a mouse for the iPad, giving users precise control capabilities in an intuitive, convenient form factor.\n\nIt's also possible that the third-generation Apple Pencil will get magnetic interchangeable tips. Apple already sells replacement tips for the second-generation Pencil, but they're all the same size. The new Pencil could get tips in a variety of sizes to fine-tune writing and drawing tasks.\n\nIf you're excited about the new-and-improved 3rd-generation Apple Pencil, you likely won't have to wait long to see it. Apple will reveal it on May 7 at its \"Let Loose\" virtual event. We'lcoverng everything Apple announces, so stay tuned for the latest news on the new Apple Pencil and revamped iPad line-up.", "source": {"uri": "laptopmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LaptopMag"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Library (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_event", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jih2oewF3tB7bzx8BwkZgC-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542626", "eventUri": "eng-9542626", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 571, "textEnd": 581}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 670, "textEnd": 675, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

However, a new report suggests that it might not have that name after all.\n\nIf the report is accurate Apple is about to announce its first Apple Pencil Pro. That's according to code found on the Japanese Apple website, at least.

But now it seems likely that Apple is going to go a step beyond, adding an Apple Pencil Pro to the lineup for the first time.\n\nWhile it's not yet clear what Apple believes warrants the Pro moniker for the new stylus, reports had previously suggested that it would sport a new squeeze gesture. Other improvements are also expected, too.\n\nAlongside the now rumored Apple Pencil Pro, Apple is expected to announce its first OLED iPad Pro as well as a revamped iPad Air lineup.

Read our ethics policy.\n\nAppleInsider has learned that code in the Japanese version of Apple's website reveals multiple mentions of an \"Apple Pencil Pro,\" ahead of the expected release of a new model on May 7.\n\nApple's \"Let Loose\" event on May 7, 2024, is believed to concentrate on the new iPad Air and iPad Pro models, but even if only based on its logo, a new Apple Pencil is expected too. Now code in Apple's official site for Japan has revealed multiple mentions of the name \"Apple Pencil Pro.\"\n\nThe mentions are all in the page source and developer views of the site. There are no publicly visible references yet.\n\nIt's previously been reported that the new Apple Pencil would gain extra features compared to the current high-end model, the Apple Pencil (second generation), which is now six years old. Those features were spotted in the code for the developer beta of iPadOS 17.5 and consist of a series of new gestures involving squeezing the Pencil.\n\nIf, as expected, the new Apple Pencil Pro becomes the top model in the range, it's not clear what will happen with the existing three models. The original Apple Pencil from 2015 is the only model that can work with iPads such as the iPad Air (third generation) and iPad mini (sixth generation).", "source": {"uri": "appleinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AppleInsider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japanese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Mini"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/3D_Modelling", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/3D Modelling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/59559-121581-000-lede-Apple-Pencil-xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542626", "eventUri": "eng-9542626", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 258, "textEnd": 263}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Besides, casual users can scribble and take notes using this stylish stylus. While the Bluetooth-enabled design offers a more convenient user experience, it also makes it easier for a user to lose the Pencil. Well, it's a universal problem with Apple Pencil owners. Unlike other Apple devices, it isn't easy to find a lost Apple Pencil. Also, things can get worse if your stylus has run out of battery. That said, you need not freak out as there are some ways to track your missing Apple Pencil. In this article, we'll tell you what to do if you lose your Apple Pencil and how to avoid losing your beloved stylus.\n\nWhile Find My lets you track most Apple devices, it doesn't support Apple Pencil yet. I know this isn't fair, but that's how it is, at least for now. Until Apple adds this capability, there are some ways to find a lost Apple Pencil. Let's check them out.\n\nYou can track a lost Apple Pencil using your iPad's Bluetooth connectivity. This will give you an idea of whether your stylus is nearby or not. Before you start your search, you have to make sure that you haven't turned off Bluetooth on your iPad. If you have done so, the Apple Pencil may disconnect and enter power-saving mode.\n\nHere's how to track a lost Apple Pencil:\n\nBear in mind that the Bluetooth range might reduce depending on the obstacles between your devices. For example, the number of floors or thick walls can impact how well your Apple Pencil connects. That said, this is one of the best ways to track an Apple Pencil if it's lost in your room, around the office desk, or anywhere nearby.\n\nAnother way to track your Apple Pencil's location is by using a Bluetooth tracker app. One such popular app is Wunderfind. If you haven't disabled Bluetooth on your iPad, you can use this app to find a lost Apple Pencil. Also, bear in mind that the method only works when your Pencil is charged and awake. Here's how to use this app:\n\nYou can use the free version of this app to track your lost Apple Pencil. There's also a Pro version that comes with a Map for more precise location tracking.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't use Apple's Find My network to track a lost Apple Pencil. Therefore, you'll have to go through the old-school method to retrace your steps. So, go back and remember your day and try to recall where you last used your Apple Pencil. Maybe you only used your stylus in the office, so you can carefully check it around your desk. Make sure to check behind the monitor, under the table, and in the drawer.\n\nOr maybe you've used your iPad and Apple Pencil in a coffee shop. In that case, you could look around the table you were working on or ask the manager if he has found a stylus.\n\nWe know this isn't a great method, especially if you've used your Apple Pnecil in several places. That said, if you have no idea what to do, this can be a good start.\n\nThe last hack to find a lost Apple Pencil is to wake it up. If your stylus has been missing for a while now, it might have fallen asleep. When this happens, you can't connect to your Apple Pencil, even if it has a charge. In such a case, you wake up your Apple Pencil to know its location.\n\nAs you retrace your steps, you can move your stuff around. For example, shake your laptop bag or purse, flip couch cushions, or reshuffle the pens and papers in your drawer. If you think the Pencil could be in your car, you can drive around to activate the stylus. We are saying this because motion can help wake the Apple Pencil. As a result, the stylus may show up in your list of connected devices. Once it comes in the range, you can use other methods to find your lost Apple Pencil.\n\nOnce you've found your Apple Pencil, you will definitely want to keep it safe so you don't lose it again. If you haven't lost your Apple Pencil, great, but you would still want to protect it to chuck away all those annoyances.\n\nWe've penned down some simple tips and tricks to avoid losing your Apple Pencil. Here you go:\n\nOne of the best ways to avoid losing your Apple Pencil is to keep it charged. We've already seen above that you can only track your Apple Pencil if it has a charge. Unfortunately, your Pencil may run out of charge if you haven't used it in a while. To avoid this, make sure that you charge your Apple Pencil at regular intervals. If you've got an Apple Pencil 2, you just need to keep the stylus on the iPad's magnetic charging point.\n\nFor the first-generation Apple Pencil, you need to remove the cap and plug the stylus into the Lightning port of the iPad. If you've got an Apple Pencil USB-C model, slide open the end of your stylus and connect a USB-C charge cable. The other end of the cable goes to your iPad or to a power adapter.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that if your Pencil remains out of charge for several weeks, the battery may fail. As a result, your Apple Pencil won't work. In such a case, you must contact Apple. If your stylus is under a warranty, you may get a free replacement. Bear in mind that Apple doesn't repair or replace these batteries.\n\nIf you work in an office where many people use an Apple Pencil, it can be quite difficult to figure out which one is yours. In such cases, you might want to consider some sort of personalization so your stylus doesn't fall into the wrong hands.\n\nOne way to do so is to engrave your Apple Pencil for free at the time of purchase. If you ever lose your engraved Apple Pencil in a co-working space or a cafe, there are comparatively fewer chances that someone would steal it as it would offer a lower resale value.\n\nThe other way to personalize your Apple Pencil is to decorate it with stickers or cases. Whichever option you prefer, you can never go wrong with personalizing your stylus.\n\nIf you own an Apple Pencil 2, you can let it stay attached to your iPad to minimize the risk of losing your beloved stylus. In addition to safety, your Pencil will also charge while connected. So, it's a win-win situation. Knowing this, there's no point in leaving your Apple Pencil anywhere else, but only on your iPad.\n\nFor the Apple Pencil 1 or USB-C model, you can get yourself an iPad case with a dedicated slot to stow your stylus. This way, you can easily move around with your stylus without having to worry about losing it.\n\nToday, GPS trackers have become a lot more common. You can attach a smart tracker to your valuable items like keys, luggage, and even your Apple Pencil. This will prevent your stylus from being lost or stolen. If you prefer only official Apple accessories, get yourself an AirTag.\n\nThe best part of using an AirTag is that you can use Find My to track your lost Apple Pencil. Also, this smart tracker is lightweight so it won't ruin your writing experience. Not to forget, attaching a Bluetooth tracker will allow you to track the location even if your Apple Pencil runs out of charge or falls asleep.\n\nIf you're someone like me who often loses tiny gadgets, it's a great idea to get yourself a pair of AirTags. Of course, you can also go for AirTag alternatives that are equally good.\n\nThe best way to avoid losing tiny gadgets is to give them a dedicated storage space. While you're organizing your workstation, it's a nice idea to allot a special space for your Apple Pencil so you don't lose it, at least not that easily. You can go for Apple Pencil cases, pencil stands, or charging stations to store your Apple Pencil. When you do this, you'll always know where you find your stylus when you need it the most.\n\nIf you share your stylus with other team members in the office or your sibling at home, you should decide on a safe storage spot. This way, no one freaks out where the Apple Pencil is gone.\n\nThat was all on how to find a lost Apple Pencil. We hope this article helped to track your Apple Pencil's location. Since it can get quite difficult to find the stylus, we strongly recommend you take all the preventive measures to avoid losing the pencil.

Even though the person who added these details might not know the actual name of the upcoming Apple Pencil, it might not be a third-generation, but a \"Pro\" model to take advantage of all the new features available with the forthcoming OLED iPad Pro.\n\nOver the past few months, Apple has let slip several details about this upcoming Apple Pencil. That said, here's what Apple might unveil for this Apple Pencil Pro:\n\nThere's even a sketchy leak that believes Apple is planning interchangeable tips. However, no one corroborated that.\n\nStill, if Apple is planning an Apple Pencil Pro brand, this might mean this OLED iPad Pro upgrade will be bigger than we all expected. I hope Cupertino can fix the Apple Pencil's battery drain issue and also add more quality-of-life improvements.\n\nThankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to discover what Apple has in store for tomorrow's event.", "source": {"uri": "bgr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BGR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jose_adorno@bgr.com", "name": "Jos\u00e9 Adorno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Genius_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boy Genius Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/usb-c-apple-pencil-bgr.jpg?resize=1200%2C628", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542626", "eventUri": "eng-9542626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The teaser at the top of the page showcased multiple Apple logo illustrations that users could erase using their mouse on their Mac or finger on the iPhone's touchscreen. Once fully erased, a new logo variant was animated, hinting at the possibility of an upcoming reveal for the Apple Pencil Pro.\n\nSpeculations suggest that the new Apple Pencil may replace the high-end Apple Pencil introduced in 2018. Recent discoveries in the iPadOS 17.5 developer beta indicated potential new gestures involving squeezing the Pencil. Code in iOS 17.5 referenced an Apple Pencil with a \"squeeze\" gesture, hinting at a hardware-based erase option enabled through squeezing. The current Apple Pencil models lack a universal erase feature across apps, making the addition of such functionality likely appealing to users.\n\nThe interactive eraser feature displayed on the Apple Japan website could be a subtle hint at the upcoming reveal of the Apple Pencil Pro, which could potentially include an advanced erasing feature. As Apple continues to innovate and improve upon its product line, it's exciting to see what new features and updates the company will introduce during its upcoming event.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacRumors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacRumors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japanese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchscreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/ustopstories/2024/may/pencil-06052024-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542626", "eventUri": "eng-9542626", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 145, "textEnd": 152}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Now, a new update to the company's website has given us another indication of what we can expect - and it strongly hints that there will be a new Apple Pencil as part of the big event.\n\nRumors have already suggested that an Apple Pencil 3 is set to be announced, while a more recent report suggests that we can expect that accessory to be called the Apple Pencil Pro. That came after a reference to an Apple Pencil Pro was found in the code of the Japanese Apple website, and now a change to the US website has again hinted at a new Apple Pencil announcement.\n\nThe change, reported by 9to5Mac, comes as Apple updated the teaser on its website that cycles between different illustrations of the Apple logo. However, those on an iPhone can use their finger to erase the currently displayed illustration while those on a Mac can use the mouse instead. When the logo has been fully erased a new animation replaces it.\n\nThis would appear to again point to an Apple Pencil launch, possibly nodding to what we can expect the rumored squeeze gesture to do. The gesture has been heavily rumored but it's as yet it's unclear what we should expect the gesture to do. The current Apple Pencil 2 features a double-tap gesture that can be used to activate some tools within specific apps and it's possible the squeeze gesture will be similar.\n\nApple's May 7 event is expected to see Apple debut the new OLED iPad Pro in both 11- and 12.9-inch size options. The new tablet was long expected to sport an M3 chip inside, but recent reports by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman have hinted that an M4 could debut instead. It's as-yet unclear which will be used, however.\n\nAlongside the new iPad Pro, Apple is expected to announce an updated iPad Air lineup. The 11-inch iPad Air is expected to be updated while an all-new 12.9-inch iPad Air is also set to be added to the mix. Both models are set to upgrade the current generation's M1 chip to a newer M2, but it's possible that an M3 could be used if the iPad Pro does indeed move to the M4 as rumored.", "source": {"uri": "tweaktown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TweakTown"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_haslam@tweaktown.com", "name": "Oliver Haslam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://static.tweaktown.com/news/9/8/98073_01_apple-again-hints-at-new-pencil-launch-with-revamped-may-7-event-teaser_full.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542626", "eventUri": "eng-9542626", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 78, "textEnd": 83, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

In theory it will be a previously filmed event with a duration of approximately 35 minutes and will be broadcast via streaming.\n\nAfter the official announcement of the event, we discovered to our great astonishment that Apple had hidden a series of clues in the design of the logos on its invitations. Thanks to them we know that The new Apple Pencil 3 will have different features for painting and drawingpreviously rumored through supposed interchangeable magnetic tips.\n\nThe latest news? Apple has given us more clues about the possible news of its Let Loose event in May in its official website.\n\nApple has updated its website with a small graphic which shows the different logos for the event that the company's team of designers has prepared for this very special occasion.\n\nThe curious thing about all this is that users who access the site when they move the mouse pointer over the logo on a computer or when they move their finger over the logo from an iPad, This is deleted giving way to another logo. You can discover it in more detail in the following X post from our colleague Angel Rock.\n\nWell, we have put on the disguise of detectives to discover what meaning this change could have. First of all, this curious and fun clue from the Apple event suggests that the company has introduced new brush strokes to draw with the Apple Pencil 3, since each logo is designed in a different style.\n\nBut on the other hand, and what is even more interesting, is that this track could refer to a new function of the \"Magic Pencil\" - Apple could take advantage of the news to change its name - that will allow users access deletion functions faster and more conveniently with a small side touch panel with haptic feedback. It has all the sense of the world!\n\nApple's special event titled Let Loose will take place tomorrow starting at 4:00 p.m. (peninsular time) and at 3:00 p.m. (Canary Islands). We are waiting for you to tell you everything that has been presented and other curiosities related to this May event.

You can read full details of what's coming and when, here. But Apple just did something rather unusual: it dropped a massive clue that a new eraser feature is coming, and since it's already told us there's a new Pencil, you don't need to be a mathematical genius to put two and two together.\n\nAs spotted by Benjamin Mayo at 9to5Mac, the homepage for apple.com has just been updated with a last-minute clue as to what we should expect. Apple never does this, certainly not this late in the day, but it's a pretty cool tease.\n\nGo to apple.com and on the homepage you'll see a front-and-center placement for the special event. It exhorts you to watch tomorrow at 7 a.m. Pacific.\n\nNothing unusual in that, but if you allow your cursor to gently trail across the Apple logo (and only the logo), you'll find the cursor becomes an eraser, wiping out the logo and replacing it with another of the half-dozen specially created apple image. You can then to proceed to erase that one and it'll be replaced, too until you edge round to the first one again.\n\nThe first of the icons has a hand holding an Apple Pencil, so it's pretty sure that Apple is launching a new one of those, right? So, we can be sure that Apple is letting us know that the next Apple Pencil will have an eraser in it.\n\nBut it already does, I hear you exclaim. True, but you have to touch the nib of the Pencil on the eraser icon to swap from pen or paintbrush to eraser, for instance.\n\nThe hint here seems to be that there'll be something different in the new Apple Pencil. It may correlate with the reports that the next Pencil will have a squeezable function and haptic feedback.\n\nPerhaps, if you squeeze the Pencil it will vibrate a little to let you know it's recognized your touch, and automatically switch functions.\n\nIt's unlikely there will be any new hints between now and the keynote starting at 7 a.m. Pacific.

When it's all gone, a new logo pops up. It's not surprising to see Apple come up with a pre-event teaser. As has been the case, Cupertino often builds anticipation for launch events this way, including those quirky animations we'll (most likely) see on X/Twitter shortly.\n\nThough it's unofficial till now, what's expected is a 35-minute long keynote, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, where Apple shows off new iPads, Keyboard, and Apple Pencil. Except for the obvious iPad line, Apple Pencil should have our attention which is expected to come with a new squeeze gesture to help folks perform quick actions such as \"adding shapes, signatures, stickers, or texts,\" according to code strings in iPadOS 17.5 developer beta reported 9to5Mac.\n\nOne should also note that it's technically the fourth Apple Pencil to come if the Apple Pencil with USB-C is counted. On the side of that, Apple's new Magic Keyboard is rumored to attempt to bridge the gap between iPads and laptops by offering a more \"laptop-like\" feel with key upgrades such as an aluminum case and a larger trackpad. We're yet to know whether the new Magic Keyboard will only back the upcoming iPad Pro (rumored to feature an M4 chip) or support the iPad Air models, too.\n\nMost of the questions and our doubts will be cleared out tomorrow when Apple unveils the new devices during the \"Let Loose\" event.

To build hype, Apple has slipped a last-minute teaser onto its site that hints at a feature for the rumored new \"squeeze\" function on the Apple Pencil 3 stylus.\n\nWhen you visit Apple.com, you'll see that the Apple logo keeps changing above a spotlight post for tomorrow's big event. If you're on a Mac or one of the best iPhones, you can actually erase the logo with your mouse or finger, respectively. After you've finished erasing it all, a new logo pops up to take its place.\n\nWhile we don't know much about this new \"squeeze\" function, it seems to imply that one feature could be to trigger the Pixel Eraser simply by squeezing the Apple Pencil 3. Previous rumors speculated that Apple Pencil 3 squeeze gestures could open a \"contextual menu\" to let users quickly perform certain actions -- including adding shapes, stickers and text to a canvas. There will likely be additional new gestures adding more functionality to the stylus, but we'll have to wait until Apple's big shindig to learn more.\n\nOther rumored upgrades include new interchangeable magnetic tips, depending on the kind of finesse you need. There have also been reports that the Apple Pencil 3 may even be compatible with Apple Vision Pro at some point in the near future.\n\nOf course, the stars of Apple's show are expected to be the new iPad Pro 2024 and iPad Air 2024. The latest iPad Pro is tipped to come with an OLED display -- the first iPad to do so -- featuring LTPO technology, a more power-efficient form of OLED capable of both a high refresh rate and resolution without turning your tablet into a battery-sucking rectangle of glass and metal. Apple is expected to offer the new iPad Pro models in 12.9-inch and 11.1-inch sizes, both widely tipped to feature a slimmed-down design and ultra-thin bezels. We could also see a new 10.9-inch and supersized 12.9-inch iPad Air models with MiniLED displays.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stylus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eraser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(1st_generation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad (1st generation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/87U4H2hY9J8zZrQqv65nQk-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542626", "eventUri": "eng-9542626", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1390, "textEnd": 1395}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 129, "textEnd": 134}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 243261002, "title": "Collagen Supplements: The Scoop on Healthy Hair, Skin and Nails", "text": "Before discussing its benefits, what is collagen? In short, collagen is the most plentiful protein in the human body and accounts for one-third of all protein. It serves as a connective building block that holds together your muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones and skin. It serves as a building block that holds together your muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, skin and promotes healthy joints and connective tissues. There are nearly 30 known types of collagen, but type I is the most prevalent (it exists in all connective tissue and makes up 90% of all collagen in the body). Types II, III and IV are also common and found in various parts of the body, including your joints, kidneys, ears and blood vessels. All of this leads us to another pertinent question: What is collagen good for? Your body naturally makes collagen by combining multiple amino acids (like proline and glycine) with zinc, vitamin C and copper. However, as you get older, production slows and the existing collagen in your body starts to break down at a faster rate. When that happens, you may notice your skin getting wrinklier, your tendons and ligaments becoming less flexible and shrinking muscles. To prevent or delay these effects, some people make up for what their body has lost by eating collagen-rich foods or collagen supplements.", "summary": "Using collagen has shown benefits like healthy hair, bones and skin.

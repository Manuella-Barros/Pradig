{"id": 227483380, "title": "Shinty: Doug Brockie, 15, on target as Glenurquhart claim first points of the season", "text": "Fifteen-year-old Doug Brockie scored his first senior goal as Glenurquhart gathered their first point of the Mowi Premiership season, drawing 2-2 with Kyles Athletic. James Keating and James Cameron replaced Fergus Robertson and Liam Robertson for the hosts while Andrew King returned for Kyles with Will Cowie and Innes Macdonald starting outfield for the first time since March. James Pringle\u2019s back-hand strike and Conor Kennedy\u2019s effort from the edge of the D had Kyles two-up but Ryan Porter took the ball down to score from around the penalty spot before Brockie beat stand-in keeper Jack Whyte to level. Glen boss Davie Stewart said: \u201cWe fought until the end and deserved at least a point. Everyone played their part, and it was a day to remember for Doug Brockie.\u201d Kyles\u2019 Will Cowie: \u201cI thought we were the better team, especially up front, for almost an hour and Stuart MacKintosh made several super saves to keep them in it. \u201cGlenurquhart then started to dominate the centre line and our hitting could have been better. It\u2019s disappointing as I think Glenurquhart only had a couple of shots on target.\u201d Kinlochshiel and Oban Camanachd drew 1-1. Shiel\u2019s Keith MacRae was injured while a heel problem restricted John MacRae to the substitutes\u2019 bench, and he only managed the final 15 minutes. Duncan Matheson, Archie MacRae and Zander MacRae all returned. Oban Camanachd\u2019s Daniel MacCuish was passed fit following a groin injury while Ross Macmillan started after scoring four goals over his last two substitute appearances. Substitute Lewis Cameron put Oban ahead, set up by Matthew Sloss who rounded the keeper, but Jordan Fraser\u2019s backhand strike with 10 minutes remaining earned Shiel a point. Shiel boss Willie MacRae said: \u201cIt\u2019s as strong an Oban side as we\u2019ve seen for a while. \u201cWe pushed Finlay MacRae into midfield and Donald Nixon to buckshee forward as we went for it.\u201d Oban Camanachd manager Gareth Evans said: \u201cI thought we could have won it, but we\u2019ll take the point. \u201cWe lost Louie MacFarlane (ankle) before a recurrence of a groin injury forced Daniel MacCuish off, all within the first 20 minutes, and that\u2019s my main concern.\u201d Kings open up a gap at summit With Lovat idle, leaders Kingussie played their game in hand and go four points clear after winning 6-0 at Lochaber. Savio Genini returned to bag a first half double with Dylan Borthwick adding a third on 76 minutes. Lochaber\u2019s Max Campbell was sent off after a high swing caught Robert Mabon on the back of the neck before Kingussie\u2019s Dylan Borthwick took his tally to four goals. Kingussie manager Iain Borthwick: \u201cThe boys had to be on it, and our defence didn\u2019t give them an inch. \u201cDylan Borthwick came off after half an hour after taking a blow to the knee but returned towards the end to score four goals.\u201d A productive second half saw Caberfeidh leapfrog Skye into fourth place after beating the islanders 6-2. Jamie Gillies gave Skye an interval lead but Craig Morrison\u2019s treble, Kevin Bartlett\u2019s double and Ruaraidh MacKinnon all counted for Cabers. William MacKinnon bagged Skye\u2019s other goal. Cabers boss Garry Reid said: \u201cI always felt the goals were coming and I thought we played well.\u201d Beauly stretched their lead at the top of the Mowi National Division as they defeated Fort William 3-0. Euan MacCormick scored twice before Sandy Elick added a third. Allan MacDonald\u2019s hat-trick helped Inveraray beat Kilmallie 3-1. Innes Blackhall replied before being sent off a minute from time. Col Glen beat Oban Celtic 4-3. Daniel MacMillan, Gabriel Tidser and David Hill\u2019s penalty counted for Celtic with Col Glen replying through Scott MacVicar\u2019s quick-fire double and Auryn Kerr. Sam Bulloch\u2019s winner came eight minutes from time. Celtic\u2019s Kyle MacFarlane and Col Glen\u2019s Scott Symons were sent off in the final minute.

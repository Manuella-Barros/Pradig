After winning a silver medal in the 10-meter synchronized platform on her debut at the Beijing Olympics, Wu returned to the Olympic podium in Tokyo with a bronze medal in the 10-meter individual platform diving. The 32-year-old veteran is among a nine-member diving squad that the AOC has officially unveiled for the upcoming Paris Olympics. World champions Cassiel Rousseau and Domonic Bedggood will both contest their second Olympics, alongside Jaxon Bowshire, Kurtis Mathews, Alysha Koloi, and Ellie Cole, who are poised to make their debut. The seven divers joined Olympic bronze medalists Anabelle Smith and Maddi Keeney, both selected in May. According to the AOC, with 71 divers having already represented Australia at Olympic Games, Wu makes history as the first to make five Games, while Smith follows Jenny Donnet and Loudy Wiggins as four-time diving Olympians. Wu said that she was looking forward to focusing on improving further after earning her spot by winning the Australian trials. \"It's a pretty incredible thing to achieve five Olympic Teams,\" said Wu. \"Getting through trials, I knew it was going to be tough, there's so many talented young athletes coming through. Now I can set my sights on Paris - I'll focus on the process, if I can get that right hopefully the result will take care of itself,\" she added. Wu and her 17-year-old compatriot Ellie Cole, the oldest and youngest team members, will compete in the event of 10-meter platform individual diving during the Paris Olympics.", "summary": "<p>SYDNEY, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Melissa Wu, a Tokyo Olympic bronze medalist, is set to make history as the first Australian diver to participate in five Olympic Games, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) confirmed on Monday.</p><p> After winning a silver medal in the 10-meter synchronized platform on her debut at the Beijing Olympics, Wu returned to the Olympic podium in Tokyo with a bronze medal in the 10-meter individ", "url": "https://www.sydneysun.com/news/274415427/wu-to-make-history-as-first-australian-diver-to-make-fifth-olympics", "image": "https://static.midwestradionetwork.com/story_logos/premier/sydney-sun.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:03:54", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": 0.471}

Nasreen, who was expelled by Hasina in 1994, highlighted the irony of Hasina's departure, drawing parallels to her own situation. She condemned Hasina for enabling Islamist groups and corruption, and called for democracy over military rule as Bangladesh faces political turmoil. Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman took charge, promising an interim government following over 300 deaths in protests over a reintroduced controversial quota system.Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India on Monday after resigning amidst severe and escalating unrest. The protests, which began in early July, were fueled by the reintroduction of a controversial quota system for government jobs. The unrest quickly intensified into violent clashes, leading to Hasina's departure. Exiled Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen has publicly criticized Hasina, drawing a stark parallel between her own expulsion from Bangladesh and Hasina's current predicament.\n\nTaslima Nasreen recalled her expulsion from Bangladesh in 1999, orchestrated by Sheikh Hasina to appease Islamist factions upon her return to visit her ailing mother. She pointed out the irony that the same groups were now part of the movement that forced Hasina to flee.\n\n\"Hasina had to resign and leave the country. She was responsible for her situation. She made Islamists to grow. She allowed her people to involve in corruption. Now Bangladesh must not become like Pakistan. Army must not rule.

Despite the Bangladesh Supreme Court's decision to limit the quota, the protests grew more violent. On Sunday, clashes between protesters and police resulted in nearly 100 deaths, including 14 police officers. The unrest reached a tipping point when protesters stormed Hasina's official residence, prompting her to flee the country\n\nAccording to news agency AFP, the total number of people killed since the onset of the protests has reached at least 300.\n\nNasreen's Call for Democracy\n\nNasreen's critique extended beyond Hasina's personal failings. She condemned Hasina for allowing Islamist groups to gain power and permitting corruption to proliferate. Nasreen warned against the dangers of military rule and called for the restoration of democratic governance. She stated, \"Hasina had to resign and leave the country. She was responsible for her situation. She made Islamists grow. She allowed her people to involve in corruption. Now Bangladesh must not become like Pakistan. Army must not rule.

The same Islamists have been in the student movement who forced Hasina to leave the country today,\" Nasreen posted over X.\n\nNasreen, a controversial literary figure in Bangladesh due to her staunch take on patriarchy, the Islamic Code of Law and sexually descriptive texts, was arrested and later banished from her own country in 1994 as pressure from the Islamic conservatives loomed on the then Sheikh Hasina government.\n\nThe author drew global attention in 1993 when a fatwa was issued against her because of her infamous book 'Lajja', based on the persecution of a Hindu family by Muslims. She took refuge in India in 2004 and stayed in Kolkata. However, she was compelled to leave West Bengal after violent protests by Muslims against her writings in 2007. She was also in Sweden briefly during her exile. As of 2017, she was living in New Delhi.\n\nCalling out Hasina for the current hostility in Bangladesh, Nasreen said \"She was responsible for her situation. She made Islamists to grow. She allowed her people to involve in corruption. Now Bangladesh must not become like Pakistan. Army must not rule. Political parties should bring democracy & secularism.\"\n\nAfter Sheikh Hasina's exit, the Bangladesh army chief has announced that an interim government has been formed.

AI Shows Scary Pictures\n\nExiled Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen has voiced a scathing critique of Sheikh Hasina amid the ongoing crisis in Bangladesh. Nasreen, who has been living in exile since 1994, finds a poignant irony in Hasina's current predicament. \"Hasina threw me out of Bangladesh to please Islamists, who have now forced her out,\" she remarked, highlighting a twist of fate that underscores the complexities of Bangladesh's political landscape.\n\nNasreen's expulsion from Bangladesh in the 1990s was largely due to her outspoken views on religion and her criticism of Islamist extremism, which made her a target for radical groups. She believes that Hasina, in an attempt to consolidate power and placate Islamist factions, compromised on principles of secularism and democracy. This compromise, according to Nasreen, has now come back to haunt Hasina.\n\nHasina's recent ousting follows a period of escalating unrest in Bangladesh. The protests, initially sparked by economic grievances and allegations of corruption, have been further inflamed by Islamist groups. Nasreen argues that Hasina's government allowed these groups to gain influence, which ultimately contributed to the current turmoil. \"By turning a blind eye to the growing power of Islamist factions, Hasina sowed the seeds of her own downfall,\" Nasreen stated.\n\nThe author's critique extends to the broader political environment in Bangladesh. Nasreen contends that both major political parties, the Awami League led by Hasina and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), have failed to uphold the principles of secularism and democracy. She calls for a fundamental shift in the country's governance, emphasizing the need for a new political framework that prioritizes human rights, freedom of expression, and secular values.\n\nNasreen also commented on the pervasive corruption in Bangladeshi politics, which she sees as a significant factor in the current crisis. \"Corruption has become deeply entrenched in the political system, eroding public trust and fueling discontent,\" she noted. The combination of economic hardship, corruption, and the rise of Islamist extremism has created a volatile environment that threatens the stability of the nation.\n\nWhile Nasreen's comments are a reflection of her long-standing opposition to Islamist influence and her advocacy for secularism, they also resonate with many who are frustrated by the current state of affairs in Bangladesh. Her perspective adds a critical voice to the discourse surrounding the country's future, highlighting the urgent need for reforms that address both political corruption and religious extremism.\n\nAs the situation in Bangladesh continues to evolve, Nasreen's insights offer a sobering reminder of the complex interplay between politics and religion in the country. Her call for a renewed commitment to secularism and democratic principles is a plea for a more inclusive and just society, one that can withstand the pressures of both internal and external forces.\n\nNasreen's observations, while critical, are grounded in her deep concern for the country she was forced to leave. Her exile has not diminished her connection to Bangladesh; instead, it has given her a platform to advocate for change. Her words serve as a powerful reminder of the need to address the underlying issues that have led to the current crisis and to work towards a future that upholds the values of democracy and secularism.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taslima_Nasrin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taslima Nasrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radical politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative_Political_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative Political Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/08/06/1460933-taslima-nasrin-author.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793575", "eventUri": "eng-9793575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

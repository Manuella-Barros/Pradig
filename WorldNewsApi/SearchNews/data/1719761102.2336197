The US Congress recently granted President Joe Biden the authority to outright confiscate that money, according to Daleep Singh, the deputy national security adviser for international economics. \u201cThat would be the most efficient and potent option for all of us in the G7,\u201d Singh stated on Tuesday, speaking at an event hosted by the Brookings Institution think tank. \u201cBut seizing [the] principal is a red line for many of our G7 partners,\u201d Singh said, adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t have consensus as a G7\u201d on taking that step. In addition to the US, the G7 includes Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the UK and the EU. More than 80% of the frozen Russian assets are held by the EU, which is reluctant to expose its clearinghouse to Moscow\u2019s retaliation. Russia has vowed a reciprocal response to any \u201ctheft\u201d from the West. Arguing in favor of the move, Singh told the audience at Brookings that the \u201chistoric decision\u201d to freeze the sovereign funds \u201cdid not lead to an appreciable shift away from G7 currencies,\u201d so seizing the interest on it \u2013 as both the US and the EU have already agreed on doing \u2013 was merely factoring in \u201cthe risk already taken.\u201d The West can\u2019t afford to sit and wait, Singh said, because Ukraine is in a \u201cdire\u201d situation on the battlefield. \u201cIf we have a way to act with solidarity, and with speed, and at appreciable scale \u2013 which I would define as at least $50 billion \u2013 that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d Singh said. He added that the White House hoped this would happen at the upcoming summit in Italy, not just to fund Ukraine but to send \u201ca signal to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin that we\u2019re not going to fatigue and he\u2019s not going to outlast us, regardless of what happens in the remainder of the year.\u201d In his Brookings presentation, Singh also revealed that Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s speech in February 2022 created the \u201cemotional valence\u201d for the EU to agree to the \u201cshock and awe phase of the sanctions campaign,\u201d which had the goal of crashing the Russian currency. Singh admitted that this objective was not achieved, but insisted that the sanctions worked because the current situation was better than the \u201ccounterfactuals\u201d \u2013 things that could have possibly happened otherwise, but did not.", "summary": "<p><img src=\"https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/627cf09d85f5406e6f083a52.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin: 1em auto\"></p>\n<p>The US wants to seize frozen Russian sovereign funds and hand them over to Ukraine, but for some G7 member states that is a \u201cred line,\u201d the White House\u2019s architect of sanctions against Russia has confirmed.</p>", "url": "https://ifpnews.com/us-g7-confiscating-russian-money/", "image": "https://ifpnews.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=284831&type=iran-front-page&hash=ff0191d3234a7d6927f5d6c447520897", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:11:15", "author": "Ifp Media Wire", "authors": ["Ifp Media Wire"], "language": "en", "source_country": "IR", "sentiment": -0.301}

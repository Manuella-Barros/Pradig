They also make it easier for companies to have two classes of shares, a structure that's often favoured by entrepreneurs or early-stage investors who want to have a significant role in businesses even after they have gone public.\n\n\"We do not believe the status quo is an option,\" the FCA said in a policy statement. \"We have kept in mind that investors already choose to put their money in companies listed outside the UK, where the costly obligations we are removing do not exist. We believe institutional investors have the ability and heft to steer the companies they co-own.\"\n\nThe FCA proposed rewriting the listings rules in May 2023 in the midst of a highly-charged debate about London's future that was sparked by Cambridge-based technology company Arm Holdings' decision to list in the US. It later offered up a draft of the rules in December, following a dramatic drop in the number of new listings in London and a bevy of companies seeking to move their shares to New York.\n\nThat all renewed concerns about whether the UK can retain its place as one of the world's top financial centres while it suffers from less liquid markets after Brexit. There's also widespread belief that UK investors have less appetite for growth stocks compared to the US and Asia.\n\n\"These new rules represent a significant first step towards reinvigorating our capital markets,\" Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said in the statement, adding that the changes are bringing \"the UK in line with international counterparts and ensuring we attract the most innovative companies to list here.\"\n\nThe new rules, which have been months in the making, amount to regulators' biggest overhaul of the UK's listings regime in more than three decades. They will apply from Jul 29.\n\nWhen it comes to significant transactions, companies will now have more flexibility on the timing and content of the disclosures they're required to make, the FCA said. The regulator acknowledged that it was aware some market participants wouldn't be happy with its decision to not require companies to seek shareholder approval for significant and related-party transactions.\n\n\"We've been very upfront and very clear throughout that these changes will mean greater investor risk,\" Sarah Pritchard, executive director of markets and international at the FCA, said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio. \"That said, we do see investors invest internationally where these obligations don't exist. And we think that these changes better reflect the risk appetite that we need to achieve growth.\"\n\nInstitutional investors will also be allowed to hold enhanced voting rights, though the FCA did introduce a new 10-year deadline for investors to exercise these rights in order to protect future investors in a company.\n\nStill, Pritchard cautioned that more would need to be done to revive the UK's moribund equity capital markets. Indeed, the depth of liquidity in US public markets and less scrutiny over executive pay have been among the factors that have lured companies to New York.\n\n\"Regulatory reform is only one of the changes required to reinvigorate the UK's public markets,\" said Claire Keast-Butler, a partner at the law firm Cooley.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange (LSE) has said its listings pipeline was building up in anticipation of the reforms.\n\nJulia Hoggett, CEO of LSE, said the change will ensure that UK-listed companies benefit from \"a listing regime that better supports their growth ambitions, increases investment opportunities for UK investors and supports the UK economy\".\n\nThe FCA, however, has said easing rules will not alone be enough to make companies list in London, and that relying more on companies to make disclosures brings risks, echoing concerns from shareholder groups about standards being weakened.

takeovers and delisting.\n\n\"The new rules involve allowing greater risk,\" the FCA said, but added it \"believes the changes set out will better reflect the risk appetite the economy needs to achieve growth.\"\n\nThe announcement comes one week after Reeves' Labour Party won power in a landmark vote that ended 14 years of right-wing Conservative rule.\n\nCentre-left Labour, which had put growing the UK economy at the heart of its manifesto, won last Thursday's general election with a sizeable majority.\n\n\"The financial services sector is central to the UK economy, and at the heart

The regulator has warned repeatedly that the new rules will mean there is a higher risk of investors losing money but it said they would \"better reflect the risk appetite the economy needs to achieve growth\".\n\nLondon has struggled to compete with New York for listings of high-growth start-ups while large groups such as bookmaker Flutter and building materials group CRH have moved their primary listings to the US.\n\n\"The financial services sector is central to the UK economy, and at the heart of this government's [economic] growth mission,\" said Rachel Reeves, the UK's new chancellor, on Thursday.\n\n\"These new rules represent a significant first step towards reinvigorating our capital markets, bringing the UK in line with international counterparts and ensuring we attract the most innovative companies to list here,\" she said.\n\nThe shake-up is part of wider reforms begun by the previous Conservative government which the Labour administration is expected to continue.\n\nThey include the so-called Edinburgh and Mansion House reforms, designed to increase investment in UK assets by domestic pension funds and instil a culture of greater risk-taking.\n\nFurther changes are on the horizon with the FCA planning to launch a review of the UK's prospectus rules this summer.\n\nThe listing rule changes announced on Thursday are more drastic than previously proposed by the FCA in December because they will allow institutional investors to hold super voting rights under dual class share structures.\n\nThe FCA previously said it intended to allow only natural persons, such as founders and directors, to hold extra voting rights.\n\nThe change will mean investment groups such as private equity firms and venture capitalists may be able to hold more voting rights than other shareholders for up to 10 years.\n\nThe 10-year limit would not apply to sovereign wealth funds if they are controlling shareholders, a rule that could make it easier for some Middle East-owned companies in particular to list in the UK.\n\nIn a document published on Thursday, the FCA acknowledged that investors had been \"overwhelmingly against\" its plan to allow greater freedom to use dual class structures and had \"largely opposed\" its proposals.\n\nThe FCA said companies and their advisers had mostly supported increased flexibility to use dual class shares. It added that investors would have the option not to invest in any structure they were not comfortable with.\n\nSupporters of the proposals have argued that investors already back overseas companies with dual class shares, including US tech groups.\n\nThe new rules will abolish requirements for shareholders to approve related party transactions or certain other large deals. Votes will still be needed for a company to delist, carry out a \"reverse takeover\" of a larger business or if the company receives a takeover offer.\n\nThe new rules will also simplify the existing regime by collapsing the premium and standard segments into a single category. Existing companies will be able to avail of transitional arrangements.\n\nJustifying the changes, FCA boss Nikhil Rathi wrote that \"we do not believe the status quo is an option\" and that refusing to overhaul the rules would risk the UK regime falling \"increasingly out of step with those of other jurisdictions, making it less likely that companies eager to grow choose the UK as a place to list their shares\".", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Conduct_Authority",

Instead there will be one overall category for equity share listings, which has been named 'commercial companies.'\n\nPremium listings previously had additional requirements compared to standard ones. Some of these will be carried over and now applied to all listings, while others have been scrapped.\n\n\"The new rules remove the need for votes on significant or related party transactions and offer flexibility around enhanced voting rights. Shareholder approval for key events, like reverse takeovers and decisions to take the company's shares off an exchange, is still required,\" the FCA said.\n\nSome rules around eligibility for listings will also change, such as the removal of a requirement for companies to provide track records of their revenue.\n\nThe rules are a positive move for the U.K. IPO market, but could have gone further, Chris Haynes, corporate partner at law firm Gibson Dunn told CNBC in emailed comments.\n\n\"The move to a single listing category with streamlined eligibility criteria, and to disclosure-based continuing obligations, is one of a number of important initiatives which, together, should lead to more UK IPO activity,\" he said.\n\n\"In my view the FCA could have created further flexibility in some areas, such as in relation to dual class share structures, however overall it's a good outcome,\" Haynes added.\n\nThe new rules come at a time when the European listings market, and the U.K.'s in particular, have slumped. Major tech companies have recently favored the U.S. for their listings, including British chip designer Arm which chose to list on New York's Nasdaq last year.\n\nEuronext reported 64 equity listings on its platform last year, a significant drop from the 83 listings it welcomed in 2022.\n\nThe new rules were made in response to the 2021 U.K. Listing Review report which showed that the number of listed companies in the UK has declined by about 40% since 2008, and that only 5% of global IPOs between 2015 and 2020 took place in the U.K.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophie_kiderlin@nbcnewyork.com", "name": "Sophie Kiderlin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Conduct_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial Conduct Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reverse takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euronext", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euronext"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Direct_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Direct Marketing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Gift_Registry", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Gift Registry", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/07/108003880-1720621944820-gettyimages-1246744992-Vuk_Valcic_City_020223_1.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723048", "eventUri": "eng-9723048", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 210, "textEnd": 217}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

They also remove a requirement for companies to seek a shareholder vote on significant transactions, with the exception of reverse takeovers and a listing cancellation.\n\nBritain's finance ministry under the previous government had requested the changes to help London to compete more effectively with Amsterdam, Paris and elsewhere in the European Union - which has already eased its listings rules.\n\nLondon has already lost some high-profile listings to other markets, including UK chip designer Arm Holdings, which chose to list in New York.\n\nFast fashion retailer Shein meanwhile has begun the process for a London listing.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the rules are largely in line with proposals made last December. These had a mixed reception, with backers saying the plans simply brought London in line with rival centres, while critics said they would dilute investor rights.\n\nLindsey Stewart, director of stewardship research and policy at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said the new rules \"represent a gamble over whether the UK can build more attractive markets by introducing features that many of the largest investors are opposed to.\"\n\nPension scheme Railpen said it was \"deeply disappointed with the \"lost opportunity\" to make UK capital markets an environment where all parties have a voice.\n\nThe rules also merge the current two-tier standard and more onerous premium listing segments from July 29, a very short period as companies usually have many months to prepare.\n\nENHANCED VOTING RIGHTS\n\nUnder the new system, company founders or directors can have dual or enhanced voting rights for an unlimited period, a step that aims to attract more growth companies whose founders want to retain control after a listing.\n\nThe FCA, now required to show it has Britain's competitiveness in mind when writing rules, has also decided to allow pre-IPO institutional investors, such as private equity, to have enhanced voting rights for up to 10 years.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange has said its listings pipeline was building up in anticipation of the reforms.\n\nJulia Hoggett, CEO of LSE plc, said the change will ensure that UK-listed companies benefit from \"a listing regime that better supports their growth ambitions, increases investment opportunities for UK investors and supports the UK economy\".\n\nRobert Newman, a partner at DLA Piper law firm, said the overhaul is a \"much needed step towards enabling investors to rediscover their appetite to fund risk and, hopefully, enjoy its returns.\"\n\nThe FCA has flagged that easing the listing rules will not be enough on its own to make companies list in London. The watchdog has also highlighted that relying more on companies to make disclosures raises the risk of investors losing money.\n\nScott McCubbin, UKI IPO leader at consultants EY, said the new balance between investor protection and market attractiveness will need to be carefully monitored.\n\n\"From here, further efforts to support both institutional and retail investment into the market are critical to ensure the UK strengthens its competitiveness on the global stage,\" McCubbin said.\n\nThe previous government launched the \"Edinburgh\" and \"Mansion House\" reforms to make UK markets more attractive, and the new Labour government has indicated it would continue with those to help a cash-strapped Britain attract private money into the economy.\n\n(Additional reporting by

German-owned Tui also signed off a plan to delist from London in February.\n\nSarah Pritchard, an executive director at the FCA, says: \"A thriving capital market is vital in delivering investment to growing companies plus returns and choice to investors. That's why we are acting to make it more straightforward for those seeking to list in the UK.\"\n\nBy streamlining the listing process and introducing more flexibility, the FCA hopes to create fresh avenues for corporate financing and improve the competitiveness of the UK's stock markets, thereby increasing investment opportunities.\n\nNaureen Zahid, director of investor relations at venture capital firm OpenOcean, says: \"This is a much-needed shot of adrenaline for the London Stock Exchange. The FCA's new listing rules could unblock the UK's tech ecosystem by making public markets more accessible to early-stage companies.\n\n\"For startups, the streamlined eligibility requirements and reduced procedural hurdles mean faster and less costly access to capital, allowing them to scale more rapidly.\"\n\nUnder the new rules, set to take effect from the 29th July, the requirement for firms to get approval from shareholders for certain mergers will also be scrapped.\n\nThe need to consult shareholders for certain transactions has been off putting for some firms wanting to list in the UK, and was reported to have been one of the reasons the London Stock Exchange lost out to the US last year when UK chip maker Arm Holdings chose Wall Street over London for its stock market return.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"The financial services sector is central to the UK economy and at the heart of this government's growth mission.\n\n\"These new rules represent a significant first step towards reinvigorating our capital markets, bringing the UK in line with international counterparts and ensuring we attract the most innovative companies to list here.\"\n\nThe removal of the need for shareholder votes on significant or related party transactions, however, has troubled some investors.\n\nAlthough shareholder approval remains necessary for major events like reverse takeovers and delistings, the chief executive officer of investor group ICGN, Jen Sisson, says: \"Investors have repeatedly expressed their concerns over the listing rules reform, and have not been heard.\n\n\"The changes mean that shareholders, the owners of the company, will no longer have a right to vote on significant and related party transactions. Those votes are an important protection for minority investors, ensuring that large shareholders and company directors do not unfairly benefit from their position.\"\n\nThe regulator says: \"The FCA has been clear that the new rules involve allowing greater risk, but believes the changes set out will better reflect the risk appetite the economy needs to achieve growth.\"", "source": {"uri": "moneyweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyWeek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_newlands@moneyweek.com", "name": "Chris Newlands", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Conduct_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial Conduct Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keywords_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keywords Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUI_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TUI Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arm (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reverse takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of the Exchequer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/69yEeyz2iuSVKyZ5T4c938-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723048", "eventUri": "eng-9723048", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 1775, "textEnd": 1784}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

These changes reduce regulatory burdens and aim to attract more listings, a move driven by Britain's need to remain competitive globally post-Brexit.\n\nBritain's markets watchdog on Thursday introduced final rules for the most significant overhaul in company listings on the London Stock Exchange in three decades, aiming to better compete with New York and the EU post-Brexit.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) confirmed that the new rules, largely unchanged from last December's proposals, will merge the existing standard and premium listing segments starting July 29. Traditionally, firms are granted months to prepare for such changes.\n\nThe new rules are designed to lessen bureaucratic hurdles and make it easier for companies to disclose information at their discretion to potential investors. Notably, the requirement for shareholder approval on significant transactions has been eliminated, barring reverse takeovers and delisting actions.\n\nThe initiative, requested by Britain's finance ministry, aims to bolster London's standing as a global financial hub. This follows Brexit-induced competition from cities like Amsterdam and Paris, which have already lessened their listing regulations. Britain was unable to convince UK chip designer Arm Holdings to list in London over New York.\n\nFast fashion giant Shein is among companies beginning the London listing process under the new regulations. \"These new rules are a significant step towards revamping our capital markets, aligning the UK with international standards, and attracting innovative companies,\" said Rachel Reeves, Britain's newly elected finance minister.\n\nThe reforms also allow company founders and directors to retain dual or enhanced voting rights indefinitely, intending to attract growth-oriented firms. Pre-IPO institutional investors will also benefit from enhanced voting rights for up to ten years.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange asserts that its listings pipeline is growing in anticipation of these rule changes. CEO Julia Hoggett highlighted that the reforms will support the growth ambitions of UK-listed companies and enhance investment opportunities.

an overhaul of the country's stock market rules amid rising pressure after a string of firms shunned London listings.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said new rules will apply from the end of this month which will create a \"more straightforward\" listing structure.\n\nRachel Reeves was appointed Chancellor of the new Labour Government last week and she said it marks \"a significant first step towards reinvigorating our capital markets\".\n\nNevertheless, the FCA admitted its new plans will \"involve allowing greater risk\" in a bid to secure rewards through faster economic growth.\n\nThe shake-up will include scrapping rules that currently force a shareholder vote on transactions between UK-listed companies and \"related parties\".\n\nThis hurdle was partly blamed for Cambridge-based chip firm Arm's decision to list in the US over London last year by backer SoftBank.\n\nThe FCA said the new regulations will better align UK stock market rules with wider international standards.\n\nSarah Pritchard, executive director for markets and international at the FCA, said: \"A thriving capital market is vital in delivering investment to growing companies plus returns and choice to investors.\n\n\"That's why we are acting to make it more straightforward for those seeking to list in the UK while retaining vital protections so investors can help steer the

Between 2015 and 2020, the UK accounted for just 5% of all initial public offerings globally.\n\nAnd the trend appears to be continuing. At the start of this week, drinks manufacturer Britvic (BVIC), which is a FTSE 250 constituent, announced it had accepted a buyout offer from Carlsberg. The move would mean Britvic de-lists from the London Stock Exchange.\n\nBut politicians of all stripes have also expressed quiet concern that London is also not attracting as many new entrants to the market too, following high-profile companies like chipmaker Arm Holdings choosing New York for their listings. The news that fast fashion company Shein will list in London did something to quell the discomfort, but the UK is yet to play host to a technology listing that delivers for investors in the long term.\n\nJust days into her role as the UK's new chancellor of the exchequer, Rachel Reeves said the changes were a \"significant first step\".\n\n\"The financial services sector is central to the UK economy, and at the heart of this government's growth mission,\" she said.\n\n\"These new rules represent a significant first step towards reinvigorating our capital markets, bringing the UK in line with international counterparts and ensuring we attract the most innovative companies to list here.\"\n\nThe new rules will take effect on 29 July 2024, following a short implementation period.\n\nThe proposals are complicated, but they can be condensed down to the following:\n\n1. The FCA is sticking with its proposal to simplify the listing regime. This will involve a single listing category and \"streamlined\" eligibility requirements to make things simpler for listees;\n\n2. The UK will move to a \"disclosure-based\" system, which the FCA hopes will \"put sufficient information in the hands of investors, so they can influence company behaviour and decide how they want to invest.\"\n\nThe existing regime means corporate actions are put to mandatory votes, long seen as a key feature of the UK's global reputation for corporate governance. However, the FCA agrees they can also present stumbling blocks.\n\nInstead, \"significant transactions\" and \"related-party\" transactions will now be subject to official disclosures to allow investors to make up their own minds in a different way. Shareholder approval for reverse takeovers and de-listing will remain.\n\nWhen the FCA initially announced its proposals in December last year, there was some concern the proposed rules would result in a dilution of standards.\n\nIndeed, in an interview with Morningstar.co.uk in January this year, now-outgoing Witan Investment Trust chief executive Andrew Bell said the FCA should be careful not to \"throw the baby out with the bathwater\" in its efforts to make the UK a more attractive place to invest.\n\n\"One of the reasons a lot of foreign companies wanted to list in the UK was because it had a respected set of requirements in order to be listed,\" he said at the time.\n\n\"And there was a quality threshold. And so, if you abolished the quite quality threshold, the danger is you're going to end up with lots of poor-quality companies coming along, or the market gets poorly rated because people think, well, I don't trust the accounts.\"\n\nToday, concerns remain, despite the largely positive reception.\n\nChris Beckett, head of equity research at Quilter Cheviot, agreed the reforms were an important move, but highlighted the risk that governance standards might fall.\n\n\"Finally, while these reforms are a good, albeit limited, first step, we need to be careful not to lower standards too much,\" he said.\n\n\"Encouraging businesses to list here is beneficial, and we hope these reforms will help, despite reservations. However, attracting high quality companies requires maintaining robust governance standards. Given the FCA's mandate and actions to date, it fully understands the need to protect those standards.\"\n\nOne fund manager said it will take more than a listings overhaul to solve the UK's capital markets conundrum, however.\n\n\"These changes should be welcomed, as they will with other recent changes (the British ISA, for example) increase the attractiveness of the UK equity market,\" said James Lowen, senior fund manager of the Morningstar Silver-Rated JO Hambro Capital Management UK Equity Income fund.\n\n\"However, the changes to date have been incremental, and more will need to be done - for example, mandated domestic allocations for pensions funds, the removal of stamp duty - to fully restore the UK market competitiveness on the world stage and remove the material valuation discount the UK trades on.\"\n\nAs much was acknowledged by the FCA in its announcement.\n\n\"Regulation is only part of the answer in helping the UK achieve sustainable growth,\" Pritchard said.\n\n\"Other factors play a significant role in influencing where a company decides to list. We're committed to continually working together with all those who have a part to play in supporting a thriving UK capital market and thank everyone who has contributed to this work so far.\"",

Nevertheless, all content published by Proactive is edited and authored by humans, in line with best practice in regard to content production and search engine optimisation.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has introduced new rules for the UK's stock market listings to stimulate growth after a slowdown in initial public offerings (IPOs).\n\nEffective from July 29, the framework aligns the UK's listing system with other markets, simplifying and streamlining the process.\n\nThis marks the most significant change to the listing regime in over thirty years. The goal is to support a wider range of companies to list their shares on a UK exchange, thereby increasing investment opportunities.\n\nA major change is the elimination of the 'premium' and 'standard' listing segments, replaced by a single category called 'commercial companies.'\n\nPreviously, premium listings had additional requirements, some of which will now apply to all listings, while others have been removed.\n\nKey changes include removing the need for shareholder votes on significant or related party transactions and allowing flexibility around enhanced voting rights.\n\nHowever, shareholder approval remains necessary for major events like reverse takeovers and delisting.\n\nEligibility rules for listings have also been modified, including the removal of the requirement for companies to provide revenue track records.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"The financial services sector is central to the UK economy and at the heart of this government's growth mission.\n\n\"These new rules represent a significant first step towards reinvigorating our capital markets, bringing the UK in line with international counterparts and ensuring we attract the most innovative companies to list here.'\n\nExperts said the move to a single listing category with streamlined criteria and disclosure-based obligations is a positive step that should increase UK IPO activity. However, some thought the FCA could have added more flexibility, particularly regarding dual-class share structures.\n\n\"There's been a tug-of-war between two distinct groups here. On the one hand, many companies and their advisers want to remove what they see as needless risk aversion and red tape restricting the free flow of capital to new and growing businesses,\" said Lindsey Stewart of market data provider Morningstar.\n\n\"On the other, many investors want to preserve existing shareholder protections which they see as vital to ensuring a trusted and equitable market.\n\n\"It looks like the side favouring deregulation has prevailed when it comes to designing the shape of listing regulations this time around.\n\n\"But it's fair to say, the new rules represent a gamble over whether the UK can build more attractive markets by introducing features that many of the largest investors are opposed to.\"\n\nThe changes come in response to the 2021 UK Listing Review, which revealed a significant decline in the number of listed companies in the UK since 2008, and a low percentage of global IPOs taking place in the UK between 2015 and 2020.",

This change effectively hands more power to company boards and takes it away from investors.\n\nThe previous need for a vote on 'related party' transactions was thought to be a key reason why Arm Holdings decided against a London listing.\n\nA second change is that founders or directors of a company can have 'dual' or enhanced voting rights for an unlimited period. This brings the UK more into line with the United States - where such arrangements are common.\n\nThe aim here is to attract more growth companies, particularly in the tech sector, where founders want to retain control after the business comes to market. Similarly, institutional investors who backed a company prior to its stock market flotation will be allowed to enjoy enhanced voting rights for up to 10 years.\n\nA third change will sweep away so-called 'premium' and 'standard' listings and replace them with a single category for equities. The premium listing, which required companies to adhere to stricter rules and standards, was at the centre of a push seven years ago to attract Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, to list in London. A number of fund managers opposed the rules being bent to allow Aramco a premium listing which, had it listed in London, would have entitled it to FTSE 100 membership.\n\nConfirming the rule changes, Sarah Pritchard, the FCA's executive director for markets and international, admitted that the new rules would allow greater risk but insisted they would better reflect the risk appetite the UK economy needs to achieve growth.\n\nShe said the changes followed \"extensive engagement across the market\".\n\nMs Pritchard added: \"A thriving capital market is vital in delivering investment to growing companies plus returns and choice to investors. That's why we are acting to make it more straightforward for those seeking to list in the UK, while retaining vital protections so investors can help steer the businesses they co-own.\n\n\"Regulation is only part of the answer in helping the UK achieve sustainable growth. Other factors also play a significant role in influencing where a company decides to list. We're committed to continually working together with all those who have a part to play in supporting a thriving UK capital market and thank everyone who has contributed to this work so far.\"\n\nAmong those welcoming the rule changes was Dame Julia Hoggett, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, who has been at the heart of efforts to attract more companies to list in London and to make the City a more attractive place to do business.\n\nShe said: \"We congratulate the FCA on delivering the largest set of reforms to our listing rules in decades. It has been heartening to see how the entire ecosystem has come together to achieve this ambitious objective.\n\n\"It will ensure that companies listed in the UK can benefit from a listing regime that better supports their growth ambitions, increases investment opportunities for UK investors and supports the UK economy.\"\n\nAnd also giving the reforms her blessing was Rachel Reeves, the new chancellor, who said: \"The financial services sector is central to the UK economy, and at the heart of this government's growth mission.\n\n\"These new rules represent a significant first step towards reinvigorating our capital markets, bringing the UK in line with international counterparts and ensuring we attract the most innovative companies to list here.\"\n\nSo the rule changes clearly have a lot of supporters in high places.\n\nBut be in no doubt - they are by no means universally popular in the Square Mile.\n\nSome investors fear they represent an unacceptable lowering of standards that could end up saddling savers - who invest in the stock market via their pensions, ISAs and life policies - with more clunkers in their portfolios.\n\nA group of pension funds led by Railpen, which manages the retirement savings of 350,000 railway workers, wrote to the FCA last month urging a rethink. They pointed to rule changes made in 2006 with the aim of making the UK a more attractive listings destination for resources firms but which instead led to a string of investment disasters including Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC), a Kazakhstan-based mining company that for a while was a member of the FTSE-100 and Bumi, an Indonesian-based coal miner.\n\nCritics of the reforms - unfairly - also suspected a stitch-up because Nikhil Rathi, the chief executive of the FCA, was previously a senior executive at the London Stock Exchange.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com",

Companies will be able to float without the need for an extensive financial track record.\n\nIt is hoped that the changes will encourage more flotations in areas such as Scotland which have seen their stock of publicly listed companies dwindle in recent years. Scotland has lost a number of firms to takeover, including Aggreko and Stagecoach, and Wood Group is currently subject to a possible bid. Smaller firms, including Chris van der Kuyl's Parsley Box decided to return to private ownership.\n\nJames Ashton of the Quoted Companies Alliance, who recently gave a presentation in Edinburgh, said the changes have been a long time coming and reflect the need to address the mobility of finance.\n\nThe reforms, which come into effect on 24 July, follow two FCA consultations last year and are supported by the new Chancellor Rachel Reeves.\n\nShe said the changes \"represent a significant first step towards reinvigorating our capital markets, bringing the UK in line with international counterparts and ensuring we attract the most innovative companies to list here\".\n\nThe City regulator acknowledged that the new rules \"involve allowing greater risk\" amid warnings that they could lead to more stock market failures.\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: \"The government is clearly desperate to bolster UK listings as part of efforts to revitalise the City of London. However, the regulator's plans to loosen existing rules come with some serious potential negatives.\n\n\"The FCA's reforms risk diluting the quality of the UK stock market to a house made out of balsa wood. This includes giving shareholders less of a voice on matters like acquisitions even though they are a company's owners.\n\n\"It's important to make the UK market a more attractive place for investors with greater choice, particularly in sectors like technology which are under-represented on the London Stock Exchange versus the US.\n\n\"However, the worst thing the FCA can do is open the floodgates and let in any Tom, Dick or Harry onto the UK market.\n\n\"It feels as if the listing reforms could make the UK market a riskier place for investors if we get a wave of companies of questionable quality taking advantage of the relaxed rules and listing in London.\n\n\"The FCA even says in its report that access to a wider range of companies may result in increased risk of exposure to individual company failure. Ultimately, the reforms will put a greater onus on investors to do thorough research before making an investment.\n\n\"The junior AIM market in the UK took a long time to shake off its negative reputation as being the 'Wild West' for investors, and we certainly don't want to see a similar tag slapped on London's Main Market.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailybusinessgroup.co.uk", "dataType":

Sarah Pritchard, the FCA's executive director for markets and international, commented: \"A thriving capital market is vital in delivering investment to growing companies plus returns and choice to investors.\"\n\n\"That's why we are acting to make it more straightforward for those seeking to list in the UK while retaining vital protections so investors can help steer the businesses they co-own.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "henry_saker_clark@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Henry Saker-Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Conduct_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial Conduct Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of the Exchequer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article33216989.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_the-financial-regulator-is-to-launch-new-rules-later-this-month-aimed-to-boost-listings-in-the-london-stock-markets.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723048", "eventUri": "eng-9723048", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

They also remove a requirement for companies to seek a shareholder vote on significant transactions, with the exception of reverse takeovers and a listing cancellation.\n\nBritain's finance ministry under the previous government had requested the changes to help London to compete more effectively with Amsterdam, Paris and elsewhere in the European Union -which has already eased its listings rules.\n\nLondon has already lost some high-profile listings to other markets, including UK chip designer Arm Holdings, which chose to list in New York.\n\nFast fashion retailer Shein meanwhile has begun the process for a London listing.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the rules are largely in line with proposals made last December. These had a mixed reception, with backers saying the plans simply brought London in line with rival centres, while critics said they would dilute investor rights.\n\nLindsey Stewart, director of stewardship research and policy at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said the new rules \"represent a gamble over whether the UK can build more attractive markets by introducing features that many of the largest investors areopposed to.\"\n\nPension scheme Railpen said it was \"deeply disappointed with the \"lost opportunity\" to make UK capital markets an environment where all parties have a voice.\n\nThe rules also merge the current two-tier standard and more onerous premium listing segments from July 29, a very short period as companies usually have many months to prepare.\n\nENHANCED VOTING RIGHTS\n\nUnder the new system, company founders or directors can have dual or enhanced voting rights for an unlimited period, a step that aims to attract more growth companies whose founders want to retain control after a listing.\n\nThe FCA, now required to show it has Britain's competitiveness in mind when writing rules, has also decided to allow pre-IPO institutional investors, such as private equity, to have enhanced voting rights for up to 10 years.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange has said its listings pipeline was building up in anticipation of the reforms.", "source": {"uri":

The FCA's new regime merges the standard and premium listing segments, slashes regulatory red tape, and hands more disclosure responsibility to companies. Shareholder votes will now be required only for reverse takeovers and listing cancellations. These measures aim to make London more competitive with New York and EU markets, which have both eased their rules post-Brexit. This move comes as the UK seeks to boost its capital market attractiveness following high-profile snubs like UK chip designer Arm Holdings opting for a New York listing.\n\nWith these reforms, the London Stock Exchange aims to attract innovative companies and enhance its global standing. The changes could fuel growth for UK-listed firms, enhance investment opportunities for UK investors, and potentially make London a rival to financial giants like New York and Amsterdam. However, the FCA has warned that simply easing rules might not be enough, as there are risks linked to relying more on companies for disclosures.\n\nThe bigger picture: Post-Brexit financial pivot.\n\nSince Brexit, the UK has faced stiff competition from other European financial centers like Amsterdam and Paris. These new rules are part of a broader strategy to reinvigorate London's capital markets and align them with global standards.

The changes have been done in an attempt to encourage innovation and growth in what is seen as an increasingly lacklustre UK stock market.\n\nThe new rules have widely simplified the eligibility criteria for companies wishing to list in the UK, while also giving them more voting and decision-making power. Companies can now have dual-class share structures, which can go a long way in making sure that insiders, institutional investors and key stakeholders retain the shares with the most voting powers.\n\nAs a result, companies will be able to make more decisions without requiring shareholder approval, such as related party transactions. However, other important decisions such as reverse takeovers will still be subject to shareholder approval.\n\nThese changed rules will come into effect from 29 July onwards.\n\nSarah Pritchard, executive director, Markets and International at the FCA said in a statement: \"A thriving capital market is vital in delivering investment to growing companies plus returns and choice to investors. That's why we are acting to make it more straightforward for those seeking to list in the UK, while retaining vital protections so investors can help steer the businesses they co-own.\n\n\"Regulation is only part of the answer in helping the UK achieve sustainable growth. Other factors also play a significant role in influencing where a company decides to list. We're committed to continually working together with all those who have a part to play in supporting a thriving UK capital market and thank everyone who has contributed to this work so far.\"\n\nThe UK's new Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, also said: \"The financial services sector is central to the UK economy, and at the heart of this government's growth mission.\n\n\"These new rules represent a significant first step towards reinvigorating your capital markets, bringing the UK in line with international counterparts and ensuring we attract the most innovative companies to list here.\"\n\nThe new rules also make it much easier for innovative tech companies to list in the UK, without showing a three-year revenue history, thus encouraging more growth and diversity in the country's stock markets.\n\nAnne Glover, chief executive officer (CEO) of Amadeus Capital Partners, a venture capital firm which invests in early and growth stage tech companies said, in an email note: \"The UK has always been a great place for tech innovation and business development, but it has been clear for some time that there are a number of factors, both structural and cultural, making growth-stage tech companies hesitant about staying in the country and eventually listing here.\n\n\"I've always argued that changing this dynamic is possible, but only if action is taken by the asset management industry, government and regulators, which is why I welcome the FCA's change to the regulations.\n\n\"I have also called for pensions reform for a long time too, which would enable a small proportion of UK managed assets to be invested in UK entrepreneurial, risky, but very high potential private companies. The Mansion House Compact was a great first step. These are needed steps if we want to grow the economy sustainably by creating and building the industries of the future.\"\n\nThe UK stock market has been facing an exodus of companies lately, with the likes of Flutter Entertainment, Shell, CRH and Smurfit Kappa all choosing to up sticks and list in the US, due to a more welcoming legal and investment environment.\n\nHowever, in the last few months, UK initial public offerings (IPOs) have picked up slightly, with Raspberry Pi, Shein and Rosebank Industries being some of the most well-known names choosing the UK to list in. This has led to significant hope that the country's investment environment could be making a turnaround.\n\nRosebank Industries' IPO on Thursday was the first one since the general election, with share prices almost doubling on the same day.\n\nRegarding this, Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell said: \"The UK has a strong history of producing high quality industrial and manufacturing businesses, and if Rosebank can help any ailing ones to recover, then it would be good for the country as well as the fixer's pockets. But there is no guarantee that Rosebank will always clean up.\n\n\"For now, the market reaction to Rosebank's IPO could encourage other entrepreneurs to follow suit and list in the UK. That would be positive for the London Stock Exchange, given the market is currently diminishing in size due to takeovers and companies defecting to other countries, mainly the US. It would also play well into the FCA's new listings regime announced today, which hopes to make the UK an easier and more attractive place for companies to list.\n\n\"The regulator's intentions are good, but there are some flaws to the reforms as they could encourage lower quality and higher risk companies to list.\"", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Conduct_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial Conduct Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reverse takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Institutional investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosebank,_Staten_Island", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rosebank, Staten Island"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of the Exchequer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_plc", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shell plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutter_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flutter Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smurfit_Kappa", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smurfit Kappa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansion_House,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mansion House, London"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/49/45/88/1200x675_cmsv2_a3b336f3-a2da-57c6-8040-bf3117388166-8494588.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723048", "eventUri": "eng-9723048", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 1136, "textEnd": 1143}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

More firms will be able to issue shares on the UK market, which will increase investment possibilities.\n\nAmong the most notable modifications is eliminating the \"premium\" and \"standard\" listing categories.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves has enthusiastically endorsed UK regulatory proposals to dilute investor protections such as voting rights on big deals. The move dovetails with the new government's ambition to boost British growth, but will nonetheless raise eyebrows.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority's listing reforms, started under the previous Conservative government, are a big gamble. They aim to breathe life into a shrinking UK equity market, beset by competition from overseas bourses and private equity buyouts. It's a long-term trend: back in 2021, the FCA lamented that the number of listed companies had fallen by 40% since 2008. High profile UK companies, like SoftBank Group-backed (9984.T)New Tab, opens new tab Arm , have floated elsewhere.\n\nThe FCA's hope is that fewer restrictions will encourage more companies to list in Britain. It plans to do away with a complex system of premium and standard initial public offerings with different levels of investor protection. As a result, listed companies will find it easier to avoid holding votes on significant or related-party deals, and have dual-class share structures. Notably, private equity and sovereign wealth funds will benefit from the laxer treatment too.\n\nReeves' support for all this is understandable. The government wants to revive UK growth, and innovations like its new wealth fund require major private sector investment. A vibrant stock market will please the M&A and IPO bankers who inhabit the ecosystem. It also helps offset less market-friendly plans like raising taxes on private equity and ending Britain's beneficial tax status for wealthy non-domiciled people.\n\nYet the FCA's plans aren't universally liked. The regulator conceded that most asset managers, overseeing the savings of working people Labour has traditionally represented, are opposed. No wonder: avoiding votes on deals could make it easier for executives to launch mis-priced takeovers, or siphon off assets from shareholders. Waving through dual-class shares further deprives shareholders of a meaningful say.\n\nNor is it clear that the rules will achieve their stated aim. They may level the playing field with other jurisdictions like the United States, and entice some companies with dominant founders to list. Yet bigger steps are needed to revive the stock market: the UK's fragmented pension and asset management sectors need consolidation; citizens need to save and invest more; and Brexit damage -- which caused trading to migrate to the continent -- needs to be undone.\n\nPeter Mandelson, an architect of the New Labour government that swept to power in 1997, once declared he was \"intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich, as long as they pay their taxes\". That statement aged poorly after Labour had to bail out risk-taking banks. If FCA reforms usher in a series of low-quality listings, Reeves' enthusiasm will also look a tad awkward.\n\nFollow @Unmack1New Tab, opens new tab on X\n\nCONTEXT NEWS\n\nUK finance minister Rachel Reeves on July 11 gave a full endorsement to a series of listing reforms proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority intended to water down shareholder protections.\n\n\"The financial services sector is central to the UK economy, and at the heart of this government's growth mission,\" Reeves said in a press release published by the FCA announcing the reforms.\n\n\"These new rules represent a significant first step towards reinvigorating our capital markets, bringing the UK in line with international counterparts and ensuring we attract the most innovative companies to list here,\" Reeves added.\n\nThe FCA's primary markets effectiveness review will do away with the current regime of primary and standard listings, as well as the protections previously seen in the main primary listing. The rules make it easier for companies to avoid shareholder votes on significant transactions, and put in place dual-class share structures when listing.\n\nThe FCA acknowledged in its review that the \"predominant\" preference of pension schemes and asset managers was to retain premium listing rules for dual-class share structures and shareholder votes.\n\nRailpen, which oversees 34 billion pounds of savings, said in March that the proposals \"will not create the healthy capital markets the UK needs\". The proposals \"will exacerbate the current situation and make the UK less appealing to the high-quality investors which any financial market needs in order to thrive\".\n\nEditing by George Hay and Streisand Neto\n\nBreakingviews\n\nReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

United Utilities gets a \u00a394 rise (21%) while Pennon's South West Water arm gets a \u00a364 (13%) rise. All exclude inflation.\n\nOfwat said in total, an average bill will rise by \u00a319 a year and pay for \u00a388 billion of spending by the sector of which \u00a335 billion will be directed towards fewer sewage spills and better water quality, including \u00a310 billion for storm overflows.\n\nFootsie up 18 at 8,211.\n\n8.55am: The morning so far\n\nThe FTSE 100 shifted to and fro when trading commenced this Thursday, but it ultimately looks to be heading in the right direction.\n\nAs of 8.55am, the blue-chip index was trading 15 points higher at 8,208, supported by a raft of bullish economic announcements.\n\nGDP figures show that the economy grew by 1.4% year on year in May, outstripping the expected growth rate of 1.2% and doubling April's 0.7% gain.\n\nMonth on month, gross domestic product grew by 0.4%, an upside surprise following a zero-growth period in April, though the data still shows \"significant room for improvement under the incoming Labour government\", according to Rob Morgan, chief investment analyst at Charles Stanley (LSE:CAY).\n\nConstruction output, meanwhile, advanced by 0.8% year-on-year in May, marking a strong rebound from a 2.1% drop in the prior month and exceeding market expectations of a 1.9% decline.\n\nWater firms Severn Trent PLC (LSE:SVT) and United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.) were the two biggest FTSE 100 risers of the morning.\n\nThis follows regulator Ofwat's latest draft determination, which sets the pricing and investment agenda for British water firms.\n\nOn average, water bills are set to rise 21% by 2030, Ofwat declared.\n\nThough this is less than what the water firms wanted, Severn Trent is higher following a decent first-quarter financial update.\n\nElsewhere in company news, Dr Martens has published a bare trading update prior to its AGM meeting this morning.\n\nThe classic British footwear company said that \"trading since the start of this financial year has been in line with expectations and our guidance for (financial 2025) remains unchanged\".\n\n8.43am: Construction output grows\n\nConstruction output in the UK advanced by 0.8% year-on-year in May 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThis marks a significant rebound from a 2.1% drop in the prior month and exceeded market expectations of a 1.9% decline.\n\nIt was the first expansion in construction output since January.\n\nThe increase was driven by a 7.7% rise in repair and maintenance activity, up from 6.4% in April, while new work saw a smaller decline of 4% compared to 9.4% previously.\n\n8.30am: Dr Martens targets growth in US direct-to-customer market\n\nDr Martens has published a bare trading update prior to its AGM meeting this morning.\n\nThe classic British footwear company said that \"trading since the start of this financial year has been in line with expectations and our guidance for (financial 2025) remains unchanged\".\n\nThe first quarter is typically \"the smallest period of our financial year, representing the end of the Spring/Summer season\", said the group, adding that the current financial year will be weighted to the second half.\n\n\"The upcoming Autumn/Winter 24 season remains a key focus,\" said Dr Martens, with detailed trading plans currently being implemented.\n\nDr Martens is targeting target positive direct-to-customer growth in the US in the second half of the current financial year.\n\n\"Work on our cost action plan is ongoing and we will provide a detailed update at our first half results in November.\"\n\nShares were up 1.6% in opening exchanges.\n\n8.25am: Blue chips wobble\n\nMarkets dipped their toes into the red in opening trades despite pre-market data pointing to a strong start.\n\nThe FTSE 100 is currently a handful of points lower at 8,191, with Rolls-Royce Group plc, BAE Systems PLC (LSE:BA.) and Antofagasta plc among the worst performers.\n\n8.10am: Labour has inherited improving economy, GDP data shows\n\nBritain's economy grew by 1.4% year on year in May, outstripping the expected growth rate of 1.2% and doubling April's 0.7% gain.\n\nMonth on month, gross domestic product grew by 0.4%, an upside surprise following a zero-growth period in April.\n\n\"This should be a boon for the new Labour government with growth now likely to outstrip the OBR's 2024 GDP forecasts, partially offsetting some of the projected increase in interest rate costs,\" said Deutsche Bank's chief UK economist Sanjay Raja.\n\nAccording to Rob Morgan, chief investment analyst at Charles Stanley (LSE:CAY): \"The UK's economic scorecard shows significant room for improvement under the incoming Labour government.\n\n\"The UK economy has been subdued coming out of the pandemic, an energy crisis, and a cost-of-living crisis which has been very difficult for UK consumers.\n\n\"However, tepid growth now looks to be warming up heading into the second half of the year.\"\n\nMorgan said today's GDP data \"illustrates we are in the midst of a very gentle upswing in activity following a slowdown in 2023\"\n\n7.59am: Thames Water bills to rise by \u00a399, barely half of what it sought\n\nOfwat will allow Thames Water to raise its annual bills by \u00a399 over the next five years, falling significantly below what the London and south east England water supplier wanted.\n\nOfwat made the announcement in its latest draft determination, which sets investment and pricing targets for Britain's water suppliers.\n\nThames Water was seeking a \u00a3191 bill rise to support investment in creaking infrastructure.\n\nDespite slashing Thames Water's pricing wishes, Ofwat has outlined some strict expectations of the water supplier.\n\nOfwats expects Thames Water to deliver a 19% reduction in leakage, and 18% reduction in phosphorus and a full 50% reduction in pollution incidents from average 2020-23 levels.\n\nOver 2025-30, Thames Water should deliver a 66% reduction in water supply interruptions and a 55% reduction in internal sewer flooding events from 2020-23 levels.\n\nThames Water is expected to deliver \u00a316.9 billion worth in total infrastructure improvements.\n\n7.35am: Annual water bills to rise 21% by 2030\n\nWater bills are expected to rise by \u00a319 per year to fund investment into Britain's ageing infrastructure, Ofwat has declared.\n\nIt means the average household water bill across the UK will increase from \u00a3441 to \u00a3535 by 2030, an increase of 21%.\n\nThis is below the average asked of Ofwat by Thames Water, United Utilities and other major water firms.\n\nOfwat laid out the plans in the regulator's draft determination, which sets the agenda for all UK water firms over the next five years.\n\nIt has proposed total investment spending to increase to \u00a388 billion between 2025 and 2030, a 50% increase from the previous draft determination.\n\nOfwat expects water companies to triple investment in new infrastructure and resources \"to improve the environment, resilience and service\".\n\n\"We expect increased investment to be reflected in better performance,\" said Ofwat.\n\n\"We set each company targets for up to 23 areas of performance which are important to customers.\n\n\"If companies do not meet their targets each year, they will face automatic penalties, reflected in reduced bills. But there are incentives to beat the targets, and good performance will be rewarded.\"\n\nSouth West Water owner Pennon and United Utilities said they will review Ofwat's draft determination and will respond by 28 August.\n\n7.10am: Markets to bounce higher\n\nThe FTSE 100 looks set to move high when trading commences today following a bullish session on Wednesday, when the blue-chip index finished 53 points higher at 8,193.\n\nMarkets were buoyed by a strong performance from airline and utilities stocks, as well an afternoon rally from Ladbrokes-owner Entain PLC (LSE:ENT) in the run up to England's victory over Netherlands in the Euro semi-finals.\n\nBetter-than-expected GDP figures released this morning should offer some support.\n\nThe economy expanded 1.4% year on year in May, beating expectations of a 1.2% expansion. Month on month, the economy rose 0.4% after not moving a blip in April.\n\nOn the company news front, recruiter Hays PLC (LSE:HAS) reports its full-year earnings amid a lukewarm time for City recruiters.\n\nWater firms are on tenterhooks as Ofwat prepares to rule on their five-year investment and pricing plans in the latest draft determination.", "source": {"uri":

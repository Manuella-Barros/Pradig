Job openings also fell a tad.\n\nThe number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits jumped to its highest level in a year last week, even as the labor market remains surprisingly healthy in an era of high interest rates.\n\nJobless claims for the week ending July 27 climbed by 14,000 to 249,000, from 235,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It's the most since the first week of August last year and the 10th straight week that claims have come in above 220,000. Before that stretch, claims had remained below that level in all but three weeks this year.\n\nThe June Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) indicates real struggles on the manufacturing side of the economic engine. Weakened demand is again a sign of consumers under tremendous financial pressure.\n\nUS manufacturing activity contracted more sharply than expected last month, according to industry survey data published Thursday, deepening a recent slump on continued weak demand and falling output.\n\n...\"This is a very downbeat report underlining that the manufacturing sector continues to struggle,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics senior US economist Oliver Allen wrote in a note to clients.\n\nWhatever wages workers are being paid are nowhere near what they need to keep up with the Biden-Harris inflation cycle, no matter how productive they are or what raises they've gotten. Or how often they're told they should be grateful because things are really, really good.\n\nAnd it's not just the United States feeling the pinch, which also hurts our exports.\n\nYou can see manufacturing sinking everywhere the climate cult has taken hold and driven energy prices through the roof in concert with insane environmental regulation.

In Asia, Japan's benchmark indexes tumbled more than 5% on Friday, with the Nikkei index notching its worst day in over four years, Reuters reported.\n\nCedric Chehab, global head of country risk at research firm BMI, said a combination of factors were at play amid souring market sentiment. However, he insisted \"corrections like this are absolutely normal.\"\n\n\"The sell-off started about a week and a half ago but then it started to escalate down lower in the middle of this week. That was triggered by several things,\" Chehab told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" on Friday.\n\n\"First of all, the hawkish Bank of Japan caused an implosion of the carry trade over a short-term basis. We also had bad manufacturing data out of the U.S. and some employment sub-indicators which scared markets,\" he continued.\n\n\"And then overnight, we saw a lot of volatility in some of the major earnings. And all of that helps push equity markets, which had been quite expensive, even lower.\"\n\nChehab said one factor that some investors appeared to be forgetting was that there is typically a seasonal rise in equity market volatility between the period of July and October.\n\n\"So, this isn't to be completely unexpected given the historical patterns around calendar effects on equity markets, especially after the fact that there was such a large rally in U.S. stocks and global stocks.\"\n\nAsked whether the sell-off means investors should be thinking about hitting the panic button, Chehab replied, \"No, I don't think so. And that's because from a technical perspective there is a lot of support, in terms of moving averages and key technical levels.\"\n\nHe added, \"corrections like this are absolutely normal, particularly when you have momentum which is overdone on the upside.\"\n\nPolicymakers at the U.S. central bank on Wednesday held interest rates steady, although Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave investors some hope by signaling a September rate cut is on the table.\n\nShane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at investment management firm AMP, said a correction appears to be getting underway.\n\n\"Shares went sky-high into July on the back of better news on inflation, increasing optimism about lower interest rates ahead and optimism about IT and AI related earnings,\" Oliver said in a research note published Friday.\n\nHe added that while AMP's view is that lower interest rates ahead will likely boost shares over the next six to 12 months, assuming a recession is avoided, global shares \"look vulnerable to further falls suggesting that it's too early to buy the dip just yet.\"\n\nMarket attention now turns to the closely watched nonfarm payrolls report later on Friday, with investors looking for clues on the pace and scale of Fed cuts over the coming months.\n\n\"The past 24 hours have seen an increasingly precarious backdrop for risk markets, with a risk-off mood

This made some sense with inflation for the first time in a while becoming the primary market bogeyman over a slowing economy. But now investors find themselves with a series of disappointing economic data points a day after the Fed voted to keep its short-term rate at the highest in two decades. Yes, Fed Chair Jerome Powell did give a solid hint on Wednesday that modest quarter-point rate cut was coming in September, but the market is waking up Thursday to the fear that perhaps that will be too little, too late. The weak data on the day: July manufacturing activity in the U.S. fell 1.7 percentage point from June to 46.8%, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Any number below 50% signals a contraction. First-time filings for unemployment insurance totaled 249,000 last week, an increase of 14,000 and above the estimate. It was the highest level since August 2023. Announced layoffs last month were the highest for any July in more than two decades, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported. Investors got what they thought they wanted, with the 10-year Treasury yield breaking below 4% for the first time since February. But instead of rallying, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is diving . .DJI 1D mountain Dow, 1-day Stocks that have the most to lose in a recession led the way, with JPMorgan Chase and Caterpillar down. Even tech stocks found themselves in the red as they too, may be hurt more by a slowing economy, than their valuations are boosted by lower rates. \"The economic data keep rolling on in the direction of a downturn, if not recession, this morning,\" said Chris Rupkey, FWDBONDS chief economist. \"The stock market doesn't know whether to laugh or cry because while three Fed rate cuts may be coming this year and 10-year bond yields are falling below 4%, the winds of recession are coming in hard according to purchasing managers at manufacturing firms.\" Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge agreed: \"The ISM shortfall is just the latest sign of cooling domestic growth conditions, and another sign that the Fed should have commenced its easing cycle yesterday instead of waiting until Sept.\" The market appears to be returning to the natural order of things where investors wished for a strong economy that lifts earnings first, with a tailwind of lower rates that boosts valuations as a far second hope. Just in time for the July jobs report Friday, which is expected to show payroll growth slowed to 185,000 from 206,000 payrolls in the prior month, per Dow Jones estimates. -- With reporting by Yun Li, Jeff Cox", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_melloy@cnbc.com", "name": "John Melloy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenger,_Gray_&_Christmas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Challenger, Gray & Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outplacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outplacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Supply_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institute for Supply Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payroll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caterpillar Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108014337-1722442619172-gettyimages-2164636256-ms1_6715_cgesh9gz.jpeg?v=1722442671&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784408", "eventUri": "eng-9784408", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Initial jobless claims rose the most since August 2023. And the ISM manufacturing index, a barometer of factory activity in the U.S., came in at 46.8%, worse than expected and a signal of economic contraction.\n\nAfter these releases, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped below 4% for the first time since February.\n\nThese weak data releases come a day after central bank policymakers chose to keep rates at the highest levels in two decades, when Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave investors some hope by signaling a September rate cut could be on the table.\n\nLabor situations is on the radars also, as fresh unemployment data expected on Friday, August 2.\n\nThe Federal Reserve risks further weakening the US economy and tanking US stock markets.\n\nAs the unemployment rate has risen in recent months, it has fueled speculation that the strong labor market is cracking and pointing to potential trouble ahead, with full-time employment in the US declining by about 1.23 million jobs over the past 12 months, and part-time employment adding about 1.52 million jobs (May'24 data).\n\nWhile much of the attention of financial analysts in June and July 2024 was focused on the Fed's rhetoric, inflation and manufacturing statistics, the US unemployment rate, which is recovering from its 55-year lows, is much greater thing.\n\nIn technical terms, June'24 will be the 4th month in a row, US unemployment rate is above its 26-week (6-month) simple moving average.\n\nHistorical backtest analysis of the entire history of data since the end of World War II indicates that the onset of a recession in the United States is just around the corner.\n\nIn any case, such labor market symptoms have always, in all cases without exception, signaled either an already occurring or an imminent US recession.\n\nThe main graph (Nasdaq-100 Futures cont. contract) indicates on a potential symmetry for further bearish development. with the nearest target roughly S14'000 mark (that is corresponding also to 5-years SMA).", "source": {"uri": "tradingview.com",

While 30-stock Dow Jones fell 494.82 points, or 1.21%, to end at 40,347.97, the S&P 500 slipped 1.37% to end at 5,446.68. Similarly, the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.3% to settle at 17,194.15. Besides, other data also triggered the general apprehension of an impending recession that the US economy is heading to. While unemployment data continued to rise and reached its highest level since August 2023, the ISM manufacturing index, came down at 46.8%. The barometer of factory activities in the US is at its worst level, further signaling economic contraction. The 10-year Treasury yield followed these parameters and dropped below 4% for the first time since February 2024.\n\nThough Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated a cut in the interest rates in September, economic experts believe it is too late and too little to assuage the frayed situation. Talking to CNBC, Chris Rupkey, Chief Economist at FWDBONDS, said that Thursday's data hinted at an economic downturn amid the volatility. Elaborating on it, he said that the stock market doesn't know whether to laugh or cry because while three Fed rate cuts may be coming this year and 10-year bond yields are falling below 4.00%, the winds of recession are coming in hard.\n\nAlso Read : Terminator Zero: Check out what new trailer reveals and know about plot, voice cast, production, release date and where to watch\n\nAccording to the business news outlet, the notable losers during the day's trading session were those stocks that would suffer most in recession. These include JPMorgan Chase which slipped 2.3%, and Boeing which lost more than 6% Thursday.\n\nNvidia shares lost 6.7% of their value because investors apprehended a more volatile time for the market as the November election approached.

The ISM manufacturing index, a barometer of factory activity in the U.S., came in at 46.8%, worse than expected and a signal of economic contraction.\n\nThe weak data led investors to worry the Federal Reserve may be behind the curve in cutting interest rates to fend off a recession.\n\nEuropean stocks fell around 1.6% on Friday morning, tracking a slide on Wall Street. In Asia, Japan's benchmark indexes tumbled more than 5% on Friday, with the Nikkei index notching its worst day in over four years, Reuters reported.\n\nCedric Chehab, global head of country risk at research firm BMI, said a combination of factors were at play amid souring market sentiment. However, he insisted \"corrections like this are absolutely normal.\"\n\n\"The sell-off started about a week and a half ago but then it started to escalate down lower in the middle of this week. That was triggered by several things,\" Chehab told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" on Friday.\n\n\"First of all, the hawkish Bank of Japan caused an implosion of the carry trade over a short-term basis. We also had bad manufacturing data out of the U.S. and some employment sub-indicators which scared markets,\" he continued.\n\n\"And then overnight, we saw a lot of volatility in some of the major earnings. And all of that helps push equity markets, which had been quite expensive, even lower.\"\n\nChehab said one factor that some investors appeared to be forgetting was that there is typically a seasonal rise in equity market volatility between the period of July and October.\n\n\"So, this isn't to be completely unexpected given the historical patterns around calendar effects on equity markets, especially after the fact that there was such a large rally in U.S. stocks and global stocks.\"\n\nAsked whether the sell-off means investors should be thinking about hitting the panic button, Chehab replied, \"No, I don't think so. And that's because from a technical perspective there is a lot of support, in terms of moving averages and key technical levels.\"\n\nHe added, \"corrections like this are absolutely normal, particularly when you have momentum which is overdone on the upside.\"\n\nPolicymakers at the U.S. central bank on Wednesday held interest rates steady, although Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave investors some hope by signaling a September rate cut is on the table.\n\nShane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at investment management firm AMP, said a correction appears to be getting underway.\n\n\"Shares went sky-high into July on the back of better news on inflation, increasing optimism about lower interest rates ahead and optimism about IT and AI related earnings,\" Oliver said in a research note published Friday.\n\nHe added that while AMP's view is that lower interest rates ahead will likely boost shares over the next six to 12 months, assuming a recession is avoided, global shares \"look vulnerable to further falls suggesting that it's too early to buy the dip just yet.\"\n\nMarket attention now turns to the closely watched nonfarm payrolls report later on Friday,

"There are genuine concerns the world's largest economy is heading toward a recession, and the fear is gripping global financial markets.\n\nThere are genuine concerns the world's largest economy is heading toward a recession, and the fear is gripping global financial markets.\n\nThursday night's official US jobless claims figures showed a surprising number of Americans out of work.\n\nSeparate figures showing a weak manufacturing sector added to worries about the US economy.\n\nThe news sent global financial markets into a tailspin Friday, on fears the US economy was on track for what is known as a hard landing.\n\nIt followed weeks and months of an incredible run-up in stock prices in the US and in Australia.\n\n\"Shares went sky high into July on the back of better news on inflation, increasing optimism about lower interest rates ahead and optimism about IT and AI-related earnings,\" AMP's head of investment strategy Shane Oliver said.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve announced late this week it was leaving official interest rates unchanged at between 5.25 per cent and 5.5 per cent.\n\nAt the time it was seen as \"good news\", given chairman Jerome Powell's qualified commitment to lowering interest rates in September.\n\nHowever, investors later questioned whether this was a policy mistake given the weaker-than-expected economic data, suggesting the Federal Reserve chair should have already cut interest rates.\n\nThe problem is that, like Australia, the Federal Reserve is reluctant to cut interest rates until it sees further evidence inflation is cooling.\n\nThe fear at the heart of this share market plunge is that the US central bank has lifted interest rates too high for too long.\n\n\"The [benchmark] ASX 200 surged above 8,100 index points mid-week, helped by lower-than-feared inflation and a boost from rising Fed easing [interest] prospects,\" Dr Oliver said.\n\n\"But the gains were reversed [on Friday] as global growth worries left the market up just 0.3 per cent or so for the week, with falls in financial, health and material stocks mostly offsetting the gains in all the other sectors.\"\n\nBond yields fell sharply, reflecting expectations for lower interest rates along with safe haven demand.\n\nThe yield on the US 10 Year Treasury bond, for example, had dived to 3.79 per cent by early Saturday morning, Australian eastern time.\n\nIt had been trading at 4.2 per cent earlier in the week.\n\nShare investors often flee to the relative safety of bonds when the share market wobbles, which increases the prices of bonds and lowers the interest rate on them.\n\nOvernight US share markets were again overwhelmed by selling activity.\n\nAnd, again, it was weaker economic news that had investors more bearish.\n\nUS payroll data showed the unemployment rate climbing to 4.3 per cent -- the highest rate since 2021.\n\nNon-farm payrolls grew by just 114,000 last month, the Labor Department reported, a slowing from 179,000 jobs added in June and below the 185,000 expected by economists polled by Dow Jones.\n\nIt is further evidence the US economy may be in trouble.\n\nUS stocks fell heavily on the assumption demand in the economy is set to dive.\n\nThe broad market index dropped 1.84 per cent to end at 5,346.56.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite (which houses the big technology stocks) lost 2.43 per cent to close at 16,776.16, bringing the decline for the tech-heavy index from its recent all-time high to more than 10 per cent.\n\nIt means the Nasdaq has entered a \"technical correction\".\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 610.71 points, or 1.51 per cent, to finish at 39,737.26.\n\nAt its session low, the 30-stock index was down 989 points.\n\n\"Our view remains that lower interest rates will boost shares on a six to 12 month, view assuming recession is avoided,\" Dr Oliver said.\n\n\"However, in the next few months global and Australian shares look vulnerable to further falls, suggesting that it's too early to buy the dip just yet as: valuations are stretched; investment sentiment looks somewhat optimistic; recession risk is high; there has been a heavy reliance on tech shares to keep the key US share market going.\n\n\"And geopolitical risk is high particularly around the US election but also around the Middle East, with increasing risks of escalation in the Israel war to include Hezbollah and Iran with risks to oil supplies.\"\n\nMarcus Today market analyst Henry Jennings said, fundamentally, global investors had been spooked by the prospect of a US recession.\n\n\"US 10-year yields (interest rates) have fallen below 4 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\"The economic data flashes a warning on the economy and recession talk is back again.\n\n\"Earnings (or company profit announcements in the US) have failed to deliver in places and the bullishness has been replaced very quickly with negative volatility.\n\n\"Japan is under serious pressure, also denting sentiment in the region, with some spillover expected.\"\n\n\"We are being tossed around on a sea of volatility and new worries,\" he added.\n\nThose new worries though could bring about lower interest rates sooner than expected both in the United States and in Australia.\n\nJamieson Coote Bonds co-founder Angus Coote said sustained share market selling pressure and its impact on the economy would give the Reserve Bank pause for thought.\n\n\"I think the earliest [RBA interest rate cut] is November,\" he said.\n\n\"I would say it would have to be relatively extreme on share markets for the RBA to consider cutting rates before November but it's not impossible by any means.\"", "source": {"uri": "home.nzcity.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZCity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

New economic data showed initial jobless claims rose the highest in a year and a manufacturing index that measures factory activity in the U.S. came in worse than expected, causing renewed worries of a recession and a broad sell off in stocks.\n\nStrategists on Friday urged investors to take a cautious approach to a global stock market sell-off, warning it may be too early to buy the dip given that shares \"look vulnerable to further falls.\"\n\nU.S. stocks kicked off August sharply lower as fresh data prompted fears of a worsening economic outlook.\n\nInitial jobless claims rose the most since August 2023. The ISM manufacturing index, a barometer of factory activity in the U.S., came in at 46.8%, worse than expected and a signal of economic contraction.\n\nThe weak data led investors to worry the Federal Reserve may be behind the curve in cutting interest rates to fend off a recession.\n\nEuropean stocks fell around 1.6% on Friday morning, tracking a slide on Wall Street. In Asia, Japan's benchmark indexes tumbled more than 5% on Friday, with the Nikkei index notching its worst day in over four years, Reuters reported.\n\nCedric Chehab, global head of country risk at research firm BMI, said a combination of factors were at play amid souring market sentiment. However, he insisted \"corrections like this are absolutely normal.\"\n\n\"The sell-off started about a week and a half ago but then it started to escalate down lower in the middle of this week. That was triggered by several things,\" Chehab told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" on Friday.\n\n\"First of all, the hawkish Bank of Japan caused an implosion of the carry trade over a short-term basis. We also had bad manufacturing data out of the U.S. and some employment sub-indicators which scared markets,\" he continued.\n\n\"And then overnight, we saw a lot of volatility in some of the major earnings.

Fears of a looming recession and uncertainty over central bank policy have sent investors scrambling for safety.\n\nThe US stock market for one, has been experiencing a decline as the global stock selloff deepens amid concerns that the Federal Reserve is moving too late to support a slowing economy, sending investors into the safety of bonds.\n\nToday, Nasdaq 100, a US stock index futures, tumbled as much as 6.5 percent, coming close to triggering a circuit breaker, after the index entered a technical correction on Friday. S&P 500 contracts were down more than 2.5 percent.\n\nU.S. non-farm payroll data, measuring manufacturing activity for July, dropped to the lowest level in eight months, sparking recession fear and spurring investors farther away from the stock market.\n\nAt the start of the year, there were projections of two to three rate cuts by the Fed but slower-than-expected economic data has deterred such hopes until the next meeting on September 18.\n\nRead also: Nigeria stocks shed N1.32trn in rate hike week\n\nHowever, traders are raising wagers on an inter-meeting Fed interest-rate cut. Inter-meeting rate cuts are sporadic and reserved for only severe risks where officials deem they cannot wait until their next scheduled decision. The last such emergency cut from the Fed was at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSimilarly, Japan stocks have been on a bear run since Friday as a result of a plunge in some chip stocks.\n\nThe Nikkei, Japan's benchmark index, fell by 12.4 percent.

The loss of 4,451.28 points on the index was also the largest in terms of points in its entire history.\n\nThe Nikkei also erased all its gains so far this year, moving into a losing position year to date.

The Nikkei 225 closed Monday's trading session 12.4 percent lower than at the end of last week, while the pan-European Stoxx600 index lost around 2 percent.\n\nIn addition to a potential emergency Fed cut, markets now see the European Central Bank (ECB) going for a 0.5 percentage point rate cut at its next meeting in September.\n\nThe U.S. Fed is one of the only major central banks to keep its high rates unchanged, since major economies started a policy of monetary tightening in the wake of high inflation following the pandemic.\n\nIf there is no emergency cut before the Sept. 7-18 meeting, there will almost certainly be a decision to start lowering rates then -- but Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at Ballinger Group, said there is no need to take emergency action.\n\n\"Big bets on an inter-meeting rate cut are a clear signal that traders are overly spooked. It is certainly time for the Fed to cut next month, but the U.S. economy is not falling apart just yet,\" he said.\n\nWhile other central banks have begun to ease rates, they've warned there will be no speedy easing, nor a return to the near-zero rates of the post-financial crisis era.\n\nThe ECB cut rates in June, from 4 percent to 3.75 percent, but held in July, warning that there is still no firm path for easing policy further.\n\nThe Bank of England took its first interest rate cut decision last week, saying the U.K. economy has cooled enough to justify a modest relaxation of monetary policy, but warned it will be careful \"not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much.\"\n\nOverblown fears?\n\nFriday's employment report showed that the stellar performance of the U.S. economy in the last two years might be nearing its end, as the jobless rate rose to its highest in nearly three years while companies briskly reduced their pace of hiring.\n\nThe Fed decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 5.5 percent at its last meeting on July 31, despite its Chair Jerome Powell acknowledging early signs of an economic slowdown.\n\nAnd markets fear that a first interest rate cut in mid-September by the Fed could be too late to save the economy from falling into a recession.\n\n\"Global risk assets continue to correct sharply as investors fear that the Federal Reserve has left it too late to ease policy,\" ING FX strategist Chris Turner said.\n\nHowever, Szczepaniak said that current bets on the Fed's rate cut seem overblown when looking at the overall picture.\n\n\"If you look at the U.S. economy, it is still growing strongly,\" he explained. \"Second quarter GDP growth surprised to the upside, and household consumption remains healthy without signs of materially slowing down.\"\n\nThe U.S. economy was still growing at 2.8 percent in the April to June period, much faster than other advanced economies.\n\nEmergency rate cuts are seldom employed.

Investors are fleeing the Big Tech names that until recently had powered the U.S. market higher: Apple fell more than 7% and Meta was down 6% in premarket trading. Chipmaker Nvidia tumbled 12.5%.\n\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1%.\n\nStocks began losing ground on Thursday after weak reports on manufacturing and construction, which stoked fears the U.S. economy may finally be buckling under the pressure of high interest rates. Then on Friday, government data showed that hiring last month was far weaker than expected, adding to Wall Street's fears that economy's so-called \"soft landing,\" in which the U.S. economy could avoid a recession despite the highest interest rates in 23 years, could instead become a hard landing.\n\n\"The main factor that has staying power is the economy's slowdown,\" wrote Wells Fargo head of global investment strategy Paul Christopher in a Monday research note. \"Investors have been watching household financial stress build for the past two years, but during that time, job growth remained above its December 2009-December 2019 average of 180,000 new jobs per month.\"\n\nBut Friday's jobs report showed that employers added only 114,000 new jobs last month, far fewer than the 175,000 jobs expected by economists, he noted.\n\nWith the disappointing economic data, Wall Street is worried that the Federal Reserve may have kept its benchmark interest rate too high for too long, heightening the risk of a recession. The central bank kept the federal funds rate unchanged when it met on July 31 to discuss economic conditions and whether and when it should begin cutting rates.\n\nA rate cut would make it less expensive for U.S. households and companies to borrow money, but it could take time for the effects to boost the economy. On Monday, some investors called for the Fed to start cutting rates sooner rather than later to stave off an economic downturn.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve needs to start easing monetary policy more aggressively than had been anticipated, in order to head off a looming recession in the world's largest economy,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, an independent financial advisory and asset management firm, in an email. \"The Fed was behind the curve at the beginning of the cycle, it cannot afford to be behind the curve this time too.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trading day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_adviser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial adviser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asset management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/02/09/82ce199b-f852-439b-8a0e-dd97784414fd/thumbnail/1200x630/56674ad6310691f33b51dadc83a2b3fe/gettyimages-494965025.jpg?v=d7dedd293aad546f97f947149642d369", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784408", "eventUri": "eng-9784408", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2009-12-", "dateEnd": "2019-12-", "textStart": 1358, "textEnd": 1385}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1839, "textEnd": 1846}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

A slowdown in Germany last month prompted analysts to warn of a recession, while a rise in interest rates by Japan's central bank sent shares on the Nikkei index down 2,216 points, or nearly 6%, on Friday.\n\nIn the last month, the prospect of a recession in some of the world's biggest economies has sent the cost of a barrel of Brent crude falling from almost $88 to below $78.\n\nClosely watched economic data due this week in the US includes figures for the services sector on Monday and the unemployment claimant count on Thursday. Elsewhere, the UK is among several big economies, including China and Japan, to release service sector data on Monday.\n\nChris Weston, of the US online stockbroker Pepperstone, said global markets were \"at a truly important juncture\".\n\nHe added: \"What really matters now is whether money managers and traders feel sentiment has become too pessimistic, or if this deleveraging and risk aversion manifests into even higher volatility and drawdown.\n\n\"To answer this pertinent question the market needs to see the outcome of the data to offer increased confidence to price the risk of recession, and how that may feed into earnings expectations, consumer behaviours and business decisions.\"\n\nMarkets got the jitters last week after US jobs data for July showed a worse-than-expected slowdown, with 114,000 jobs created rather than the predicted 175,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate increased to a three-year high of 4.3%, while US manufacturing activity also slumped, falling to an eight-month low in July as new orders tailed off.\n\nThe figures stoked anxiety that the world's largest economy is vulnerable to a recession and may need to cut rates faster than expected to spur demand, rather than unwinding them in a more orderly fashion.\n\n\"We're witnessing the fallout from the curse of high expectations,\" said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management.\n\n\"So much had been invested around the scenario of a soft landing, that anything that even suggests something different is difficult.\"\n\nArt Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, was more relaxed about the prospect of a rout. He said: \"This isn't a Category 3 hurricane, but we are seeing how markets react to signs that the economy is normalising after turning hot in the first half of this year.\"\n\nHe added: \"Markets can find themselves overreacting and investors [latch] on to anything as an excuse to take profits.\"\n\nSo far this year, investors have grown accustomed to cooling inflation and gradually slowing employment, which appeared to be setting the scene for the Fed to begin trimming interest rates gradually.\n\nThat optimism had driven big gains in stocks: the S&P 500 is up by 12% this year, despite recent losses, while the tech-focused Nasdaq has gained nearly 12%.\n\nBut on Friday, the Nasdaq lost 2.4% to finish in correction territory - 10% off its record high, while Japanese equities recorded their worst day since the Covid-19 pandemic, with the Nikkei 225 index down 5.8%.\n\nIn London, the FTSE100 blue-chip share index lost more than 120 points at one stage, down by 1.5%.\n\nEurope's main stock indices also declined on Friday, with European technology stocks falling to their lowest level in more than six months. France's CAC 40 hit its lowest level since last November, down more than 1%, while Germany's DAX lost 2%.\n\nIn the US, Uber, Airbnb, Hilton International and Coca-Cola are among the big firms posting financial results this week. European bellwether stocks such as the Italian insurer Generali and Deutsche Telekom, will also report this week.\n\nWhile shares slid, gold hit a new record on Friday as investors flocked to safe-haven assets. The US dollar weakened, lifting the pound by 0.5% to $1.28, and the euro by 1.2% to $1.092.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

volatility': Fears US economy headed towards recession", "body": "Analysts say further economic and financial markets weakness could put pressure on central banks to ease monetary policy.\n\nThere are genuine concerns the world's largest economy is heading toward a recession, and the fear is gripping global financial markets.\n\nThursday night's official US jobless claims figures showed a surprising number of Americans out of work.\n\nSeparate figures showing a weak manufacturing sector added to worries about the US economy.\n\nThe news sent global financial markets into a tailspin Friday, on fears the US economy was on track for what is known as a hard landing.\n\nIt followed weeks and months of an incredible run-up in stock prices in the US and in Australia.\n\n\"Shares went sky high into July on the back of better news on inflation, increasing optimism about lower interest rates ahead and optimism about IT and AI-related earnings,\" AMP's head of investment strategy Shane Oliver said.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve announced late this week it was leaving official interest rates unchanged at between 5.25 per cent and 5.5 per cent.\n\nAt the time it was seen as \"good news\", given chairman Jerome Powell's qualified commitment to lowering interest rates in September.\n\nHowever, investors later questioned whether this was a policy mistake given the weaker-than-expected economic data, suggesting the Federal Reserve chair should have already cut interest rates.\n\nThe problem is that, like Australia, the Federal Reserve is reluctant to cut interest rates until it sees further evidence inflation is cooling.\n\nThe fear at the heart of this share market plunge is that the US central bank has lifted interest rates too high for too long.\n\n\"The [benchmark] ASX 200 surged above 8,100 index points mid-week, helped by lower-than-feared inflation and a boost from rising Fed easing [interest] prospects,\" Dr Oliver said.\n\n\"But the gains were reversed [on Friday] as global growth worries left the market up just 0.3 per cent or so for the week, with falls in financial, health and material stocks mostly offsetting the gains in all the other sectors.\"\n\nBond yields fell sharply, reflecting expectations for lower interest rates along with safe haven demand.\n\nThe yield on the US 10 Year Treasury bond, for example, had dived to 3.79 per cent by early Saturday morning, Australian eastern time.\n\nIt had been trading at 4.2 per cent earlier in the week.\n\nShare investors often flee to the relative safety of bonds when the share market wobbles, which increases the prices of bonds and lowers the interest rate on them.\n\nOvernight US share markets were again overwhelmed by selling activity.\n\nAnd, again, it was weaker economic news that had investors more bearish.\n\nUS payroll data showed the unemployment rate climbing to 4.3 per cent -- the highest rate since 2021.\n\nNon-farm payrolls grew by just 114,000 last month, the Labor Department reported, a slowing from 179,000 jobs added in June and below the 185,000 expected by economists polled by Dow Jones.\n\nIt is further evidence the US economy may be in trouble.\n\nUS stocks fell heavily on the assumption demand in the economy is set to dive.\n\nThe broad market index dropped 1.84 per cent to end at 5,346.56.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite (which houses the big technology stocks) lost 2.43 per cent to close at 16,776.16, bringing the decline for the tech-heavy index from its recent all-time high to more than 10 per cent.\n\nIt means the Nasdaq has entered a \"technical correction\".\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 610.71 points, or 1.51 per cent, to finish at 39,737.26.\n\nAt its session low, the 30-stock index was down 989 points.\n\n\"Our view remains that lower interest rates will boost shares on a six to 12 month, view assuming recession is avoided,\" Dr Oliver said.\n\n\"However, in the next few months global and Australian shares look vulnerable to further falls, suggesting that it's too early to buy the dip just yet as: valuations are stretched; investment sentiment looks somewhat optimistic; recession risk is high; there has been a heavy reliance on tech shares to keep the key US share market going.\n\n\"And geopolitical risk is high particularly around the US election but also around the Middle East, with increasing risks of escalation in the Israel war to include Hezbollah and Iran with risks to oil supplies.\"\n\nMarcus Today market analyst Henry Jennings said, fundamentally, global investors had been spooked by the prospect of a US recession.\n\n\"US 10-year yields (interest rates) have fallen below 4 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\"Earnings (or company profit announcements in the US) have failed to deliver in places and the bullishness has been replaced very quickly with negative volatility.\n\n\"Japan is under serious pressure, also denting sentiment in the region, with some spillover expected.\"\n\n\"We are being tossed around on a sea of volatility and new worries,\" he added.\n\nThose new worries though could bring about lower interest rates sooner than expected both in the United States and in Australia.\n\nJamieson Coote Bonds co-founder Angus Coote said sustained share market selling pressure and its impact on the economy would give the Reserve Bank pause for thought.\n\n\"I think the earliest [RBA interest rate cut] is November,\" he said.\n\n\"I would say it would have to be relatively extreme on share markets for the RBA to consider cutting rates before November but it's not impossible by any means.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This sell-off wiped out the Nikkei 225's gains for the year.\n\nThe global market turmoil was triggered by the release of a highly anticipated report on Friday that said the U.S. economy added 114,000 jobs last month, far fewer than expected. The jobless rate also climbed to its highest level since October 2021.\n\nInvestors took these as signs of a weakening U.S. economy, leading to a widespread sell-off in global markets.\n\nOther Asia-Pacific markets also tumbled -- including in South Korea, Taiwan and Australia -- mirroring the sharp drop seen on Wall Street.\n\nEuropean markets also saw declines, but to a less dramatic extent than in Asia.\n\nAlong with the U.S. jobs data, another contributing factor was the Bank of Japan raising its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, after which share prices in Tokyo began to fall.\n\nThe activities in Japan's stock market are significant because global investors view the Japanese market as indicative of global trade.\n\nYoshimasa Hayashi, a spokesperson for the Japanese government, said it \"will continue to stay on its toes and monitor market developments with keen interest,\" Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"We're aware there are various evaluations regarding the stocks plunge this time around, and about the status of the Japanese economy, but the government will continue its efforts to completely break free of deflation and to transition to a growth-driven economy,\" he continued.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists have raised their forecast for the likelihood of a U.S. recession in the next year to 25 percent, up from their previous estimate of 15 percent, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThey added in a report to clients on Sunday that they still viewed the recession risk as \"limited.\"\n\nThey added that the Federal Reserve has a lot of room to cut interest rates and can do so quickly if needed.\n\nSome economists have criticized the Federal Reserve for being too slow to cut interest rates.\n\nOn Wednesday, the central bank acknowledged signs of a slowing economy but decided not to cut interest rates at this time. It has kept them between 5.25 percent and 5.5 percent since July 2023. However, officials hinted at a potential rate cut in September.\n\nThe Federal Reserve declined to comment in an emailed response to Newsweek.\n\nGlobal fears have been growing because of concerns that include ongoing tensions in the Middle East and several weak earnings reports from major technology firms last week amid increasing investor doubts about the returns from AI investments.",

The rest is mechanical trading decisions based on risk.\"\n\n\"The turmoil will give the long-term investor some excellent opportunities which we will write about this week,\" they added.\n\nConcerns that a U.S. recession, tied to a Fed policy error that left rates too high for too long, is also hammering global oil prices, with Brent crude contracts falling to the lowest levels since late Spring.\n\nRelated: Jobs report triggers key recession warning signal as stocks plunge\n\nWTI futures for September delivery, the U.S. pricing benchmark that it tightly-linked to domestic gasoline prices, were marked $1.31 lower at $72.21 per barrel.\n\nThe Fed left its benchmark lending rate unchanged at between 5.25% and 5.5% last week, and wouldn't commit to a September rate cut, just days before a weaker-than-expected reading for July manufacturing activity and softer jobs market data that included the highest unemployment rate in four years.\n\nMarkets were also on edge amid the rising military tensions in the Middle East, where U.S. officials are urging Americans to leave Lebanon and Israel is bracing for a possible retaliatory attack from Iran and Hezbollah following the killing of a senior Hamas leader last week in Tehran.\n\nOn Wall Street, tech stocks look set to take the brunt of the expected selloff, with futures contracts tied to the Nasdaq suggesting a 770 point plunge at the start of trading.\n\nFutures tied to the S&P 500, meanwhile, are priced for a 140 point decline while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is called 690 points lower to kick off the week.\n\nRelated: After the Fed tipped markets over, now what?\n\nApple (AAPL) shares were a notable premarket decliner, falling 8.44% to $201.30 following news over the weekend that billionaire

Futures slump on recession concerns\n\nU.S. stock futures fell sharply Monday, with the tech sector hit hard as a soft nonfarm payrolls report ramped up concerns that the U.S. economy was heading towards recession.\n\nBy 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 590 points, or 1.5%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 106 points, or 2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 595 points, or 3.2%.\n\nThe Wall Street indices suffered a brutal week last week, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite recording a third straight losing week and is now down more than 10% from a record set last month, in correction territory.\n\nThe S&P 500 also posted a third straight losing week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been outperforming, snapped a four-week win streak, falling 2%.\n\nThis selling is set to continue this week as investors fretted that a worryingly weak July payrolls report indicated that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at elevated levels for too long, dragging the world's largest economy into recession.\n\n\"We have increased our 12-month recession odds by 10pp to 25%,\" said analysts at Goldman Sachs in a note, though they thought the danger was limited by the sheer scope the Fed had to ease policy.\n\nMarkets now price in a 78% chance the Federal Reserve will not only cut rates in September, but ease by a full 50 basis points.\n\nThe likely selloff on Wall Street Monday has already been reflected in sharp losses in Europe, with the pan-European benchmark Stoxx 600 index falling over 2% at the open.\n\nHowever, this weakness is nothing when compared with the 13% drop seen in the Nikkei 225 index in Japan earlier in the session, its worst day since the \"Black Monday\" of 1987.\n\nThe index has now fallen more than 20% from the all-time high on July 11, entering bear market territory, and has erased all its gains so far this year.\n\nUBS's Kelvin Tay warned investors about using these hefty losses to return to the Japanese market, sayings on CNBC that going into the Japanese market at this moment is akin to catching \"a falling knife.\"\n\n\"The only reason why the Japanese market is up so strongly in the last two years is because the Japanese yen has been very, very weak. Once it reverses, you've got to get out right,\" Tay said.\n\nThe yen has strengthened sharply since the Bank of Japan raised interest rates, helped before that by government intervention, after falling to a 38-year low against the U.S. dollar in June.\n\nA stronger yen pressurizes Japanese stock markets as it erodes the competitiveness of the important export-oriented firms.\n\n3. Bitcoin drops to five-month low\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD), the world's biggest cryptocurrency, slumped Monday, falling to a more than five-month low as growing fears of a U.S. economic slowdown battered risk appetite.\n\nAt 04:15 ET, Bitcoin fell 12% to $53,008, dropping to its weakest level since late-February, largely wiping out a rally sparked by the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in March.\n\nBitcoin - along with broader crypto markets - have been tracking steep losses in equity markets since Friday, as a swathe of weak economic readings from the U.S. pushed up concerns over a potential recession.\n\nLed by the drop in bitcoin as well as ether, the second most popular digital currency, Coinglass revealed over $800 million has been liquidated from the crypto space in the last 24 hours.\n\nUncertainty over the outlook for U.S. regulation has also weighed on crypto markets, especially as recent polling data saw Democratic frontrunner Kamala Harris catching up with Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n4. Mars casts its eye over Kellanova - Reuters\n\nPrivate packaged food giant Mars is considering a potential acquisition of smaller rival Kellanova (NYSE:K), according to a report from Reuters, released on Sunday.\n\nSuch a deal could be one of the biggest in the food industry, given Kellanova has a market capitalization of about $27 billion, although such a move, if it was to occur, would likely attract antitrust scrutiny given that both firms control several major brands in the packaged foods sector.\n\nKellanova was spun off from WK Kellogg (NYSE:K) last October, and although its shares are up over 12% so far this year they are still seen trading at a discount to peers such as Hershey (NYSE:HSY) and Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ).\n\nMars is one of the biggest privately-owned companies in the world, and is controlled by the Mars family.\n\n5. Crude slumps on US slowdown fears\n\nCrude prices fell Monday, trading around eighth-month lows, on mounting concerns of an economic slowdown in the U.S., the world's largest oil consumer.\n\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 1% to $72.81 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.8% to $76.22 a barrel.\n\nWeak U.S. economic data last week has hit sentiment in the oil markets as the prospect of a recession in the world's largest economy bodes poorly for future demand, even as recent inventory data showed that increased travel demand during the summer season had kept fuel consumption high.\n\nThis has added to disappointing growth numbers from top oil importer China and surveys showing weaker manufacturing activity across Asia and Europe, raising concerns of the future oil consumption.\n\nBoth benchmarks tumbled more than 3% last week to settle at their lowest since January on Friday. Last week, both contracts marked their fourth straight week of losses, their biggest losing streaks since November.\n\nThe crude markets have largely looked past heightened tensions in the Middle East, with Israel and the United States expecting a serious escalation in the region after Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah pledged to retaliate against Israel for the recent killings of a couple of militant leaders.\n\nAlso of interest is the incoming Tropical Storm Debby, which is expected to strengthen rapidly into a hurricane before making landfall in Florida's Gulf Coast later in the session, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Sunday.\n\nOil major Chevron (NYSE:CVX) said on Sunday that it had removed non-essential personnel from its facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, but production had yet to be impacted.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The frenzy also activated circuit breakers in South Korea, where the main market finished nearly 9% lower.\n\nIn Taiwan, stocks plunged more than 8% - the worst single-day percentage drop in the island's history. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - the world's largest chipmaker - fell nearly 10%.\n\nEuropean markets also declined sharply at the start of trading. U.S. stock futures also fell, an indication that the volatility will continue in U.S. markets on Monday.\n\nThe sell-off was a continuation from Friday, when the United States posted a worse than expected jobs report. Some investors are also concerned that the U.S. Federal Reserve may have acted too slowly in lowering interest rates that have been elevated in an attempt to reduce inflation.\n\nAnother worry is geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, after last week's assassination of Ismail Haniyeah, Hamas' top political leader in Tehran. Iran, which has blamed Israel for the attack, has vowed retaliation, raising fears of a regional war.\n\nThe crash has been most severe in Japan, which analysts said was experiencing a market correction after many investors relied on a historically cheap yen and rock-bottom interest rates to fund risky investments. That strategy was exposed after Japan last week raised benchmark interest rates for only the second time in 17 years and hinted that such rate hikes may continue.\n\n\"I don't think it's a civilization-altering crash,\" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Research. \"It's just to me a simple case of market participants getting way ahead and, I guess you can argue, greedy, in over-leveraging, thinking that cheap and free money in Japan was going to be here to stay. And that has gone badly wrong, and they are having to very quickly unwind it and it's having knock-on effects into asset markets.\"\n\nIn an interview with VOA, Goh downplayed concerns about a U.S. recession.\n\n\"I think it's a little bit unfair to blame the (U.S.) Fed for being late or behind the curve, because until recently a lot of people were thinking that the U.S. economy was still in reasonably good shape. And no one was really ringing the recession alarm bells,\" he said.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Federal Reserve chose to hold interest rates steady, even while leaving the door open for a rate cut next month.\n\nTwo years ago, the Fed started increasing borrowing costs to curb inflation, which had caused prices to soar for essentials like rent and food. Since then, it has aimed for a 'soft landing,' seeking to control inflation without causing an economic recession.\n\nIn an analytical note, economists at Goldman Sachs increased the probability of a U.S. recession within the next 12 months from 15% to 25%, although they acknowledged that the risk remains limited given the tools available to the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\n\"The Fed has significant firepower, and can cut rates quite aggressively to support growth if needed,\" added a commentary published Monday by BMI - A Fitch Solutions Company.\n\nHowever, while global markets have been more volatile than expected, they had recently rallied sharply and were vulnerable to a sell-off, according to BMI.\n\n\"Corrections of 5-10% are fairly common during bull markets and typically, there is a seasonal pick up in equity volatility during the July-October period,\" it added.", "source": {"uri": "cardiffstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cardiff Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Bitcoin shed more than 17% of its value while ethereum was down more than 21%.\n\nThe global digital currency market lost a total of $1.79 trillion from its market capitalization over the course of the last 24 hours.\n\nThe most recent jobs report from last week, which showed hiring crawl to a slower-than-expected pace, had Wall Street fearful of the prospects of a recession.\n\nAnalysts at investment banking giant Goldman Sachs on Sunday raised the odds of a recession next year from 15% to 25%, though they cautioned that such a risk was \"limited.\"\n\nThe weak jobs report and the global stock selloff has also fueled analyst expectations that the Federal Reserve will step in and institute emergency interest rate cuts in hopes of re-energizing the economy.\n\nA recession would upset the Fed's plan to slowly introduce rate cuts as part of a \"soft landing.\" But the latest data has led some critics to pounce on the central bank for not acting fast enough to slash rates when signs of cooling inflation were apparent.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve has been late in cutting rates, but that has been true for some time,\" Paul Donovan, a UBS economist, wrote in a client note Monday morning cited by The New York Times.\n\n\"The policy error is making things worse for lower income households.\"\n\nPrior to Monday, the markets priced in a 78% chance the Fed will not only cut rates in September, but ease by a full 50 basis points.\n\nFutures imply 122 basis points of cuts in the 5.25-5.5% funds rate this year, and rates of around 3.0% by the end of 2025.\n\nDespite the tanking

Stocks could be poised for a correction after riding high, though the chance that the Federal Reserve soon cuts interest rates may ultimately be a cushion for sentiment.\n\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 790 points, or 2%, after the index retreated 610 points on Friday to finish at 39,737. S&P 500 futures fell 2.9% with contracts tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq down 4.4%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note held around 3.75%.\n\nMonday ushered in mayhem across global markets, with Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plunging a staggering 12.4% and the yen strengthening as much as 3% against the dollar, a stomach-churning move for a foreign currency. Investors around the world were reacting to the latest U.S. jobs report, with far lower than expected nonfarm payrolls figures suggesting weakness in the labor market that could signal recession.\n\n\"Markets were on edge before Friday but a weak payrolls has really escalated a profound move across the globe,\" said Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank. \"We are seeing some astonishing moves.\"\n\nFriday's weak data flashed a warning signal called the Sahm Rule, which says the economy is in a recession when the three month-moving average of the unemployment rate is at least half a percentage point higher than the lowest three-month moving average of the rate from the prior 12 months.\n\nBut the jobs report wasn't the first sign of trouble in markets. Last week saw a trickle of data covering manufacturing and housing that indicated economic gloom, and tech was already weakening in what initially looked like a rotation, not the harbinger of a wider selloff. The latest jobs data look like the catalyst that has triggered a selloff that was already in the making, and which may be exacerbated by technical factors.\n\n\"Futures are plunging globally on snowballing concerns about economic growth following Friday's soft jobs report,\" said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report research. \"Global growth concerns are the main reason behind the stock weakness but technical factors are majorly at play.\"\n\nIndeed, some of the moves seen across markets are so outsize that they suggest selling that transcends fundamentals. It is likely that leverage, or trades made with borrowed money, is a contributing factor, as are crowded trades -- two examples being pessimism on the Japanese yen and optimism on tech stocks, both of which are seeing wild action on Monday.\n\nNevertheless, the gloomy economic backdrop is seeing investors rapidly price in action from the Fed, including a half-percentage-point interest-rate cut in September, double the typical quarter-point move in rates. Rate cuts should be supportive of stocks, and continued confidence that the Fed could cut rates may cushion sentiment.\n\n\"Apart from nearly fully pricing in a double rate cut in September, investors are now seeing around 127 basis points worth of easing by December,\" said Charalampos Pissouros, an analyst at broker XM. \"Market participants are now concerned that the Fed may have already waited too long to start easing monetary policy.\"", "source": {"uri": "barrons.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Barrons"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-53429775/social", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784408", "eventUri": "eng-9784408", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Stock markets from Asia to Europe took a beating and bond yields slid as investors rushed to safe-haven assets and investors bet the US Federal Reserve would need to cut interest rates quickly to spur growth. All megacap and growth stocks, the main drivers for the indexes hitting record highs earlier this year, fell sharply in premarket trading. Apple Inc slumped 7.3pc after Berkshire Hathaway slashed its stake in the iPhone maker by almost 50%, suggesting that the billionaire investor is growing wary about the broader US economy or stock market valuations that have gotten too high. Chip maker Nvidia fell 6.8pc after reports of a delay in the launch of its upcoming artificial-intelligence chips due to design flaws. It has been a darling of the stock market for most of this year, with its shares hitting a record in June.\n\nIn Ireland AIB and Bank of Ireland saw some of the biggest price falls early on Monday, as happened on Friday before the scale of drops eased back later in the morning. Housebuilder Cairn Homes, construction materials maker Kingspan and hotel group Dalata were also among names seeing the biggest falls but almost every company in the Iseq 20 index of leading Irish shares was down, with Kerry Group a rare exception as it had been on Friday.\n\nBanks globally are under pressure after weak US jobs data sparked speculation the US Fed may reduce rates faster potentially even making a chunky half-of-on-percent cut to its benchmark interest rates at its September meeting, which would hit the profitability of US banks and drag down global banking valuations.\n\nBig Wall Street brokerages also revised their Fed rate projections for 2024 to show greater policy easing by the central bank. \"I am reluctant to believe the Fed would start the easing process with a 50 bps cut, but if the next seven weeks of data are consistent with this week's, the Fed should be aggressive,\" said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard.", "source":

As interest rate \"carry trades\" funded by cheap yen borrowing were a lucrative bet among speculative funds for the past two years, the sudden yen surge - which hit its best levels of a year on Monday - and the related volatility spike have sent a shockwave through this and other \"risk\" trades.\n\nThe anxiety spilled out across world markets again on Monday - with South Korea and Taiwan both down 8% and European benchmarks down more 2%.\n\nAnd it's going to be a rough open on Wall St.\n\nWith the Nasdaq now already in correction territory after last week's swoon, futures are pointing to further losses of about 4% on Monday and S&P500 futures are down 2.5% ahead of the bell.\n\nThe VIX \"fear index\" of U.S. equity volatility soared - topping 40 for the first time since the 2020 pandemic lockdowns. A reflection of a reversal of risky bets, Bitcoin plunged 15% from Friday's levels, the Swiss franc surged to its best level of the year - but gold fell, curiously.\n\nU.S. stocks' eye-watering retreat last week came in the thick of a noisy and somewhat disappointing Big Tech earnings season, with fears about an overspend in artificial intelligence and the lack of an end result yet gnawing at investors.\n\nBut the return of U.S. recession worries to a market overwhelmingly priced for a \"soft landing\" of the economy was the biggest game changer - following a series of weak manufacturing and labor market updates.\n\nIf past precedents on the pace at which the U.S. jobless rate is rising are applicable - and many think persistent post-pandemic labor market distortions mean they are not - then a triggering of the so-called \"Sahm rule\" recession flag on Friday was a moment.\n\nEven though the rule's author, former Federal Reserve economist Claudia Sahm, played down the warning this time around, the calculus of a half-point rise in the three-month average jobless rate above the low of the past year stands as a warning nonetheless.\n\nSo much so, interest rate markets have scrambled.\n\nFed futures markets now see a half-point cut in Fed rates as soon as next month and as much as 125 basis points of cuts by yearend.\n\nJPMorgan Now expects the Fed to cut rates by 50 bps at both September and November meetings, followed by 25-bps cuts at every meeting thereafter.\n\nWith U.S. 3-, 10- and 30-year auctions this week, Treasury yields and the dollar have plummeted. Ten-year U.S. yields fell below 3.7% for the first time in more than a year, and have tumbled about 50bps this month already.\n\nTwo-year yields fell as low as 3.69% and the two-to-10-yield curve steepened to within a whisker of positive territory for the first time in over two years - seen by some as a warning sign of recession ahead after two years of inversion.\n\nRiffing over pumped-up Fed easing talk, the dollar index touched its lowest since March.\n\nCritical now will be readings from the U.S. service sector later today, a reality check from Fed speakers and also the release of the Fed's quarterly senior loan officer survey.\n\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:\n\n* U.S. July service sector surveys from ISM and S&P Global. Fed's quarterly senior loan officer survey\n\n* San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly speaks\n\n* U.S. corporate earnings: Tyson Foods, CSX, ONEOK, Diamondback Energy, Realty Income, Simon

As a result, major indices - and shares in key tech companies - fell.\n\nThe sell-off was exacerbated by a disappointing US jobs report, which revealed a sharp slowdown in job growth and a rise in unemployment.\n\nThe STOXX Europe 600 index suffered a 3.6% decline to its lowest point since January, dragged down by a broader market sell-off and the fallout from Intel's disappointing earnings report.\n\nThe chipmaker announced a dividend suspension and massive job cuts last week, as part of a broader strategy to cut costs by $10 billion by 2025 to reverse its declining fortunes.\n\nShares plunged 20% in pre-market trading, triggering a domino effect on European chipmakers.\n\nThe Netherlands, a European hub for semiconductor manufacturing, bore the brunt of the tech sell-off. Shares in ASML were down 9.6%, while rival ASM International saw an even steeper decline of 13.7%.\n\nThese companies are highly sensitive to economic conditions, as demand for their products is closely tied to the overall health of the semiconductor industry.\n\nThere were also significant market declines in France and Germany, with France's CAC 40 index and Germany's DAX down by more than 1% and 2%, respectively.\n\n\"The past 24 hours have seen an increasingly precarious backdrop for risk markets, with a risk-off mood on the back of another batch of weak US data yesterday followed by mostly downbeat tech earnings overnight,\" said Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.\n\nShares also fell at Nvidia, following reports of a US Department of Justice investigation into potential antitrust violations, and Amazon, which missed sales forecasts.\n\n\"Market moves can get exacerbated during summer weeks when you get thinner liquidity and trading, especially in August and that can add to the magnitude of moves,\" Karim Chedid, Blackrock's chief investment strategist for iShares EMEA, told Reuters.\n\nUS economy appears to falter\n\nFriday's sell-off came after a challenging trading day on Wall Street on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.2%, nearly 500 points. The downturn was prompted by data showing that US manufacturing activity fell to an eight-month low in July due to a decline in new orders. Data also showed a surge in new unemployment benefit applications, to an 11-month high.\n\nThe US dollar weakened in response to the market turmoil, boosting the pound and euro.\n\nThe weak US economic data has also intensified speculation about a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Financial markets now anticipate a rate reduction in September, with a half-point cut seen as a strong possibility.\n\nRuss Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, said: \"An economy going through a bad patch is one catalyst for a central bank to cut rates and hopefully stimulate activity.\n\n\"This thought process is likely to be at the top of the agenda for the Fed this week after shocking US economic data that featured bigger than expected jobless claims and contraction in manufacturing. The narrative has changed from rate cuts equating to good news to rate cuts meaning measures to avoid recession.\"\n\nLast month, Tesla saw its stock price plummet after reporting a steep decline in quarterly profits.\n\nThe company's net income dropped by 45% to $1.47 billion, falling short of Wall Street expectations.\n\nAlphabet stocks also dropped after the company warned, in an earnings call, of limited Q3 revenue growth due to increased capital spending and a lack of profit from AI investments.", "source": {"uri": "computing.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Computing"},

That's almost double the previous 52-week high, and its highest intraday level since March 2020, when global stock markets crashed on fears of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nKnown as the \"fear index\" or \"fear gauge,\" the VIX reflects investors' anxieties about market downturns. It's calculated using the weighted prices of put and call options in the S&P 500 index for the next 30 days.\n\nGlobal stock markets were in the grips of a quickly intensifying rout on Monday. It started with Japan's Nikkei 225 plunging 12% -- its worst day since the 1987 Black Monday crash. In the U.S., Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell more than 1,000 points, or 2.7%; S&P 500 futures dipped 3.6%; and Nasdaq-100 futures dropped 4.8%.\n\nThe culprit? Friday's weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report, that saw employers add just 114,000 jobs in July. This fell far short of the 175,000 gain economists had projected, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. At the same time, unemployment ticked up to 4.3%, it's highest level in three years.\n\nThat data pointed to a slowing U.S. economy, and renewed concerns about a potential hard landing as opposed to a soft landing, when the central bank brings down inflation without tipping the economy into a recession.\n\nIt also raised concerns among investors about whether the Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates, which have sat at a 23-year high of between 5.25% and 5.5% for the past year. A September rate cut seems all but certain, given that inflation has continued to move towards the Fed's 2% target in recent readings.\n\nHowever, Monday's rout could force central banks around the world into earlier rate cuts, with some traders at one point pricing in a 60% chance that the Fed carries out an emergency rate cut before September.", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "VIX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_option", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Call option"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/10aa9b97868411329358366bd4e07846.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784408", "eventUri": "eng-9784408", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 82, "textEnd": 92, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

The broader Japanese Topix fell 6.1%, Australia's ASX fell 2.5% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 2.1%.\n\nEurope's main stock indices all declined on Friday morning, with European technology stocks falling to their lowest level in more than six months.\n\nThe Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML's shares fell 6%, while the rival ASM International dropped 10%.\n\n\"The past 24 hours have seen an increasingly precarious backdrop for risk markets, with a risk-off mood on the back of another batch of weak US data yesterday followed by mostly downbeat tech earnings overnight,\" said Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.\n\nIn London, the FTSE 100 blue-chip share index lost 50 points, or 0.6%, to 8,233, in early trading.\n\nFriday's sell-off followed a rough day's trading on Wall Street on Thursday, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.2%, or almost 500 points. This was triggered by data showing US manufacturing activity dropped to an eight-month low in July amid a slump in new orders, and a jump in the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits to an 11-month high.\n\nInvestors fear that the US economy could be weaker than central bankers at the Federal Reserve realised. On Wednesday the Fed left US interest rates on hold but hinted that a rate cut was close.\n\nFinancial markets are now pricing in a 100% chance that the Fed will cut rates in September. A quarter-point cut is likely but market pricing suggests a near 30% chance of a larger rate cut of 0.5 percentage points.\n\nNew York traders were bracing for further losses on Friday, with the Dow down another 0.9% in the futures market and the tech-focused Nasdaq on course for a 2% drop.\n\nIntel's shares were down more than 21% in premarket trading, after it announced plans to cut more than 15,000 jobs globally as it tries to \"resize and refocus\" its business. Amazon shares were down 8.7% after missing sales forecasts and disappointing analysts with its latest outlook.\n\nShares in the chipmaker Nvidia fell 4% in premarket trading, after a report that the US Department of Justice had launched an investigation into complaints from competitors that it may have abused its market dominance in selling chips that power artificial intelligence.\n\nRuss Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, an investment platform, said rising economic pessimism meant August has got off to a bad start for global stock markets.\n\n\"An economy going through a bad patch is one catalyst for a central bank to cut rates and hopefully stimulate activity. This thought process is likely to be at the top of the agenda for the Fed this week after shocking US economic data that featured bigger than expected jobless claims and contraction in manufacturing. The narrative has changed from rate cuts equating to good news to rate cuts meaning measures to avoid recession,\" Mould said.\n\nWhile shares slid, gold hit a fresh record on Friday as investors flocked to safe-haven assets. Gold futures gained $25.70 (\u00a320.17), or 1%, to $2,506.40 an ounce.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The end result was the Nasdaq beginning a \"correction.\"\n\nThe broad market index dropped 1.84% to end at 5,346.56. The Nasdaq Composite lost 2.43% to close at 16,776.16, bringing the decline for the tech-heavy index from its recent all-time high to more than 10%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 610.71 points, or 1.51%, to finish at 39,737.26. At its session low, the 30-stock index was down 989 points.\n\nThe Nasdaq is the first of the three major benchmarks to enter correction territory, down more than 10% from its record high. The S&P 500 and Dow were 5.7% and 3.9% below their all-time highs, respectively.\n\nFriday's declines are a \"natural course\" in a bull market that is reverting after its steep uptrend, LPL Financial chief technical strategist Adam Turnquist said.\n\n''[The Nasdaq] was very overbought coming into July, same thing with semiconductors. And a lot of that AI enthusiasm hasn't really had a reality check at this stage,\" he said, adding that \"it's not the end of the AI story.\"\n\nBut it was more than just technology stocks that saw selling on Friday. Bank stocks were slammed on the recession fears with Bank of America off 4.9% and Wells Fargo down 6.4%.\n\nRecession is definitely the looming boogeyman in the room, and the news that the Sahm Rule indicators were being triggered definitely upset the markets. And there were more heartburn moments to come. Governments around the world are currently telling their citizens to get out of Lebanon immediately, before an actual war breaks out between Hezbollah and Israel. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is apparently expecting Iran to do something - whether it be use Hezbollah to attack Israel, or attacking Israel directly - soon. The markets HATE war, because what the markets love is predictability. War is not predictable.\n\nAnd while the actions of one man should never be a huge market indicator, it raised many eyebrows when Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold off almost 50% of their stock in Apple during the second quarter of the year, according to their earnings report that was released on Saturday. The markets also hate it when large companies with lots of money decide to sell off well-known stock.\n\nSo it shouldn't be a surprise when the markets start to react badly in a collective domino effect. The question then becomes, just how badly will they react? So far... it's not looking good.\n\n\"Black Monday\" was trending on X, and with good reason. Japan has officially entered \"bear market\" status.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8% on Friday and it is headed for its worst two-day decline ever. Its worst single-day rout was a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9%, on a day dubbed \"Black Monday\" in October 1987. Share prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei is now down 4.3% from a year ago.\n\nLed by a drop of 11% in bitcoin in the past 24 hours and a 21% plunge in ether, the overall value of cryptocurrencies sank by about $270 billion, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThe selloff in the crypto market coincided with a broader slide in equities in Asia-Pacific markets. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped as much as 7%, extending losses that began last week, after the Bank of Japan announced it would hike its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 16 years.\n\nIn the U.S. the Nasdaq slid 3.4% last week into correction territory, capping off the tech-heavy index's worst three-week stretch since September 2022, when the market was in freefall. Amazon and Nvidia contributed to the declines.\n\nIn short, there is a whole lot of risk in the world right now, and the markets are reacting poorly. Which means that no one should look at their 401k status anytime soon. At the time this post is being written, Wall Street has not yet opened for business. But all indications indicate that things could get very ugly, very quickly.\n\nU.S. stock futures fell Sunday night following a volatile week for Wall Street, in which the Nasdaq Composite dropped into correction territory.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 383 points, or 0.96%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 1.6% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\nWall Street is coming off a brutal week for the major averages. On Friday, the Nasdaq capped a third straight week of losses, bringing the tech-heavy index down more than 10% from a record set last month.\n\nThe S&P 500 also posted a third straight losing week, down 2% for the week. Even the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been outperforming, snapped a four-week win streak, falling 2%.\n\nIn Asia overnight, Japan stocks confirmed a bear market on Monday as Asia-Pacific markets continued the sell-off from last week, with the Nikkei 225 and Topix dropping over 12%. The benchmark indexes have fallen more than 20% from their all-time highs on July 11.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields tumbled as well. The benchmark 10-year note on Friday yielded 3.79%, down from where it was one week previously at 4.20%.\n\nThe stock market isn't the be-all, end-all of economic health, but it is a huge indicator of what the markets are predicting and what they are concerned about. And yes, a market correction will have a political impact. The 2008 \"housing bubble\" and subprime mortgage collapse definitely had an impact on the presidential election that year. Are we headed into the same situation? I desperately hope not, because the American public is still struggling with inflation and debt and high interest rates. But if something DOES happen, the blame will be laid at the feet of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The Harris campaign already tried to pin blame on Donald Trump for Friday's jobs report. Biden and Harris have been in the White House too long for that to stick. Kamala may try to dodge responsibility the way she is currently dodging media interviews, but she owns this, too. If you attempt to take the credit, you also assume the blame. Kamala Harris has cast more tie-breaking votes than any other vice president due to the tight numbers in the Senate. That means she owns her own vote on things like the \"Inflation Reduction Act.\" Will the media push for answers from Kamala Harris if there is a market correction that causes stocks to drop?\n\nA word of advice for Donald Trump - if the media approaches you with questions about the stock market, or the economy, your response should be this: \"Have you asked the vice president this question yet? After all, she is currently part of the current administration in charge of making decisions.\" And then stop. We all know Donald Trump loves going toe-to-toe with the media. He should embarrass them every chance he gets because they are too chicken to demand answers from Kamala Harris. And if the markets crash and we eventually do go into a recession, Kamala Harris will need to have some good explanations.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

New York stock exchanges saw significant declines, erasing the year's gains.\n\nThis ignited fears of a potential recession in the United States. The Nasdaq plummeted by more than 3% within the first two hours of trading. It entered correction territory with a drop of over 10% from its peak.\n\nThe S&P 500 recorded its worst daily decline since 2022. It now trades 6% below its historic high.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average also hit its lowest level in over a year. The catalyst for this market upheaval was the release of the official U.S. jobs report.\n\nThe U.S. economy added only 114,000 jobs in July. This was significantly below the consensus estimate of 180,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate increased from 4.1% in June to 4.3% in July. New orders for manufactured goods in the U.S. fell by 3.3% in June.\n\nThe Purchasing Managers' Index for the manufacturing sector dropped from 48.5 in June to 46.8 in July.\n\nThese weak economic indicators led to a reassessment of the U.S. economic outlook. Markets are now pricing in a higher likelihood of a recession.\n\nThe VIX, Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" surged by 48%. This reflected heightened risk aversion among investors.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 31, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged. However, it hinted at a potential rate cut in September.\n\nThe disappointing jobs data led many investors to believe that the Fed should have acted sooner. The FedWatch tool now shows a 100% probability of a rate cut in September.\n\nWall Street in Turmoil as Recession Fears Mount\n\nThe sell-off extended to global markets. Japan's Nikkei 225 index had its worst day since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEuropean indices saw similar declines, with tech shares hitting their lowest levels in over six months.\n\nThe recent economic data has shifted market sentiment dramatically. This led to a broad sell-off in equities and increasing fears of a recession.\n\nInvestors are now closely watching for further developments.

The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, up from 4.1%, which was also the market estimate.\n\nAsian stocks fell sharply on Monday, extending last week's losses amid fears of a US economic slowdown, and the rand kicked off the week on the back foot as investors pulled out of high risk markets into safe havens.\n\nThe rand crumbled close to 2% in trade on Monday, hitting close to R18.70 to the dollar in intraday trade. The currency recovered to under R18.60 to the dollar by 13h30.\n\nGlobal stock markets tumbled, with losses cascading across tech shares, Nasdaq 100 Index futures falling more than 4%, and Japanese equities crashing by the most in over a decade.\n\nAs concerns about a US economic slowdown intensified, traders ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve will step in with an emergency interest rate cut, putting the odds at 30% for a quarter-point reduction.\n\nThe dollar weakened, and the 10-year Treasury yield fell to the lowest in a year. Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, soared to the highest since 2020.\n\nNvidia Corp., Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. fell more than 7% in premarket trading. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reported on Saturday that it had slashed its stake in Apple by almost 50% as part of a massive second-quarter selling spree. Chipmakers including Intel Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. also plunged.\n\nMarkets are extending last week's retreat when a weak US jobs report ignited fears that the Fed isn't moving fast enough to prevent a sharp economic downturn.\n\nThe wave of selling hit a fever pitch in Japan as traders rushed to unwind popular carry trades, powering a 3% surge in the yen and causing the Topix stock index to shed 12% and close the day with the biggest three-day drop in data stretching back to 1959.\n\n\"The key point is the current shift in narrative, from no landing to soft landing,\" said Florian Ielpo, the head of macro research at Lombard Odier Asset Management. \"That risk was poorly priced, and investors shifting gears fast explains the extent of the move.\"\n\nAt one point, Nasdaq futures tumbled 6.5%, coming close to triggering a circuit breaker, before paring the drop. The index has already fallen more than 10% since its July 10 record, passing the threshold that meets the definition of correction.\n\nInvestors sought havens in government bonds and the Swiss franc. Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. put the probability of a US recession in the next year to 25%, increasing their forecast from 15%. They added that the risk is still limited, and the economy continues to look \"fine overall.\"\n\nEven so, swaps pricing has moved dramatically in recent weeks to reflect the perception that the Fed will need to act quickly to preserve growth. Traders briefly priced in 60% odds for an emergency rate cut on Monday (5 August), and are now anticipating roughly the equivalent of five quarter-point cuts to interest rates through the end of the year.\n\n\"Clearly those jobs numbers have absolutely freaked everybody out,\" said Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors. \"It might well be that even the Fed thinks that we've got to do something to provide markets stability, and that could be an out-of-cycle rate cut. To do it a week after its policy meeting would be extraordinary, based on one data point.\"\n\nStill, bets on an early move by the Fed are misplaced, as the economy remains relatively robust despite the most recent data, said Christopher Dembik, senior investment adviser at Pictet Asset Management.\n\n\"We are facing a panic-style market overreaction, but it is largely irrational,\" Dembik said. \"The economy is deteriorating but nothing distressing if one takes a step back.\"\n\nThe selloff swept across risk assets of all stripes. In Taiwan, the benchmark stock gauge sank 8.4% lower, marking its worst selloff since 1967, in a decline that was led by AI-chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Brent futures slipped toward $75 a barrel -- erasing this year's gains -- and hit the lowest level since January. Bitcoin erased more than 10%.", "source": {"uri": "businesstech.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessTech"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Downside surprises there could have far-reaching consequences for open economies and may influence the upcoming decisions of global central banks.\"\n\nThe European selling was sparked by a crash that saw the Nikkei slump from Friday's 35,249.36 point-close to bottom out at 31,156.12 just before the market closed Monday afternoon before recovering slightly to 31,458.42, down 12.4%, with markets in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, India and Australia following suit.\n\nThe Topix, the Japanese equivalent of the S&P 500, fell more than 12% with the country's big industrials including Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Sumitomo all falling by more than 14%.\n\nNikkei and Topix futures trading was temporarily paused at the Osaka Securities Exchange after circuit-breakers kicked in to arrest panic selling.\n\nThe Bank of Japan lit the match Wednesday by raising interest rates for only the second time in nearly two decades -- from 0.1% to 0.25% -- and signalling there would be more hikes to follow, triggering two days of selling going into the weekend that saw the Nikkei lose more than 3,000 points.\n\nHowever, Nomura Securities chief strategist Naka Matsuzawa said the sell-off had to be seen in the context of growing \"risk-off\" sentiment, with most of the selling by foreign investors worried about the U.S. economy.\n\n\"The fall is not really happening due to Japan-specific reasons,\" he explained warning that there may be more selling to come.\n\n\"Markets are still trying to find the bottom.\"\n\nU.S. futures plunged ahead of the opening of Monday's Wall Street trading session with Dow futures down 800 points, on top of a 600-point drop Friday, the S&P down 3% and Nasdaq-100 futures down 4% as tech stocks took a hammering led by Apple after Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway revealed it had dumped half its stake in the iPhone maker.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

A slowdown in Germany last month prompted analysts to warn of a recession, while a rise in interest rates by Japan's central bank sent shares on the Nikkei index down 2,216 points, or nearly 6%, on Friday.\n\nIn the last month, the prospect of a recession in some of the world's biggest economies has sent the cost of a barrel of Brent crude falling from almost $88 to below $78.\n\nClosely watched economic data due this week in the US includes figures for the services sector on Monday and the unemployment claimant count on Thursday. Elsewhere, the UK is among several big economies, including China and Japan, to release service sector data on Monday.\n\nChris Weston, of the US online stockbroker Pepperstone, said global markets were \"at a truly important juncture\".\n\nHe added: \"What really matters now is whether money managers and traders feel sentiment has become too pessimistic, or if this deleveraging and risk aversion manifests into even higher volatility and drawdown.\n\n\"To answer this pertinent question the market needs to see the outcome of the data to offer increased confidence to price the risk of recession, and how that may feed into earnings expectations, consumer behaviours and business decisions.\"\n\nMarkets got the jitters last week after US jobs data for July showed a worse-than-expected slowdown, with 114,000 jobs created rather than the predicted 175,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate increased to a three-year high of 4.3%, while US manufacturing activity also slumped, falling to an eight-month low in July as new orders tailed off.\n\nThe figures stoked anxiety that the world's largest economy is vulnerable to a recession and may need to cut rates faster than expected to spur demand, rather than unwinding them in a more orderly fashion.\n\n\"We're witnessing the fallout from the curse of high expectations,\" said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management.\n\n\"So much had been invested around the scenario of a soft landing, that anything that even suggests something different is difficult.\"\n\nSo far this year, investors have grown accustomed to cooling inflation and gradually slowing employment, which appeared to be setting the scene for the Fed to begin trimming interest rates gradually.\n\nThat optimism had driven big gains in stocks: the S&P 500 is up by 12% this year, despite recent losses, while the tech-focused Nasdaq has gained nearly 12%.\n\nBut on Friday, the Nasdaq lost 2.4% to finish in correction territory - 10% off its record high, while Japanese equities recorded their worst day since the Covid-19 pandemic, with the Nikkei 225 index down 5.8%.\n\nIn London, the FTSE100 blue-chip share index lost more than 120 points at one stage, down by 1.5%.\n\nEurope's main stock indices also declined on Friday, with European technology stocks falling to their lowest level in more than six months. France's CAC 40 hit its lowest level since last November, down more than 1%, while Germany's DAX lost 2%.\n\nIn the US, Uber, Airbnb, Hilton International and Coca-Cola are among the big firms posting financial results this week. European bellwether stocks such as the Italian insurer Generali and Deutsche Telekom, will also report this week.\n\nWhile shares slid, gold hit a new record on Friday as investors flocked to safe-haven assets. The US dollar weakened, lifting the pound by 0.5% to $1.28, and the euro by 1.2% to $1.092.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The prospect of a wider regional conflict in the Middle East has also been stoking fears.\n\nIn the US, the talk has turned to the need for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to support to stave off recession, when previously a cut in borrowing rate would have been seen as a reason for cheer.\n\nREAD MORE: Middle East firm withdraws takeover interest in Wood\n\nAnalysts said on Friday that they feared the Fed may have made a mistake by not cutting interest rates, and might now be too late to hold off a recession.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 lost 13% on Monday to hit a seven-month low, in a day of trading that was worse than at any time during the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nThe Japanese benchmark index fell 4,451 points to 31,458 on Monday- its worst day since 1987.\n\nLondon's blue-chip index, meanwhile, plunged in early trading today after an expected global stock market rout started overnight.

This has all spilled into Asian markets, with carry trades unwinding and risk-off sentiment prevalent.\n\n\"However, we think the macro backdrop isn't as terminal as markets are indicating. Strong labour supply growth in recent years has helped to cool the labour market and layoffs remain low in the US. In Asia, the upturn in tech exports and still buoyant domestic demand shouldn't set alarm bells ringing yet for policymakers.\n\n\"We expect the Fed to begin easing in September, which should provide the runway for cutting cycles in parts of emerging Asia, and likely further stimulus in China could also have some positive spill-overs, softening any slowdown in the region.\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FTSE 100 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007\u20132008_financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2007\u20132008 financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nikkei", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Nikkei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_chip_(stock_market)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blue chip (stock market)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Langham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Langham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(investment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carry (investment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9743170/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784408", "eventUri": "eng-9784408", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Fears of a potential U.S. recession prompted investors to flee from risky assets, leading to a sharp sell-off in equities across both Western and Eastern markets.\n\nGrowing tensions in the Middle East have further dampened investor sentiment, with analysts concerned that Israel's war against Palestinians in Gaza, which began last October after attacks on the Jewish state, could escalate into a wider conflict involving more nations.\n\nThe Nifty 50 plummeted 824 points, falling below 24,000 for the first time since June 26. Today's drop also marked the largest intraday decline since June 4, when the Lok Sabha results fell short of exit poll predictions. S&P BSE Sensex tumbled 2,686 points to 78,295 points.\n\nAll sectoral indices are trading in the red, with Nifty Realty experiencing the steepest decline of 5.2%, followed by Nifty Metal and Nifty PSU Bank, which dropped by 5% and 4.9%, respectively.\n\nThe sell-off began on Friday after the U.S. economy revealed signs of weakness for June. Manufacturing activity contracted at its fastest rate since December 2023, job growth slowed significantly, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4.3%, the highest level since October 2021.\n\nRecent data have sparked concerns about a potential recession, leading to criticism of the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain high interest rates for an extended period. Economists argue that the Fed should have lowered rates last week to bolster the economy, given the weakening labor market.\n\nOn July 31, the Fed kept interest rates steady at a 23-year high of 5.25%-5.50% for the eighth consecutive meeting in 2024, as anticipated. Despite this, Jerome Powell hinted at the possibility of a rate cut as early as September.\n\nEven if the Fed does lower rates in September, current high rates have already made borrowing costlier for consumers, affecting home, car purchases, and credit card use. The impact of any rate cut might take several months to a year to be fully felt in the economy.\n\nFollowing today's market downturn, many economists expect the Fed might implement a rate cut before the September meeting to stabilise the markets.\n\nApart from Indian stocks, Japan's Nikkei shed a staggering 9% to hit 8-month lows, entering bear market territory and marking its biggest three-session loss since the 2011 financial crisis.\n\nThe Nasdaq index, heavily influenced by tech stocks, has entered correction territory during Friday's trade, and it is currently down more than 10% from its record high. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones are 5.7% and 3.9% below their all-time highs, respectively.\n\nCommenting on today's market performance, Tanvi Kanchan, Head, UAE Business & Strategy, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, said, \"This sell-off is more of a short-term volatility by way of profit booking and is no indicator of any long-term panic mode set in the Indian equities. For investors looking at entering the equity market, a staggered entry during volatile periods can be considered.\"", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_ksheerasagar@livemint.com", "name": "A Ksheerasagar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIFTY_50", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NIFTY 50"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSE_SENSEX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BSE SENSEX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/08/05/600x338/HONG-KONG-STOCKS-2_1706631938185_1722841202550.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784408", "eventUri": "eng-9784408", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 630, "textEnd": 637}, {"amb": false, "date": "-06-04", "textStart": 699, "textEnd": 705}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1612, "textEnd": 1619}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Japan's Nikkei index entered bear market territory earlier in the session, and bitcoin, the world's favorite digital currency slumped as risk appetite drained away.\n\nU.S. stock futures fell sharply Monday, with the tech sector hit hard as a soft nonfarm payrolls report ramped up concerns that the U.S. economy was heading towards recession.\n\nBy 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 590 points, or 1.5%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 106 points, or 2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 595 points, or 3.2%.\n\nThe Wall Street indices suffered a brutal week last week, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite recording a third straight losing week and is now down more than 10% from a record set last month, in correction territory.\n\nThe S&P 500 also posted a third straight losing week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been outperforming, snapped a four-week win streak, falling 2%.\n\nThis selling is set to continue this week as investors fretted that a worryingly weak July payrolls report indicated that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at elevated levels for too long, dragging the world's largest economy into recession.\n\n\"We have increased our 12-month recession odds by 10pp to 25%,\" said analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a note, though they thought the danger was limited by the sheer scope the Fed had to ease policy.\n\nMarkets now price in a 78% chance the Federal Reserve will not only cut rates in September, but ease by a full 50 basis points.\n\nEconomic data due out Monday include the July ISM Services PMI, while San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly will be speaking at a conference after the close Monday.\n\nThe likely selloff on Wall Street Monday has already been reflected in sharp losses in Europe, with the pan-European benchmark Stoxx 600 index falling over 2% at the open.\n\nHowever, this weakness is nothing when compared with the 13% drop seen in the Nikkei 225 index in Japan earlier in the session, its worst day since the \"Black Monday\" of 1987.\n\nThe index has now fallen more than 20% from the all-time high on July 11, entering bear market territory, and has erased all its gains so far this year.\n\nUBS's Kelvin Tay warned investors about using these hefty losses to return to the Japanese market, sayings on CNBC that going into the Japanese market at this moment is akin to catching \"a falling knife.\"\n\n\"The only reason why the Japanese market is up so strongly in the last two years is because the Japanese yen has been very, very weak. Once it reverses, you've got to get out right,\" Tay said.\n\nThe yen has strengthened sharply since the Bank of Japan raised interest rates, helped before that by government intervention, after falling to a 38-year low against the U.S. dollar in June.\n\nA stronger yen pressurizes Japanese stock markets as it erodes the competitiveness of the important export-oriented firms.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD), the world's biggest cryptocurrency, slumped Monday, falling to a more than five-month low as growing fears of a U.S. economic slowdown battered risk appetite.\n\nAt 04:15 ET, Bitcoin fell 12% to $53,008, dropping to its weakest level since late-February, largely wiping out a rally sparked by the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in March.\n\nBitcoin - along with broader crypto markets - have been tracking steep losses in equity markets since Friday, as a swathe of weak economic readings from the U.S. pushed up concerns over a potential recession.\n\nLed by the drop in bitcoin as well as ether, the second most popular digital currency, Coinglass revealed over $800 million has been liquidated from the crypto space in the last 24 hours.\n\nUncertainty over the outlook for U.S. regulation has also weighed on crypto markets, especially as recent polling data saw Democratic frontrunner Kamala Harris catching up with Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nPrivate packaged food giant Mars is considering a potential acquisition of smaller rival Kellanova (NYSE:K), according to a report from Reuters, released on Sunday.\n\nSuch a deal could be one of the biggest in the food industry, given Kellanova has a market capitalization of about $27 billion, although such a move, if it was to occur, would likely attract antitrust scrutiny given that both firms control several major brands in the packaged foods sector.\n\nKellanova was spun off from WK Kellogg (NYSE:K) last October, and although its shares are up over 12% so far this year they are still seen trading at a discount to peers such as Hershey (NYSE:HSY) and Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ).\n\nMars is one of the biggest privately-owned companies in the world, and is controlled by the Mars family.\n\nCrude prices fell Monday, trading around eighth-month lows, on mounting concerns of an economic slowdown in the U.S., the world's largest oil consumer.\n\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 1% to $72.81 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.8% to $76.22 a barrel.\n\nWeak U.S. economic data last week has hit sentiment in the oil markets as the prospect of a recession in the world's largest economy bodes poorly for future demand, even as recent inventory data showed that increased travel demand during the summer season had kept fuel consumption high.\n\nThis has added to disappointing growth numbers from top oil importer China and surveys showing weaker manufacturing activity across Asia and Europe, raising concerns of the future oil consumption.\n\nBoth benchmarks tumbled more than 3% last week to settle at their lowest since January on Friday. Last week, both contracts marked their fourth straight week of losses, their biggest losing streaks since November.\n\nThe crude markets have largely looked past heightened tensions in the Middle East, with Israel and the United States expecting a serious escalation in the region after Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah pledged to retaliate against Israel for the recent killings of a couple of militant leaders.\n\nAlso of interest is the incoming Tropical Storm Debby, which is expected to strengthen rapidly into a hurricane before making landfall in Florida's Gulf Coast later in the session, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Sunday.\n\nOil major Chevron (NYSE:CVX) said on Sunday that it had removed non-essential personnel from its facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, but production had yet to be impacted.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Bitcoin lost 10% of its value during the day", "body": "At the end of Friday, the Dow Jones Index (US30) fell by 1.51% (for the week -2.28%), and the S&P 500 Index (US500) lost 1.84% (for the week -2.37%). The NASDAQ Technology Index (US100) closed negative 2.43% (for the week -3.83%). On Friday, the US dollar fell to a twenty-week low against a basket of currencies due to weak US jobs data, which heightened fears of a possible recession and raised the stakes for more Fed rate cuts. The US economy added 114,000 jobs in July, which was below market expectations of a 175,000 increase. In addition, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to its highest level since 2021, and wage growth slowed more than expected. This followed weak manufacturing data, with the ISM manufacturing PMI showing a larger-than-expected contraction in factory activity. This raised fears of a recession in the US and also increased expectations of a dovish Federal Reserve rate hike. Markets now believe there is a more than 70% chance of a 50 basis point Fed rate cut in September, with a total easing of around 155 basis points this year and next.\n\nBitcoin fell 10% to below 53,000 on Monday, hitting a more than five-month low, as rising fears of a US recession prompted investors to shed risky assets, including digital currencies, stocks, commodities, and risk-sensitive currencies. The moves came amid weak US jobs data, which heightened fears that the Federal Reserve may already be too late to cut interest rates as the US economy may already be entering recession.\n\nEquity markets in Europe mostly fell on Friday. Germany's DAX (DE40) fell by 2.23% (week ended -4.75%), France's CAC 40 (FR40) closed down by 1.61% (week ended -3.92%), Spain's IBEX 35 (ES35) fell 1.67% (week ended -4.89%), and the UK's FTSE 100 (UK100) closed negative 1.31% (week ended -1.34%).\n\nECB official Stournaras emphasized that inflation could fall below the 2% target due to problems in the Eurozone economy. As for the data, Eurozone annual inflation unexpectedly accelerated to 2.6% in July, but services inflation fell for the first time in three months. In addition, preliminary estimates suggest that the Eurozone economy grew 0.3% faster than expected in Q2, driven by growth in France, Italy, and Spain. On the other hand, Germany's economy unexpectedly contracted.\n\nWTI crude oil prices fell to $73 a barrel on Monday, declining for the third consecutive session as fears of recession in the US, the world's top oil consumer, outweighed supply risks caused by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Markets are also watching the reaction of Iran, which vowed to avenge the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh after an airstrike in Tehran killed a top Hezbollah commander.\n\nAsian markets were mostly down last week. Japan's Nikkei 225 (JP225) fell by 5.85%, China's FTSE China A50 (CHA50) declined 0.86%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HK50) lost 2.08% over 5 trading days, while Australia's ASX 200 (AU200) was positive 0.28%.\n\nIn Asia, investors await the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) interest rate decision on Tuesday, where a rate hold is widely expected. The probability of an RBA rate cut in November is around 75%, much earlier than previous estimates that suggested a rate cut in April next year. The Melbourne Institute's monthly inflation gauge rose 0.4% in July 2024 after rising 0.3% in the previous two months. It was the fifth straight month of growth and the sharpest reading since December last year.\n\nThe overall Caixin China PMI fell to 51.2 in July 2024 from June's reading of 52.8, indicating the lowest since last October and marking the ninth month of expansion in sector activity.", "source": {"uri": "investmacro.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InvestMacro"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This frenzy also activated circuit breakers in South Korea, where the main market finished nearly 9% lower.\n\nIn Taiwan, stocks plunged more than 8% - the worst single-day percentage drop in the island's history. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company -- the world's largest chipmaker - fell nearly 10%.\n\nEuropean markets also fell sharply at the start of trading.\n\nThe sell-off was a continuation from Friday, when the United States posted a worse than expected jobs report. Some investors are also concerned that the U.S. Federal Reserve may have acted too slowly in lowering interest rates that have been elevated in attempt to reduce inflation.\n\nThe sell-off has been most severe in Japan, which analysts said was experiencing a market correction after many investors relied on a historically cheap yen and rock-bottom interest rates to fund risky investments. That strategy was exposed after Japan last week raised benchmark interest rates for only the second time in 17 years and hinted that such rate hikes may continue.\n\n\"I don't think it's a civilization-altering crash,\" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Research. \"It's just to me a simple case of market participants getting way ahead and, I guess you can argue, greedy, in over-leveraging, thinking that cheap and free money in Japan was going to be here to stay. And that has gone badly wrong, and they are having to very quickly unwind it and it's having knock-on effects into asset markets.\"\n\nIn an interview with VOA, Goh downplayed concerns about a U.S. recession.\n\n\"I think it's a little bit unfair to blame the (U.S.) Fed for being late or behind the curve, because until recently a lot of people were thinking that the U.S. economy was still in reasonably good shape. And no one was really ringing the recession alarm bells,\" he said.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Federal Reserve chose to hold interest rates steady, even while leaving the door open for a rate cut next month.\n\nTwo years ago, the Fed started increasing borrowing costs to curb inflation, which had caused prices to soar for essentials like rent and food. Since then, it has aimed for a \"soft landing,\" seeking to control inflation without causing an economic recession.\n\nIn an analytical note, economists at Goldman Sachs increased the probability of a U.S. recession within the next 12 months from 15% to 25%, although they acknowledged that the risk remains limited given the tools available to the U.S. Federal Reserve.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nikkei", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Nikkei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_selling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Panic selling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_correction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market correction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/FB4878FC-E7BC-433C-9ACB-DE8C352AB268.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784408", "eventUri": "eng-9784408", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Talk of the US Federal Reserve potentially cutting interest rates soon to ward off a recession has only added to the market's nerves. Apple's 7.3% drop was a major shock, triggered by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway slashing its stake by nearly 50%, hinting at broader economic concerns. Nvidia wasn't far behind, falling 6.8% on news of delays in its new AI chips. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 futures all showed significant declines, reflecting overall market anxiety.\n\nWeak job reports and shrinking manufacturing activity have already pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory. Traders are now betting on a 91.5% chance of a 50 basis points rate cut by September, shifting year-end rates to potentially 4-4.25% from the current 5.25%-5.50%. Major Wall Street brokers have also updated their 2024 rate forecasts, emphasizing greater policy easing. With market volatility climbing - the CBOE Volatility Index has hit 35.19, its highest since May 2022 - investors should brace for a turbulent market ahead.\n\nThe bigger picture: Reading the economic tea leaves.\n\nThe weak jobs data activated the 'Sahm Rule,' a historically reliable recession indicator, heightening recession fears. As the Federal Reserve faces pressure, key figures like Austan Goolsbee and Mary Daly will address the public, potentially offering more clues about future rate decisions.

Fears that the Federal Reserve has gone a bit too far with\n\nits monetary policy in terms of keeping rates restrictive for too long is creating negative sentiment that has spilled over into other markets. Stock markets from Asia to Europe took a beating and bond yields slid as investors rushed to safe-haven assets.\n\nGlobal bonds rallied as traders bet the Federal Reserve and fellow central banks will turn more aggressive in cutting interest rates amid mounting concern that economic growth is faltering at a faster pace than expected just weeks ago. The global repricing\n\nwas so sharp that at one point the swap market assigned a 60% chance of an emergency rate reduction by the Federal Reserve over the coming week. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East further added to the cautious sentiment as Israel braced for a possible\n\nattack from Iran and regional militias.\n\nUS equity futures tumbled overnight, with the Nasdaq 100 contracts falling nearly 5% and set for its biggest opening drop in more than four years as fears of the United States slipping\n\ninto a recession rippled through global markets. Megacap and growth stocks, the main drivers for the indexes hitting record highs earlier this year, fell sharply in premarket trading. Apple shares are sharply lower after Berkshire Hathaway slashed its stake\n\nin the iPhone maker by almost 50%. Nvidia shares tumbled in early trading, extending its one-month decline to around 23% after reports of a delay in the launch of its upcoming artificial intelligence chips known as Blackwell, due to design flaws. Analysts\n\nhad expected Blackwell to generate revenues for Nvidia starting in the third quarter of this year. A slew of Fed officials will be speaking on the economy and monetary policy through the week.\n\nFutures ahead of the bell: E-Mini S&P -4.3%, Nasdaq -5.9%, Russell 2000 -5.3%, DJI -3%\n\nIn pre-market trading, Nvidia (NVDA) falls 12% as megacap technology stocks are bearing the brunt of the selloff. Apple (AAPL) -7%, Meta Platforms (META) -5% Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) -4%,\n\nTesla (TSLA) -9%. Berkshire Hathaway slashed its Apple stake by almost 50%, while its cash pile soared to a record $277B. Intel shares are down 7% after plunging 26% on Friday in its biggest drop since at least 1982. Kellanova (K) rises 20% after Reuters\n\nreported Mars was exploring an acquisition of the snack maker. Moderna (MRNA) drops 5% as RBC cut its rating to sector perform, noting an \"increasingly uncertain outlook.\"\n\nVIX is at a four-year high. Carry traders unwinding their positions fueled more volatility.\n\nEuropean gauges are extending last week's decline amid a deepening global rout in equities and a rotation away from the technology shares that have powered this year's rally. The Euro\n\nStoxx 600 fell as much as 3.2%, the steepest intraday drop since March 2022. All sectors declined, with energy and REIT shares sinking the most. London's FTSE 100 plunged over 2.5% to hit its lowest in over three months. France's CAC Index has now fallen more\n\nthan 10% from its recent peak, the technical definition of a correction. Among single stocks, L'Oreal SA said it is buying a 10% stake in Swiss skincare company Galderma Group AG. While L'Oreal fell with the rest of the market, Galderma rose as much as 6.6%.\n\nStoxx 600 -3.2%, DAX -3.3%, CAC -2.6%, FTSE 100 -2.9%. Energy -4.4%, REITs -4.4%, Banks -4.1%, Technology -4.1%.\n\nShares in Asia plunged as fears of a deeper US economic slowdown and an extended rout in Japanese shares sapped risk appetite. A measure of implied volatility for the Nikkei 225 Stock\n\nAverage jumped a record 140% to its highest level since the global financial crisis in 2008. Many equity indexes across the region hit bleak milestones, with those in export-reliant markets of Japan, Taiwan and Korea suffering the most. Circuit breakers temporarily\n\nsuspended trading of futures for the Topix as well as the Nikkei 225 Stock Average multiple times, while trading was also briefly halted for the Kospi and Kosdaq cash and futures markets in Seoul. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank as much as 6.7%, its worst\n\nday since 2008, erasing all its gains for the year. The Topix and Nikkei 225 were pummeled, both ending down more than 12% and more than 20% off the year's high, putting them into bear markets. Nikkei 225 -12.4%, Topix -12.2%, Kospi -8.8%, Taiwan -8.3%, Singapore\n\n-4%, Vietnam -3.9%, ASX 200 -3.7%, Sensex -2.7%, Hang Seng Index -1.5%, CSI 300 -1.2%.\n\nTreasuries retain about half of their steep, front-end-led gains during Asia session and European morning, with 2-year yields richer by 14bp at around 3.75% after\n\nfalling nearly 27bp Friday. Similar gains seen in core European rates, where 2-year German yields are lower by around 11bp on the day. Investors continue to price in aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, with about 55bp of easing now priced in for September\n\nFOMC meeting, 100bp by November's. Traders priced in a 60% chance of a 25-bp emergency Fed rate cut within the next week as markets around the world extended their plunge. \"I'm calling for a 75 basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another\n\n75 basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting - and that's minimum,\" says Wharton's Jeremy Siegel. 2s10s spread is wider by almost 8bp and approaching dis-inversion for the first time since July 2022.\n\n14 day RSI in 2-year and 10-year yield is at most oversold condition since March 2020.\n\nGold prices fell in volatile trading as investors liquidated positions in tandem with a broader equities sell-off, though analysts said bullion's safe-haven appeal\n\nremains strong as U.S. recession fears mount. Spot bullion -- which neared a record high last week -- declined over 3%. Spot gold -3.05%, silver -7%.\n\nOil prices are sharply lower, pulled down by a continued rout in global equity markets. Geopolitical concerns remain an underlying factor for the oil market, with\n\ntraders waiting to see how Iran responds to the assassination of a top Hamas official on Iranian soil last week. Hurricane Debby is expected to slam into the Big Bend region of Florida's Gulf Coast by midday today before slowly crossing the state, causing\n\npotentially dangerous storm surges and catastrophic flooding, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm could bring \"potentially historic rainfall\" of between 10 and 20 inches and catastrophic flooding to Georgia and South Carolina, it said. Saudi Arabia\n\nraised September prices of its flagship crude for Asian buyers, but the hike was less than expected. In Europe, it lowered prices by the most in more than four years. WTI -1.8%, Brent -1.6%, US Nat Gas -3.5%, RBOB -1.8%.\n\nIn currency markets, the yen and yuan pushed higher to start the week, while the Mexican peso extended its slump as traders continued to roll back the popular global\n\ncarry trades. The Australian dollar pared some of its losses following a 2% drop. Two currencies often used to fund carry trades jumped -- the yen by more than 3% and China's yuan by 1%. US$ Index -0.7%, GBPUSD -0.3%, EURUSD +0.5%, USDJPY -3%, AUDUSD -1%, USDNOK\n\n+1%, USDCHF -1.1%.", "source": {"uri": "mrtopstep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mr TopStep"}, "authors": [],

They said that local investors were staying on the sidelines until global market conditions stabilised.\n\nAnalysts said the market's reaction is due to a global sell-off triggered by fears of a slowdown in the US economy and a potential rate hike by the Bank of Japan.\n\nAs per the PSX website, the KSE-100 Index was hovering at 77,053.57 points at 02:46 pm, down by 1172.41 points or 1.5% from the previous close.\n\nKey sectors, including automobile assemblers, cement, chemical, commercial banks, oil marketing companies (OMCs), and refineries, saw widespread selling.

This came a day after disappointing factory data, raising concerns that the Fed may have kept borrowing costs at over two-decade highs for too long, potentially leading to a hard landing and recession.\n\nA weak jobs report and shrinking manufacturing activity in the world's largest economy, coupled with dismal forecasts from the big technology firms, pushed the Nasdaq 100 and Nasdaq Composite into a correction last week.\n\nJapanese stocks collapsed on Monday in their biggest single-day rout since the 1987 Black Monday sell-offs, driven by last week's plunge in global stock markets, economic concerns and worries investments funded by a cheap yen were being unwound.\n\nThe Nikkei share average shed a staggering 12.4% as Friday's dismal jobs data heightened worries of a possible recession, and as the yen rallied to 7-month highs versus the dollar. This was the index's worst showing in percentage terms since the October 1987 crash.", "source": {"uri": "profit.pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Profit by Pakistan Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_outcry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open outcry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitch_Ratings", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fitch Ratings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bank_of_Poland", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Bank of Poland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_rupiah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indonesian rupiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nikkei", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Nikkei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/psx-down.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784408", "eventUri": "eng-9784408", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Israel is bracing itself for a possible attack from Iran and regional militias in retaliation for the recent assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas officials.\n\nCurrencies in the region leapt higher as the dollar weakened on rising bets of deeper rate cuts by the Fed. The Malaysian ringgit soared 2.3% to its highest level since late April last year, marking its best day since January 2016, and China's yuan jumped as much as 0.8% to its highest level since the start

The dollar weakened, and the 10-year Treasury yield fell to the lowest in a year. Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, soared to the highest since 2020.\n\nNvidia Corp., Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. fell more than 7% in premarket trading. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reported on Saturday that it had slashed its stake in Apple by almost 50% as part of a massive second-quarter selling spree. Chipmakers including Intel Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. also plunged.\n\nMarkets are extending last week's retreat, when a weak US jobs report ignited fears that the Fed isn't moving fast enough to prevent a sharp economic downturn. The wave of selling hit a fever pitch in Japan as traders rushed to unwind popular carry trades, powering a 3% surge in the yen and causing the Topix stock index to shed 12% and close the day with the biggest three-day drop in data stretching back to 1959.\n\n\"The key point is the current shift in narrative, from no landing to soft landing,\" said Florian Ielpo, the head of macro research at Lombard Odier Asset Management. \"That risk was poorly priced and investors shifting gears fast explains the extent of the move.\"\n\nAt one point, Nasdaq futures tumbled 6.5%, coming close to triggering a circuit breaker, before paring the drop. The index has already fallen more than 10% since its July 10 record, passing the threshold that meets the definition of correction.\n\nInvestors sought havens in government bonds and the Swiss franc. Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. put the probability of a US recession in the next year to 25%, increasing their forecast from 15%. They added that the risk is still limited and the economy continues to look \"fine overall.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\n\nEven so, swaps pricing has moved dramatically in recent weeks to reflect the perception that the Fed will need to act quickly to preserve growth.\n\n\"Clearly those jobs numbers have absolutely freaked everybody out,\" said Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors. \"It might well be that even the Fed thinks that we've got to do something to provide markets stability, and that could be an out-of-cycle rate cut. To do it a week after its policy meeting would be extraordinary, based on one data point.\"\n\nStill, bets on an early move by the Fed are misplaced, as the economy remains relatively robust despite the most recent data, said Christopher Dembik, senior investment adviser at Pictet Asset Management.\n\n\"We are facing a panic-style market overreaction, but it is largely irrational,\" Dembik said. \"The economy is deteriorating but nothing distressing if one takes a step back.\"\n\nThe selloff swept across risk assets of all stripes. In Taiwan, the benchmark stock gauge sank 8.4% lower, marking its worst selloff since 1967, in a decline that was led by AI-chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Brent futures slipped toward $75 a barrel -- erasing this year's gains -- and hit the lowest level since January. Bitcoin erased more than 10%.\n\nWhat other investors and strategists are saying:\n\nWe recommend keeping a defensive stand, using the correction to buy high quality assets that have derated. It is not the time to take large direction risks.\n\nWe are not changing our strategy, which we had lowered to a moderate Underweight in July, but we believe it is premature to repurchase now.\n\nPeople are scared, people are selling everything. So when it is this quick normally, it stops quickly. It will create a lot of opportunities. Eventually it's just a matter of trying to not lose too much and eventually create some nice performance.\n\nEven if the US does go into recession, it's likely to be a relatively soft and shallow one. Interest rates are going to start coming down, which will at some point provide some some support for the stock market. If we were to see an acceleration of the selloff, then I'd be more minded to be a buyer at that point than a seller.\n\nThe bigger concern for tech companies, and semiconductors in particular, is that this is a cyclical industry. Demand will impact sales and thus any slowdown will filter through to some of these tech giants. The macroeconomic data out last week is pointing to a more extreme slowdown than had been anticipated, putting into doubt the coveted soft landing the Federal Reserve is after. As such, the next few weeks is likely to be a volatile one for tech stocks.\n\nMy portfolio is built to withstand these types of event so I don't have a engage myself in a big-time rotation. I've got fairly high levels of cash and if some stocks I have already identified go down enough, I might just buy the dip. But in no way am I trying to do some market timing, this is a very dangerous strategy which can be very costly.\n\nI might be a lonely voice today calling to buy the dip, but I think this selloff has been about positioning, valuation adjustment as the major drivers of the previous rally are still there.\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n-With assistance

Unemployment rate rose from 4.1% in June to 4.5 % in July - highest since October 2021. The report is often seen as providing vital clues on the health of the US economy, and as a crucial indicator of the Fed's policy trajectory.\n\nLast week, The Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate to ~0.25% from a 0%-0.1% range in a bid to contain inflation. While the move was widely expected, being only the second time Japan has raised interest in almost two decades, the economic backdrop and lack of 'demand-driven' inflation,\n\nIn the backdrop of other data, Japan's move boosted the currency and has pushed a massive sell off of Yen carry trade positions which have had ripple effects on US stocks. When the Yen's exchange rate against the USD was strong, investors would borrow in the currency and reinvest the money in other currencies and assets. This made sense when the interest rate was negative or 0%, but a stronger yen means the margins that many investors had invested in have either been wiped out or at risk of being wiped out.\n\nThe ripple effect has been a decline in the stock markets in Shanghai, India, Australia, Taiwan, and other markets by between 1% and 8%.\n\nNasdaq, Dow futures and S&P 500 futures fell by 4.31%, 1.5% and 2.3% respectively. While this is partially a ripple effect of the situation in Japan, and the US's unemployment data, it is also widely seen as a market correction against AI and superconductor stocks driven growth over the past year.\n\nAnother effect has been the decline in the prices of various metals, especially gold, copper, and silver, in what is widely seen as speculative moves to cover losses in other investments.\n\nAnalysts believe the US Fed and regulators in Europe and Asia will be forced to cut rates in the next few months as it finds itself behind the market curve. Unlike the Bank of England, the US Fed declined to cut rates but the recent moves may force a rethinking with global repercussions.\n\nThe volatility Index (VIX), which is a measure of implied market volatility, popularly known as the \"fear index\", jumped 120.27 percent, signaling increased market uncertainty and possible market turmoil stemming from global market sell-off amid developments in

jobs report for July and a higher unemployment rate ignited worries that the U.S. economy could be falling into a recession.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, also know as the \"VIX\" -- a measure of expected market volatility -- jumped to 41.65, according to LSEG data, hitting its highest level since October 2020, as risk fears returned to the market.\n\nInvestors have grown concerned that the Fed has been too slow to cut interest rates after hiking them in a range between 5.25% and 5.5% to combat inflation from the Covid-19 era.\n\nThe U.S. central bank held rates steady at its latest policy meeting last week, but markets are predicting that it may now need to more faster and more firmly to prevent a downturn, with interest rate futures contracts pricing in a 70% chance of a 50 basis points cut in September, according to Reuters.\n\nSmead said the latest inflation data, which showed price rises dipped in June for the first time in four years, was a positive signal for markets -- but he noted that underlying issues remain.\n\nHe said he now sees the U.S. falling into recession \"at some point,\" though he added this was more likely to be led by the loss in asset values from the fall off of the stock market.\n\nThe Fed will continue to have a challenge on its hands as it grapples with the added inflationary pressures of the U.S. election cycle and the prospect of wider conflict in the Middle East, Smead noted.\n\n\"Is it likely to see us tame our fiscal spending in the interim?\" he said of the election campaign. \"The answer's 'no.'\"\n\n\"Whoever comes in, be it Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, there's going to be an interest in trying to prop up anything,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"},

Republicans Shouldn't Let Voters Forget It.", "body": "The opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com.\n\nAt the beginning of August last year, Kamala Harris praised a jobs report as being an example of \"Bidenomics\" at work. The term was co-opted by the Biden administration as a means of countering what Republicans were saying about the weak economy. Every good bit of news that came out, they took credit for.\n\n\"Bidenomics is working,\" she said at the time, letting the Biden-Harris administration take credit for the economy that month.\n\nThat was a year ago. A lot has changed, particularly the election landscape for the presidency. 2024 has shifted from a rematch of 2020 to Donald Trump now running directly against Harris. But the Biden team made a deliberate choice to call the administration the \"Biden-Harris Administration,\" and to tie her closely to the policies Biden and his team were putting in place.\n\nOn Friday, the jobs report for July was abysmal to the point that the markets went into a full-blown panic.\n\nNonfarm payrolls grew by just 114,000 for the month, down from the downwardly revised 179,000 in June and below the Dow Jones estimate for 185,000. The unemployment rate edged higher to 4.3%, its highest since October 2021.\n\nAverage hourly earnings, a closely watched inflation barometer, increased 0.2% for the month and 3.6% from a year ago. Both figures were below respective forecasts for 0.3% and 3.7%.\n\nStock market futures added to losses following the report while Treasury yields plunged.\n\nAnd now, as the markets begin to open, things aren't looking much better.\n\nU.S. stock futures sharply fell on Monday as part of a global market sell-off centered around U.S. recession fears. Japan's Nikkei 225 plunged 12% in its worst day since the 1987 Black Monday crash for Wall Street.\n\nHere's where U.S. stock market futures stand at the moment:\n\nIf the Dow was to follow through on that decline, it would be the first 1,000 point decline since September 2022.\n\nThere are now global fears of a U.S. recession. Given the numbers, there is real concern that the U.S. is, at best, in a pre-recession state.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has raised interest rates in a constant effort to combat inflation. Typically, when you start raising interest rates at that pace, it leads to a recession. I say \"typically\" because it hasn't happened yet, and many economists assumed the Fed had pulled off the soft landing. However, the sudden contraction in the jobs market has brought those worries back to the fore, and people are panicking.\n\nIf the Biden-Harris administration was taking credit for the economy a year ago, then it should be made to take credit for it now. In truth, Biden's policies did create the sharp rise in inflation that we as consumers are still dealing with. In truth, that rise in inflation led the Fed to start hiking rates, which forced the economy to begin to contract. In truth, this has led us to where we are today.\n\nThe timing could not be worse for Kamala Harris, whose name is one half of the \"Biden-Harris\" administration. It was her voice that credited \"Bidenomics\" with the state of the economy. She is tied to all of these policies, and if the economy does go into a full-blown recession, then it will fall on her.\n\nIf Republicans want to win in November, they should be running the clip at the beginning of this post every day, following by the July jobs report. It should be in ads everywhere as soon as they can get them on the air. But the Republican Party has been slow to define Harris and slow to properly tie her to the policies of her boss, President Joe Biden.

It is thought the global sell-off has \"wiped trillions of dollars off of global markets\", said the Daily Express. The effect appears most severe in Japan's Nikkei index, which suffered \"its worst day since 1987 and hitting a seven-month low\".\n\nGlobal market drops can be attributed to the latest US jobs report showing unemployment \"rising to its highest level in years\", said The New York Times. The figures stoked fears the \"economy was cooling\", prompting a wave of \"investor anxiety\".\n\nInvestors were already on a knife-edge thanks to the US Federal Reserve's \"waiting game\" on lowering its benchmark interest rate, said Bloomberg's John Authers. \"To err is human\", but the Fed might have held off \"too long\", creating an atmosphere of \"hair-trigger reactions to every shred of news\".\n\nA \"painful combination of factors\", such as a potential recession in the US and the current geopolitical tensions, have damaged the \"global risk appetite of investors\", said the Financial Times' Leo Lewis. However, Donald Trump was quick to blame the slide on the Democrats, calling Joe Biden \"sound asleep\" on the economy and claiming Kamala Harris \"doesn't have a clue\".\n\nDespite the fears being rooted in the US economic outlook, it is Japan that has seemingly borne the brunt of the ongoing crisis. The painful irony is that the Nikkei has \"recently been experiencing a renaissance\", said Lewis, meaning it is \"unusually attractive to take profits from it right now because the gains this year have been so good\".\n\nHowever, not everyone is buying into the idea of a worst-case scenario. \"We don't see a recession [in the US] even though the stock market today is behaving like it anticipates a recession,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, told Al Jazeera. There are \"things going on beneath the surface\" of the seemingly glum data, she said - the higher unemployment rate, for instance, is partly due to new immigrants entering the workforce, and \"that is a good thing\".\n\nWith a global sell-off now in full swing, the prospects of swift interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve at its next meeting on 17 September \"loom large\", said Reuters.\n\nWhile Britain's FTSE 100 has undoubtedly been caught up in the ongoing \"global mayhem\", it could be in with a chance of \"skirting the absolute worst of the declines\". As sectors within the index often offer a glut of \"solid, predictable dividends\", investors will be turning to the FTSE to ensure safety, Bloomberg added.\n\nMeanwhile, it will be a \"moment of truth\" for Japan's stock market, said Reuters' Una Galan, as this week's \"slump\" is likely to finally reveal \"how much substance is beneath the froth\" in the country.\n\nProblems are unlikely to end soon. In fact, \"we likely have a summer of volatility ahead of us\", said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG, in The Mirror, as \"such moves don't stop in a single day\".",

This abrupt change underscores the complex economic factors affecting precious metals markets.\n\nInvestors are selling positions alongside a broader equities decline, with increasing concerns about a U.S. recession pushing traders to cash. Friday's weak U.S. jobs data continues to impact market sentiment, contributing to the overall market instability.\n\nSilver is down despite typically positive signals such as falling Treasury yields and a weaker U.S. Dollar. This unexpected behavior highlights the current market's instability, with traders cutting profitable positions to meet margin calls in the stock market. The precious metal's usual safe-haven appeal appears temporarily overshadowed by the need for liquidity in other markets.\n\nXAG/USD is nearing the important 200-day moving average at $26.02, a level that often strongly influences price direction. Traders are closely watching this indicator for potential support, as it could play a crucial role in determining the near-term direction of silver prices.\n\nThe silver sell-off is part of a wider market reaction affecting various asset classes. Japanese stocks fell to levels not seen since the 1987 Black Monday crash, while European stocks have also declined sharply. U.S. Treasury yields have reached their lowest points in over a year, reflecting the flight to safety and growing recession concerns.\n\nFriday's U.S. jobs report revealed the unemployment rate rising to 4.3%, intensifying recession worries. This data, combined with poor tech earnings and concerns about China's economy, is driving a global sell-off in stocks, oil, and high-yield currencies. The weak labor market data has also fueled expectations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, with some traders now pricing in a 50 basis point cut at the September meeting.\n\nThe short-term outlook for silver has turned bearish due to current market conditions. While silver's status as a safe-haven asset remains intact, it's currently overshadowed by demand for liquidity in other markets.", "source": {"uri": "fxempire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXEmpire.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_hyerczyk@fxempire.com", "name": "James Hyerczyk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Precious metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margin (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_classes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asset classes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2024/08/Silver-bull-coin-2.jpg?func=cover&q=70&width=700", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784408", "eventUri": "eng-9784408", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

It comes after a rough week for global markets.\n\nThat has reignited criticisms that the Fed is moving too slowly to cut rates as economic conditions look shakier.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nS&P 500 futures were down 3 percent on Monday. Mega-cap tech stocks, which have driven much of the market's gains this past year, were especially bruised: Nvidia was down 11 percent premarket, while Apple was off 7.5 percent. (Adding to the jitters was Berkshire Hathaway again cutting its stake in Apple and Nvidia reportedly delaying shipments of its most advanced A.I. chip.)\n\nJapan was especially hard hit. The Nikkei 225 fell more than 12 percent, battered by concerns about tech stocks and worries that the Bank of Japan moved too quickly in raising interest rates last week.\n\nBitcoin tumbled more than 10 percent, wiping out more than $100 billion in value off the volatile digital currency.\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark, fell despite growing tensions in the Middle East.\n\nInvestors fled to safe-haven assets, helping lift sovereign bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to a one-year low. (Bond prices rise when yields fall.)\n\nGoldman Sachs economists this weekend raised the odds of a U.S. recession in the next year to 25 percent from 15 percent; they cautioned that such a risk was \"limited.\"\n\nBut the Goldman note -- along with recent disappointing earnings results, and lackluster economic reports including Friday's jobs report -- have compounded global fears that the U.S. is headed for a hard landing. All this has stoked speculation that the Fed will need to take bold action, such as a prodigious half-percentage point cut next month or an exceedingly rare emergency cut within the next week.\n\nCriticisms of the Fed are getting louder, especially from the I-told-you-so crowd. \"The Federal Reserve has been late in cutting rates, but that has been true for some time,\" Paul Donovan, a UBS economist, wrote in a client note on Monday. \"The policy error is making things worse for lower income households.\"\n\nCompanies have been warning for some time that lower-income consumers are pulling back, muddying their profit outlooks. \"The tone for companies on earnings calls will be key to watch in the coming weeks,\" Lori Calvasina, the head of global equity research at RBC Capital

Investors say that the central bank made a big policy error in keeping the Federal Funds Rate at these high levels for more than a year, even as inflation pressures continued to ease toward its 2% target and underlying weakness in the job market has become evident.\n\nRelated: Jobs report triggers key recession warning signal as stocks plunge\n\n\"In the first quarter of the year the market was debating whether the economy was overheating and reaccelerating, whereas during the second quarter focus shifted to whether things could be slowing too much, too quickly,\" said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Fund.\n\n\"Now there is concern that the Federal Reserve could again be 'behind the curve,'\" he added.\n\nTraders are now betting on an oversized 50 basis point rate cut when the Fed meets next month in Washington, with Wisdom Tree economist and Wharton School of Business Professor Jeremy Siegel calling for an emergency rate move before the Sept. 18 sit-down.\n\n2. The yen-carry trade\n\nOver the past two years U.S stock markets, and the tech sector in particular, have seen a huge rush of foreign investment power outsized gains for the three major benchmarks.\n\nA notable portion of those gains, however, is tied to what is known as the yen-carry trade, a process in which investors borrow cheap money in Japan -- at essentially zero interest -- and reinvest it at higher rates in markets worldwide.\n\nThat trade, however, has been unwinding for weeks. And that move has accelerated over the past few trading days after the Bank of Japan executed two successive interest-rate hikes - its first in 17 years - and signaled a slowdown in the pace of its bond purchases in order to tamp down inflation pressures in the world's fourth-largest economy.\n\nThat's lifted the yen from a four-decade low of around 161.61 against the U.S. dollar last month to around 142.71 today. The 11% surge has traders racing to sell their overseas assets and convert them back into yen to stem some of their currency-related losses.\n\nSo far the moves seem to have been slightly overextended, leading to a correction during the European session, but the bias remains strongly to the downside in the short term, said Daniela Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com.\n\nThat trade is starting to unwind as well, amid a July investor rotation from tech stocks into domestically focused companies that might benefit from both a second administration under former President Donald Trump and from bets on upcoming Fed interest-rate cuts.\n\nRelated: What Buffett's huge Apple sale really means\n\nMuted near-term outlooks from Google (GOOGL) , Amazon (AMZN) , Apple and Microsoft during the second-quarter reporting season, as well as plans to increase capital spending over the second half, look to have accelerated that selling as well. Tech losses are leading declines in Asia trading this week and the Nasdaq slid into correction territory at the end of last week.\n\nBloomberg's Magnificent 7 Total Return Index, which was up 51% for the year as of July 10, has since fallen more than 18%.\n\nNews that billionaire investor Warren Buffett nearly halved his stake in Apple last quarter has added to concern that the sector is significantly overvalued.\n\n\"While we clearly get the worries/fears [that] the US consumer is weakening [Amazon consumer softer print, the] Fed is late to the game [and the] hard-landing bear thesis [is] returning, we focus on tech spending and the winners that will be front and center in this massive AI tech buildout that is still in the second inning of a nine-inning game,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.\n\n4. Volatility in the market spikes\n\nAnother key factor in the current global selloff is the spike in Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, which is used to predict the levels of market volatility over the coming month.\n\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange's VIX index, which traded near historic lows for much of the first half, has spiked to the highest levels since the depth of the Covid pandemic this week. That's triggered a rush out of riskier markets and into safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds.\n\nThe VIX, which is calculated from stock-option prices, was last marked a staggering 167.5% higher on the session in early Monday trading and pegged at $49.73.\n\nAt that level, the VIX suggests that traders are expecting daily swings in the S&P 500 of around 3.1%, or 160 points, over the next 30 days. That's around three times the level of volatility markets were forecasting at the start of the second quarter.\n\n\"This past week of stock market volatility is overdue, as we are in the early stages of this bull market, which involve sharp rallies, like we saw so far this year, that are then punctured by sharp corrections, like we are now experiencing,\" said James Demmert, chief investment officer at New York-based Main Street Research.\n\n\"These corrections are healthy,\" resetting and normalizing stock prices and setting the market up \"for another run to new highs,\" he added.\n\n5. Geopolitical risks rise in the Mideast\n\nGlobal oil prices have been weakening notably for the past month, with Brent crude futures contracts, the world benchmark, trading at the lowest levels since December.\n\nWhile some of that decline is tied to concerns that slowing U.S. growth will trigger a slump in global oil demand, traders are also factoring in the prospect of a dangerously escalating conflict between Israel and Iran.\n\nU.S. officials are urging Americans to leave Lebanon, and Israel is bracing for a possible retaliatory attack from Iran and Hezbollah following the killing of senior Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh last week in Tehran.\n\n\"Reinforcing stability and security in the region will be achieved by punishing the aggressor and creating deterrence against Israel and its adventurism,\" Nasser Kanaani, a spokesperson for Iran's Foreign Ministry, told reporters Monday.\n\n\"I reiterate and tell our enemies: We will respond and we will exact a heavy price for any act of aggression against us, from whatever quarter,\" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to the Times of Israel on Sunday.\n\nThe U.S. military, meanwhile, is upping its presence in the region even as government officials urge Netanyahu to advance cease-fire talks with Hamas.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

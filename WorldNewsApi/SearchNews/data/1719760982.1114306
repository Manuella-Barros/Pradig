Ironically, he says, the industry itself is doing excellent business, but it\u2019s a slippery slope for new, small distilleries going for a niche market, which, \u201cif not supported by consumers will go away.\u201d Let\u2019s look on the bright side, however, because there is a tumult of new bourbons (sometimes old bourbons in new bottles) from both individual producers and from the corporate brands, who, in fact, learned that \u201csmall batch\u201d and \u201creserves\u201d and \u201cspecial barrel\u201d claims by the little guys have caused the majors to come up with novelties as well, and with bigger ad budgets.(By the way, bourbon distillers have now paraphrased the food clich\u00e9 \u201cfarm to table\u201d as \u201cground to glass.\u201d Here are but a few bottlings new in the bourbon market.

Based on the idea that intense heat and humidity affects aging bourbon, Jefferson's aged its spirits ... [+] in Singapore. Jefferson's JEFFERSON\u2019S TROPICS ($100). Jefferson\u2019s founder, Trey Zoeller', having investigated maturation techniques and environments with his Ocean Aged at Sea Voyage Series, was convinced that climate could affect the maturation process more than the mash bill or barrel itself. Jefferson's Tropics Aged in Humidity depends on year-round intense heat and humidity. He found it in Singapore shipping nine containers with a combined capacity of 720 barrels of fully matured Kentucky straight bourbon to Singapore in July 2019, where they were exposed to the climate for 18 months.

It was a long wait, but with each new release, we see how our patience paid off.\u201d This spring he released two new bottled in bond bourbons in very limited supply. Howling Mob ($95), with just 31 barrels at 100 proof, using 93% corn and 7% malted barley, and Bloody Butcher ($99), made from 44 carefully selected barrels, to become an annual release.

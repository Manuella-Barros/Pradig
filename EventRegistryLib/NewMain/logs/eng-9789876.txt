will regret it' as mosques offered emergency support", "body": "Keir Starmer vowed rioters would \"regret\" engaging in \"far-right thuggery\" after a sixth day of escalating violence in England as the Government announced emergency security for mosques amid the threat of further disorder.\n\nIn a televised address to the nation, the Prime Minister condemned an attack on a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham and promised those involved in unrest would \"face the full force of the law\".\n\nSpeaking from Downing Street, Sir Keir suggested that rioters taking to the streets, and those \"whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,\" would face consequences.\n\nMeanwhile, the Home Office announced mosques would be offered greater protection under a new \"rapid response process\" designed to quickly tackle the threat of further attacks on places of worship.\n\n\"People in this country have a right to be safe, and yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques,\" the Prime Minister said on Sunday.\n\n\"Other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery.\"\n\nSir Keir indicated the response to the violence could mirror elements of how the 2011 riots were handled, at which time he was director of public prosecutions.\n\n\"We do have standing arrangements for law enforcement which means that we can get arrests, charge remanded in custody and convictions done very quickly,\" he said.\n\n\"I myself was part of that in 2011 when I was director of public prosecutions, and I'm determined we will do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice as quickly as possible.\"\n\nMinisters have suggested that courts could sit 24 hours to fast-track prosecutions - as they did in 2011 - while police forces have measures in place to draft in extra officers to tackle potential unrest.\n\nIt comes after ugly scenes of anti-immigration rioters attacking police and smashing the windows of a hotel in Rotherham on Sunday as the atmosphere turned increasingly febrile on the sixth day of unrest in England.\n\nMasked men launched lengths of wood and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside a Holiday Inn Express, with some storming past a police line and into the ground floor, which was set on fire during the disorder.\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person was already arrested and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\".\n\nStaffordshire Police warned people to stay away from the Holiday Inn, Tamworth, which was hit with \"violent acts of thuggery\" and one officer was injured.\n\nA spokesman said: \"A large group of individuals are in the area and have been throwing projectiles, smashing windows, starting fires and targeting police.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and hurled objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nIt follows similar scenes of unrest in Southport, Belfast, Hartlepool, Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Sunderland and elsewhere earlier in the week.\n\nCleveland Police has said nine arrests have been made so far.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said the deliberate torching of a hotel where people were known to be inside was \"utterly appalling\" and police have Government backing to take \"the strongest action\".\n\nThe Home Office on Sunday offered mosques greater protections as part of a new process, under which it said \"rapid security\" deployment can be requested in order to allow a return to worship as fast as possible.\n\nViolence has broken out in parts of England and Northern Ireland following the killing of three young girls in Southport on Monday, with 147 arrests made since Saturday alone.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had travelled to the UK by boat.\n\nThe far right have been widely condemned as the organising force behind the subsequent unrest, which has seen bricks pelted at police officers, community facilities including a library set on fire, mosques attacked and shops looted.\n\nMs Cooper said: \"Britain is a proud and tolerant country, and nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops or attacking people based on the colour of their skin.\n\n\"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the Government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, alongside the support from local police forces and we repeat that anyone involved in this disorder and violence will face the full force of the law.\n\n\"As a nation we will not tolerate criminal behaviour, dangerous extremism, and racist attacks that go against everything our country stands for.\"\n\nSir Keir said he wanted those who \"feel targeted because of the colour of their skin\" to know \"this violent mob do not represent our country\".\n\nIn his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nIt comes after far-right agitator Tommy Robinson was accused of stoking tensions from afar after he promoted a \"pro-UK\" rally and appeared to defend the unrest on social media while on holiday abroad.\n\nForces are bracing for further unrest, with Greater Manchester Police issuing a Section 60AA order in Bolton requiring people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\" which will stay in force until 10pm.\n\nThe widespread unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, with MPs including Ian Byrne and Dame Priti Patel saying Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots.\n\nMinisters have so far insisted police have the resources they need to respond and insisted that despite plans to release some offenders from prison early, there is capacity to hand custodial sentences to violent rioters.\n\nBut the Police Federation for England and Wales has voiced concerns that officers will be left unable to attend other incidents as they focus efforts on quelling the disorder, warning \"there is a cost to all this\".\n\nDeputy chairman of the federation Brian Booth told the PA news agency: \"Every day this continues means a certain amount of officer hours are being taken away from other policing duties. It has a massive effect on already significant under-resourcing.\"\n\nConservative leader Rishi Sunak said the scenes had \"nothing to do with the tragedy in Southport\" and warned that \"violent, criminal behaviour has no place in our society\".\n\nStephen Parkinson, Director of Public Prosecutions, said extra lawyers had been drafted in over the weekend and would continue to work round the clock to ensure justice is served.\n\nHe has directed prosecutors to make immediate charging decisions where key evidence is in place \"and they are doing so\", he said.\n\n\"I am determined that we will act swiftly and robustly, giving the courts maximum ability to pass sentences that reflect what has occurred.\"", "source": {"uri": "ludlowadvertiser.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ludlow

But it doesn't matter what apparent motivation there is. This is violence, not protest. It doesn't matter what the motivation is,\" he said.\n\nHe hit out at the \"marauding gangs intent on breaking the law or worse\", adding: \"There is no justification, none, for taking this action and all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence.\"\n\nMinisters have suggested that courts could sit 24 hours to fast-track prosecutions - as they did in 2011 - while police forces have measures in place to draft in extra officers to tackle potential unrest.\n\nIt comes as anti-immigration rioters attacked police and smashed the windows of a hotel in Rotherham as the atmosphere turned increasingly febrile on the sixth day of unrest in England.\n\nMasked men launched lengths of wood and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside a Holiday Inn Express, with some storming past a police line and into the ground floor, which was set on fire during the disorder.\n\nA police helicopter circled overhead, and at least one injured officer in riot gear was carried away.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and hurled objects at officers on Sunday afternoon.\n\nIt follows similar scenes of unrest in Southport, Belfast, Hartlepool, Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Sunderland and elsewhere earlier in the week.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said the deliberate torching of a hotel where people were known to be inside was \"utterly appalling\" and South Yorkshire Police have Government backing to take \"the strongest action\".\n\nThe Home Office on Sunday offered mosques greater protections as part of a new process, under which it said \"rapid security\" deployment can be requested in order to allow a return to worship as fast as possible.\n\nViolence has broken out in parts of England and Northern Ireland following the killing of three young girls in Southport on Monday, with 147 arrests made since Saturday alone.\n\n17-year-old Axel Rudakubana is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had travelled to the UK by boat.\n\nThe far right have been widely condemned as the organising force behind the subsequent unrest, which has seen bricks pelted at police officers, community facilities including a library set on fire, mosques attacked and shops looted.\n\nMs Cooper said: \"Britain is a proud and tolerant country, and nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops or attacking people based on the colour of their skin.\n\n\"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the Government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, alongside the support from local police forces and we repeat that anyone involved in this disorder and violence will face the full force of the law.\n\n\"As a nation we will not tolerate criminal behaviour, dangerous extremism, and racist attacks that go against everything our country stands for.\"\n\nSir Keir said he wanted those who \"feel targeted because of the colour of their skin\" to know \"this violent mob do not represent our country\".\n\nForces are bracing for further unrest, with Greater Manchester Police issuing a Section 60AA order in Bolton requiring people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\" which will stay in force until 10pm.\n\nThe widespread unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, with MPs including Ian Byrne and Dame Priti Patel saying Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots.\n\nMinisters have so far said they have been reassured by police that forces have the resources they need to respond to the violence.\n\nMeanwhile, the Muslim Council of Britain said British Muslims have been living with anxiety and fear as far-right mobs have terrorised Muslim communities across the country, attempting to attack mosques and individuals.\n\nZara Mohammed, Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \"The last week we have seen two Britains at play. The first is a mainstream, multicultural, and merciful Britain driven by hope. We saw it reflected on the streets of Southport when communities came together to clean up after protests outside a mosque. This spirit of solidarity was replicated throughout the country.\n\nThe second Britain is a fringe, fearful, and fractious Britain, driven by hatred of the other. Far-right thugs descended on Southport and elsewhere to spew hatred outside a mosque, falsely thinking the person who committed those terrible murders against the poor girls was a Muslim.\"\n\n\"What we saw on the streets of Britain the consequence of unchecked Islamophobia: acceptable, potent, and very real in our society today. The government is right to speak out against the extremism witnessed on our streets, but it has been silent on the Islamophobia fueling that extremism. Reports of terrifying Islamophobic and criminal behaviour have emerged this weekend, targeting local communities, including mosques, shops, and the police. These violent thugs have been damaging property, looting shops, and attacking innocent bystanders in what appear to be racially motivated attacks. Incidents include stabbings and smashed windows of refugee accommodations, accompanied by chants of Tommy Robinson. We commend the police for their bravery in dealing with this unprecedented level of violence and criminality. We are heartened by the hundreds who opposed this racism, protected mosques, cleaned up the streets, and reminded us of the importance of staying united.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk",

as they did in 2011 - while police forces have measures in place to draft in extra officers to tackle potential unrest.\n\nIt comes after ugly scenes of anti-immigration rioters attacking police and smashing the windows of a hotel in Rotherham on Sunday as the atmosphere turned increasingly febrile on the sixth day of unrest in England.\n\nMasked men launched lengths of wood and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside a Holiday Inn Express, with some storming past a police line and into the ground floor, which was set on fire during the disorder.\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person was already arrested and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\".\n\nMeanwhile, a group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and hurled objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nIt follows similar scenes of unrest in Southport, Belfast, Hartlepool, Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Sunderland and elsewhere earlier in the week.\n\nCleveland Police has said nine arrests have been made so far.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said the deliberate torching of a hotel where people were known to be inside was \"utterly appalling\" and police have Government backing to take \"the strongest action\".\n\nThe Home Office on Sunday offered mosques greater protections as part of a new process, under which it said \"rapid security\" deployment can be requested in order to allow a return to worship as fast as possible.\n\nViolence has broken out in parts of England and Northern Ireland following the killing of three young girls in Southport on Monday, with 147 arrests made since Saturday alone.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had travelled to the UK by boat.\n\nThe far right have been widely condemned as the organising force behind the subsequent unrest, which has seen bricks pelted at police officers, community facilities including a library set on fire, mosques attacked and shops looted.\n\nMs Cooper said: \"Britain is a proud and tolerant country, and nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops or attacking people based on the colour of their skin.\n\n\"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the Government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, alongside the support from local police forces and we repeat that anyone involved in this disorder and violence will face the full force of the law.\n\n\"As a nation we will not tolerate criminal behaviour, dangerous extremism, and racist attacks that go against everything our country stands for.\"\n\nSir Keir said he wanted those who \"feel targeted because of the colour of their skin\" to know \"this violent mob do not represent our country\".\n\nIn his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nIt comes after far-right agitator Tommy Robinson was accused of stoking tensions from afar after he promoted a \"pro-UK\" rally and appeared to defend the unrest on social media while on holiday abroad.\n\nForces are bracing for further unrest, with Greater Manchester Police issuing a Section 60AA order in Bolton requiring people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\" which will stay in force until 10pm.\n\nThe widespread unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, with MPs including Ian Byrne and Dame Priti Patel saying Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots.\n\nMinisters have so far insisted police have the resources they need to respond and insisted that despite plans to release some offenders from prison early, there is capacity to hand custodial sentences to violent rioters.\n\nBut the Police Federation for England and Wales has voiced concerns that officers will be left unable to attend other incidents as they focus efforts on quelling the disorder, warning \"there is a cost to all this\".\n\nDeputy chairman of the federation Brian Booth told the PA news agency: \"Every day this continues means a certain amount of officer hours are being taken away from other policing duties. It has a massive effect on already significant under-resourcing.\"\n\nConservative leader Rishi Sunak said the scenes had \"nothing to do with the tragedy in Southport\" and warned that \"violent, criminal behaviour has no place in our society\".\n\nStephen Parkinson, Director of Public Prosecutions, said extra lawyers had been drafted in over the weekend and would continue to work round the clock to ensure justice is served.\n\nHe has directed prosecutors to make immediate charging decisions where key evidence is in place \"and they are doing so\", he said.\n\n\"I am determined that we will act swiftly and robustly, giving the courts maximum ability to pass sentences that reflect what has occurred.\"", "source": {"uri": "kidderminstershuttle.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

It will involve relevant ministers and police representatives.\n\nSources have suggested this should be seen in the context of meetings that have already taken place, such as one between the prime minister and police chiefs last Thursday, and a meeting of senior ministers on Saturday.\n\nDuring the prime minister's televised address on Sunday, he warned those involved that they would \"regret\" taking part.\n\n\"People in this country have a right to be safe, and yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques,\" the prime minister said.\n\n\"Other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Home Office offered mosques greater protections as part of a new process, under which it said \"rapid security\" deployment can be requested in order to allow a return to worship as fast as possible.\n\nIn Rotherham, at least ten police officers were injured with one left unconscious after anti-immigration demonstrators threw planks of wood at officers and sprayed them with fire extinguishers, South Yorkshire police said.\n\nSome members of the group smashed windows to gain access to a Holiday Inn Express and a large bin was set alight.\n\nThe officer knocked unconscious suffered a head injury, the force said, adding that at least two others had suspected broken bones.\n\nHotel employees and residents, some of whom are asylum seekers, were \"terrified\", but no injuries were reported, police said.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper called the scenes \"utterly appalling\" and said police have government backing to take \"the strongest action\".\n\nAt a second hotel in Tamworth, Staffordshire, officers said they had to deal with \"violent acts of thuggery\" on Sunday evening.\n\nOne officer was injured at the site as people threw missiles, smashed windows, and started fires, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and hurled objects at officers.\n\nIn Dorset, 600 people from opposing sides gathered on the seafront in Weymouth. Officers said there had been a \"small number of low-level incidents\", with one man arrested for a public order offence.\n\nAnd in Bolton, anti-immigration protestors were confronted by a group of up to 300 masked people shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" - or \"God is greatest\".\n\nGreater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order in the town which requires people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nThe violence followed similar scenes of unrest in Southport, Belfast, Hartlepool, Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Sunderland and elsewhere earlier in the week.\n\nSir Keir indicated the response to the violence could mirror elements of how the 2011 riots were handled, at which time he was director of public prosecutions.\n\n\"We do have standing arrangements for law enforcement which means that we can get arrests... and convictions done very quickly,\" he said.\n\n\"I myself was part of that in 2011 when I was director of public prosecutions, and I'm determined we will do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice as quickly as possible.\"\n\nMinisters have suggested that courts could sit 24 hours to fast-track prosecutions - as they did in 2011 - while police forces have measures in place to draft in extra officers to tackle potential unrest.", "source": {"uri": "citinewsroom.com", "dataType": "news",

The incident sparked widespread unrest and riots in multiple cities, which were fueled by far-right groups\n\nAfter the incident, Starmer shared a post on X and wrote, \"I utterly condemn the far-right thuggery we have seen this weekend.

It is organised violent thuggery. And it has no place on our streets or online. Right now, there are attacks happening on a hotel in Rotherham. Marauding gangs intent on law-breaking. Or worse, windows smashed. Fire set ablaze,\" he added.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer further said \"there is no justification\" for the far-right violence, which has led to attacks on mosques and assaults on Muslims.\n\n\"There is no justification, none, for taking this action. And all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe. And yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted. Attacks on mosques. Other minority communities were singled out. Nazi salutes in the street. Attacks on the police.\" Starmer said.\n\nFurther, the prime minister added that \"he won't shy away from calling it [the rioting] what it is\" and that is \"far-right thuggery\".\n\n\"To those who feel targeted because of the colour of your skin or your faith, I know how frightening this must be,\" he said.\n\n\"I want you to know that this violent mob does not represent our country and we will bring them to justice. Our police deserve our support as they tackle any and all violent disorder that flares up. Whatever the apparent cause or motivation, we make no distinction. Crime is a crime and this government will tackle it,\" he added.\n\nEarlier in the day, far-right demonstrators vandalised a hotel housing asylum seekers in the northern England town of Rotherham, as the United Kingdom grappled with its worst riots in 13 years, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of people gathered at a Holiday Inn Express hotel used to house asylum seekers near Rotherham before throwing bricks at police, breaking several hotel windows, and then setting bins on fire.\n\nThe unrest is the latest bout of rioting in the UK that has gripped the nation, following a stabbing rampage at a dance class last week in the north of England that left three girls dead and several wounded, as per Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to police officials, false rumours spread online that the young man in the Southport stabbing was a Muslim and an immigrant, fuelling anger among the far-right in the country.

involved in unrest would \"face the full force of the law\".\n\nSpeaking from Downing Street, Sir Keir suggested that rioters taking to the streets, and those \"whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,\" would face consequences.\n\nSign up for newsletters from The Star\n\nMeanwhile, the Home Office announced mosques would be offered greater protection under a new \"rapid

no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery.\"\n\nSir Keir indicated the response to the violence could mirror elements of how the 2011 riots were handled, at which time he was director of public prosecutions.\n\n\"We do have standing arrangements for law enforcement which means that we can get arrests, charge remanded in custody and convictions done very quickly,\" he said.\n\n\"I myself was part of that in 2011 when I was director of public prosecutions, and I'm determined we will do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice as quickly as possible.\"\n\nMinisters have suggested that courts could sit 24 hours to fast-track prosecutions while police forces have measures in place to draft in extra officers to tackle potential unrest.\n\nIt comes as anti-immigration rioters attacked police and smashed the windows of a hotel in Rotherham on the fifth day of unrest in England .\n\nMasked men launched lengths of wood and sprayed fire extinguishers at police officers outside a Holiday Inn Express and some stormed into the hotel, with reports of a fire inside.\n\nA police helicopter circled overhead, and at least one injured officer in riot gear was carried away as the atmosphere turned febrile.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said the deliberate torching of a hotel where people were known to be inside was \"utterly appalling\" and South Yorkshire Police have Government backing to take \"the strongest action\".\n\nThe Home Office , on Sunday, offered mosques greater protections as part of a new process, under which it said \"rapid security\" deployment can be requested in order to allow a return to worship as fast as possible.\n\nMs Cooper said: \" Britain is a proud and tolerant country, and nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops or attacking people based on the colour of their skin.\n\n\"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the Government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, alongside the support from local police forces and we repeat that anyone involved in this disorder and violence will face the full force of the law.\n\n\"As a nation we will not tolerate criminal behaviour, dangerous extremism, and racist attacks that go against everything our country stands for.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

as they did in 2011 - while police forces have measures in place to draft in extra officers to tackle potential unrest.\n\nIt comes after ugly scenes of anti-immigration rioters attacking police and smashing the windows of a hotel in Rotherham on Sunday as the atmosphere turned increasingly febrile on the sixth day of unrest in England.\n\nMasked men launched lengths of wood and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside a Holiday Inn Express, with some storming past a police line and into the ground floor, which was set on fire during the disorder.\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person was already arrested and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\".\n\nMeanwhile, a group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and hurled objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nIt follows similar scenes of unrest in Southport, Belfast, Hartlepool, Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Sunderland and elsewhere earlier in the week.\n\nCleveland Police has said nine arrests have been made so far.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said the deliberate torching of a hotel where people were known to be inside was \"utterly appalling\" and police have Government backing to take \"the strongest action\".\n\nThe Home Office on Sunday offered mosques greater protections as part of a new process, under which it said \"rapid security\" deployment can be requested in order to allow a return to worship as fast as possible.\n\nViolence has broken out in parts of England and Northern Ireland following the killing of three young girls in Southport on Monday, with 147 arrests made since Saturday alone.\n\n17-year-old Axel Rudakubana is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had travelled to the UK by boat.\n\nThe far right have been widely condemned as the organising force behind the subsequent unrest, which has seen bricks pelted at police officers, community facilities including a library set on fire, mosques attacked and shops looted.\n\nMs Cooper said: \"Britain is a proud and tolerant country, and nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops or attacking people based on the colour of their skin.\n\n\"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the Government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, alongside the support from local police forces and we repeat that anyone involved in this disorder and violence will face the full force of the law.\n\n\"As a nation we will not tolerate criminal behaviour, dangerous extremism, and racist attacks that go against everything our country stands for.\"\n\nSir Keir said he wanted those who \"feel targeted because of the colour of their skin\" to know \"this violent mob do not represent our country\".\n\nForces are bracing for further unrest, with Greater Manchester Police issuing a Section 60AA order in Bolton requiring people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\" which will stay in force until 10pm.\n\nThe widespread unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, with MPs including Ian Byrne and Dame Priti Patel saying Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots.\n\nMinisters have so far insisted police have the resources they need to respond and insisted that despite plans to release some offenders from prison early, there is capacity to hand custodial sentences to violent rioters.\n\nBut the Police Federation for England and Wales has voiced concerns that officers will be left unable to attend other incidents as they focus efforts on quelling the disorder, warning \"there is a cost to all this\".\n\nDeputy chairman of the federation Brian Booth told the PA news agency: \"Every day this continues means a certain amount of officer hours are being taken away from other policing duties. It has a massive effect on already significant under-resourcing.\"\n\nConservative leader Rishi Sunak said the scenes had \"nothing to do with the tragedy in Southport\" and warned that \"violent, criminal behaviour has no place in our society\".\n\nStephen Parkinson, Director of Public Prosecutions, said extra lawyers had been drafted in over the weekend and would continue to work round the clock to ensure justice is served.\n\nHe has directed prosecutors to make immediate charging decisions where key evidence is in place \"and they are doing so\", he said.\n\n\"I am determined that we will act swiftly and robustly, giving the courts maximum ability to pass sentences that reflect what has occurred.\"", "source": {"uri": "asianimage.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asian

Addressing the nation on Sunday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer vowed rioters would regret engaging in \"far-right thuggery\" and promised those involved in unrest would \"face the full force of the law.\"\n\nMonday's meeting is due to involve relevant ministers and police representatives who will discuss the emergency services response in the coming days to ensure there is no repeat of the violent scenes. The Home Office announced on Sunday that mosques would be offered greater protection under a new \"rapid response process\" designed to quickly tackle the threat of further attacks on places of worship.\n\nA large crowd gathered outside a mosque in Middlesbrough on Sunday night and others have also been targeted. In Rotherham, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express before starting fires.\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person had already been arrested and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\". Masked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles, and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside after some 700 people gathered.\n\nA similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth into Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed. People threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nA group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nThere were 43 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said. Greater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order amid disturbances in Bolton, requiring people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nViolence has broken out in several parts of England and Northern Ireland following the killing of three young girls in Southport last week. The widespread unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, with MPs including Ian Byrne and Dame Priti Patel saying Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots.\n\nThe former first minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf said the army should be called in to stop \"thugs\" causing disorder on the streets. Ministers have so far insisted police have the resources required to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army.\n\nSir Keir said he wanted those who \"feel targeted because of the colour of their skin\" to know \"this violent mob do not represent our country.\" In his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nDame Sara Khan, who was Rishi Sunak's independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience until May, blamed the Conservative government for leaving the country open to far-right violence. She told the Guardian: \"The writing was clearly on the wall for some time.\" Writing in The Times, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said \"there will be reckoning\" for people who took part in the unrest and those who \"whipped them up on social media and in online chat forums.\n\n\"Whatever they and some of their political supporters may tell us, these are not patriots standing up for their communities. They are thugs, criminals and extremists who betray the values our country is built on.\"\n\nShe said those responsible would be \"paying the price for years to come\". Shadow minister for security Tom Tugendhat, a candidate for the leadership of the Conservatives, described the violence as \"abhorrent acts\" with no justification.\n\nWriting in the Daily Express, he called on the Government to \"get a grip\" by offering police \"all available resources\".

addressed the nation on Sunday.\n\nMonday's meeting is due to involve relevant ministers and police representatives who will discuss the response in the coming days to ensure there is no repeat of the violent scenes.\n\nThe Home Office announced on Sunday that mosques would be offered greater protection under a new \"rapid response process\" designed to quickly tackle the threat of further attacks on places of worship.\n\nA large crowd gathered outside a mosque in Middlesbrough on Sunday night and others have also been targeted.\n\nIn Rotherham, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express before starting fires.\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person had already been arrested and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\".\n\nMasked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles, and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside after some 700 people gathered.\n\nA similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth into Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed.\n\nPeople threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nA group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nThere were 43 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said.\n\nGreater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order amid disturbances in Bolton, requiring people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or

violent mob do not represent our country\".\n\nIn his message to rioters, the prime minister said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nDame Sara Khan, who was Rishi Sunak's independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience until May, blamed the Conservative government for leaving the country open to far-right violence.\n\n\"The writing was clearly on the wall for some time,\" she told the Guardian.\n\nWriting in The Times, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said \"there will

The incident sparked widespread unrest and riots in multiple cities, which were fueled by far-right groups\n\nAfter the incident, Starmer shared a post on X and wrote, \"I utterly condemn the far-right thuggery we have seen this weekend. Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law.\"\n\nIn his video message on X, he issued a stern warning to those involved in the recent violence and riots and emphasized that the full force of the law would be brought to bear on individuals who participated in the violence, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n\"Be in no doubt, those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law. The police will be making arrests, individuals will be held on remand, charges will follow and convictions will follow. I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,\" said the UK PM.\n\n\"This is not a protest. It is organised violent thuggery. And it has no place on our streets or online. Right now, there are attacks happening on a hotel in Rotherham. Marauding gangs intent on law-breaking. Or worse, windows smashed. Fire set ablaze,\" he added.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer further said \"there is no justification\" for the far-right violence, which has led to attacks on mosques and assaults on Muslims.\n\n\"There is no justification, none, for taking this action. And all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe. And yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted. Attacks on mosques. Other minority communities were singled out. Nazi salutes in the street. Attacks on the police.\" Starmer said.\n\nFurther, the prime minister added that \"he won't shy away from calling it [the rioting] what it is\" and that is \"far-right thuggery\".\n\n\"To those who feel targeted because of the colour of your skin or your faith, I know how frightening this must be,\" he said.\n\n\"I want you to know that this violent mob does not represent our country and we will bring them to justice. Our police deserve our support as they tackle any and all violent disorder that flares up. Whatever the apparent cause or motivation, we make no distinction. Crime is a crime and this government will tackle it,\" he added.\n\nEarlier in the day, far-right demonstrators vandalised a hotel housing asylum seekers in the northern England town of Rotherham, as the United Kingdom grappled with its worst riots in 13 years, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of people gathered at a Holiday Inn Express hotel used to house asylum seekers near Rotherham before throwing bricks at police, breaking several hotel windows, and then setting bins on fire.\n\nThe unrest is the latest bout of rioting in the UK that has gripped the nation, following a stabbing rampage at a dance class last week in the north of England that left three girls dead and several wounded, as per Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to police officials, false rumours spread online that the young man in the Southport stabbing was a Muslim and an immigrant, fuelling anger among the far-right in the country.

Violence broke out in several UK cities on Saturday, following a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga class for elementary school-aged girls. The incident sparked widespread unrest and riots in multiple cities, which were fueled by far-right groups.\n\nAfter the incident, Starmer shared a post on X and wrote, \"I utterly condemn the far-right thuggery we have seen this weekend. Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law.\"\n\nIn his video message on X, he issued a stern warning to those involved in the recent violence and riots and emphasized that the full force of the law would be brought to bear on individuals who participated in the violence, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n\"Be in no doubt, those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law. The police will be making arrests, individuals will be held on remand, charges will follow and convictions will follow. I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,\" said the UK PM.\n\n\"This is not a protest. It is organised violent thuggery. And it has no place on our streets or online. Right now, there are attacks happening on a hotel in Rotherham. Marauding gangs intent on law-breaking. Or worse, windows smashed. Fire set ablaze,\" he added.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer further said \"there is no justification\" for the far-right violence, which has led to attacks on mosques and assaults on Muslims.\n\n\"There is no justification, none, for taking this action. And all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe. And yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted. Attacks on mosques. Other minority communities were singled out. Nazi salutes in the street. Attacks on the police.\" Starmer said.\n\nFurther, the prime minister added that \"he won't shy away from calling it [the rioting] what it is\" and that is \"far-right thuggery\".\n\n\"To those who feel targeted because of the colour of your skin or your faith, I know how frightening this must be,\" he said.\n\n\"I want you to know that this violent mob does not represent our country and we will bring them to justice. Our police deserve our support as they tackle any and all violent disorder that flares up. Whatever the apparent cause or motivation, we make no distinction. Crime is a crime and this government will tackle it,\" he added.\n\nEarlier in the day, far-right demonstrators vandalised a hotel housing asylum seekers in the northern England town of Rotherham, as the United Kingdom grappled with its worst riots in 13 years, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of people gathered at a Holiday Inn Express hotel used to house asylum seekers near Rotherham before throwing bricks at police, breaking several hotel windows, and then setting bins on fire.\n\nThe unrest is the latest bout of rioting in the UK that has gripped the nation, following a stabbing rampage at a dance class last week in the north of England that left three girls dead and several wounded, as per Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to police officials, false rumours spread online that the young man in the Southport stabbing was a Muslim and an immigrant, fuelling anger among the far-right in the country.", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flagellation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_salute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi salute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Inn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holiday Inn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2024/08/05/2644406-httpscloudfront-us-east-2.ima-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789876", "eventUri": "eng-9789876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.607843137254902, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

A library, which provided support for one of the most deprived communities in the country, was torched in Liverpool.\n\nMasked men launched lengths of wood and sprayed fire extinguishers at police officers outside a Holiday Inn Express and some stormed into the hotel, with reports of a fire inside.\n\nA police helicopter circled overhead, and at least one injured officer in riot gear was carried away as the atmosphere turned febrile.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said the deliberate torching of a hotel where people were known to be inside was \"utterly appalling\" and South Yorkshire Police have Government backing to take \"the strongest action\".\n\nThe Home Office, on Sunday, offered mosques greater protections as part of a new process, under which it said \"rapid security\" deployment can be requested in order to allow a return to worship as fast as possible.\n\nMs Cooper said: \"Britain is a proud and tolerant country, and nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops or attacking people based on the colour of their skin.\n\n\"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the Government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, alongside the support from local police forces and we repeat that anyone involved in this disorder and violence will face the full force of the law.\n\n\"As a nation we will not tolerate criminal

scenes of criminal violence and thuggery\".\n\nVowing to deliver \"swift justice\" for the \"unacceptable disorder\", she emphasised that there would be a \"reckoning\" for the offenders, including \"serious prison sentences\" for the worst culprits.\n\n\"We simply can't stand for this,\" she told Sky News.\n\n\"So we should be clear there will be people who were thinking they were going on their summer holidays this week and instead they will face a knock on the door from the police, they will face arrest, and a police cell while they wait for trail in order to make sure that they do pay the price for what they have done.\"\n\nHundreds of people have already been arrested.\n\n\"We have made very clear to the police they have our full support in pursuing the full range of prosecutions and penalties including serious prison sentences, long term tagging travel bans and more,\" Ms Cooper added.\n\nThe full range of offenders would face justice, she added, from individuals who turned up at last minute and took part in looting to those who engaged in \"really dangerous arson, damage and criminal violence.\n\nSir Keir Starmer is expected to hold a Cobra emergency response meeting on Monday morning after far-right thugs tried to storm hotels housing asylum seekers on the sixth day of escalating disorder.\n\nThe Prime Minister vowed rioters would \"regret\" engaging in \"far-right thuggery\" and promised those involved in unrest would \"face the full force of the law\" as he addressed the nation on Sunday.\n\nMonday's meeting is due to involve relevant ministers and police representatives who will discuss the response in the coming days to ensure there is no repeat of the violent scenes.\n\nThe Home Office announced on Sunday that mosques would be offered greater protection under a new \"rapid response process\" designed to quickly tackle the threat of further attacks on places of worship.\n\nA large crowd gathered outside a mosque in Middlesbrough on Sunday night and others have also been targeted.\n\nIn Rotherham, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express before starting fires.\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person had already been arrested and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\".\n\nMasked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles, and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside after some 700 people gathered.\n\nA similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth into Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed.\n\nPeople threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nA group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nThere were 43 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said.\n\nGreater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order amid disturbances in Bolton, requiring people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nViolence has broken out in several parts of England and Northern Ireland following the killing of three young girls in Southport last week.\n\nThe widespread unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, with MPs including Ian Byrne and Dame Priti Patel saying Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots.\n\nThe former first minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf said the army should be called in to stop \"thugs\" causing disorder on the streets.\n\nMinisters have so far insisted police have the resources required to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army.\n\nSir Keir said he wanted those who \"feel targeted because of the colour of their skin\" to know \"this violent mob do not represent our country\".\n\nIn his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nDame Sara Khan, who was Rishi Sunak's independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience until May, blamed the Conservative government for leaving the country open to far-right violence.\n\n\"The writing was clearly on the wall for some time,\" she told the Guardian.\n\nWriting in The Times, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said \"there will be reckoning\" for people who took part in the unrest and those who \"whipped them up on social media and in online chat forums\".\n\n\"Whatever they and some of their political supporters may tell us, these are not patriots standing up for their communities,\" she said.\n\n\"They are thugs, criminals and extremists who betray the values our country is built on.\"\n\nShe said those responsible would be \"paying the price for years to come\".\n\nShadow minister for security Tom Tugendhat, a candidate for the leadership of the Conservatives, described the violence as \"abhorrent acts\" with no justification.\n\nWriting in the Daily Express, he called on the Government to \"get a grip\" by offering police \"all available resources\".\n\nA fundraiser launched by Stand Up To Racism, which it called an Emergency Unity Fund to \"stop the far right\" raised \u00a37,910 in its first 11 hours.",

It has a massive effect on already significant under-resourcing.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The attack sparked violent protests in several cities.\n\nAfter the incident, Starmer shared a post on X and wrote, \"I utterly condemn the far-right thuggery we have seen this weekend. Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law.\"\n\nIn his video message on X, he issued a stern warning to those involved in the recent violence and riots and emphasized that the full force of the law would be brought to bear on individuals who participated in the violence, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n\"Be in no doubt, those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law. The police will be making arrests, individuals will be held on remand, charges will follow and convictions will follow. I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,\" said the UK PM.\n\n\"This is not a protest. It is organised violent thuggery. And it has no place on our streets or online. Right now, there are attacks happening on a hotel in Rotherham. Marauding gangs intent on law-breaking. Or worse, windows smashed. Fire set ablaze,\" he added.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer further said \"there is no justification\" for the far-right violence, which has led to attacks on mosques and assaults on Muslims.\n\n\"There is no justification, none, for taking this action. And all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe. And yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted. Attacks on mosques. Other minority communities were singled out. Nazi salutes in the street. Attacks on the police.\" Starmer said.\n\nFurther, the prime minister added that \"he won't shy away from calling it [the rioting] what it is\" and that is \"far-right thuggery\".\n\n\"To those who feel targeted because of the colour of your skin or your faith, I know how frightening this must be,\" he said.\n\n\"I want you to know that this violent mob does not represent our country and we will bring them to justice. Our police deserve our support as they tackle any and all violent disorder that flares up. Whatever the apparent cause or motivation, we make no distinction. Crime is a crime and this government will tackle it,\" he added.\n\nEarlier in the day, far-right demonstrators vandalised a hotel housing asylum seekers in the northern England town of Rotherham, as the United Kingdom grappled with its worst riots in 13 years, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of people gathered at a Holiday Inn Express hotel used to house asylum seekers near Rotherham before throwing bricks at police, breaking several hotel windows, and then setting bins on fire.\n\nThe UK has recently been engulfed by a surge of violence following a heartbreaking knife attack during a dance session in North England. The attack tragically took three young lives and left several others wounded, shaking the nation to its core. The situation worsened when inaccurate information spread on the internet incorrectly pinpointed the offender of the Southport stabbing as a Muslim immigrant.

The police have our full support to deal with these criminals swiftly and they must face the full weight of the law,\" he added.\n\nEarlier, authorities reported at least 100 arrests following the eruption of violence, not only in Rotherham but across the UK, with more demonstrations planned for later on Sunday.\n\nSimilar protests are expected in Bolton, Lancaster, Middlesborough, Weymouth, and Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nMasked rioters, some draped in England flags, gathered outside the hotel, which is known to house migrants.\n\nLocal authorities are on high alert, anticipating more violent protests across the country on Sunday.\n\nThe unrest follows the tragic killing of three young girls in Southport on Monday, an event that has further strained community relations and sparked

It will involve relevant ministers and police representatives.\n\nSources have suggested this should be seen in the context of meetings that have already taken place, such as one between the prime minister and police chiefs last Thursday, and a meeting of senior ministers on Saturday.\n\nDuring the prime minister's televised address on Sunday, he warned those involved that they will \"regret\" taking part.\n\n\"People in this country have a right to be safe, and yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques,\" the prime minister said.\n\n\"Other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Home Office offered mosques greater protections as part of a new process, under which it said \"rapid security\" deployment can be requested in order to allow a return to worship as fast as possible.\n\nIn Rotherham, at least ten police officers were injured with one left unconscious after anti-immigration demonstrators threw planks of wood at officers and sprayed them with fire extinguishers, South Yorkshire police said.\n\nSome members of the group smashed windows to gain access to a Holiday Inn Express and a large bin was set alight.\n\nThe officer knocked unconscious suffered a head injury, the force said, adding that at least two others had suspected broken bones.\n\nHotel employees and residents, some of whom are asylum seekers, were \"terrified\", but no injuries were reported, police said.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper called the scenes \"utterly appalling\" and said police have government backing to take \"the strongest action\".\n\nAt a second hotel in Tamworth, Staffordshire, officers said they had to deal with \"violent acts of thuggery\" on Sunday evening.\n\nOne officer was injured at the site as people threw missiles, smashed windows, and started fires, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and hurled objects at officers.\n\nIn Dorset, 600 people from opposing sides gathered on the seafront in Weymouth. Officers said there had been a \"small number of low-level incidents\", with one man arrested for a public order offence.\n\nAnd in Bolton, anti-immigration protestors were confronted by a group of up to 300 masked people shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" - or \"God is greatest\".\n\nGreater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order in the town which requires people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nThe violence followed similar scenes of unrest in Southport, Belfast, Hartlepool, Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Sunderland and elsewhere earlier in the week.\n\nSir Keir indicated the response to the violence could mirror elements of how the 2011 riots were handled, at which time he was director of public prosecutions.\n\n\"We do have standing arrangements for law enforcement which means that we can get arrests... and convictions done very quickly,\" he said.\n\n\"I myself was part of that in 2011 when I was director of public prosecutions, and I'm determined we will do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice as quickly as possible.\"\n\nMinisters have suggested that courts could sit 24 hours to fast-track prosecutions - as they did in 2011 - while police forces have measures in place to draft in extra officers to tackle potential unrest.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news",

'Far-right thugs' also tried to storm Holiday Inn hotels housing asylum seekers.\n\nLast night (Sunday), anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express before starting fires in Rotherham. At least 10 officers were injured in the violent scenes, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police said.\n\nREAD NEXT: 'We're living in fear': As riots and protests bring havoc to UK, Manchester's religious leaders aren't surprised\n\nOne person was arrested, with police stating that others involved should 'expect us to be at their doors very soon'. Masked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles, and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside after around 700 people gathered.\n\nA similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth on Sunday night, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed. People threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nIn Middlesborough, a large crowd gathered outside a mosque. A group of rioters also smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nThere were 43 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said. In Greater Manchester over the weekend, large-scale demonstrations were held in both Manchester city centre and Bolton.\n\nA demonstration organised under the banner of 'Enough is Enough' in the city centre on Saturday became violent as attendees clashed with counter protesters and police. Fights broke out, a supermarket had to be closed and public transport was brought to a standstill.\n\nOn Sunday, a protest under the same name was held in Bolton. The arrival of around 300 counter protestors sparked chanting between the groups, with missiles thrown at police and several scuffles.\n\nAddressing the nation yesterday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer vowed rioters would 'regret' engaging in 'far-right thuggery' and promised those involved in unrest would 'face the full force of the law'. Sir Keir said he wanted those who 'feel targeted because of the colour of their skin' to know 'this violent mob do not represent our country'.\n\nIn his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nToday's Cobra meeting is due to involve relevant ministers and police representatives who will discuss the response in the coming days to ensure there is no repeat of the violent scenes. MPs, including Ian Byrne and Dame Priti Patel, have said Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons can debate the riots.\n\nThe former first minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf said the army should be called in to stop 'thugs' causing disorder on the streets. Ministers have so far insisted police have the resources required to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army.\n\nThe first of the major riots broke out in Southport last week following the tragic murder of three young girls at a school holiday dance event. Axel Rudakubana, 17, has been charged in connection with the attack.\n\nRead more of today's top stories here", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Officers said there had been a \"small number of low-level incidents\", with one man arrested for a public-order offence.\n\nAnd in Bolton, anti-immigration protestors were confronted by a group of up to 300 masked people shouting \"Allahu Akbar\", or \"God is greatest\".\n\nGreater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order in the town which requires people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nThe violence follows similar scenes of unrest in Southport, Belfast, Hartlepool, Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Sunderland and elsewhere earlier in the week.\n\nSir Keir indicated the response to the violence could mirror elements of how the 2011 riots were handled, at which time he was director of public prosecutions.\n\n\"We do have standing arrangements for law enforcement, which means that we can get arrests... and convictions done very quickly,\" he said, adding:\n\n\"I myself was part of that in 2011, when I was director of public prosecutions, and I'm determined we will do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice as quickly as possible.\"\n\nMinisters have suggested that courts could sit 24 hours to fast-track prosecutions, as they did in 2011, while police forces have measures in place to draft in extra officers to tackle potential unrest.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer vowed rioters would 'regret' engaging in \"far-right thuggery\" and promised those involved in unrest would \"face the full force of the law\" as he addressed the nation on Sunday.\n\nToday's meeting at No 10 is due to involve relevant ministers and police representatives and outline a response for the coming days to prevent further outbreaks of mob violence in towns and cities across the country, according to reports on PA. The Home Office announced at the weekend that mosques would be offered greater protection via a new 'rapid response process' designed to intercept the potential of further attacks on places of worship.\n\nSunday night saw a large crowd gather outside a mosque in Middlesbrough on and others have been targeted. In Rotherham, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express before starting fires and hurling chairs and other debris at police officers.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person had already been arrested and others involved should 'expect us to be at their doors very soon'. Masked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles, and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside after some 700 people gathered.\n\nA similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth into Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed. People threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nA group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: 'It's our f****** country.' There were 43 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said.\n\nThe widespread unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, with MPs Dame Priti Patel saying Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots. The former home secretary told Times Radio: \"I would not feel safe in some of the areas and communities where we've seen racism and thuggery on our streets.\n\n\"I grew up with people using the P-word against me. And I think some of the individuals that are now involved in this violence, disorder and racism that we are seeing in parts of the country - that's no different to the type of racism that I experienced when I was growing up, and I just think that there's no place for that in our amazing country,\" she added.\n\nGreater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order amid disturbances in Bolton, requiring people to 'remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance'. Violence has broken out in several parts of England and Northern Ireland following the killing of three young girls in Southport last week. The former first minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf said the army should be called in to stop 'thugs' causing disorder on the streets.\n\nSir Keir said he wanted those who 'feel targeted because of the colour of their skin' to know 'this violent mob do not represent our country'. A fundraiser launched by Stand Up To Racism, which it called an Emergency Unity Fund to \"stop the far right\" raised \u00a37,910 in its first 11 hours.\n\nREAD NEXT", "source": {"uri":

I want you to know that this violent mob do not represent our country and we will bring them to justice,\" he said.\n\nCleveland Police said officers have arrested nine people so far in relation to the ongoing disorder in Middlesbrough.\n\nThe force added that the main areas affected by disorder were Parliament Road, Waterloo Road, and the area around the university.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable David Felton said: \"We are urging members of the public to stay away from Middlesbrough while officers respond to violent disorder in the town.\n\n\"We have a high policing presence responding to the disorder, and the priority remains to protect people and communities.\n\n\"We will continue to make arrests and deal robustly with anyone shown to be intent on committing violence and causing harm.\"\n\nSir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: \"Everyone across the UK was shocked and appalled by the dreadful attack in Southport on Monday, which took the lives of three innocent little girls.\n\n\"Most people have come together to grieve with love and compassion. But sadly, a minority of far-right extremists have disgraced themselves by exploiting this tragedy to commit appalling acts of violence, targeting Muslims, asylum seekers and communities of colour.\n\n\"I am deeply angered by the riots and disorder that we have seen these past few days and welcome the extra protections now in place. This lawlessness is unacceptable and it must be stopped and those responsible must face the full force of the law.\n\n\"And amidst these awful scenes, we should all take heart from the immense compassion, kindness and decency shown by the vast majority, not least those communities who are being specifically targeted. Their example is one we must all follow.\"\n\nRishi Sunak, the Conservative Party leader, has condemned the unrest gripping Britain as \"violent, criminal behaviour that has no place in our society\".\n\n\"The police have our full support to deal with these criminals swiftly and they must face the full weight of the law,\" he added.\n\nMore from Crime Editor Martin Evans on the ongoing disorder in Middlesbrough:\n\nMosques will now be able to request \"rapid response\" security under a new security scheme just announced by the Home Office.\n\nThe plans state that mosques, police and local authorities can ask for rapid security personnel to be deployed, which will \"allow for a return to worship as quickly as possible\".\n\nIn a statement, the Home Office said the scheme would \"build on the existing Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, with up to \u00a329.4 million already available this year to fund security at mosques and Muslim faith schools\".\n\nYvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, said: \"Britain is a proud and tolerant country, and nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops or attacking people based on the colour of their skin.\n\n\"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, alongside the support from local police forces and we repeat that anyone involved in this disorder and violence will face the full force of the law.\n\n\"As a nation we will not tolerate criminal behaviour, dangerous extremism, and racist attacks that go against everything our country stands for.\"\n\nBy Crime Editor Martin Evans\n\nElon Musk, the Tesla and X chief, has said that civil war in the UK is \"inevitable\".\n\nResponding to a clip posted on social media showing recent rioting in Britain, Mr Musk wrote: \"Civil war is inevitable.\"\n\nThe comment received over one million views.\n\nYvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, has condemned the attack on a migrant hotel in Rotherham, calling it \"utterly appalling\".\n\n\"South Yorkshire Police have full Government support for the strongest action against those responsible,\" she added.\n\nThe BBC reports that a group of around 250-300 protesters chanting \"Allahu Akbar\" has clashed with police and Right-wing demonstrators in Bolton.\n\nAccording to the broadcaster, the group charged towards Bolton Town Hall, where protesters waving England flags had gathered.\n\nOn a further cry of \"Allahu Akbar\", the group began throwing eggs at the police before \"charging\" around streets in the town centre.\n\nThe two groups of protesters then skirmished on another street, where bottles and fireworks were exchanged, but both sides were kept apart by police lines.\n\nBy Crime Editor Martin Evans\n\nMalaysia has issued a warning to its citizens travelling to or residing in the UK, advising them to \"remain vigilant\" and to \"stay away from protest areas\".\n\nThe warning, released on Sunday by the country's ministry of foreign affairs, also encourages Malaysian citizens to register with the country's high commission in London in order to receive assistance and information.\n\nHumza Yousaf, the former first minister of Scotland, has suggested that Sir Keir Starmer should send in the army to quell rioting across Britain.\n\nIn a post on X, Mr Yousaf wrote: \"How much worse does it have to get before the army is sent in @Keir Starmer?\n\n\"The Police clearly do not have a handle on this situation. This pogrom against Muslims and People of Colour is going to cost lives unless these far-right thugs are stopped.\"\n\nJames Cleverly, the MP for Braintree, and Tom Tugendhat, the MP for Tonbridge, have condemned the attack on a migrant hotel in Rotherham.\n\nIn a post on X, Mr Tugendhat wrote: \"This behaviour is abhorrent. We have got to put an end to the violence and disorder plaguing our streets. The government must use all the available resources to punish those responsible.\"\n\nMr Cleverly wrote: \"There is not and can never be any excuse, justification or rationale for behavior like this. This should be condemned by everybody, and those taking part should expect to be met with the full weight of the law.\"\n\nBy Martin Evans, our crime editor\n\nMore than 300 protesters marched through Middlesbrough after gathering at the city's Cenotaph.\n\nDemonstrators were seen carrying a banner saying: \"Tom Jones is Welsh, Axel Rudakubana isn't\" and chanted \"We want our country back\" as they made their way through the city.\n\nPolice used dogs to keep the group back and at least two people were taken away in handcuffs within the first half hour, while several pieces of slate were thrown, along with vapes and full plastic bottles.\n\nOur reporter Kevin Donald is on the ground in Middlesbrough. He reports that \"skirmishes\" have broken out between police and agitators.\n\nSarah Champion, the Labour MP for Rotherham, has described the ongoing riot at a migrant hotel in Manvers, Rotherham as \"horrendous\" in a post on social media.\n\nBy Crime Editor Martin Evans\n\nSocial media footage shows rioters battling with mounted police on the streets of Bolton.\n\nGreater Manchester Police earlier issued a Section 34 dispersal notice covering Bolton until 10pm, which gives the force extra powers to remove people causing anti-social behaviour.\n\nGreater Manchester Police said a section 34 dispersal notice has been authorised covering Bolton until 10pm on Sunday.\n\nUnder a Section 34 notice, officers have extra powers to deal with anyone causing anti-social behaviour in defined areas.\n\nThe force said officers will be able to instruct anyone who is causing - or very likely to cause - harassment, alarm, or distress to leave an area immediately.\n\nChief Inspector Natasha Evans said: \"These powers have been authorised in response to increased protest activity.\n\n\"We have been working with organisers of pre-planned protests to help facilitate peaceful and lawful protests, to prevent serious disruption and ensure everyone can go about their lives without fear or risk of harm.\n\n\"We will continue to have an increased police presence around these areas to deal with any incidents that may arise, and with these additional powers, officers are more equipped to intervene early to ensure people feel safe and are safe.\"\n\nProtesters have gathered outside the Holiday Inn Express in Manvers, Rotherham, which has been used as an asylum hotel.\n\nBoth anti-immigration protesters and counter-protesters have been pictured outside the hotel in South Yorkshire (see our posts at 12.47pm and 12.07pm).\n\nThe number of protesters is not as large as was seen during Saturday's protests, but there is a police presence at the scene.\n\nTory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick has said that Sir Keir Starmer should \"cancel this Nero-esque holiday\".\n\nIt would be \"completely wrong for the Prime Minister to holiday while parts of Britain are burning\", Mr Jenrick added.\n\nThe comments came after reports circulated that Sir Keir Starmer was set to take his first holiday as Prime Minister at the start of next week.\n\nHowever, sources close to No 10 have suggested to the PA news agency that Sir Keir will not be going on holiday with the prospect of further unrest looming.\n\nSpellow Hub library on County Road in Liverpool was set ablaze during far-Right rioting on Saturday (see our posts at 9.29am and 9.54am).\n\nMerseyside Police said that protesters attempted to stop firefighters at the scene putting out the blaze.\n\nStreet cleaning teams in Hull worked overnight to ensure the city would be open for business on Sunday, the city council said.\n\nVolunteers also arrived with brushes early on Sunday morning to assist the council crews.\n\nCouncillor Jack Haines of Hull City Council said: \"Yesterday we saw the worst of Hull but already today we have seen the best.\n\n\"The cleaning teams have made fantastic progress overnight. The main streets are largely clear and the interchange has reopened.\n\n\"We have already seen the power in our community with volunteers turning up from 7am this morning with brushes to assist council teams. I thank all volunteers and council staff.\n\n\"With the clean-up largely completed and areas clear, the best way anyone can help today is to come together, enjoy our city and support local shops and business.\"\n\nCleveland Police has denied rumours circulating online that a Muslim woman was attacked with acid in Middlesbrough during unrest on Saturday.\n\nThe force said it had not received \"any formal complaint\" from a victim or anyone on their behalf. It also said it had not received notification from medical colleagues of any such incident.\n\nOn Saturday, reports of the attack were shared on social media by Nick Lowles, chief executive of Left-wing group Hope not Hate, and Josh Fenton-Glynn, the Labour MP for Calder Valley.\n\n\"Reports are coming in of acid being thrown out of a car window at a Muslim woman in Middlesbrough. Absolutely horrendous,\" Mr Lowles posted on X.\n\nIn response to Mr Lowles' post, Mr Fenton-Glynn wrote: \"Far right cowards attacking women. When people show you who they are, believe them.\"\n\nBoth Mr Lowles and Mr Fenton-Glynn have since retracted their statements.\n\nThe owner of King Vape Store on County Road in Liverpool reviews CCTV footage of looters swarming around his shop and ransacking his stock.\n\nA cafe and a supermarket in south Belfast were badly damaged following unrest in the city on Saturday.\n\nCars were also set on fire as police attempted to deal with disorder in the Donegall Road area, which lasted through the night and into Sunday morning.\n\nThe supermarket's manager, Bashir, said that the Islamic community was being targeted.\n\n\"People attacked this place, racism against Islam and Muslims, especially the Muslim community,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"All of that happened and the police did nothing, I am telling you the truth.\n\n\"What kind of police are letting the people burn everything down?\"\n\nThere is \"no need\" to bring in the army to deal with unrest in parts of the UK, a Home Office minister has said.\n\nDame Diana Johnson, the policing minister, told BBC News: \"There is no need to bring in the Army and there has been no discussion about that.\n\n\"As I say, the police have made it very clear that they have all the resources they need at the moment... they have the powers that they need.\"\n\nAsked about the spread of misinformation online, Dame Diana added: \"Obviously we need to do more because you're absolutely right there has been that spread of misinformation which has caused problems this week.\"\n\nA police leader has condemned the recent rioting and violence against police officers.\n\nTiffany Lynch, from the Police Federation of England and Wales, said on BBC Breakfast: \"It is an abhorrent, senseless act of violence against our police officers, towards our public buildings who are there to serve the community.\n\n\"[These acts are those of] a small minority and it doesn't represent the community of Great Britain. It is absolutely abhorrent.\"\n\nMs Lynch also said that everyday crime fighting would suffer due to police officers being redirected to tackle the riots (see our post at 9.41am).\n\nPolice forces across the UK will struggle to attend everyday crime incidents while officers are redirected to tackle rioting, a police leader told the BBC.\n\nTiffany Lynch, from the Police Federation of England and Wales, said on BBC Breakfast: \"We're seeing officers that are being pulled from day-to-day policing to... go out there and essentially protect our communities.\n\n\"But while that's happening, the communities that are out there that are having incidents against them - victims of crime - unfortunately, their crimes are not being investigated.\n\n\"We're not going to be able to attend all of the incidents that are coming in on the 999s because we're having to direct the priorities of what's happening on the streets.\"\n\nRioters torched Liverpool's new Spellow Hub Library in the Walton area of the city on Saturday.\n\nMerseyside Police said agitators prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.\n\nPolice forces across the UK arrested more than 90 people in connection with anti-immigration rioting on Saturday.\n\nMerseyside Police said a total of 23 people were arrested, including 12 arrests for the disorder in the city centre, nine arrests for the disorder on County Road and two in connection with the unrest in Southport.\n\nIn Hull, Humberside Police said they had arrested 20 people.\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre.\n\nLancashire Police said more than 20 people were arrested and dispersal orders were issued in parts of Blackpool, Preston and Blackburn.\n\nStaffordshire Police said 10 people were arrested following disorder in Stoke-on-Trent.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims",

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nKeir Starmer will hold a Cobra emergency response meeting in Downing Street today after \"thugs\" tried to storm hotels housing asylum seekers on the sixth day of escalating disorder. The Prime Minister addressed the nation on Sunday and has vowed that the rioters would \"regret\" engaging in \"far-right thuggery\" and promised those involved in unrest would \"face full force of the law\".\n\nMonday's meeting will bring together relevant ministers and police representatives to discuss the response that will follow in the next few days to ensure there is no repeat of the violent scenes. The Home Office announced on Sunday that mosques would be offered greater protection under a new \"rapid response process\" designed to quickly tackle the threat of further attacks on places of worship.\n\nIn Rotherham, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express before starting fires. At least 10 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later. The force said one person had already been arrested and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\".\n\nMasked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles, and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside after some 700 people gathered.\n\nA similar incident occurred at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth into Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed. People threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nA group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\" There were 43 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said.\n\nThis unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, with MPs including Ian Byrne and Dame Priti Patel saying Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots.\n\nDame Priti told Times Radio: \"I would not feel safe in some of the areas and communities where we've seen racism and thuggery on our streets. I grew up with people using the P-word against me.\n\n\"And I think some of the individuals that are now involved in this violence, disorder and racism that we are seeing in parts of the country - that's no different to the type of racism that I experienced when I was growing up, and I just think that there's no place for that in our amazing country.\"\n\nThe Tory MP said that claims that there is \"two-tier policing\" in Britain, where right-wing protests are dealt with more harshly than left-wing ones, are \"not correct\".\n\nGreater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order amid disturbances in Bolton, requiring people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nThe former First Minister of Scotland, Humza Yousaf, said the army should be called in to stop \"thugs\" causing disorder on the streets. Ministers have insisted police have the resources required to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army.\n\nSir Keir said he wanted those who \"feel targeted because of the colour of their skin\" to know \"this violent mob do not represent our country\". In his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nDame Sara Khan, who was Rishi Sunak's independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience until May, blamed the Conservative government for leaving the country open to far-right violence. \"The writing was clearly on the wall for some time,\" she told the Guardian.\n\nWriting in The Times, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said \"there will be reckoning\" for whoever took part in the unrest and those who \"whipped them up on social media and in online chat forums\".\n\nShe said: \"Whatever they and some of their political supporters may tell us, these are not patriots standing up for their communities. They are thugs, criminals and extremists who betray the values our country is built on.\"\n\nShadow minister for security Tom Tugendhat, a candidate for the leadership of the Conservatives, described the violence as \"abhorrent acts\" with no justification. Writing in the Daily Express, he called on the Government to \"get a grip\" by offering police \"all available resources\".\n\nA fundraiser launched by Stand Up To Racism, which it called an Emergency Unity Fund to \"stop the far right\" raised \u00a37,910 in its first 11 hours.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

The disorder has been fuelled by an online misinformation campaign since an attack a week ago left three young girls dead. The far right falsely accused the suspect of being a Muslim migrant to stoke anti-immigrant and Islamophobic sentiment.\n\nSpeaking from Downing Street, Mr Starmer described the riots as \"far-right thuggery\" and said those who took part will face \"the full force of the law.\"\n\nThe prime minister will today hold an emergency Cobra meeting with senior ministers and police chiefs, according to a government official.\n\nThe prime minster is preparing emergency court sittings, getting prosecutors to work longer hours and weekends to process cases, and the redeployment of police if necessary.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper announced additional measures to protect the mosques and pledged \"full backing\" for the police in dealing with the unrest. \"Anyone who gets involved in criminal disorder and violent thuggery on our streets will have to pay the price,\" she said in a video posted to X.\n\nIn Rotherham, South Yorkshire, rioters on Sunday attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers and started a fire, injuring around a dozen police officers. Around 150 arrests have been made in England's worst rioting in over a decade.\n\nAbout 700 people gathered outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, before clashing with police. Some rioters hurled pieces of wood, bottles and chairs, and sprayed fire extinguishers at police officers.\n\nSouth Yorkshire police said at least 10 officers had been injured, including one who was left unconscious with a head injury.\n\nFootage from the scene showed a bin on fire and people, some draped in St George and union flags, chanting: \"Get them out.\" The demonstrators appeared at one point to storm into the hotel, with reports of a fire inside, and people peering out of windows.\n\nProtests at the Holiday Inn Express began at midday, immediately turning into a riot when a mob of far-right individuals, mostly men, smashed windows and set a stairwell in the building alight, temporarily overwhelming police.\n\nShabnam Shabir, who came as part of a group of counter-protesters, said she had been left traumatised after her group was surrounded by the mob, who chanted racist words. \"It was a lot of angry, angry, angry far right,\" she said. \"This is very scary.\"\n\nShe was left stranded in her car outside the hotel, unable to leave until the rioters did. \"And we have people inside of the hotel who are scared for their lives so it's terrifying.\"\n\nTensions have been rising since the stabbing attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in Southport, near Liverpool, on July 29th. Police have said the suspect, Axel Rudakubana (17) was born in Britain in an attempt to counter false claims spread on social media that he was a Muslim migrant.\n\nAround 300 people were involved in disturbances in the Walton area of Liverpool on Saturday night, according to Merseyside Police. The force, also responsible for Southport, said that a local convenience store was set on fire and that a library was damaged, while firefighters who attended to the scene had a missile thrown at their vehicle.\n\nIn Hull, demonstrators gathered outside a hotel that houses asylum seekers, a number of windows were smashed and bottles thrown. In videos uploaded to social media many of the protesters can be heard chanting \"stop the boats,\" a reference to crossings made from the European Continent by migrants attempting to get to Britain.\n\nMany police forces across the country have issued so-called dispersal orders to try to break up and deter rioters. There were also disturbances in Leicester, Stoke-on Trent, Nottingham, Manchester and Middlesbrough, as well as Belfast in Northern Ireland. - Agencies", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com",

windows of the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham before starting fires.\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person had already been arrested and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\".\n\nMasked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles, and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside.\n\nSome 700 people had gathered, the force said.\n\nA similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth into the evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed.\n\nPeople threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nA group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nThere were 35 arrests, and significant

saying Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots.\n\nThe former first minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf said the army should be called in to stop \"thugs\" causing disorder on the streets.\n\nMinisters have so far insisted police have the resources they need to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army.\n\nSir Keir said he wanted those who \"feel targeted because of the colour of their skin\" to know \"this violent mob do not represent our country\".\n\nIn his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nDame Sara Khan, who was Rishi Sunak's independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience until May, blamed the Conservative government for leaving the country open to far-right violence.\n\n\"The writing was clearly on the wall for some time,\" she told the

More info\n\nKeir Starmer has warned rioters they will \"regret\" their actions, branding them as \"far-right thuggery\", following a sixth consecutive day of escalating violence across England. The Government has also announced emergency security measures for mosques in response to the threat of further disorder.\n\nIn a national televised address, the Prime Minister condemned an attack on a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham and assured that those involved in the unrest would \"face the full force of the law\".\n\nAddressing the nation from Downing Street, Sir Keir suggested that those inciting riots on the streets and those \"whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,\" would face repercussions.\n\nRead more: Shocking scenes in Middlesbrough in 19 pictures as disorder breaks out when protest turns to violence Keep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter\n\nIn the meantime, the Home Office has announced that mosques will be provided with enhanced protection under a new \"rapid response process\" aimed at swiftly addressing the threat of further attacks on places of worship.\n\n\"People in this country have a right to be safe, and yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques,\" the Prime Minister stated on Sunday.\n\n\"Other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery.\"\n\nSir Keir hinted that the response to the violence could reflect elements of how the 2011 riots were managed, during which time he served as director of public prosecutions.\n\n\"We do have standing arrangements for law enforcement which means that we can get arrests, charge remanded in custody and convictions done very quickly,\" he added.\n\n\"I myself was part of that in 2011 when I was director of public prosecutions, and I'm determined we will do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice as quickly as possible.\"\n\nGovernment officials have hinted at the possibility of courts operating round-the-clock to expedite prosecutions a measure previously implemented in 2011 while police forces are prepared to call in additional officers to manage potential disturbances.\n\nThis follows the disturbing scenes witnessed in Rotherham on Sunday, where anti-immigration rioters attacked police and vandalised a hotel's windows. The situation escalated on the sixth day of unrest across England.\n\nMasked individuals were seen hurling pieces of wood and discharging fire extinguishers at officers stationed outside a Holiday Inn Express. Some managed to breach the police line and enter the ground floor of the building, which was subsequently set ablaze.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police later confirmed that at least 10 officers sustained injuries, with one losing consciousness. They also reported one arrest and warned those involved to \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\".\n\nIn Middlesbrough, another group of rioters damaged residential and vehicle windows and threw objects at police on Sunday afternoon. One individual was heard shouting a racial slur, while another told officers: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nThese incidents follow similar outbreaks of disorder in Southport, Belfast, Hartlepool, Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Sunderland and other locations earlier in the week.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper expressed her horror at the intentional arson of a hotel with people inside, branding it \"utterly appalling\" and affirming that the police have full government support to take \"the strongest action\".\n\nIn response to the recent events, the Home Office announced on Sunday a new initiative offering \"rapid security\" measures to mosques, aiming for a swift resumption of worship services.\n\nFollowing the tragic deaths of three young girls in Southport on Monday, unrest has erupted in parts of England and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe far-right elements orchestrating the chaos have faced widespread condemnation. The violence has included hurling bricks at law enforcement, setting community buildings like libraries ablaze, assaulting mosques, and looting retail stores.\n\nMs Cooper stated: \"Britain is a proud and tolerant country, and nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops or attacking people based on the colour of their skin.\"\n\n\"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the Government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, alongside the support from local police forces and we repeat that anyone involved in this disorder and violence will face the full force of the law.\"\n\n\"As a nation we will not tolerate criminal behaviour, dangerous extremism, and racist attacks that go against everything our country stands for.\"", "source": {"uri":

The U.K.'s Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday condemned the violence as \"far-right thuggery,\" pledging swift prosecution of those involved.\n\nHundreds of extremist demonstrators have attacked police and set fire to mosques and shops, with hundreds of masked individuals rampaging through city centers.\n\nIn the northern English town of Rotherham on Sunday, a mob of hundreds of people attacked a hotel that was housing asylum seekers. The rioters assaulted police protecting the hotel, smashing windows and then trying to set it on fire. At least 10 police officers were injured, South Yorkshire Police said, calling the violence \"deplorable.\"\n\n\"We absolutely condemn the scenes of disorder we witnessed, with a total of around 700 people in attendance,\" the police added.\n\nSeveral small fires were started, but South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Services \"worked to extinguish these quickly,\" according to officials.\n\nA heavy police presence was expected to stay outside the hotel and the surrounding area for the rest of Sunday evening and into Monday, according to the police.\n\nSouth of Rotherham, another hotel in Tamworth, England, was targeted by rioters. Police in the area urged the public to stay away while they worked on controlling the situation. One officer was injured, the police said Sunday night.\n\n\"We're urging members of the public to avoid the area around the Holiday Inn, Tamworth, as specialist officers continue to deal with violent acts of thuggery,\" Tamworth Police said in an update Sunday evening local time.\n\nOn Saturday, police said they rescued a Black man in Manchester who was being kicked and punched as dozens of men surrounded him. In Sunderland, hundreds of Muslim men gathered to protect a local mosque as groups of individuals targeted the religious building.\n\nPrime Minister Starmer held crisis talks on Saturday with his government discussing measures to shut down the violence.\n\nStarmer released a statement Sunday condemning the violence and vowing to \"do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice.\"\n\n\"I utterly condemn the far-right thuggery we have seen this weekend,\" Starmer said. \"Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law,\" he added.\n\n\"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,\" Starmer said. \"This is not a protest, it is organized, violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets or online.\"\n\nStarmer said more arrests would follow and prosecutions would be swift. The government is moving to have courts open 24 hours a day to rapidly process the arrested. The government has also offered increased protection for mosques.\n\nU.K. authorities have accused far-right groups of coordinating the violence. Following the deadly knife attack in Southport, far-right groups and commentators quickly spread false claims on social media, particularly X, that the attacker was a Muslim migrant who crossed illegally on the so-called \"small boats\" from Europe.\n\nHowever, Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, a 17-year-old boy from Banks, a coastal village in Lancashire, just outside Southport, was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder, police said. The suspect was born in Cardiff, Wales, police said.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The incident sparked widespread unrest and riots in multiple cities, which were fueled by far-right groups\n\nAlso Read | Bangladesh Unrest: 76, Including 13 Police Officers Killed As Fresh Protests Rock Nation (See Pics).\n\nhttps://x.com/keir_starmer/status/1820135066711761047?s=46&t=WnjyJyC971ItJhbOMQlj-Q\n\nAfter the incident, Starmer shared a post on X and wrote, \"I utterly condemn the far-right thuggery we have seen this weekend. Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law.\"\n\nAlso Read | Nepal Road Accident: Woman Killed, 4 Others Injured As Tractor Carrying Bolbom Festival Pilgrims Returning From India Falls Into Canal in Sarlahi District.\n\nIn his video message on X, he issued a stern warning to those involved in the recent violence and riots and emphasized that the full force of the law would be brought to bear on individuals who participated in the violence, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n\"Be in no doubt, those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law. The police will be making arrests, individuals will be held on remand, charges will follow and convictions will follow. I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,\" said the UK PM.\n\n\"This is not a protest. It is organised violent thuggery. And it has no place on our streets or online. Right now, there are attacks happening on a hotel in Rotherham. Marauding gangs intent on law-breaking. Or worse, windows smashed. Fire set ablaze,\" he added.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer further said \"there is no justification\" for the far-right violence, which has led to attacks on mosques and assaults on Muslims.\n\n\"There is no justification, none, for taking this action. And all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe. And yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted. Attacks on mosques. Other minority communities were singled out. Nazi salutes in the street. Attacks on the police.\" Starmer said.\n\nFurther, the prime minister added that \"he won't shy away from calling it [the rioting] what it is\" and that is \"far-right thuggery\".\n\n\"To those who feel targeted because of the colour of your skin or your faith, I know how frightening this must be,\" he said.\n\n\"I want you to know that this violent mob does not represent our country and we will bring them to justice. Our police deserve our support as they tackle any and all violent disorder that flares up. Whatever the apparent cause or motivation, we make no distinction. Crime is a crime and this government will tackle it,\" he added.\n\nEarlier in the day, far-right demonstrators vandalised a hotel housing asylum seekers in the northern England town of Rotherham, as the United Kingdom grappled with its worst riots in 13 years, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of people gathered at a Holiday Inn Express hotel used to house asylum seekers near Rotherham before throwing bricks at police, breaking several hotel windows, and then setting bins on fire.\n\nThe unrest is the latest bout of rioting in the UK that has gripped the nation, following a stabbing rampage at a dance class last week in the north of England that left three girls dead and several wounded, as per Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to police officials, false rumours spread online that the young man in the Southport stabbing was a Muslim and an immigrant, fuelling anger among the far-right in the country.

"British prime ministerKeir Starmer vowed rioters would \"regret\" engaging in \"far-right thuggery\" and promised those involved in unrest would \"face the full force of the law\" as he addressed the nation on Sunday.\n\nMonday's meeting is due to involve relevant ministers and police representatives who will discuss the response in the coming days to ensure there is no repeat of the violent scenes.\n\nThe UK's home pffice announced on Sunday that mosques would be offered greater protection under a new \"rapid response process\" designed to quickly tackle the threat of further attacks on places of worship.\n\nA large crowd gathered outside a mosque in Middlesbrough on Sunday night and others have also been targeted.\n\nIn Rotherham, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express before starting fires.\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person had already been arrested and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\".\n\nMasked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles, and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside after some 700 people gathered.\n\nA similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth into Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed.\n\nPeople threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nA group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nThere were 43 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said.\n\nGreater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order amid disturbances in Bolton, requiring people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nViolence has broken out in several parts of England and Northern Ireland following the killing of three young girls in Southport last week.\n\nI guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder\n\nThe widespread unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Mr Starmer's premiership, with MPs including Ian Byrne and Dame Priti Patel saying the UK parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots.\n\nThe former first minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf said the army should be called in to stop \"thugs\" causing disorder on the streets.\n\nMinisters have so far insisted police have the resources required to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army.\n\nStarmer said he wanted those who \"feel targeted because of the colour of their skin\" to know \"this violent mob do not represent our country\".\n\nIn his message to rioters he said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nSara Khan, who was Rishi Sunak's independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience until May, blamed the Conservative government for leaving the country open to far-right violence.\n\n\"The writing was clearly on the wall for some time,\" she told the Guardian.\n\nWriting in The Times, UK home secretary Yvette Cooper said \"there will be reckoning\" for people who took part in the unrest and those who \"whipped them up on social media and in online chat forums\".\n\n\"Whatever they and some of their political supporters may tell us, these are not patriots standing up for their communities,\" she said.\n\n\"They are thugs, criminals and extremists who betray the values our country is built on.\"\n\nShe said those responsible would be \"paying the price for years to come\".\n\nShadow minister for security Tom Tugendhat, a candidate for the leadership of the Conservatives, described the violence as \"abhorrent acts\" with no justification.\n\nWriting in the Daily Express, he called on the Government to \"get a grip\" by offering police \"all available resources\".\n\nA fundraiser

into the night after demonstrators tried to storm hotels housing asylum seekers on the sixth day of escalating disorder.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer vowed rioters would \"regret\" engaging in \"far-right thuggery\", and promised those involved in unrest would \"face the full force of the law\".\n\nAnti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham before starting fires.\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person had already been arrested and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\".\n\nMasked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles, and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside.\n\nSome 700 people had gathered, the force said.\n\nA similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth into the evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed.\n\nPeople threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nA group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers yesterday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our country.\"\n\nThere were 35 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said.\n\nGreater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order amid disturbances in Bolton, requiring people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nViolence has broken out in several parts of England and Northern Ireland following the killing of three young girls in Southport last week.\n\nThe widespread unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Mr Starmer's leadership, with MPs including Ian Byrne and Priti Patel saying parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots.\n\nThe former first minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf said the army should be called in to stop \"thugs\" causing disorder on the streets.\n\nMinisters have so far insisted police have the resources they need to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army.\n\nMr Starmer said he wanted those who \"feel targeted because of the colour of their skin\" to know \"this violent mob do not represent our country\".\n\nIn his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nSara Khan, who was Rishi Sunak's independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience until May, blamed the Conservative government for leaving the country open to far-right violence.\n\n\"The writing was clearly on the wall for some time,\" she told the Guardian.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper will appear on news programmes on Monday morning, where she is likely to be asked how the government plans to tackle the continued disorder.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

standing arrangements for law enforcement which means that we can get arrests, charge remanded in custody and convictions done very quickly,\" he said.\n\n\"I myself was part of that in 2011 when I was director of public prosecutions, and I'm determined we will do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice as quickly as possible.\"\n\nMinisters have suggested that courts could sit 24

South Yorkshire Police have Government backing to take \"the strongest action\".\n\nThe Home Office, on Sunday, offered mosques greater protections as part of a new process, under which it said \"rapid security\" deployment can be requested in order to allow a return to worship as fast as possible.\n\nMs Cooper said: \"Britain is a proud and tolerant country, and nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops or attacking people based on the colour of their

Hundreds of police officers have been injured in clashes with thugs, as far-right activists led the way in attacking police officers, mosques and hotels thought to house asylum seekers this week.\n\nIslamophobic chants were heard and in some areas of the country rioters were filmed stopping cars and interrogating drivers about whether they were 'white and English'. Speaking ahead of the Cobra meeting, the Home Secretary said the Government is not recalling Parliament 'right now': 'That's not what we're doing right now. What we're doing right now is keeping in close contact with MPs.'\n\nCommunities are now coming together to begin the massive clean-up operation in areas including Rotherham, Middlesbrough and Tamworth. In response, the Home Office announced on Sunday that mosques would be offered greater protection under a new 'rapid response process' designed to quickly tackle the threat of further attacks on places of worship. A large crowd gathered outside a mosque in Middlesbrough on Sunday night and others have also been targeted.\n\nOn Saturday night Spellow Lane Library in Liverpool was torched while in Sunderland local travel agents Hays Travel, known for its commitment to raising money for charity, had its storefront smashed. In Rotherham, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express before starting fires in an apparent attempt to set the building alight while dozens of people were inside it.\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured there, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person had already been arrested and others involved should 'expect us to be at their doors very soon'. Masked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles, and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside after some 700 people gathered.\n\nIslamophobic and racist chants were heard at multiple riots across the country, with images appearing to show some members of the mobs performing Nazi salutes. A similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth into Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed. People threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nA group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: 'It's our [Expletive] country.' Video footage showed groups of youths and young men running from house to house and smashing windows and cars parked outside, throwing bricks, traffic cones and other objects.\n\nAnd footage from a local park appeared to show a group of white men and boys with faces covered surrounding and attacking a group, with violence erupting before they fled the scene. Nearby, a Muslim leader at a mosque told community members who had turned out to protect their place of worship to 'show the world what Muslims are really like'. Addressing far-right violence in the town, he said: 'They are doing all the wrong things. We don't want to be part of it.'\n\nOther local Muslims were seen carrying tea and coffee to police officers on the front line of the town amid fierce violence from the far-right. There were 43 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said. Greater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order amid disturbances in Bolton, requiring people to 'remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance'. And in Weymouth, police said three people were arrested and dispersal orders put in place for several teenagers.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Reuters\n\nIn recent days, the United Kingdom has experienced a wave of violent protests and unrest, sparked by the stabbing of three young girls in Southport. These incidents have escalated into targeted attacks against hotels housing asylum seekers, resulting in widespread violence and damage.\n\nThe situation has been described as the worst social unrest the country has seen since the 2011 riots.\n\nAround 700 far-right protesters, clad in balaclavas and waving St George's flags, stormed the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. They clashed with police officers who were attempting to protect the hotel and its occupants. The rioters threw chairs, wooden planks, and other objects, set fires, and used fire extinguishers against the officers.\n\nAt least 10 police officers were injured, with one left unconscious and another suffering a suspected fractured elbow. The protesters also breached the hotel, smashing windows and causing significant damage. Some occupants of the hotel were seen looking out at the chaos from the windows, though it remains unclear if they were able to evacuate safely.\n\nIn another incident, in Tamworth, rioters also targeted a hotel housing asylum seekers. Protesters there threw projectiles, smashed windows, and started fires. The situation in both locations was described by Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield as involving \"marauding gangs intent on law-breaking,\" leaving \"terrified residents and staff\" inside the hotels, reported UK's Daily Mail.\n\nHow has the government responded?\n\nThe violent actions have been strongly condemned by government officials and public figures. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed the nation, denouncing the far-right violence as \"far-right thuggery\" and promised that those involved would face \"the full force of the law.\"\n\nHe stated that the actions of these violent rioters do not represent the country, saying, \"People in this country have a right to be safe, and yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric.\"\n\nUK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed these sentiments, describing the events as \"utterly appalling.\" She stated, \"Nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs, and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops, or attacking people based on the colour of their skin.\"\n\nThe UK Home Office has announced that mosques will be offered \"greater protection with new emergency security\" measures, allowing for rapid security deployment to protect communities and enable a quick return to worship.\n\nAlso Read: Who are the EDL, UK far-right group stoking hatred, violence after the Southport\u00c2 stabbing?\n\nDiana Johnson, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policing minister, stated that there was no current need to involve the army, as police resources were deemed sufficient.\n\nShe stressed the importance of a swift response, noting that the plan was to carry out quick arrests and charges to act as a deterrent and prevent further unrest.\n\nUnrest spreads across the UK\n\nThe unrest has not been confined to Rotherham and Tamworth. Similar scenes of violence have been reported in towns and cities across England, including Middlesbrough, Bolton, Weymouth, and more.\n\nIn Middlesbrough, around 300 protesters marched towards the city's Cenotaph, carrying banners with xenophobic slogans and chanting \"we want our country back.\" Violence erupted, with projectiles being thrown at police, and several arrests were made.\n\nIn Bolton, a peaceful protest turned chaotic when two groups of demonstrators clashed, with one group shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" and the other waving England flags.\n\nFormer UK PM Rishi Sunak also condemned the violence, stating, \"The shocking scenes we're seeing on the streets of Britain have nothing to do with the tragedy in Southport. This is violent, criminal behaviour that has no place in our society.\"\n\nSouth Yorkshire's mayor, Oliver Coppard, expressed his dismay at the violence, stating, \"What we're seeing is not protest; it is brutal thuggery directed against some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\" He assured the public that those responsible for the violence would be pursued \"with the full force of the law,\" reported Daily Mail.\n\nWhat is being done to manage the situation?\n\nThe government and law enforcement agencies are taking significant steps to address the situation. Police are reviewing considerable online imagery and footage to identify those involved in the violence, and more arrests are expected. The response may include fast-tracking prosecutions and potentially holding courts around the clock to handle cases swiftly.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Butterfield highlighted the consequences of the unrest, noting the diversion of police resources and the injuries sustained by officers, reported Daily Mail. She condemned the actions of the rioters, stating, \"The mindless actions of those today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear.\"\n\nAlso Read: Who is Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, the 17-year-old who \u00e2\u20ac~killed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 3 children?\n\nStarmer has pledged to stay engaged with the crisis, despite previous plans for a holiday, indicating the seriousness with which 10 Downing Street is addressing the unrest. The violence and chaos have left a deep mark on communities across the UK, and have underlined the dangers of misinformation and the challenges posed by extremism.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com",

of Scotland Humza Yousaf has called for troops to be called in to stop \"thugs\" following appalling scenes in Hull, Halifax, Liverpool, London, Southport and Rotherham.\n\nBut ministers have so far insisted that the police have the resources they need to respond to the violent mobs, who on Sunday stormed a hotel full of asylum seekers and set fire to it, knowing people were inside.\n\nJohn Healy, the defence secretary, said it was the police's responsibility to respond in the first place \"and currently, they've got the means to do it, and they will make sure that people stay safe.\"\n\nAsked directly if the Army would be used in response to the riots, he said: \"No\".\n\nHe was speaking in Rotherham, where he is the local MP, where rioters smashed the windows of a Holiday Inn Express hotel before starting fires.\n\nHe spoke of the \"fear\" felt by locals and the staff and residents at the hotel \"who saw the windows put through and people outside trying the set fire to this hotel knowing there were people inside\".\n\nEarlier the home secretary Yvette Cooper said police had the \"expertise\" to deal with the issue.\n\nThere were a number of highly trained police officers yet to be deployed who could be called upon, she said.\n\nChallenged why they were not used over the weekend, Ms Cooper said extra officers had been made available in the past few days.\n\nThe violence has hit towns and cities around the UK since misinformation was used to inflame tensions following the murder of three girls in Southport.\n\nFalse claims the alleged attacker was on a watchlist and Muslim were used to stir up far-right mobs.\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured in Rotherham, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police have said, on the sixth day of escalating violence.\n\nAs around 700 people gathered, masked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles, and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside.\n\nThere were similar scenes ay a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed.\n\nRioters threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nElsewhere, a group in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers, with one telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nGreater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order amid disturbances in Bolton, requiring people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nSir Keir

A large bin close to a window of the hotel was also set alight but the small fire was extinguished.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police, which is responsible for Rotherham, said at least 10 officers were injured, including one who was left unconscious.\n\n\"The behavior we witnessed has been nothing short of disgusting. While it was a smaller number of those in attendance who chose to commit violence and destruction, those who simply stood on and watched remain absolutely complicit in this,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield. \"We have officers working hard, reviewing the considerable online imagery and footage of those involved, and they should expect us to be at their doors very soon.\"\n\nFar-right agitators have sought to take advantage of last week's stabbing attack by tapping into concerns about the scale of immigration in the U.K., in particular the tens of thousands of migrants arriving in boats from France.\n\nTensions were also running high Sunday in the northeastern town of Middlesbrough, where some protesters broke free of a police guard. One group walked through a residential area smashing the windows of houses and cars. When asked by a resident why they were breaking windows, one man replied, \"Because we're English.\"\n\nStarmer said anyone targeting people for the color of their skin or their faith is far-right.\n\n\"People in this country have a right to be safe, and yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType":

with dozens thought to be inside at the time\n\nRioters attacked police officers in Rotherham on Sunday as far-right thugs led unrest\n\nSerious damage has been done to buildings including hotels, libraries, local shops and homes since disorder started last week\n\nA police dog handler during the far-right demonstration outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham\n\nGreater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order amid disturbances in Bolton, requiring people to 'remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance'.\n\nAnd in Weymouth, police said three people were arrested and dispersal orders put in place for several teenagers.\n\nA 42-year-old man from Yeovil was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence, a 62-year-old man from Yeovil was arrested for being drunk and disorderly and a 27-year-old man from Weymouth was arrested for assault.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Mark Callaghan said two officers were injured - one when a bottle his them in the face and a second who was punched in the head.\n\nHe said: 'There were rumours circulating that asylum seekers currently housed on the Bibby Stockholm would be moved to Portland, Weymouth or the wider Dorset Council area but the Home Office have confirmed this is not the case.\n\n'In addition, there are no asylum seekers housed in hotels in the Weymouth area.'\n\nThe widespread unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, with MPs including Ian Byrne and Dame Priti Patel saying Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots.\n\nThe race riots have spread from Southport to cities including London, Leeds, Rotherham, Manchester, Blackbool, Belfast and Aldershot.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News on Monday, Shadow Secretary James Cleverly said: 'The things that we have seen are completely unjustified. These are the actions of people who are clearly responding to disinformation online but are obviously motivated by racism.\n\n'We've seen people with Swastika tattoos and making the Nazi salute... attacking people who have no link at all to the terrible incidents that we saw in Southport last week and it is absolutely right that the government is taking firm action.\n\n'When you've people giving Nazi salutes with Swastika tattoos that is clearly far-right extremism.\n\n'It's clearly these attacks on mosques on hotels these are clearly driven by racism and should be unequivocally condemned.'\n\nBut he also criticised Starmer's new government for not reacting quickly enough: 'They could and should have been quicker, it's worrying that it's only today that cobra is meeting.\n\nScenes in Middlesbrough on Monday morning after residents wake up to the after-effects of rioting\n\nResidents saw their car windows smashed and businesses suffered attacks including arson\n\n'We want to support the government taking firm action against this violence but they have to move much more quickly and they have to be more agile, more decisive. Had I still be Home Secretary I would have called a Cobra much earlier than this.'\n\nHe continued: 'I'm really uncomfortable with the idea that somehow this violence reflects a wider national move. This is a group of extreme people.\n\n'People committing arson, attacking mosques, targeting asylum hotels, they are not reflective of the country. This is a generous and open hearted country. The people in this country are not represented by the thugs that are attacking people, committing arson and targeting places of worship.'\n\nThe former first minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf said the army should be called in to stop 'thugs' causing disorder on the streets.\n\nMinisters have so far insisted police have the resources required to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army.\n\nSir Keir said he wanted those who 'feel targeted because of the colour of their skin' to know 'this violent mob do not represent our country'.\n\nIn his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: 'I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.'\n\nDame Sara Khan, who was Rishi Sunak's independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience until May, blamed the Conservative government for leaving the country open to far-right violence.\n\n'The writing was clearly on the wall for some time,' she told the Guardian.\n\nWriting in The Times, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said 'there will be reckoning' for people who took part in the unrest and those who 'whipped them up on social media and in online chat forums'.\n\n'Whatever they and some of their political supporters may tell us, these are not patriots standing up for their communities,' she said.\n\n'They are thugs, criminals and extremists who betray the values our country is built on.'\n\nShe said those responsible would be 'paying the price for years to come'.\n\nMs Cooper slammed actions taken by rioters this week after more than 420 people were arrested, as she warned 'many more will follow' as authorities scour CCTV footage to identify all those involved.\n\nClashes, sparked by the murder of three little girls in Southport last Monday, deteriorated further yesterday when a second migrant hotel was set ablaze in Tamworth, while hundreds cheered and clinked beers outside.\n\nIn Middlesbrough the protestors were filmed stopping traffic to interrogate the passengers to check they were 'white and English'.\n\nKeir Starmer also waded in to warn far-Right rioters 'you'll regret taking part' as he tried to stamp his authority over the first major test of his Premiership.\n\nHe blasted 'far-Right thuggery', for which he promised swift justice as he is expected to call a COBRA meeting today.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tories were forced to reprimanded Shadow Wales Secretary Lord Davies of Gower after The Mail on Sunday columnist Dan Hodges said there was 'no political justification' for the riots and Lord Davies retorted: 'Labour blocked the Rwanda Bill 130+ times, of course it's politically justified!'\n\nThis comes as:\n\nRioters descend on second migrant hotel as far-right mob try to set fire to Holiday Inn housing asylum seekers in TamworthTommy Robinson suns himself at an all-inclusive five-star hotel in Cyprus while his foot soldiers run riot in violent protests The Tory Police and Crime Commissioner claimed far-right protesters are trying to 'protect Britain's sovereignty and identity' Malaysia becomes the first country issues warning over travelling to the UK amid the violent protests The Tories were forced to reprimanded Shadow Wales Secretary after he justified the rioting by saying: 'Labour blocked the Rwanda Bill 130+ times, of course it's politically justified!'\n\nROTHERHAM: Police defend themselves as far-right thugs launch planks of wood on Sunday\n\nROTHERHAM: Violent thugs yesterday attacked a hotel reported to be housing asylum seekers\n\nROTHERHAM: A rioter throws blocks of concrete towards a hotel on Sunday\n\nWriting in the Times the Home Secretary held nothing back when she said: 'Make no mistake: there will be a reckoning for the individuals who took part in this violence, those who whipped them up on social media and in online forums and those who have felt emboldened by this moment to stir up racial hatred.'\n\nMs Cooper made clear that the crackdown would also cover those spreading misinformation online.\n\nThis came after Tommy Robinson posted a video of a confrontation in Stoke and claimed two protesters had been stabbed 'by Muslims'.\n\nThe post was viewed two million times on X.\n\nTwo hours later, Staffordshire Police confirmed the information was false. Those injured were hit by something thrown by their own side.\n\nRead MoreEXCLUSIVE Tommy Robinson suns himself at an all-inclusive five-star hotel in Cyprus while followers run riot\n\nActor Laurence Fox has also shared a string of false claims. On Friday night, he posted a list of dozens of acts of violence he alleged had been committed by immigrants under the caption: 'Anyone else had enough?'\n\nAmong them was the claim that a 'woman [was] beaten to death by two Somalis while walking her dog' - understood to have been a reference to last month's murder of Anita Rose, 57, in Brantham, Suffolk.\n\nThree people have been arrested in connection with the murder, but Suffolk Police last night confirmed Fox's tweet was not correct.\n\nHundreds of people gathered as a group of masked thugs threw a burning bush inside the side entrance of the Hotel Inn Express, Leisure Island, in Tamworth yesterday evening.\n\n'Get out England' was graffitied on the side of the building, as police worked to extinguish the fire inside the hotel's stairwell.\n\nSome people could be heard chanting 'England, England, England,' while others threw objects at police and set off flares and fireworks. One man could be seen running towards police with what appeared to be a large speaker.\n\nOfficers clad in riot gear were seen standing in a line guarding the entrance to the hotel. One police officer has suffered a suspected broken arm.\n\nPolice have said the violent disorder has been 'successfully dispersed' as they appeal to anyone with information to help identify those responsible.\n\nA group of protesters were kept apart from counter protesters in Bolton this afternoon\n\nA fire extinguisher is sprayed at riot police in Rotherham\n\nProperty is vandalised as far-right activists in Middlesbrough\n\nProtesters try to cram into the migrant hotel through a damaged fire exit in Rotherham\n\nRiot police clash with anti-migration protesters outside of the Holiday Inn Express in Manvers, which is being used as an asylum hotel\n\nROTHERHAM: Police have been trying to fend off agitators outside the hotel yesterday\n\nYvette Cooper slammed actions taken by rioters this week, as more than 420 people have been arrested, warning 'many more will follow' as authorities scour CCTV footage for criminals\n\nStarmer blasted 'far-Right thuggery', for which he promised swift justice amid another day of violent scenes nationwide.\n\nHe is today expected to hold an emergency COBRA Cabinet meeting, attended by police chiefs, in a bid to ensure the crisis does not spiral further out of control.\n\nHe also opened the door yesterday to tougher sentences to act as a 'deterrent', saying he will do 'whatever it takes' to crack down on the violence. He said the sentences would mirror action taken to deal with thuggery during the 2011 riots, when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nRead More Rioters descend on second migrant hotel in Tamworth\n\nAn asylum seeker who was staying at the Holiday Inn in Tamworth when it was set alight, told the Times of his terror as he was beaten up by the mob when they broke in.\n\n'They came onto this floor and hit me until the police drove them down the corridor.'\n\nWhile another 55-year-old Palestinian said his window was pelted with rocks thrown at his window.\n\n'I was taking some tea when they ran down shouting f***, f***, f***. A shirtless man was shouting and making so much noise. They broke the windows. There were eight on my floor.'\n\nWhile John Woodcock, a former Labour MP, called for MI6, MI5 and GCHQ to be given additional powers that would allow them to ask social media firms to take down accounts that try to 'fan the flames of British extreme actors'.\n\nMalaysia has become the first country to warn its citizens about the dangers of visiting Britain at the moment.\n\nThe statement released by Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: 'Malaysians residing in or travelling to the United Kingdom are urged to stay away from protest areas, remain vigilant and follow the latest updates and guidance provided by local authorities.'\n\nMore than 300 protesters started marching through Middlesbrough after gathering at the city's Cenotaph.\n\nThe thugs chanted 'We want our country back' as they made their way through the city centre, before at least two people were taken away in handcuffs.\n\nPolice officers stand near the broken windows of the hotel during an anti-immigration protest\n\nROTHERHAM: Police try to control the deplorable violence after a mob attacked a hotel\n\nPolice officers detain a protester who broke through the police line\n\nA thug throws a brick at a parked car during an anti-immigration protest in Middlesbrough\n\nPolice have said that there was a 'staggering' surge of violence which led to 35 people being arrested in Middlesbrough on Sunday.\n\nRioters smashed the windows of houses and cars and hurled objects at officers, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: 'It's our f****** country.'\n\nThere was significant damage to the crown court, the university and a number of properties in the Parliament Road area.\n\nCleveland Police said it has now arrested 55 people because of the violence that has swept across Teesside as 20 suspects were also arrested after rioting in Hartlepool on Wednesday.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable David Felton said: 'The level of violence we have seen today is staggering.\n\n'We know the shocking scenes across Middlesbrough today will have caused alarm amongst communities.\n\n'I want to reassure the people of Teesside that we will continue to identify those involved in these acts of violence and arrest them and put them before the courts.'\n\nAt one point police used dogs to keep the group back and stop them breaking through and running ahead of the officers patrolling the march. Several pieces of slate were also thrown, along with vapes and full plastic bottles.\n\nSome people kicked bollards into the road so that police vehicles driving ahead of the group could not get through, and one man sat on the bonnet of a police car to stop it moving.\n\nIn Bolton, Greater Manchester, violent clashes between protesters and police broke out, with footage showing the activists pushing against officers who had formed a human barricade.\n\nThere was also an counter protest in Bolton, where it was reported that large groups of Asian men could be heard shouting 'Allahu Akbar' as they clashed with the far-right.\n\nLast night experts condemned the 'dangerous' behaviour and also called for stricter action against those spreading misinformation.\n\nFestus Akinbusoye, a former police and crime commissioner, said: 'Of course there are discussions to be had about the level of immigration, the type of immigration and issues like integration.\n\n'But misinformation and xenophobic narratives are wrong, irresponsible and dangerous. These actions are having real world consequences and the people spreading dangerous lies need to be brought to book.'\n\nMIDDLESBROUGH: A car burns on Parliament Road after it was set alight by far-right thugs\n\nMIDDLESBROUGH: Police raced off with far-right agitators on Parliament Road yesterday\n\nA man is detained as Far-right activists hold a demonstration in Middlesbrough\n\nAn anti-immigration protester wearing a Union Jack mask outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nAn aerial view of the anti-migration protesters stand outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nCounter-protesters shout at police officers as they push against a cordon in Bolton\n\nObjects thrown at the hotel as trouble flares during an anti-immigration protest outside the Holiday Inn Express\n\nLIVERPOOL: Police officers attend to a shell-shocked colleague after a face-off with protesters on Saturday\n\nMr Akinbusoye, who was Britain's first black PCC, added: 'Our entire criminal justice system is going to have to be revisited in terms of how the authorities are going to be able to legitimately counter and pre-empt these narratives.\n\n'I understand that police forces need to be careful about what they put into the public domain but they need to... publish safe information whenever possible.'\n\nTory leadership hopeful Mel Stride said the scrapping of pilots of rapid-response police units, introduced by the Tories last March, may make it harder to tackle the current disorder.\n\nIt comes after an angry far-right mob stormed into a hotel in Rotherham yesterday, hurling chairs and spraying fire extinguishers at riot police, while setting bins, a generator and furniture alight.\n\nAround 700 violent anti-immigration protesters clad in balaclavas and draped in St George's flags clashed with officers trying to protect the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire since around 2pm this afternoon.\n\nAt least 10 officers have been injured in the chaos outside the hotel on the northern outskirts of the post-industrial town. One was left unconscious following a head injury, another suffered a suspected fractured elbow and other suspected broken bones.\n\nIt marks yet another day of violent riots of Britain's streets, with crowds in Middlesbrough setting fire to a car and pushing burning wheelie bins at police, while thugs in Rotherham smash windows and doors as riot police use shields to push them back.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police said one person has been arrested on suspicion of public order offences.\n\nSimilar scenes could be seen in Weymouth, as around 400 protesters from opposing sides gathered on the seafront to chant at each other. One side could be heard chanting 'Nazis go home', while the other shouted 'Tommy Robinson'.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

What we're doing right now is keeping in close contact with MPs.'\n\nCommunities are now coming together to begin the massive clean-up operation in areas including Rotherham, Middlesbrough and Tamworth.\n\nIn response to the violence, the Home Office announced on Sunday that mosques would be offered greater protection under a new 'rapid response process' designed to quickly tackle the threat of further attacks on places of worship.\n\nA large crowd gathered outside a mosque in Middlesbrough on Sunday night and others have also been targeted.\n\nOn Saturday night Spellow Lane Library in Liverpool was torched while in Sunderland local travel agents Hays Travel, known for its commitment to raising money for charity, had its storefront smashed.\n\nIn Rotherham, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express before starting fires in an apparent attempt to set the building alight while dozens of people were inside it.\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured there, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person had already been arrested and others involved should 'expect us to be at their doors very soon'.\n\nMasked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles, and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside after some 700 people gathered.\n\nIslamophobic and racist chants were heard at multiple riots across the country, with images appearing to show some members of the mobs performing Nazi salutes.\n\nA similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth into Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed.\n\nPeople threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nA group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: 'It's our f****** country.'\n\nVideo footage showed groups of youths and young men running from house to house and smashing windows and cars parked outside, throwing bricks, traffic cones and other objects.\n\nYouths also appeared to loot a branch of Iceland, with one teenager running out triumphantly while holding a bottle of Friji.\n\nAnd footage from a local park appeared to show a group of white men and boys with faces covered surrounding and attacking a group, with violence erupting before they fled the scene.\n\nNearby, a Muslim leader at a mosque told community members who had turned out to protect their place of worship to 'show the world what Muslims are really like'.\n\nAddressing far-right violence in the town, he said: 'They are doing all the wrong things. We don't want to be part of it.'\n\nOther local Muslims were seen carrying tea and coffee to police officers on the front line of the town amid fierce violence from the far-right.\n\nThere were 43 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said.\n\nGreater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order amid disturbances in Bolton, requiring people to 'remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance'.\n\nAnd in Weymouth, police said three people were arrested and dispersal orders put in place for several teenagers.\n\nA 42-year-old man from Yeovil was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence, a 62-year-old man from Yeovil was arrested for being drunk and disorderly and a 27-year-old man from Weymouth was arrested for assault.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Mark Callaghan said two officers were injured - one when a bottle his them in the face and a second who was punched in the head.\n\nHe said: 'There were rumours circulating that asylum seekers currently housed on the Bibby Stockholm would be moved to Portland, Weymouth or the wider Dorset Council area but the Home Office have confirmed this is not the case.\n\n'In addition, there are no asylum seekers housed in hotels in the Weymouth area.'\n\nThe widespread unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, with MPs including Ian Byrne and Dame Priti Patel saying Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots.\n\nThe race riots have spread from Southport to cities including London, Leeds, Rotherham, Manchester, Blackbool, Belfast and Aldershot.\n\nIt comes after Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said there would be a 'reckoning' following unrest across England, as she pledged that anyone involved in the riots will 'pay the price'.\n\nShe told Sky News: 'It's a total disgrace and there has to be a reckoning. Those individuals who are involved in the disorder need to know that they will pay a price.'\n\n'I've made clear to the police they have my full support in going after the full range of offenders, from those who turned up at the last minute and joined in the looting, to some of the most serious offenders who were pursuing really dangerous arson, really dangerous damage and criminal violence, because we simply cannot stand for this.\n\n'So we should be clear, there will be people who were thinking they were going on their summer holidays this week, and instead they will face a knock on the door from the police.\n\n'They will face arrest and... a police cell, while they wait for trial in order to make sure that they do pay the price for what they have done,' she added.\n\nMs Cooper claimed that social media has put 'rocket boosters' under far-right organisations.\n\nBut she said the courts are on 'stand-by' to ensure 'swift justice': 'We have made sure that the courts are on stand-by. We've made sure that there are additional prosecutors in place this weekend, and hundreds of arrests have already taken place. So we do expect swift justice to take place.'\n\nAsked if the Army would be called upon, Ms Cooper said: 'So, the police have the expertise and also the powers in terms of dealing with public order and crime, because this is crime.\n\n'There are also significant additional numbers of public order-trained police, who were not deployed this weekend, so there are considerable additional policing resources that forces can call upon.'\n\nPressed on whether the Government will take action against Tommy Robinson, who has been accused of stoking tensions from afar, Ms Cooper said: 'If it's a crime offline, it's a crime online.'\n\n'You can't just have the the armchair thuggery or the people being able to incite and organise violence and also not face consequences for this,' she added.\n\nShadow Secretary James Cleverly said: 'The things that we have seen are completely unjustified. These are the actions of people who are clearly responding to disinformation online but are obviously motivated by racism.\n\n'We've seen people with Swastika tattoos and making the Nazi salute... attacking people who have no link at all to the terrible incidents that we saw in Southport last week and it is absolutely right that the government is taking firm action.\n\n'When you've people giving Nazi salutes with Swastika tattoos that is clearly far-right extremism.\n\n'It's clearly these attacks on mosques on hotels these are clearly driven by racism and should be unequivocally condemned.'\n\nBut he also criticised Starmer's new government for not reacting quickly enough: 'They could and should have been quicker, it's worrying that it's only today that cobra is meeting.\n\n'We want to support the government taking firm action against this violence but they have to move much more quickly and they have to be more agile, more decisive. Had I still be Home Secretary I would have called a Cobra much earlier than this.'\n\nHe continued: 'I'm really uncomfortable with the idea that somehow this violence reflects a wider national move. This is a group of extreme people.\n\n'People committing arson, attacking mosques, targeting asylum hotels, they are not reflective of the country. This is a generous and open hearted country. The people in this country are not represented by the thugs that are attacking people, committing arson and targeting places of worship.'\n\nThe former first minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf said the army should be called in to stop 'thugs' causing disorder on the streets.\n\nMinisters have so far insisted police have the resources required to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army.\n\nSir Keir said he wanted those who 'feel targeted because of the colour of their skin' to know 'this violent mob do not represent our country'.\n\nIn his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: 'I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.'\n\nDame Sara Khan, who was Rishi Sunak's independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience until May, blamed the Conservative government for leaving the country open to far-right violence.\n\n'The writing was clearly on the wall for some time,' she told the Guardian.\n\nWriting in The Times, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said 'there will be reckoning' for people who took part in the unrest and those who 'whipped them up on social media and in online chat forums'.\n\n'Whatever they and some of their political supporters may tell us, these are not patriots standing up for their communities,' she said.\n\n'They are thugs, criminals and extremists who betray the values our country is built on.'\n\nShe said those responsible would be 'paying the price for years to come'.\n\nMs Cooper slammed actions taken by rioters this week after more than 420 people were arrested, as she warned 'many more will follow' as authorities scour CCTV footage to identify all those involved.\n\nClashes, sparked by the murder of three little girls in Southport last Monday, deteriorated further yesterday when a second migrant hotel was set ablaze in Tamworth, while hundreds cheered and clinked beers outside.\n\nIn Middlesbrough far-right yobs were filmed stopping traffic to interrogate the passengers to check they were 'white and English'.\n\nKeir Starmer also waded in to warn far-Right rioters 'you'll regret taking part' as he tried to stamp his authority over the first major test of his Premiership.\n\nHe blasted 'far-Right thuggery', for which he promised swift justice as he is expected to call a COBRA meeting today.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tories were forced to reprimanded Shadow Wales Secretary Lord Davies of Gower after The Mail on Sunday columnist Dan Hodges said there was 'no political justification' for the riots and Lord Davies retorted: 'Labour blocked the Rwanda Bill 130+ times, of course it's politically justified!'\n\nThis comes as:\n\nThis came after Tommy Robinson posted a video of a confrontation in Stoke and falsely claimed two 'protesters' had been stabbed 'by Muslims'. The post was viewed two million times on X.\n\nTwo hours later, Staffordshire Police confirmed the information was false. Those injured were hit by something thrown by their own side.\n\nActor Laurence Fox has also shared a string of false claims. On Friday night, he posted a list of dozens of acts of violence he alleged had been committed by immigrants under the caption: 'Anyone else had enough?'\n\nAmong them was the claim that a 'woman [was] beaten to death by two Somalis while walking her dog' - understood to have been a reference to last month's murder of Anita Rose, 57, in Brantham, Suffolk.\n\nThree people have been arrested in connection with the murder, but Suffolk Police last night confirmed Fox's tweet was not correct.\n\nHundreds of people gathered as a group of masked thugs threw a burning bush inside the side entrance of the Hotel Inn Express, Leisure Island, in Tamworth yesterday evening.\n\n'Get out England' was graffitied on the side of the building, as police worked to extinguish the fire inside the hotel's stairwell.\n\nSome people could be heard chanting 'England, England, England,' while others threw objects at police and set off flares and fireworks. One man could be seen running towards police with what appeared to be a large speaker.\n\nOfficers clad in riot gear were seen standing in a line guarding the entrance to the hotel. One police officer has suffered a suspected broken arm.\n\nPolice have said the violent disorder has been 'successfully dispersed' as they appeal to anyone with information to help identify those responsible.\n\nStarmer blasted 'far-Right thuggery', for which he promised swift justice amid another day of violent scenes nationwide.\n\nHe is today expected to hold an emergency COBRA Cabinet meeting, attended by police chiefs, in a bid to ensure the crisis does not spiral further out of control.\n\nHe also opened the door yesterday to tougher sentences to act as a 'deterrent', saying he will do 'whatever it takes' to crack down on the violence. He said the sentences would mirror action taken to deal with thuggery during the 2011 riots, when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nAn asylum seeker who was staying at the Holiday Inn in Tamworth when it was set alight, told the Times of his terror as he was beaten up by the mob when they broke in.\n\n'They came onto this floor and hit me until the police drove them down the corridor.'\n\nWhile another 55-year-old Palestinian said his window was pelted with rocks thrown at his window.\n\n'I was taking some tea when they ran down shouting f***, f***, f***. A shirtless man was shouting and making so much noise. They broke the windows. There were eight on my floor.'\n\nWhile John Woodcock, a former Labour MP, called for MI6, MI5 and GCHQ to be given additional powers that would allow them to ask social media firms to take down accounts that try to 'fan the flames of British extreme actors'.\n\nMalaysia has become the first country to warn its citizens about the dangers of visiting Britain at the moment.\n\nThe statement released by Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: 'Malaysians residing in or travelling to the United Kingdom are urged to stay away from protest areas, remain vigilant and follow the latest updates and guidance provided by local authorities.'\n\nMore than 300 started marching through Middlesbrough after gathering at the city's Cenotaph.\n\nThe thugs chanted 'We want our country back' as they made their way through the city centre, before at least two people were taken away in handcuffs.\n\nPolice have said that there was a 'staggering' surge of violence which led to 35 people being arrested in Middlesbrough on Sunday.\n\nRioters smashed the windows of houses and cars and hurled objects at officers, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: 'It's our f****** country.'\n\nThere was significant damage to the crown court, the university and a number of properties in the Parliament Road area.\n\nCleveland Police said it has now arrested 55 people because of the violence that has swept across Teesside as 20 suspects were also arrested after rioting in Hartlepool on Wednesday.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable David Felton said: 'The level of violence we have seen today is staggering.\n\n'We know the shocking scenes across Middlesbrough today will have caused alarm amongst communities.\n\n'I want to reassure the people of Teesside that we will continue to identify those involved in these acts of violence and arrest them and put them before the courts.'\n\nAt one point police used dogs to keep the group back and stop them breaking through and running ahead of the officers patrolling the march. Several pieces of slate were also thrown, along with vapes and full plastic bottles.\n\nSome people kicked bollards into the road so that police vehicles driving ahead of the group could not get through, and one man sat on the bonnet of a police car to stop it moving.\n\nIn Bolton, Greater Manchester, violent clashes between rioters and police broke out, with footage showing the activists pushing against officers who had formed a human barricade.\n\nThere was also an counter protest in Bolton, where it was reported that large groups of Asian men could be heard shouting 'Allahu Akbar' as they clashed with the far-right.\n\nLast night experts condemned the 'dangerous' behaviour and also called for stricter action against those spreading misinformation.\n\nFestus Akinbusoye, a former police and crime commissioner, said: 'Of course there are discussions to be had about the level of immigration, the type of immigration and issues like integration.\n\n'But misinformation and xenophobic narratives are wrong, irresponsible and dangerous. These actions are having real world consequences and the people spreading dangerous lies need to be brought to book.'\n\nMr Akinbusoye, who was Britain's first black PCC, added: 'Our entire criminal justice system is going to have to be revisited in terms of how the authorities are going to be able to legitimately counter and pre-empt these narratives.\n\n'I understand that police forces need to be careful about what they put into the public domain but they need to... publish safe information whenever possible.'\n\nTory leadership hopeful Mel Stride said the scrapping of pilots of rapid-response police units, introduced by the Tories last March, may make it harder to tackle the current disorder.\n\nIt comes after an angry far-right mob stormed into a hotel in Rotherham yesterday, hurling chairs and spraying fire extinguishers at riot police, while setting bins, a generator and furniture alight.\n\nAround 700 violent thugs clad in balaclavas and draped in St George's flags clashed with officers trying to protect the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire since around 2pm this afternoon.\n\nAt least 10 officers have been injured in the chaos outside the hotel on the northern outskirts of the post-industrial town. One was left unconscious following a head injury, another suffered a suspected fractured elbow and other suspected broken bones.\n\nIt marks yet another day of violent riots of Britain's streets, with crowds in Middlesbrough setting fire to a car and pushing burning wheelie bins at police, while thugs in Rotherham smash windows and doors as riot police use shields to push them back.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police said one person has been arrested on suspicion of public order offences.\n\nSimilar scenes could be seen in Weymouth, as around 400 protesters from opposing sides gathered on the seafront to chant at each other. One side could be heard chanting 'Nazis go home', while the other shouted 'Tommy Robinson'.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors":

Starmer condemned the violence and promised strict legal action. The Home Office announced heightened security for places of worship. Hundreds were arrested as the police confronted the mobs.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called an emergency COBRA meeting of senior ministers and police chiefs at 10 Downing Street here on Monday after a weekend of riots across several cities in the country, which he termed a \"far-right thuggery\" that will face the full force of the law. Hundreds of arrests have been made as police officers in riot gear responded to violent scenes in Rotherham, Middlesbrough, Bolton and other parts of the UK on Sunday, after days of some of the worst rioting seen on the streets of the country in the wake of the fatal stabbings of three schoolgirls in Southport, north-west England.\n\nHotels housing asylum seekers and mosques have been among the targets of the anti-immigrant mobs after initial false claims spread online regarding the stabbing suspect being an immigrant who arrived in the country illegally.\n\n\"I utterly condemn the far-right thuggery we have seen this weekend. Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law,\" said Starmer in a statement on Sunday.\n\n\"There is no justification - none - for taking this action, and all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe and yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, (and) wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric. So, no, I won't shy away from calling this what it is: far-right thuggery,\" he said.\n\nHe will chair the emergency Cabinet Office Briefing Room A (COBRA) meeting with UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss the future course of action to curb the violence. The Home Office has also announced that mosques will be offered greater protection with new \"emergency security\" that can be rapidly deployed to respond to violent disorder targeting places of worship.\n\n\"They do not speak for our communities. It's a total disgrace, and there has to be a reckoning. Those individuals who are involved in the disorder need to know that they will pay a price,\" said Cooper, as she indicated that additional prosecutors and courts are on standby to charge those being arrested for a series of offences.\n\n\"We have made very clear to the police that they have our full support in pursuing the full range of prosecutions and penalties, including the serious prison sentences, long-term tagging, travel bans and more,\" she said.\n\nDuring clashes over the weekend, cars were set alight, windows smashed, large bins burnt and hurled at officers and stores looted. Masked anti-immigration mobs broke into a hotel housing asylum-seekers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and rocks and long pieces of wood were thrown at police officers who lined up in front of the building as they tried to protect it.\n\n\"The mindless actions of those today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield of South Yorkshire Police.\n\nSeveral police officers have suffered injuries as they faced off with the mobs, who are being fuelled by misinformation being spread online. The riots started in Southport, near Liverpool, last week following the stabbing of a group of young children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on July 29.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, who has been charged with three murders and other attempted murders, was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents. However, initial misinformed social media posts claimed he was a refugee who arrived last year on a small boat. Southport residents, including the mother of one of the girls who died, have called for the protesters to stop and that they do not speak for them.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com",

One arrest had already been made and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\", the force warned.\n\nA similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth on Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed, in a scene which saw fires, smashed windows and missiles being thrown at officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, a group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nThere were 43 arrests, with crown court and university buildings sustaining significant damage, Cleveland Police said.\n\nA chair is launched at police officers outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham (Danny Lawson/PA)\n\nMeanwhile Greater Manchester Police used powers amid disturbances in Bolton to order people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nThe widespread and continued disorder, which broke out in the wake of a knife attack last week which left three girls dead, prompted some MPs to demand Parliament is recalled so the problems can be debated in the Commons, as it was during the 2011 riots.\n\nThe Government has also faced calls for the army to be called in to quell the unrest but ministers have so far insisted police have the resources needed to respond.\n\nDame Priti told Times Radio: \"I would not feel safe in some of the areas and communities where we've seen racism and thuggery on our streets.\n\n\"I grew up with people using the P-word against me.\n\nDamage at the Holiday Inn Express in Tamworth, Staffordshire, after a mob attacked it on Sunday (Jacob King/PA)\n\n\"And I think some of the

and I just think that there's no place for that in our amazing country,\" she added.\n\nThe Tory MP for Witham in Essex said that claims there is \"two-tier policing\" in Britain, where right-wing

One man could be seen running towards police with what appeared to be a large speaker.\n\nOfficers clad in riot gear were seen standing in a line guarding the entrance to the hotel. One police officer has been injured.\n\nTamworth Police has urged people to avoid the area around the Holiday Inn as officers deal with the 'violent acts of thuggery'.\n\nThey said in a statement: 'We're urging members of the public to avoid the area around the Holiday Inn, Tamworth, as specialist officers continue to deal with violent acts of thuggery tonight.\n\n'A large group of individuals are in the area and have been throwing projectiles, smashing windows, starting fires and targeting police. One officer has been injured.\n\n'Officers are working valiantly to keep the public safe. Specialist drone surveillance and the national police air service (NPAS) have been sweeping the area as our efforts to identify those involved continue.'\n\nIt comes after an angry far-right mob stormed into a hotel in Rotherham today, hurling chairs and spraying fire extinguishers at riot police, while setting bins, a generator and furniture alight.\n\nAround 700 violent anti-immigration protesters clad in balaclavas and draped in St George's flags clashed with officers trying to protect the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire since around 2pm this afternoon.\n\nThugs light small fires using debris on the ground and throw them into the stairwell of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nThe stairwell of the Holiday Inn Express in Tamworth was set alight this evening, as 'Get out England' was spray painted on the side of the building\n\nFlames engulf the stairwell in the Holiday Inn Express tonight as violence breaks out in Tamworth\n\nPeople were seen cheering as thugs three flames into the hotel's stairwell\n\nSome people could be heard chanting 'England, England, England,' while others threw objects at police and set off flares and fireworks\n\nThugs started fires outside the building before throwing the debris inside\n\nAt least 10 officers have been injured in the chaos outside the hotel on the northern outskirts of the post-industrial town. One was left unconscious following a head injury, another suffered a suspected fractured elbow and other suspected broken bones.\n\nIt marks yet another day of violent riots of Britain's streets, with crowds in Middlesbrough setting fire to a car and pushing burning wheelie bins at police, while thugs in Rotherham smash windows and doors as riot police use shields to push them back.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police said one person has been arrested on suspicion of public order offences.\n\nMeanwhile, a peaceful protest in Bolton descended into chaos when two groups of demonstrators clashed. One charged towards the town hall shouting 'Allahu Akbar' while the other waved England flags.\n\nSimilar scenes could be seen in Weymouth, as around 400 protesters from opposing sides gathered on the seafront to chant at each other. One side could be heard chanting 'Nazis go home', while the other shouted 'Tommy Robinson'.\n\nThe outbursts come after three young girls were stabbed to death in Southport on July 29.\n\nWhile photos from Rotherham have shown some occupants looking out of the hotel window onto rioters, it is unclear if the migrants and asylum seekers housed in the property have been able to evacuate. MailOnline has contacted the Home Office.\n\nOther photos appear to show far-right protesters breaching the hotel. The BBC reported that balaclava-clad people were seen forcing their way inside.\n\nObjects and pieces of wood were flung at officers who had lined up in front of the building with at least one cop in riot gear being carried away by their colleagues. The grass around the hotel appears to have been set on fire as well.\n\nKeir Starmer vowed rioters would 'regret' taking part in 'far-right thuggery' after a fifth day of violence in England, as the Government announced emergency security for mosques amid the threat of further disorder.\n\nA bin on fire outside the Holiday Inn Migrant hotel in Rotherham\n\nProtesters try to cram into the migrant hotel through a damaged fire exit in Rotherham\n\nA member of the community offers snacks to police officers on the front line in Middlesbrough\n\nResidents offer food and snacks to police on the front line in Middlesbrough this evening\n\nSerious violence and rioting by far-right protesters continues in side streets into the evening\n\nA man looks out of The Holiday Inn hotel in Rotherham as counter demonstrators stand outside with signs saying 'refugees welcome'\n\nTwo other residents in the hotel look out as protests begin in Rotherham, Britain\n\nA fire extinguisher is sprayed at riot police in Rotherham\n\nPolice officers stand guard as counter-protesters push against the police cordon on the day of a protest against illegal immigration, in Bolton\n\nPolice officers stand near the broken windows of the hotel during an anti-immigration protest\n\nPolice officers detain a protester who broke through the police line on August 4, 2024 in Weymouth\n\nA group of protesters were kept apart from counter protesters in Bolton, this afternoon\n\nA car burns on Parliament Road after it was set alight by far-right activists holding a demonstration in Middlesbrough\n\nA group of protesters were kept apart from counter protesters in Bolton this afternoon\n\nPolice try to hold back anti-immigrant protestors on Weymouth seafront\n\nPolice detain a man during an anti-immigration protest in Middlesbrough\n\nA car lies overturned and on fire during an ant-immigration protest in Middlesbrough\n\nA police officer helping a woman who has fallen over during an anti-immigration protest in Middlesbrough\n\nA thug throws a brick at a parked car during an anti-immigration protest in Middlesbrough\n\nA car burns after being overturned during an anti-immigration protest in Middlesbrough\n\nA group of young men in Rotherham held a banner that read 'we're not far right we're just right' while another placard being waved around said: 'Stopping the boats means stopping the stabbings'.\n\nMissiles, including glass bottles and beer cans were thrown at police, as protesters smashed hotel windows to gain access to the premises.\n\nOne person's face was seen completely covered with a Union Jack mask while they waved a large England flag outside the hotel and chanted offensive slogans.\n\nThe protest has already been strongly criticised by anti-racism groups as well as campaigner Brendan Cox, whose MP wife Jo Cox was killed in her West Yorkshire constituency in 2016.\n\nHe said: 'The scenes in Rotherham aren't a protest, they aren't even a far right riot, they are an ongoing attempt to murder the men, women and children inside by burning them alive.\n\n'The stench of these days will hang around those who incited and justified it for the rest of their lives.'\n\nAn anti-racism counter protest at the scene increased tensions for police, who arrived to find banners reading: 'Refugees welcome: Stop the far right.'\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police said several of its officers were injured during 'deplorable acts of violence' outside the Holiday Inn Express in the Manvers area of Rotherham today.\n\nAt least ten officers have been injured as a result of the violence, with one left unconscious following a head injury, another suffering a suspected fractured elbow and other suffering suspected broken bones.\n\nNo hotel employees or residents have been injured, police said.\n\nOfficers regained access to the hotel from protesters and are continuing to disperse the group away from the area this evening.\n\nA heavy police presence will remain outside the hotel and in the surrounding area over the course of the rest of this evening and into tomorrow.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield said: 'Today in Rotherham we have seen our officers attacked and at least ten injured, significant damage caused and a fire set outside a hotel full of terrified residents and staff. The mindless actions of those today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear.\n\n'The behaviour we witnessed has been nothing short of disgusting. While it was a smaller number of those in attendance who chose to commit violence and destruction, those who simply stood on and watched remain absolutely complicit in this. Those who choose to spread misinformation and hate online, also need to take responsibility for the scenes today - this was not a protest, just angry people, reacting to a false narrative who have their own motivations for doing so.\n\n'All today has achieved is the diversion of police and partner resources, operational police officers who will now be away from active duty while they recover from their injuries, and the continued use of public money to clean up the mess they have left behind.\n\n'Please be assured, our work does not end today - we have officers working hard, reviewing the considerable online imagery and footage of those involved, and they should expect us to be at their doors very soon.\n\n'I want to take this opportunity to thank our officers and staff who have worked incredibly hard today and the officers from West Yorkshire Police, British Transport Police, Durham Constabulary, North Yorkshire Police and Leicestershire Police who have supported us, alongside South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, Yorkshire Ambulance Service and Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council for their continued support.'\n\nResidential properties and businesses attacked on a street in Middlesbrough\n\nA car is vandalised as far-right activists hold a demonstration in Middlesbrough\n\nA policeman tussles with an anti-immigrant protestors near Weymouth seafront\n\nPolice officers detain a protester who broke through the police line\n\nPolice officers deploy as far-right activists hold a demonstration in Middlesbrough on August 04\n\nProperty is vandalised as far-right activists in Middlesbrough\n\nAnti-immigration protesters hold Union Jacks on Weymouth seafront.

The army can help to get control where the police are unable.'\n\nFormer Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also condemned the violence this evening.\n\nHe said: 'The shocking scenes we're seeing on the streets of Britain have nothing to do with the tragedy in Southport.\n\n'This is violent, criminal behaviour that has no place in our society. The police have our full support to deal with these criminals swiftly and they must face the full weight of the law.'\n\nFormer Prime Minister Rishi Sunak condemned the violence on 'X' this evening\n\nA bin has been set on fire in Middlesbrough as police officers deal with an anti-immigration protest\n\nA car burns after being overturned during an anti-immigration protest in Middlesbrough\n\nA car burns after being overturned during an anti-immigration protest in Middlesbrough\n\nA bin is chucked towards a fire as a group of far right protestes gather in Rotherham\n\nA woman and a man take cover as objects are thrown during an anti-immigration protest outside the Holiday Inn Express\n\nPolice officers in front of a smashed window as trouble flares during an anti-immigration protest outside the Holiday Inn Express\n\nA protester kicks a window at a hotel in Rotherham, as a far-right group joins\n\nExtinguishers are blown at police as trouble flares up outside The Holiday Inn in Rotherham\n\nA table is flung at a police officers wearing riot gear while others try to break into The Holiday Inn hotel in Rotherham\n\nPolice officers in front of a smashed window as trouble flares during an anti-immigration protest outside the Holiday Inn Express\n\nPolice officers tackle an anti-immigration protest in Middlesbrough\n\nPolice officers stand guard as counter-protesters push against the police cordon\n\nA police officers is injured as trouble flares during an anti-immigration protest outside the Holiday Inn Express\n\nSouth Yorkshire's mayor Oliver Coppard said he is 'utterly appalled by the violence' in Rotherham.\n\n'What we're seeing is not protest, it is brutal thuggery directed against some of the most vulnerable people in our society', he said in a statement.\n\n'The people carrying out these attacks do not represent the beautiful, brilliant place and people I know. We will come after those carrying out this violence with the full force of the law', he added.\n\nWatching the scenes of chaos unfold, former home secretary and Tory party leader hopeful James Cleverly said rioters should be hit with 'the full weight of the law'.\n\n'There is not and can never be any excuse, justification or rationale for behaviour like this,' he tweeted. 'This should be condemned by everybody, and those taking part should expect to be met with the full weight of the law.'\n\nIGH, the parent company of the Holiday Inn chain, told the BBC: 'The safety and security of our guests and colleagues is always our priority.'\n\nA Sky News journalist was approached by a group of masked men with 'potential weapons' in their hands while reporting on the scenes in Middlesbrough this evening.\n\nThe moment was caught on camera as Charlotte Leeming and her team were forced to move back.\n\nMeanwhile, the sight of demonstrators attacking a hotel in the belief it is housing migrants is 'almost incomprehensible', the managing director of the Hope not Hate advocacy group has said.\n\nNick Lowles said he was 'lost for words' to describe the scenes at a Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham.\n\n'The fact that hundreds of people have targeted a hotel that is housing migrants, it is almost incomprehensible,' he told Sky News.\n\n'They knew that people were in that hotel and they consciously tried to set fire to it.\n\n'Communities are so scared, we have to rebuild.'\n\nMr Lowles said agitators have been over-simplifying stories to whip-up hate.\n\nObjects thrown at the hotel as trouble flares during an anti-immigration protest outside the Holiday Inn Express\n\nAn aerial view of the anti-migration protesters stand outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nPolice officers and people during an anti-immigration protest outside the Holiday Inn Express\n\nAnti-immigration supporters outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham today\n\nA police officer moves a burning bin in Middlesbrough\n\nPolice officers clash with anti-migration protesters outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nRioters outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, kicking off another day of chaos\n\nAn anti-immigration protester wearing a Union Jack mask outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nMounted police stand in front of anti-racism counter protesters holding placards outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nPolice officers and anti-immigration supporters outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham\n\nPolice officers and dogs patrol as anti-racism counter protesters and anti-migration protesters gather outside of the Holiday Inn\n\nPolice officers and anti-immigration supporters standing outside the hotel housing migrants in Rotherham\n\nProtesters clash with police outside the Holiday Inn in Rotherham\n\nAnti-racism counter protesters hold placards outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nPeople carrying placards attend an anti-racism protest outside Holiday Inn Express\n\nA person carries a sign reading 'Refugees are welcome here' outside the hotel housing migrants\n\nPolice officers and anti-immigration supporters outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham\n\nAn aerial view of the Holiday Inn Express, which has seen rioters gather outside it for another day of chaos in the UK\n\nMounted police stand opposite anti-racism counter protesters holding placards outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nPolice horses outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham amid the protests\n\nPeople carrying placards attend an anti-racism protest outside Holiday Inn Express\n\nThe disruption across England and Northern Ireland began on Tuesday in Southport, after three little girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class.\n\nElsewhere in Middlesbrough, more than 300 protesters started marching towards the city's Cenotaph today.\n\nThey carried a banner that read: 'Tom Jones is Welsh, Axel Rudakubana isn't' Rudakubana is the 17-year-old accused for murdering the three little girls in Southport and is charged with attempted murder of 10 others.\n\nHis parents were born in Rwanda before moving to the UK in 2002. Rudakubana was born in Cardiff in 2006 before moving to near Southport in 2013.\n\nOthers marching through the city chanted 'we want our country back' as they made their way through the city centre.\n\nAt least two people were taken away in handcuffs within the first half hour, while several pieces of slate were thrown, along with vapes and full plastic bottles.\n\nSome people kicked bollards into the road so that police vehicles driving ahead of the group could not get through, and one man sat on the bonnet of a police car to stop it from moving.\n\nOne Middlesbrough resident said: 'We're going to be paying for this, and for what?\n\n'This has got nothing to do with three little girls that have lost their lives.

Every Prime Minister has to have that family time and that break but from what I know of Keir - and I've met him many times, and sitting here in Blackpool several times - he will be continuing to work and monitor the situation wherever he is on holiday.'\n\nCities such as Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester and Belfast have seen vehicles burned, shops destroyed, pedestrians attacked and police officers injured this week following the Southport stabbings on Monday.\n\nArrests have been made across the country, with police warning of more to come once CCTV, social media and body-worn camera footage has been scoured.\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast, which saw several police officers injured.

False rumors about the suspect quickly spread online, fueling an outburst of violence.\n\nOn Sunday, two hotels where asylum seekers are believed to be living, were targeted by mobs in what has turned into the worst disorder the U.K. has seen in years.\n\nIn the northern town of Rotherham, video shared by U.K.'s public broadcaster BBC and Reuters showed protesters, some masked and carrying Union Jack flags, chanting \"get them out\" as they smashed windows of a Holiday Inn Express hotel which was being used to house asylum seekers as people inside looked on with horror.\n\nThe rioters can also be seen setting plastic cans on fire next to the hotel, and hurling planks of wood and profanities at police officers in riot gear on the scene.\n\nThe South Yorkshire police, where Rotherham is, later said its officers were also targeted with glass bottles and beer cans by a crowd of about 700 people. It added that at least 10 officers have been injured in the melee, with one left unconscious following a head injury, although no hotel employees or residents have been reported as hurt.\n\nA police officer was also injured in the clashes at another Holiday Inn hotel in the town of Tamworth, north of Birmingham in the Midlands. Windows at the hotel were smashed and three petrol bombs were used to start several fires, Staffordshire Police said. Here too, projectiles were thrown at officers, resulting in one suffering a broken arm, it said. No one inside was injured, the police statement added.\n\nIn the town of Bolton, in the northwest of England, police were trying to keep rival demonstrators apart, with one group shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" at anti-immigration protesters, according to the footage shared by the BBC Sunday.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer will hold an emergency response meeting later on Monday after he condemned what he called the \"far-right thuggery\" behind the riots in a televised address Sunday night, and promised that the rioters would face \"full force of the law.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Interior Ministry

One man could be seen running towards police with what appeared to be a large speaker.\n\nOfficers clad in riot gear were seen standing in a line guarding the entrance to the hotel.\n\nTamworth Police issued the following statement this evening: 'We're aware and responding proactively to protest activity in Tamworth today.\n\n'Officers are deployed in specialist public order equipment. Robust action will be taken against those responsible for violence and disorder. Updates will be provided on this page.'\n\nIt comes after an angry far-right mob have stormed into a hotel in Rotherham today, hurling chairs and spraying fire extinguishers at riot police, while setting bins, a generator and furniture alight.\n\nAround 700 violent anti-immigration protesters clad in balaclavas and draped in St George's flags clashed with officers trying to protect the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire since around 2pm this afternoon.\n\nThugs light small fires using debris on the ground and throw them into the stairwell of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nPeople were seen cheering as thugs three flames into the hotel's stairwell\n\nSome people could be heard chanting 'England, England, England,' while others threw objects at police and set off flares and fireworks\n\nThugs started fires outside the building before throwing the debris inside\n\nAt least 10 officers have been injured in the chaos outside the hotel on the northern outskirts of the post-industrial town. One was left unconscious following a head injury, another suffered a suspected fractured elbow and other suspected broken bones.\n\nIt marks yet another day of violent riots of Britain's streets, with crowds in Middlesbrough setting fire to a car and pushing burning wheelie bins at police, while thugs in Rotherham smash windows and doors as riot police use shields to push them back.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police said one person has been arrested on suspicion of public order offences.\n\nMeanwhile, a peaceful protest in Bolton descended into chaos when two groups of demonstrators clashed. One charged towards the town hall shouting 'Allahu Akbar' while the other waved England flags.\n\nSimilar scenes could be seen in Weymouth, as around 400 protesters from opposing sides gathered on the seafront to chant at each other. One side could be heard chanting 'Nazis go home', while the other shouted 'Tommy Robinson'.\n\nThe outbursts come after three young girls were stabbed to death in Southport on July 29.\n\nWhile photos from Rotherham have shown some occupants looking out of the hotel window onto rioters, it is unclear if the migrants and asylum seekers housed in the property have been able to evacuate. MailOnline has contacted the Home Office.\n\nOther photos appear to show far-right protesters breaching the hotel. The BBC reported that balaclava-clad people were seen forcing their way inside.\n\nObjects and pieces of wood were flung at officers who had lined up in front of the building with at least one cop in riot gear being carried away by their colleagues. The grass around the hotel appears to have been set on fire as well.\n\nKeir Starmer vowed rioters would 'regret' taking part in 'far-right thuggery' after a fifth day of violence in England, as the Government announced emergency security for mosques amid the threat of further disorder.\n\nA bin on fire outside the Holiday Inn Migrant hotel in Rotherham\n\nProtesters try to cram into the migrant hotel through a damaged fire exit in Rotherham\n\nA member of the community offers snacks to police officers on the front line in Middlesbrough\n\nResidents offer food and snacks to police on the front line in Middlesbrough this evening\n\nSerious violence and rioting by far-right protesters continues in side streets into the evening\n\nA man looks out of The Holiday Inn hotel in Rotherham as counter demonstrators stand outside with signs saying 'refugees welcome'\n\nTwo other residents in the hotel look out as protests begin in Rotherham, Britain\n\nA fire extinguisher is sprayed at riot police in Rotherham\n\nPolice officers stand guard as counter-protesters push against the police cordon on the day of a protest against illegal immigration, in Bolton\n\nPolice officers stand near the broken windows of the hotel during an anti-immigration protest\n\nPolice officers detain a protester who broke through the police line on August 4, 2024 in Weymouth\n\nA group of protesters were kept apart from counter protesters in Bolton, this afternoon\n\nA car burns on Parliament Road after it was set alight by far-right activists holding a demonstration in Middlesbrough\n\nA group of protesters were kept apart from counter protesters in Bolton this afternoon\n\nPolice try to hold back anti-immigrant protestors on Weymouth seafront\n\nPolice detain a man during an anti-immigration protest in Middlesbrough\n\nA car lies overturned and on fire during an ant-immigration protest in Middlesbrough\n\nA police officer helping a woman who has fallen over during an anti-immigration protest in Middlesbrough\n\nA thug throws a brick at a parked car during an anti-immigration protest in Middlesbrough\n\nA car burns after being overturned during an anti-immigration protest in Middlesbrough\n\nA group of young men in Rotherham held a banner that read 'we're not far right we're just right' while another placard being waved around said: 'Stopping the boats means stopping the stabbings'.\n\nMissiles, including glass bottles and beer cans were thrown at police, as protesters smashed hotel windows to gain access to the premises.\n\nOne person's face was seen completely covered with a Union Jack mask while they waved a large England flag outside the hotel and chanted offensive slogans.\n\nThe protest has already been strongly criticised by anti-racism groups as well as campaigner Brendan Cox, whose MP wife Jo Cox was killed in her West Yorkshire constituency in 2016.\n\nHe said: 'The scenes in Rotherham aren't a protest, they aren't even a far right riot, they are an ongoing attempt to murder the men, women and children inside by burning them alive.\n\n'The stench of these days will hang around those who incited and justified it for the rest of their lives.'\n\nAn anti-racism counter protest at the scene increased tensions for police, who arrived to find banners reading: 'Refugees welcome: Stop the far right.'\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police said several of its officers were injured during 'deplorable acts of violence' outside the Holiday Inn Express in the Manvers area of Rotherham today.\n\nAt least ten officers have been injured as a result of the violence, with one left unconscious following a head injury, another suffering a suspected fractured elbow and other suffering suspected broken bones.\n\nNo hotel employees or residents have been injured, police said.\n\nOfficers regained access to the hotel from protesters and are continuing to disperse the group away from the area this evening.\n\nA heavy police presence will remain outside the hotel and in the surrounding area over the course of the rest of this evening and into tomorrow.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield said: 'Today in Rotherham we have seen our officers attacked and at least ten injured, significant damage caused and a fire set outside a hotel full of terrified residents and staff. The mindless actions of those today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear.\n\n'The behaviour we witnessed has been nothing short of disgusting. While it was a smaller number of those in attendance who chose to commit violence and destruction, those who simply stood on and watched remain absolutely complicit in this. Those who choose to spread misinformation and hate online, also need to take responsibility for the scenes today - this was not a protest, just angry people, reacting to a false narrative who have their own motivations for doing so.\n\n'All today has achieved is the diversion of police and partner resources, operational police officers who will now be away from active duty while they recover from their injuries, and the continued use of public money to clean up the mess they have left behind.\n\n'Please be assured, our work does not end today - we have officers working hard, reviewing the considerable online imagery and footage of those involved, and they should expect us to be at their doors very soon.\n\n'I want to take this opportunity to thank our officers and staff who have worked incredibly hard today and the officers from West Yorkshire Police, British Transport Police, Durham Constabulary, North Yorkshire Police and Leicestershire Police who have supported us, alongside South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, Yorkshire Ambulance Service and Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council for their continued support.'\n\nResidential properties and businesses attacked on a street in Middlesbrough\n\nA car is vandalised as far-right activists hold a demonstration in Middlesbrough\n\nA policeman tussles with an anti-immigrant protestors near Weymouth seafront\n\nPolice officers detain a protester who broke through the police line\n\nPolice officers deploy as far-right activists hold a demonstration in Middlesbrough on August 04\n\nProperty is vandalised as far-right activists in Middlesbrough\n\nAnti-immigration protesters hold Union Jacks on Weymouth seafront.

The army can help to get control where the police are unable.'\n\nFormer Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also condemned the violence this evening.\n\nHe said: 'The shocking scenes we're seeing on the streets of Britain have nothing to do with the tragedy in Southport.\n\n'This is violent, criminal behaviour that has no place in our society.

We will come after those carrying out this violence with the full force of the law', he added.\n\nWatching the scenes of chaos unfold, former home secretary and Tory party leader hopeful James Cleverly said rioters should be hit with 'the full weight of the law'.\n\n'There is not and can never be any excuse, justification or rationale for behaviour like this,' he tweeted. 'This should be condemned by everybody, and those taking part should expect to be met with the full weight of the law.'\n\nIGH, the parent company of the Holiday Inn chain, told the BBC: 'The safety and security of our guests and colleagues is always our priority.'\n\nA Sky News journalist was approached by a group of masked men with 'potential weapons' in their hands while reporting on the scenes in Middlesbrough this evening.\n\nThe moment was caught on camera as Charlotte Leeming and her team were forced to move back.\n\nMeanwhile, the sight of demonstrators attacking a hotel in the belief it is housing migrants is 'almost incomprehensible', the managing director of the Hope not Hate advocacy group has said.\n\nNick Lowles said he was 'lost for words' to describe the scenes at a Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham.\n\n'The fact that hundreds of people have targeted a hotel that is housing migrants, it is almost incomprehensible,' he told Sky News.\n\n'They knew that people were in that hotel and they consciously tried to set fire to it.\n\n'Communities are so scared, we have to rebuild.'\n\nMr Lowles said agitators have been over-simplifying stories to whip-up hate.\n\nObjects thrown at the hotel as trouble flares during an anti-immigration protest outside the Holiday Inn Express\n\nAn aerial view of the anti-migration protesters stand outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nPolice officers and people during an anti-immigration protest outside the Holiday Inn Express\n\nAnti-immigration supporters outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham today\n\nA police officer moves a burning bin in Middlesbrough\n\nPolice officers clash with anti-migration protesters outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nRioters outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, kicking off another day of chaos\n\nAn anti-immigration protester wearing a Union Jack mask outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nMounted police stand in front of anti-racism counter protesters holding placards outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nPolice officers and anti-immigration supporters outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham\n\nPolice officers and dogs patrol as anti-racism counter protesters and anti-migration protesters gather outside of the Holiday Inn\n\nPolice officers and anti-immigration supporters standing outside the hotel housing migrants in Rotherham\n\nProtesters clash with police outside the Holiday Inn in Rotherham\n\nAnti-racism counter protesters hold placards outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nPeople carrying placards attend an anti-racism protest outside Holiday Inn Express\n\nA person carries a sign reading 'Refugees are welcome here' outside the hotel housing migrants\n\nPolice officers and anti-immigration supporters outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham\n\nAn aerial view of the Holiday Inn Express, which has seen rioters gather outside it for another day of chaos in the UK\n\nMounted police stand opposite anti-racism counter protesters holding placards outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nPolice horses outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham amid the protests\n\nPeople carrying placards attend an anti-racism protest outside Holiday Inn Express\n\nThe disruption across England and Northern Ireland began on Tuesday in Southport, after three little girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class.\n\nElsewhere in Middlesbrough, more than 300 protesters started marching towards the city's Cenotaph today.\n\nThey carried a banner that read: 'Tom Jones is Welsh, Axel Rudakubana isn't' Rudakubana is the 17-year-old accused for murdering the three little girls in Southport and is charged with attempted murder of 10 others.\n\nHis parents were born in Rwanda before moving to the UK in 2002. Rudakubana was born in Cardiff in 2006 before moving to near Southport in 2013.\n\nOthers marching through the city chanted 'we want our country back' as they made their way through the city centre.\n\nAt least two people were taken away in handcuffs within the first half hour, while several pieces of slate were thrown, along with vapes and full plastic bottles.\n\nSome people kicked bollards into the road so that police vehicles driving ahead of the group could not get through, and one man sat on the bonnet of a police car to stop it from moving.\n\nOne Middlesbrough resident said: 'We're going to be paying for this, and for what?\n\n'This has got nothing to do with three little girls that have lost their lives.

Every Prime Minister has to have that family time and that break but from what I know of Keir - and I've met him many times, and sitting here in Blackpool several times - he will be continuing to work and monitor the situation wherever he is on holiday.'\n\nCities such as Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester and Belfast have seen vehicles burned, shops destroyed, pedestrians attacked and police officers injured this week following the Southport stabbings on Monday.\n\nArrests have been made across the country, with police warning of more to come once CCTV, social media and body-worn camera footage has been scoured.\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast, which saw several police officers injured.

This follows an incident where anti-immigrant protesters clashed with police at a venue in Rotherham. - Internewscast Journal", "body": "Rioters have descended on a second hotel believed to be housing migrants and asylum seekers, as thugs set fire to a doorway, smashed windows, and threw projectiles at police in Britain's fifth day of violence.\n\nHundreds of people gathered as a group of masked thugs threw a burning bush inside the side entrance of the Hotel Inn Express, Leisure Island, in Tamworth this evening, while onlookers filmed, cheered and clinked their beer bottles.\n\n'Get out England' has been graffitied on the side of the building, as police worked to extinguish the fire inside the hotel's stairwell.\n\nSome people could be heard chanting 'England, England, England,' while others threw objects at police and set off flares and fireworks. One man could be seen running towards police with what appeared to be a large speaker.\n\nOfficers clad in riot gear were seen standing in a line guarding the entrance to the hotel. One police officer has been injured.\n\nTamworth Police has urged people to avoid the area around the Holiday Inn as officers deal with the 'violent acts of thuggery'.\n\nThey said in a statement: 'We're urging members of the public to avoid the area around the Holiday Inn, Tamworth, as specialist officers continue to deal with violent acts of thuggery tonight.\n\n'A large group of individuals are in the area and have been throwing projectiles, smashing windows, starting fires and targeting police. One officer has been injured.\n\n'Officers are working valiantly to keep the public safe. Specialist drone surveillance and the national police air service (NPAS) have been sweeping the area as our efforts to identify those involved continue.'\n\nIt comes after an angry far-right mob stormed into a hotel in Rotherham today, hurling chairs and spraying fire extinguishers at riot police, while setting bins, a generator and furniture alight.\n\nAround 700 violent anti-immigration protesters clad in balaclavas and draped in St George's flags clashed with officers trying to protect the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire since around 2pm this afternoon.\n\nAt least 10 officers have been injured in the chaos outside the hotel on the northern outskirts of the post-industrial town. One was left unconscious following a head injury, another suffered a suspected fractured elbow and other suspected broken bones.\n\nIt marks yet another day of violent riots of Britain's streets, with crowds in Middlesbrough setting fire to a car and pushing burning wheelie bins at police, while thugs in Rotherham smash windows and doors as riot police use shields to push them back.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police said one person has been arrested on suspicion of public order offences.\n\nMeanwhile, a peaceful protest in Bolton descended into chaos when two groups of demonstrators clashed. One charged towards the town hall shouting 'Allahu Akbar' while the other waved England flags.\n\nSimilar scenes could be seen in Weymouth, as around 400 protesters from opposing sides gathered on the seafront to chant at each other. One side could be heard chanting 'Nazis go home', while the other shouted 'Tommy Robinson'.\n\nThe outbursts come after three young girls were stabbed to death in Southport on July 29.\n\nWhile photos from Rotherham have shown some occupants looking out of the hotel window onto rioters, it is unclear if the migrants and asylum seekers housed in the property have been able to evacuate. MailOnline has contacted the Home Office.\n\nOther photos appear to show far-right protesters breaching the hotel. The BBC reported that balaclava-clad people were seen forcing their way inside.\n\nObjects and pieces of wood were flung at officers who had lined up in front of the building with at least one cop in riot gear being carried away by their colleagues. The grass around the hotel appears to have been set on fire as well.\n\nKeir Starmer vowed rioters would 'regret' taking part in 'far-right thuggery' after a fifth day of violence in England, as the Government announced emergency security for mosques amid the threat of further disorder.\n\nA group of young men in Rotherham held a banner that read 'we're not far right we're just right' while another placard being waved around said: 'Stopping the boats means stopping the stabbings'.\n\nMissiles, including glass bottles and beer cans were thrown at police, as protesters smashed hotel windows to gain access to the premises.\n\nOne person's face was seen completely covered with a Union Jack mask while they waved a large England flag outside the hotel and chanted offensive slogans.\n\nThe protest has already been strongly criticised by anti-racism groups as well as campaigner Brendan Cox, whose MP wife Jo Cox was killed in her West Yorkshire constituency in 2016.\n\nHe said: 'The scenes in Rotherham aren't a protest, they aren't even a far right riot, they are an ongoing attempt to murder the men, women and children inside by burning them alive.\n\n'The stench of these days will hang around those who incited and justified it for the rest of their lives.'\n\nAn anti-racism counter protest at the scene increased tensions for police, who arrived to find banners reading: 'Refugees welcome: Stop the far right.'\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police said several of its officers were injured during 'deplorable acts of violence' outside the Holiday Inn Express in the Manvers area of Rotherham today.\n\nAt least ten officers have been injured as a result of the violence, with one left unconscious following a head injury, another suffering a suspected fractured elbow and other suffering suspected broken bones.\n\nNo hotel employees or residents have been injured, police said.\n\nOfficers regained access to the hotel from protesters and are continuing to disperse the group away from the area this evening.\n\nA heavy police presence will remain outside the hotel and in the surrounding area over the course of the rest of this evening and into tomorrow.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield said: 'Today in Rotherham we have seen our officers attacked and at least ten injured, significant damage caused and a fire set outside a hotel full of terrified residents and staff. The mindless actions of those today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear.\n\n'The behaviour we witnessed has been nothing short of disgusting. While it was a smaller number of those in attendance who chose to commit violence and destruction, those who simply stood on and watched remain absolutely complicit in this. Those who choose to spread misinformation and hate online, also need to take responsibility for the scenes today - this was not a protest, just angry people, reacting to a false narrative who have their own motivations for doing so.\n\n'All today has achieved is the diversion of police and partner resources, operational police officers who will now be away from active duty while they recover from their injuries, and the continued use of public money to clean up the mess they have left behind.\n\n'Please be assured, our work does not end today - we have officers working hard, reviewing the considerable online imagery and footage of those involved, and they should expect us to be at their doors very soon.\n\n'I want to take this opportunity to thank our officers and staff who have worked incredibly hard today and the officers from West Yorkshire Police, British Transport Police, Durham Constabulary, North Yorkshire Police and Leicestershire Police who have supported us, alongside South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, Yorkshire Ambulance Service and Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council for their continued support.'\n\nMeanwhile, in a televised address to the nation, Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned an attack on a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham and promised those involved in unrest would 'face the full force of the law'.\n\nSpeaking from Downing Street, Sir Keir suggested that rioters taking to the streets, and those 'whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,' would face consequences.\n\nThe Home Office announced mosques would be offered greater protection under a new 'rapid response process' designed to quickly tackle the threat of further attacks on places of worship.\n\n'People in this country have a right to be safe, and yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques,' the Prime Minister said on Sunday.\n\n'Other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery.'\n\nSir Keir indicated the response to the violence could mirror elements of how the 2011 riots were handled, at which time he was director of public prosecutions.\n\n'We do have standing arrangements for law enforcement which means that we can get arrests, charge remanded in custody and convictions done very quickly,' he said.\n\n'I myself was part of that in 2011 when I was director of public prosecutions, and I'm determined we will do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice as quickly as possible.'\n\nMinisters have suggested that courts could sit 24 hours to fast-track prosecutions while police forces have measures in place to draft in extra officers to tackle potential unrest.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said the deliberate torching of a hotel where people were known to be inside was 'utterly appalling' and South Yorkshire Police have Government backing to take 'the strongest action'.\n\nMs Cooper said: 'Britain is a proud and tolerant country, and nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops or attacking people based on the colour of their skin.\n\n'In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the Government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, alongside the support from local police forces and we repeat that anyone involved in this disorder and violence will face the full force of the law.\n\n'As a nation we will not tolerate criminal behaviour, dangerous extremism, and racist attacks that go against everything our country stands for.'\n\nHumza Yousaf has called for the army to be called in to stop 'thugs' causing disorder on the streets.\n\n'It doesn't look like, to me, the police have a handle on the situation,' the former first minister of Scotland said.\n\n'The police have not been able to protect those that are in the Holiday Inn,' he added. The army can help to get control where the police are unable.'\n\nFormer Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also condemned the violence this evening.\n\nHe said: 'The shocking scenes we're seeing on the streets of Britain have nothing to do with the tragedy in Southport.\n\n'This is violent, criminal behaviour that has no place in our society. The police have our full support to deal with these criminals swiftly and they must face the full weight of the law.'\n\nSouth Yorkshire's mayor Oliver Coppard said he is 'utterly appalled by the violence' in Rotherham.\n\n'What we're seeing is not protest, it is brutal thuggery directed against some of the most vulnerable people in our society', he said in a statement.\n\n'The people carrying out these attacks do not represent the beautiful, brilliant place and people I know. We will come after those carrying out this violence with the full force of the law', he added.\n\nWatching the scenes of chaos unfold, former home secretary and Tory party leader hopeful James Cleverly said rioters should be hit with 'the full weight of the law'.\n\n'There is not and can never be any excuse, justification or rationale for behaviour like this,' he tweeted. 'This should be condemned by everybody, and those taking part should expect to be met with the full weight of the law.'\n\nIGH, the parent company of the Holiday Inn chain, told the BBC: 'The safety and security of our guests and colleagues is always our priority.'\n\nA Sky News journalist was approached by a group of masked men with 'potential weapons' in their hands while reporting on the scenes in Middlesbrough this evening.\n\nThe moment was caught on camera as Charlotte Leeming and her team were forced to move back.\n\nMeanwhile, the sight of demonstrators attacking a hotel in the belief it is housing migrants is 'almost incomprehensible', the managing director of the Hope not Hate advocacy group has said.\n\nNick Lowles said he was 'lost for words' to describe the scenes at a Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham.\n\n'The fact that hundreds of people have targeted a hotel that is housing migrants, it is almost incomprehensible,' he told Sky News.\n\n'They knew that people were in that hotel and they consciously tried to set fire to it.\n\n'Communities are so scared, we have to rebuild.'\n\nMr Lowles said agitators have been over-simplifying stories to whip-up hate.\n\nThe disruption across England and Northern Ireland began on Tuesday in Southport, after three little girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class.\n\nElsewhere in Middlesbrough, more than 300 protesters started marching towards the city's Cenotaph today.\n\nThey carried a banner that read: 'Tom Jones is Welsh, Axel Rudakubana isn't' Rudakubana is the 17-year-old accused for murdering the three little girls in Southport and is charged with attempted murder of 10 others.\n\nHis parents were born in Rwanda before moving to the UK in 2002. Rudakubana was born in Cardiff in 2006 before moving to near Southport in 2013.\n\nOthers marching through the city chanted 'we want our country back' as they made their way through the city centre.\n\nAt least two people were taken away in handcuffs within the first half hour, while several pieces of slate were thrown, along with vapes and full plastic bottles.\n\nSome people kicked bollards into the road so that police vehicles driving ahead of the group could not get through, and one man sat on the bonnet of a police car to stop it from moving.\n\nOne Middlesbrough resident said: 'We're going to be paying for this, and for what?\n\n'This has got nothing to do with three little girls that have lost their lives. They've used it to cause utter mayhem on our streets.'\n\nA person was seen being stretchered into an ambulance after an incident at the Swatters Carr pub.\n\nCleveland Police said officers have made nine arrests so far relating to violent disorder offences in Middlesbrough.\n\nThe force said the main areas affected are Parliament Road, Waterloo Road, and the area around the university.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable David Felton said: 'We are urging members of the public to stay away from Middlesbrough while officers respond to violent disorder in the town.\n\n'We have a high policing presence responding to the disorder, and the priority remains to protect people and communities.\n\n'We will continue to make arrests and deal robustly with anyone shown to be intent on committing violence and causing harm.'\n\nSir Keir Starmer will lead the Government's response to a wave of far-right violence and disorder, following reports he would be going on holiday this week.\n\nDowning Street has insisted the Prime Minister will be working from No10 all week as his Government deals with its biggest crisis since winning the election last month.\n\nSlamming Sir Keir's alleged plans to go on holiday, Mr Jenrick told GBN Live: 'I think it would be completely wrong for the Prime Minister to go on holiday whilst parts of Britain are burning.\n\n'I'm sure that the government, like the whole country, sees the severity of the situation.'\n\nThe politician added: 'I know they're trying to get a grip on it and I welcome some of the measures they've already taken, like having more persecutors, having the courts sit weekends, but this is a very serious situation.'\n\nHowever, Chris Webb, the Labour MP for Blackpool South, said Sir Keir 'has to have family time'.\n\nHe told LBC's Matthew Wright: 'The government will continue and we've got an excellent Deputy Prime Minister.\n\n'Keir has to have family time, there's no doubt about it. Every Prime Minister has to have that family time and that break but from what I know of Keir - and I've met him many times, and sitting here in Blackpool several times - he will be continuing to work and monitor the situation wherever he is on holiday.'\n\nCities such as Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester and Belfast have seen vehicles burned, shops destroyed, pedestrians attacked and police officers injured this week following the Southport stabbings on Monday.\n\nArrests have been made across the country, with police warning of more to come once CCTV, social media and body-worn camera footage has been scoured.\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast, which saw several police officers injured. It followed a riot in Sunderland on Friday evening.\n\nA community library on the Merseyside that only opened last year after months of fundraising was set on fire last night as more than 300 people descended on the streets of a deprived city suburb.\n\nMerseyside Police have charged two people with committing violent disorder in Liverpool city centre on Saturday.\n\nOfficers witnessed a group throwing stones, bricks and missiles at officers in the Paradise Street area.\n\nJimmy Bailey, 45, of Station Avenue, Ellesmere Port, has been charged with violent disorder.\n\nHe has been remanded into custody to appear at Liverpool Magistrates' Court at 9.45am on Monday August 5.\n\nDeclan Geiran, 29, of Kelso Road, Liverpool, will appear at the same court after he was charged with violent disorder and arson (to a police vehicle).\n\nAn attempt was made to set a police van alight while it was parked in William Brown Street on Saturday.\n\nThe flames were quickly extinguished before

Some rioters hurled pieces of wood, bottles and chairs, and sprayed fire extinguishers at police officers.\n\nSouth Yorkshire police said at least 10 officers had been injured, including one who was left unconscious with a head injury.\n\nFootage from the scene showed a bin on fire and protesters, some draped in St George and union flags, chanting: \"Get them out.\" The demonstrators appeared at one point to storm into the hotel, with reports of a fire inside, and people peering out of windows.\n\nThe home secretary, Yvette Cooper, condemned the rioters: \"The criminal, violent attack on a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham is utterly appalling,\" she said. \"Deliberately setting fire to a building with people known to be inside.\n\n\"South Yorkshire police have full government support for the strongest action against those responsible.\"\n\nRelated: 'Far-right thugs' will be swiftly brought to justice, Keir Starmer vows\n\nProtests at the Holiday Inn Express began at midday, immediately turning into a riot when a mob of far-right individuals, mostly men, smashed windows and set a stairwell in the building alight, temporarily overwhelming police.\n\nShabnam Shabir, who came as part of a group of counter-protesters, said she had been left traumatised after her group was surrounded and kettled by the mob, who chanted racist words and called her the p-word.\n\n\"It was a lot of angry, angry, angry far right,\" she said. \"This is very scary.\"\n\nShe was left stranded in her car outside the hotel, unable to leave until the rioters did. \"And we have people inside of the hotel who are scared for their lives so it's terrifying.\"\n\nPolice closed roads around the hotel, which is on a major roundabout and connected by roads on three sides. By 5pm, they had made space around the building and pushed the rioters back with their shields.\n\nA number of officers were injured, and one was taken to hospital with a head injury caused by a brick thrown by a member of the far right. One experienced South Yorkshire police officer said it was by far the worst riot he had attended.\n\nA female rioter was crying as she was taken to safety behind the police line with a bleeding wound on the back of her head. Some parents had brought their children, who could be seen throwing stones at the riot police.\n\nOne woman, who had come with her partner and child to demonstrate outside the hotel claimed she had seen asylum seekers \"with machetes and holding the British flag and sticking their fingers up at it\".\n\nNo other witnesses the Guardian spoke to had seen this.\n\n\"We've just come because we want our country back. This hotel was supposed to be for women and children but it's full of men and there are loads of reports of them attacking women and stuff.\"\n\nProtesters occasionally broke into chants of \"Tommy Robinson\", \"Yorkshire\" and \"we want our country back\". Fireworks were aimed in the vicinity of mounted police. Two police helicopters circled ahead. Officers said they were expecting a long night.\n\nJust after 6pm, South Yorkshire police said no hotel employees or guests had been hurt and that officers had regained access to the hotel and were \"continuing to disperse\" the rioters. One arrest has been made so far.\n\nAssistant chief constable Lindsey Butterfield said the behaviour seen had been \"nothing short of disgusting\".\n\nShe said: \"While it was a smaller number of those in attendance who chose to commit violence and destruction, those who simply stood on and watched remain absolutely complicit in this.\n\n\"Those who choose to spread misinformation and hate online also need to take responsibility for the scenes today. This was not a protest, just angry people reacting to a false narrative who have their own motivations for doing so.\n\n\"All today has achieved is the diversion of police and partner resources, operational police officers who will now be away from active duty while they recover from their injuries, and the continued use of public money to clean up the mess they have left behind.\"\n\nThose involved in the violence \"should expect us to be at their doors very soon\", she added.\n\nRioters also gathered outside a Holiday Inn in Tamworth on Sunday evening, Staffordshire police said.\n\nOne officer was injured as people threw projectiles, smashed windows and started a fire, the force added.\n\nProtests were also planned on Sunday in Bolton, Lancaster, Weymouth and Middlesbrough where more than 300 protesters marched through the city centre, chanting: \"We want our country back\".\n\nThe rioters in Middlesbrough threw bricks, cans and pots at police, and pushed burning wheelie bins at a line of officers with shields, leaving a road strewn with smoking rubbish.\n\nOne group walked through a residential area smashing the windows of houses and cars. When asked by a resident why they were breaking windows, one replied \"because we're English\", the PA news agency reported.\n\nCleveland police said \"a number of arrests\" had been made since the protest started at about 2pm. \"The public is asked to avoid the area,\" a statement on social media added.\n\nElsewhere, Merseyside police introduced two section 60 orders giving officers greater stop-and-search powers covering Liverpool and Southport. The orders were put in place at 2pm on Sunday and will stay active for a 12-hour period.\n\nGreater Manchester police said section 60 and section 60AA orders have been authorised across Bolton until 10pm on Sunday, after an early section 34 dispersal notice. A section 60AA requires people to remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance.\n\nRioting and disorder has continued in the wake of the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport on Monday.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims were spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat. In the wake of these messages, far-right protesters - guided by social media - have gathered in towns and cities across the country.\n\nAt least 100 people were arrested after violence on Saturday in Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast.\n\nSeveral police officers were injured, shops were looted and a library providing support for one of the most deprived communities in the country was set on fire.\n\nBut volunteers armed with brushes and bin bags joined council crews who worked through the night to reopen the streets.\n\n\"Yesterday we saw the worst of Hull but already today we have seen the best,\" councillor Jack Haines of Hull city council said on Sunday as he thanked the \"selfless\" volunteers.\n\nRelated: 'Nick them quick' approach to be used against UK rioters, minister says\n\nThe community also rallied together to help council workers in County Road, Walton, where the ground floor of Spellow Lane Library Hub suffered severe fire damage. Shelves of books were knocked over at the library which was due to host a programme of activities for young people in August and adult learning courses in September.\n\n\"I want to pay tribute to Merseyside police, the emergency services and Liverpool city council staff for their fast response in cleaning up, and also to those residents who came out to help - it has been heartening to see, and that is the real spirit of our city,\" said councillor Liam Robinson, the leader of Liverpool city council.\n\n\"The violence we have seen on our streets is the manipulation of tragic events, an attack on our community by wanton criminals. We can't allow a minority of mindless thugs to win. They are not representative of our city and we will be working with partners to ensure the perpetrators are swiftly brought to justice.\n\n\"Our priority is to assess the damage to Spellow Library and to bring it back into use as quickly as possible.\"\n\nFaith leaders across Merseyside said that communities who have been hard hit by the Southport killings and the violence that has spread afterwards are trying to rebuild.\n\nIn a joint statement, they said: \"The people of all faiths and none who came out to sweep the streets, to rebuild walls and have so generously donated money in memory of those three girls: that is the spirit that will help us through this incredibly challenging time.\n\n\"While the events of this week may continue to shake our belief in humanity, it remains intact.\n\n\"We need to remain calm and peaceful at this time and, as faith leaders, we are united in our desire for peace and justice. Now is the time to take pride in our community spirit again.\n\n\"Within our different communities we pray for all those affected. And for all those injured to make a good recovery.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emine_sinmaz@aol.co.uk", "name": "Emine Sinmaz",

While it was a smaller number of those in attendance who chose to commit violence and destruction, those who simply stood on and watched remain absolutely complicit in this,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield. \"We have officers working hard, reviewing the considerable online imagery and footage of those involved, and they should expect us to be at their doors very soon.\"\n\nLate on Sunday, Staffordshire Police said that a hotel near Birmingham, which was known to have sheltered asylum seekers, was also targeted.\n\n\"A large group of individuals\" have been \"throwing projectiles, smashing windows, starting fires and targeting police\" at the hotel in the town of Tamworth, with one officer injured, the statement said.\n\nThe unrest is the latest in a wave of rioting in the country since a stabbing rampage at a dance class last week in the northwestern town of Southport left three girls dead and several more injured.\n\nAccording to police, false rumours were spread online that the 17-year-old suspect in the knife attack was a Muslim immigrant. He was named in court last week as British-born Axel Rudakubana after a judge lifted reporting restrictions related to people under the age of 18.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer promised a swift response.\n\n\"I guarantee, you will regret taking part in this disorder. Whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,\" Starmer said in a TV address.\n\nPeople look out from inside a hotel window in Rotherham, UK, August 4, 2024 [Hollie Adams/Reuters]\n\nThere was \"no justification\" for what he called \"far-right thuggery\", which has led to attacks on mosques and assaults on Muslims and ethnic minorities, he added.\n\n\"People in this country have a right to be safe and yet we have seen Muslim communities targeted and attacks on mosques,\" Starmer said.\n\n\"To those who feel targeted because of the colour of your skin or your faith, I know how frightening this must be,\" he said.\n\n\"I want you to know this violent mob does not represent this country and we will bring them to justice.\"\n\nStarmer had been criticised by some for not being vocal enough in denouncing the explicitly racist and Islamophobic nature of some of the attacks committed by those rioting.\n\nZarah Sultana, a Labour MP who is currently suspended from the party for voting against the government, called on social media for Parliament to be recalled from its summer break.\n\nXenophobic rhetoric\n\nElsewhere in the UK, the atmosphere was also tense. In the northeast town of Middlesborough, protesters broke free of a police cordon. As protests began in Bolton, near Manchester, police said that a dispersal notice had been authorised to give officers extra powers to tackle antisocial behaviour.\n\nPolice officials have said many of the actions are being organised online by shadowy far-right groups, who are mobilising support with phrases like \"enough is enough,\" \"save our kids\" and \"stop the boats\". They are tapping into a narrative - amplified by right-wing media outlets and commentators - about the scale of immigration in the UK, in particular migrants and refugees arriving in small boats from France across the English Channel.\n\nThe new disturbances came after police said that more than 150 people had been arrested since Saturday following unrest in Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Blackpool and Hull, as well as Belfast in Northern Ireland.\n\nCritics have repeatedly pointed out that the spread of misinformation and the amplification of xenophobic rhetoric about immigrants and minority communities in the UK has led to the current outbreak of violence.\n\nRosa Freedman, a professor at the University of Reading, told Al Jazeera that the riots were a result of the former Conservative government, which lost power last month, giving legitimacy to a small minority of \"racists\".\n\n\"Instead of hiding their faces, they have now been coming out... we cannot blame a Labour Party that has [only] been in government [for] the past four weeks,\" she said.\n\nPolice used dogs to deal with the disturbances in Rotherham [Hollie Adams/Reuters]\n\n\"There is a conversation that needs to be had in the UK and other countries about immigration.... We also need to tackle this from a human rights lens.\"\n\nPolice have noted that calls to hold riots have come from a diffuse group of social media accounts, but a key player in amplifying them is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a longtime far-right agitator who uses the name Tommy Robinson.\n\nHe led the English Defence League, which the Merseyside Police has linked to the violent protest in Southport on Tuesday, a day after the stabbing attack. Yaxley-Lennon, 41, has been jailed for assault, contempt of court and mortgage fraud and currently faces an arrest warrant after leaving the UK last week before a scheduled hearing in contempt-of-court proceedings against him.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigel Farage, who was elected to Parliament in July for the first time as leader of the right-wing Reform UK, has also been blamed by many for encouraging - indirectly - the anti-immigration sentiment that has been evident over the past few days.\n\nWhile condemning the violence, Farage has criticised the government for blaming it on \"a few far-right thugs\" and saying that \"the far right is a reaction to fear... shared by tens of millions of people\".\n\nThe anti-far-right group Hope Not Hate condemned the framing of the protests as \"outpourings of legitimate anger\".\n\n\"They are not. This is racist violence spurred on by far-right hatred,\" the group said in a statement. \"Those directly involved in these horrifying scenes need to face the full force of the law.\"\n\n\"Responsibility also lies with those who have promoted and defended these riots such as Tommy Robinson. This explosion of racist violence across the country is the result of years of far-right agitation,\" the group said.\n\n\"However, these events are also the result of a climate of anti-Muslim and anti-asylum seeker hostility stoked by elements of our media and supposedly mainstream politicians.\"", "source": {"uri": "hiiraan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hiiraan Online"}, "authors": [],

One arrest had already been made and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\", the force warned.\n\nA similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth on Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed, in a scene which saw fires, smashed windows and missiles being thrown at officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, a group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nThere were 43 arrests, with crown court and university buildings sustaining significant damage, Cleveland Police said.\n\nMeanwhile, Greater Manchester Police used powers amid disturbances in Bolton to order people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nThe widespread and continued disorder, which broke out in the wake of a knife attack last week which left three girls dead, prompted some MPs to demand Parliament is recalled so the problems can be debated in the Commons, as it was during the 2011 riots.\n\nThe Government has also faced calls for the army to be called in to quell the unrest but ministers have so far insisted police have the resources needed to respond.\n\nMs Priti told Times Radio: \"I would not feel safe in some of the areas and communities where we've seen racism and thuggery on our streets.\n\n\"And I think some of the individuals that are now involved in this violence, disorder and racism that we are seeing in parts of the country - that's no different to the type of racism that I experienced when I was growing up, and I just think that there's no place for that in our amazing country,\" she added.\n\nThe Tory MP for Witham in Essex said that claims there is \"two-tier policing\" in Britain, where right-wing protests are dealt with more harshly than left-wing ones, are \"not correct\".",

Towns and cities across England suffered violence, disorder and looting at the hands of hate-filled anti-migrant mobs.\n\nThe PM used an emergency statement from No10 last night to tell those involved: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part.\" He added: \"Whether directly, or those whipping up this action online, and then running away themselves.

There is no justification for this action.\" Amid attacks on mosques, Nazi salutes and racist rhetoric on our streets, the PM said: \"I won't shy away from calling this what it is: Far-right thuggery.\"\n\nMr Starmer will today chair an emergency Cobra meeting with senior ministers and police officials. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper also condemned the \"criminal, violent\" attack on the hotel, saying it was \"utterly appalling\".\n\nShe added: \"Deliberately setting fire to a building with people known to be inside. South Yorkshire Police have full government support for the strongest action against those responsible.\"\n\nIn Middlesbrough, bricks and wheelie bins stuffed with burning debris were hurled at police officers in riot gear. People were detained during disorder in Nottingham's Market Square, and police in Sunderland raided homes and made arrests following Saturday's violence.\n\nLast night, the Home Office announced mosques will be offered greater protection with \"emergency security\". A total of over \u00a350million has been set aside to protect faith communities.\n\nMs Cooper added: \"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, alongside the support from local police forces... anyone involved in this disorder and violence will face the full force of the law.\n\n\"As a nation, we will not tolerate criminal behaviour, extremism and racist attacks that go against everything our country stands for.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_cowburn@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Ashley Cowburn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_salute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi salute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Inn", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holiday Inn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yorkshire_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Yorkshire Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunderland A.F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesbrough", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middlesbrough"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Middlesbrough"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33393510.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Southport-incident.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789876", "eventUri": "eng-9789876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The stabbing deaths of three young girls in Southport, northwest England, earlier this week catalyzed the violence, according to CNN.\n\nTo incite anti-Muslim and anti-immigration demonstrations, the far right has exploited and disseminated a surge of misinformation, including unfounded allegations that the assailant was an immigrant.\n\nThe suspect was born in Britain, according to police. CNN geolocated footage shows demonstrators attacking and burning two Holiday Inns in northern England on Sunday: one in Rotherham and one in Tamworth, which had previously been criticised by a local lawmaker for hosting asylum seekers.\n\nLocal officials said that demonstrators in Tamworth injured one police officer by throwing projectiles, smashing windows, and starting fires.\n\nMeanwhile, police in Rotherham reported that demonstrators broke windows, flung wooden planks, attacked policemen with fire extinguishers and set fire to other objects in an attempt to enter the premises.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield said in a statement that the hotel in Rotherham was at the time \"full of terrified residents and staff,\" according to CNN.\n\nThe UK's minister of police has stated that far-right rioters who have caused disturbances will be dealt with \"nick them quick,\" but he has also stated that the army is not necessary.\n\nJust weeks after taking office, Keir Starmer's Labour government faces a formidable battle from the violent upheaval, which is the worst since the 2011 riots.\n\nIn reaction to recent attacks, the UK Home Office declared on Sunday that mosques would receive \"greater protection with new emergency security\" in the country.\n\nUnder the new arrangements, \"the police, local authorities and mosques can ask for rapid security to be deployed, protecting communities and allowing for a return to worship as quickly as possible,\" the Home Office said, according to CNN.\n\nStarmer shared a post on X and wrote, \"I utterly condemn the far-right thuggery we have seen this weekend. Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law.\"\n\nIn his video message on X, he issued a stern warning to those involved in the recent violence and riots and emphasized that the full force of the law would be brought to bear on individuals who participated in the violence, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n\"Be in no doubt, those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law. The police will be making arrests, individuals will be held on remand, charges will follow and convictions will follow. I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,\" said the UK PM.\n\n\"This is not a protest. It is organised violent thuggery. And it has no place on our streets or online. Right now, there are attacks happening on a hotel in Rotherham. Marauding gangs intent on law-breaking.

South Yorkshire Police says the event was attended by at least 700 people.\n\nIt mirrors other demonstrations and violent outbreaks across the country including in Liverpool, Hull and Tamworth, stemming from the alleged murder of three little girls - Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine - in Southport last week.\n\n17-year-old Axel Muganwa Rudakubana has been charged with three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and one count of possessing a bladed article after children were attacked with a knife at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class.\n\nMany national media outlets have reported Rudakubana is not an immigrant, but was born in Cardiff and moved to Southport in 2013, and has no known links to the Islamic faith.\n\nHowever, the incident, as well as misinformation spread about the alleged offender before he was publicly identified, has escalated into violent demonstrations against immigration nationwide by groups condemned by No 10 as \"far-right thugs.\" A sign held by a protestor at Rotherham sums up the hateful sentiment as \"stop the boats, stop the stabbings.\"\n\nIn Rotherham, police began arriving at around 12 noon as disorder spread among protestors, and by 2pm the demonstration turned violent. Many people left but photos show how many more stayed to take part in, film, and watch clashes with police.\n\nAs the scene intensified, rioters smashed ground floor windows and hurled bricks, plans and bottle at officers, who were also sprayed with fire extinguishers. An industrial sized bin closed to a window of the hotel was set on fire.\n\nOfficers in black riot gear with shields formed a line to corral the crowds away from the scene.\n\nPhotos show how the disorder spread to nearby estates in Manvers. Photos show how fence panels were torn up in Kingsbrook Chase and thrown at officers.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police this morning confirmed the extent of the damages and injuries at the riot in Rotherham.\n\nAt least ten officers were injured as a result of the violence, with one left unconscious following a head injury, another suffering a suspected fractured elbow and other suffering suspected broken bones.\n\nNo hotel employees or residents have been reported as injured as a result of today's disorder.\n\nGround floor windows have been shattered across the hotel. A generator was also set alight, and a number of small grass fires were set. These, alongside the fire in the bin against the window, were extinguished by South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.\n\nOne person has been arrested on suspicion of public order offences.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield condemned the violence in Rotherham and said those involved can \"expect us at their doors very soon.\"\n\nShe said: \"The mindless actions of those today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear.\n\n\"This was not a protest, just angry people, reacting to a false narrative, shared by people who have their own motivations for doing so.\n\nSubscribe to The Star's newsletter for all the latest news in South Yorkshire delivered direct to your inbox\n\n\"The behaviour we witnessed has been nothing short of disgusting. While it was a smaller number of those in attendance who chose to commit violence and destruction, those who simply stood on and watched remain absolutely complicit in this.\n\n\"Those who choose to spread misinformation and hate online, also need to take responsibility for the scenes today.\n\n\"Please be assured, our work does not end today - we have officers working hard, reviewing the considerable online imagery and footage of those involved, and they should expect us to be at their doors very soon.\"\n\nDowning Street is expected to hold a Cobra emergency response meeting today (August 5) over the nationwide protests.\n\nPM Keir Starmer vowed rioters would \"regret\" engaging in \"far-right thuggery\" and promised those involved in unrest would \"face the full force of the law\" as he addressed the nation on Sunday.\n\nMonday's meeting is due to involve relevant ministers and police representatives who will discuss the response in the coming days to ensure there is no repeat of the violent scenes.\n\nThe Home Office announced on Sunday that mosques would be offered greater protection under a new \"rapid response process\" designed to quickly tackle the threat of further attacks on places of worship.\n\nMinisters have so far insisted police have the resources required to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army.\n\nSir Keir said he wanted those who \"feel targeted because of the colour of their skin\" to know \"this violent mob do not represent our country\".\n\nIn his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nDame Sara Khan, who was Rishi Sunak's independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience until May, blamed the Conservative government for leaving the country open to far-right violence.\n\n\"The writing was clearly on the wall for some time,\" she told the Guardian.\n\nWriting in The Times, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said \"there will be reckoning\" for people who took part in the unrest and those who \"whipped them up on social media and in online chat forums\".\n\n\"Whatever they and some of their political supporters may tell us, these are not patriots standing up for their communities,\" she said.\n\n\"They are thugs, criminals and extremists who betray the values our country is built on.\"\n\nShe said those responsible would be \"paying the price for years to come\".", "source": {"uri": "thestar.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Protesters clashed with police, hurling wood, bottles, and chairs, and spraying fire extinguishers at officers.South Yorkshire Police confirmed that at least ten officers were injured, including one who was left unconscious with a head injury.\n\nFootage from the scene showed a large bin on fire near the hotel, as protesters chanted, \"Get them out,\" draped in St George and Union flags. Reports indicate that some rioters stormed the hotel, with fire being set inside and asylum seekers seen peering out of windows in fear.\n\nPrime Minister condemns violence\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the attack, describing it as \"far-right thuggery\" and vowing that the perpetrators would face swift justice. \"This is not a protest, it is organized, violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets or online,\" Starmer said in a statement from 10 Downing Street.\n\n\"Be in no doubt: Those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law,\" Starmer said, noting that the police would be making arrests and that charges would follow. \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves. This is not protest. It is organized, violent thuggery.\"\n\nThe violence in Rotherham is part of a broader wave of unrest that has spread across the country, following a deadly stabbing rampage at a dance class that left three girls dead. The far-right has seized on the incident, using it to stoke anti-immigration sentiments and organize violent demonstrations.\n\nNationwide unrest\n\nIn the northeastern town of Middlesbrough, tensions flared as protesters broke through police lines, vandalizing homes and cars, and attacking officers with bricks and cans. Similar scenes were reported across other towns, where far-right protesters have targeted minority communities and law enforcement.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield of South Yorkshire Police condemned the rioters' actions, emphasizing that even those who did not participate in the violence were complicit by standing by. \"We have officers working hard, reviewing the considerable online imagery and footage of those involved, and they should expect us to be at their doors very soon,\" Butterfield warned.\n\nFar-right agitation and online mobilization\n\nThe violence has been fueled by far-right groups exploiting fears over immigration, particularly the increasing number of migrants crossing the English Channel. These groups have rallied support through social media, with slogans such as \"enough is enough\" and \"stop the boats.\" Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, has been identified as a key figure in amplifying these messages, despite facing legal challenges and an arrest warrant.\n\nLegal and social consequences\n\nThe recent violence has overwhelmed the criminal justice system, which is already struggling with a significant backlog of cases. Stephen Parkinson, Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales, stated that extra legal resources have been deployed to ensure swift prosecution of those involved in the unrest.\n\nPrime Minister Starmer's administration faces mounting pressure to address the root causes of the violence and to ensure public safety amid the rise in far-right activity. As the country grapples with the aftermath of these events, questions remain about the broader implications for social cohesion and the response to far-right extremism in the UK.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Photograph: Hollie Adams/Reuters\n\nHundreds of arrests have been made as police officers in riot gear responded to violent scenes in Rotherham, Middlesbrough, Bolton and other parts of the United Kingdom on Sunday, after days of some of the worst rioting seen on the streets of the country in the wake of the fatal stabbings of three schoolgirls in Southport, north-west England.\n\nHotels housing asylum seekers and mosques have been among the targets of the anti-immigrant mobs after initial false claims spread online regarding the stabbing suspect being an immigrant who arrived in the country illegally.\n\n\"I utterly condemn the far-right thuggery we have seen this weekend. Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law,\" said Starmer in a statement on Sunday.\n\n\"There is no justification -- none -- for taking this action, and all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe and yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, (and) wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric. So, no, I won't shy away from calling this what it is: far-right thuggery,\" he said.\n\nHe will chair the emergency Cabinet Office Briefing Room A (COBRA) meeting with UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss the future course of action to curb the violence.\n\nThe Home Office has also announced that mosques will be offered greater protection with new 'emergency security' that can be rapidly deployed to respond to violent disorder targeting places of worship.\n\n\"They do not speak for our communities. It's a total disgrace, and there has to be a reckoning. Those individuals who are involved in the disorder need to know that they will pay a price,\" said Cooper, as she indicated that additional prosecutors and courts are on standby to charge those being arrested for a series of offences.\n\n\"We have made very clear to the police that they have our full support in pursuing the full range of prosecutions and penalties, including the serious prison sentences, long-term tagging, travel bans and more,\" she said.\n\nDuring clashes over the weekend, cars were set alight, windows smashed, large bins burnt and hurled at officers and stores looted. Masked anti-immigration mobs broke into a hotel housing asylum-seekers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and rocks and long pieces of wood were thrown at police officers who lined up in front of the building as they tried to protect it.\n\n\"The mindless actions of those today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield of South Yorkshire Police.\n\nSeveral police officers have suffered injuries as they faced off with the mobs, who are being fuelled by misinformation being spread online.\n\nThe riots started in Southport, near Liverpool, last week following the stabbing of a group of young children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on July 29.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, who has been charged with three murders and other attempted murders, was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents.\n\nHowever, initial misinformed social media posts claimed he was a refugee who arrived last year on a small boat.\n\nSouthport residents, including the mother of one of the girls who died, have called for the protesters to stop and that they do not speak for them.",

Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law,\" said Starmer in a statement on Sunday.\n\n\"There is no justification - none - for taking this action, and all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe and yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, (and) wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric. So, no, I won't shy away from calling this what it is: far-right thuggery,\" he said.\n\nHe will chair the emergency Cabinet Office Briefing Room A (COBRA) meeting with UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss the future course of action to curb the violence. The Home Office has also announced that mosques will be offered greater protection with new \"emergency security\" that can be rapidly deployed to respond to violent disorder targeting places of worship.\n\n\"They do not speak for our communities. It's a total disgrace, and there has to be a reckoning. Those individuals who are involved in the disorder need to know that they will pay a price,\" said Cooper, as she indicated that additional prosecutors and courts are on standby to charge those being arrested for a series of offences.\n\n\"We have made very clear to the police that they have our full support in pursuing the full range of prosecutions and penalties, including the serious prison sentences, long-term tagging, travel bans and more,\" she said.\n\nDuring clashes over the weekend, cars were set alight, windows smashed, large bins burnt and hurled at officers and stores looted. Masked anti-immigration mobs broke into a hotel housing asylum-seekers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and rocks and long pieces of wood were thrown at police officers who lined up in front of the building as they tried to protect it.\n\n\"The mindless actions of those today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield of South Yorkshire Police.\n\nSeveral police officers have suffered injuries as they faced off with the mobs, who are being fuelled by misinformation being spread online. The riots started in Southport, near Liverpool, last week following the stabbing of a group of young children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on July 29.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, who has been charged with three murders and other attempted murders, was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents. However, initial misinformed social media posts claimed he was a refugee who arrived last year on a small boat. Southport residents, including the mother of one of the girls who died, have called for the protesters to stop and that they do not speak for them.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com",

It is organized, violent thuggery. And it has no place on our street or online,\" he said.\n\nViolence instigated by far-right protesters has erupted throughout cities in Britain after three children were killed and eight others were wounded, five critically, in a stabbing spree committed July 29 at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the seaside town of Southport. Two adults were also injured\n\nThe suspected perpetrator was arrested and charged. The 17-year-old has since been identified as Axel Muganwa Rudakubana.\n\nViolent Protests that began in Southport -- which police said appeared to have been connected to the far-right, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant English Defense League -- have spread to other cities.\n\nOver the weekend, police made some 150 arrests across the country, the National Police Chiefs' Council said in a statement Sunday.\n\nAs Starmer was speaking Sunday, police in northern Rotherham were responding to attacks on the Holiday Inn Express Hotel in Rotherham's Manvers district known for being occupied by asylum seekers.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police, which oversees the city, said some 700 protesters had converged on the hotel. Planks of wood, glass bottles and cans were thrown at police by protesters who also sprayed law enforcement with fire extinguishers.\n\nFires were lit a blaze as was a generator, though they were all put out in short order.\n\nThe violence resulted in one arrest -- at least so far as authorities are calling on the public for information about the protest -- and at least 10 police officers injured, including one who was knocked unconscious and another suffering a suspected fractured elbow.\n\nNo employees or residents of the hotel were injured, South Yorkshire Police said.\n\n\"The mindless actions of those today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear,\" Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield of South Yorkshire Police said in a statement.\n\n\"The behavior we witnessed has been nothing short of disgusting.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said South Yorkshire Police have full government support to take the \"strongest action\" against those responsible.\n\n\"The criminal, violent attack on a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham is utterly appalling,\" she said on X.\n\nA second hotel came under attack in Tamworth, which is located just northeast of Birmingham. Petrol bombs and fireworks were launched by protesters at law enforcement and the hotel, putting the lives of those inside at risk, Staffordshire Police said in a statement.\n\nAt least 10 people in the city have been arrested, but that number is expected to climb as a senior investigating officer as been appointed to carry out an investigation of the incident, which police say was pre-planned.\n\nThose arrested remain in custody, it said.\n\nStarmer said that in the unrest they have seen Nazi salutes as well as attacks on mosques and members of the Muslim and other minority communities. There has been \"wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric,\" he said.\n\n\"To those who feel targeted because of the color of your skin or your father, I know how frightening this must be.

Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law.\"\n\nIn his video message on X, he issued a stern warning to those involved in the recent violence and riots and emphasized that the full force of the law would be brought to bear on individuals who participated in the violence, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n\"Be in no doubt, those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law.

One arrest had already been made and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\", the force warned.\n\nA similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth on Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed, in a scene which saw fires, smashed windows and missiles being thrown at officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, a group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nThere were 43 arrests, with crown court and university buildings sustaining significant damage, Cleveland Police said.\n\nMeanwhile Greater Manchester Police used powers amid disturbances in Bolton to order people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nThe widespread and continued disorder, which broke out in the wake of a knife attack last week which left three girls dead, prompted some MPs to demand Parliament is recalled so the problems can be debated in the Commons, as it was during the 2011 riots.\n\nThe Government has also faced calls for the army to be called in to quell the unrest but ministers have so far insisted police have the resources needed to respond.\n\nDame Priti told Times Radio: \"I would not feel safe in some of the areas and communities where we've seen racism and thuggery on our streets.\n\n\"I grew up with people using the P-word against me.\n\n\"And I think some of the individuals that are now involved in this violence, disorder and racism that we are seeing in parts of the country - that's no different to the type of racism that I experienced when I was growing up, and I just think that there's no place for that in our amazing country,\" she added.\n\nThe Tory MP for Witham in Essex said that claims there is \"two-tier policing\" in Britain, where right-wing protests are dealt with more harshly than left-wing ones, are \"not correct\".", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Windows and doors were smashed at the hotel, with large bins set alight outside the building.\n\nPolice officers with riot shields surrounded the building and are trying to push people back.\n\nSimilar riots have taken place in Bolton, Southport and Middlesbrough, where crowds broke through police barriers.\n\nA policing minister told the media that the marches have left people \"frightened because of the colour of their skin\".\n\nSouth Yorkshire's Mayor Oliver Coppard said he was \"utterly appalled by the violence\" that took place in Rotherham.\n\n\"What we're seeing is not protest, it is brutal thuggery directed against some of the most vulnerable people in our society,\" he added, saying that those carrying out the violence will be dealt with using full force of the law.\n\nIn Middlesbrough, over 300 people gathered, smashing taxis and forcing local businesses to close early. Police used dogs to hold rioters back, before making arrests.\n\nAnti-Muslim groups in Leeds shouted, \"you're not English anymore\" and \"paedo Muslims off our street\".\n\nIn an address on Sunday, Starmer said that \"gangs intent on law-breaking and nothing else\" were responsible for what was happening in Rotherham, adding \"if you target people because of the colour of their skin or faith, that is far-right and I'm prepared to say so.\"\n\nHe vowed to do \"whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice\".\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper, said police would have the government's full support to take strong action, adding \"criminal violence and disorder have no place on Britain's streets.\"\n\n\"Anyone who gets involved in criminal disorder and violent thuggery on our streets will have to pay the price and they should expect there to be arrests, prosecutions, penalties and the full force of the law including imprisonment and travel bans. There are consequences for breaking the law,\" she said.\n\nThe wave of violent riots come after 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana stabbed three girls and wounded several others and false information about him was shared online, suggesting he was a Muslim or an illegal immigrant.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

More violence spread across the country triggered by a stabbing rampage at a dance class that claimed the lives of three girls and injured several others.\n\nIssuing a statement from 10 Downing Street on Sunday, Starmer vowed that the authorities will \"do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice\". \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves. This is not a protest, it is organised, violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets or online,\" he said.\n\nHis remarks came after another day of far-right violence which was primarily prevalent in the north of England town of Rotherham where the police confronted the challenge of stopping hundreds of rioters who sought to barge into the Holiday Inn Express hotel which was being used as accommodation for asylum-seekers.\n\nThe police officials had to use shields to protect themselves from the barrage of missiles, which included bits of wood, chairs and fire extinguishers, fired at them. A large bin close to a window of the hotel was also set alight but the small fire was extinguished.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police, which is responsible for Rotherham, said at least 10 officers have been injured, including one who was left unconscious.\n\n\"The behaviour we witnessed has been nothing short of disgusting. While it was a smaller number of those in attendance who chose to commit violence and destruction, those who simply stood on and watched remain absolutely complicit in this,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield.\n\n\"We have officers working hard, reviewing the considerable online imagery and footage of those involved, and they should expect us to be at their doors very soon.\"\n\nFar-right agitators have sought to take advantage of last week's stabbing attack by tapping into concerns about the scale of immigration in the UK, in particular the tens of thousands of migrants arriving in small boats from France across the English Channel.\n\nWhen asked by a resident why they were breaking windows, one man replied, \"Because we're English.\" Hundreds of others squared up to police with shields at the town's cenotaph, throwing bricks, cans and pots at officers. Starmer said anyone targeting people for the colour of their skin or their faith is far-right.\n\n\"People in this country have a right to be safe, and yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery,\" he said.\n\n(With AP inputs)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The police will be making arrests. Individuals will be held on remand. Charges will follow. And convictions will follow.

Marauding gangs intent on law breaking. Or worse. Windows smashed. Fires set ablaze. Residents and staff in absolute fear. There is no justification - none - for taking this action.\"\n\nIn a note to those on the right who appeared to have given some justification to the scenes including Tory Hampshire police and crime commissioner Donna Jones and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, he added: \"All right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence.\"\n\nHe went on: \"People in this country have a right to be safe. And yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted. Attacks on Mosques. Other minority communities singled out. Nazi salutes in the street. Attacks on the police. Wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric.\"\n\nHe added: \"To those who feel targeted because of the colour of your skin or your faith I know how frightening this must be. I want you to know this violent mob do not represent our country. And we will bring them to justice.\n\n\"Our police deserve our support, as they tackle any and all violent disorder that flares up.

Keir Starmer vowed rioters would \"regret\" engaging in \"far-right thuggery\", and promised those involved in unrest would \"face the full force of the law\".\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person had already been arrested and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\".\n\nA similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth into the evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed.\n\nPeople threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nThere were 35 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said.\n\nGreater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order amid disturbances in Bolton, requiring people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nViolence has broken out in several parts of England and Northern Ireland following the killing of three young girls in Southport last week.\n\nThe former first minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf said the army should be called in to stop \"thugs\" causing disorder on the streets.\n\nMinisters have so far insisted police have the resources they need to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army.\n\nSir Keir said he wanted those who \"feel targeted because of the colour of their skin\" to know \"this violent mob do not represent our country\".\n\nIn his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nDame Sara Khan, who was Rishi Sunak's independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience until May, blamed the Conservative government for leaving the country open to far-right violence.\n\n\"The writing was clearly on the wall for some time,\" she told the Guardian.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper will appear on news programmes on Monday morning, where she is likely to be asked how the government plans to tackle the continued disorder.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker",

The meeting comes after Starmer's stern warning to the far-right thugs responsible for the violence, disorder, and looting in towns and cities across England, targeting asylum seekers and mosques.\n\nIn his emergency statement from No10 last night, the PM made it clear that those involved in the riots will face severe consequences. \"I guarantee you will regret taking part,\" he said, addressing both the direct participants and those inciting the violence online. Starmer emphasized that this is not a protest but rather \"organised, violent thuggery,\" and assured the public that those responsible will face the full force of the law, with arrests, remand, charges, and convictions to follow.\n\nThe PM's statement came in the wake of an attack on a Holiday Inn Express housing asylum seekers in Rotherham, where crowds assaulted police officers and smashed windows, leaving residents and staff in \"absolute fear.\"\n\nStarmer condemned the rioters as \"marauding gangs intent on law-breaking or worse\" and said that there is no justification for such actions. Amid the Nazi salutes, racist rhetoric, and attacks on mosques, the PM did not hesitate to label the violence as \"far-right thuggery.\"\n\nHome secretary Yvette Cooper also strongly denounced the \"criminal, violent\" attack on the hotel, calling it \"utterly appalling\" and highlighting the fact that the perpetrators deliberately set fire to a building known to have people inside. She assured that South Yorkshire Police have the full support of the government in taking the strongest action against those responsible.\n\nThe violence was not limited to Rotherham; in Middlesbrough, police officers in riot gear were attacked with bricks and burning debris-filled wheelie bins. Arrests were made in Nottingham's Market Square during the disorder, and police in Sunderland conducted raids on homes and made arrests in connection with Saturday's violence. In response to the attacks on mosques, the Home Office has announced \"emergency security\" measures and allocated over \u00a350 million to protect faith communities.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law,\" said Starmer in a statement on Sunday.\n\n\"There is no justification -- none -- for taking this action, and all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe and yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, (and) wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric. So, no, I won't shy away from calling this what it is: far-right thuggery,\" he said.\n\nHe will chair the emergency Cabinet Office Briefing Room A (COBRA) meeting with UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss the future course of action to curb the violence. The Home Office has also announced that mosques will be offered greater protection with new \"emergency security\" that can be rapidly deployed to respond to violent disorder targeting places of worship.\n\n\"They do not speak for our communities. It's a total disgrace, and there has to be a reckoning. Those individuals who are involved in the disorder need to know that they will pay a price,\" said Cooper, as she indicated that additional prosecutors and courts are on standby to charge those being arrested for a series of offences.\n\n\"We have made very clear to the police that they have our full support in pursuing the full range of prosecutions and penalties, including the serious prison sentences, long-term tagging, travel bans and more,\" she said.\n\nDuring clashes over the weekend, cars were set alight, windows smashed, large bins burnt and hurled at officers and stores looted. Masked anti-immigration mobs broke into a hotel housing asylum-seekers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and rocks and long pieces of wood were thrown at police officers who lined up in front of the building as they tried to protect it.\n\n\"The mindless actions of those today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield of South Yorkshire Police.\n\nSeveral police officers have suffered injuries as they faced off with the mobs, who are being fuelled by misinformation being spread online. The riots started in Southport, near Liverpool, last week following the stabbing of a group of young children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on July 29.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, who has been charged with three murders and other attempted murders, was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents. However, initial misinformed social media posts claimed he was a refugee who arrived last year on a small boat. Southport residents, including the mother of one of the girls who died, have called for the protesters to stop and that they do not speak for them.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com",

One arrest had already been made and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\", the force warned.\n\nA similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth on Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed, in a scene which saw fires, smashed windows and missiles being thrown at officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, a group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nThere were 43 arrests, with crown court and university buildings sustaining significant damage, Cleveland Police said.\n\nMeanwhile Greater Manchester Police used powers amid disturbances in Bolton to order people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nThe widespread and continued disorder, which broke out in the wake of a knife attack last week which left three girls dead, prompted some MPs to demand Parliament is recalled so the problems can be debated in the Commons, as it was during the 2011 riots.\n\nThe Government has also faced calls for the army to be called in to quell the unrest but ministers have so far insisted police have the resources needed to respond.\n\nDame Priti told Times Radio: \"I would not feel safe in some of the areas and communities where we've seen racism and thuggery on our streets.\n\n\"I grew up with people using the P-word against me.\n\n\"And I think some of the individuals that are now involved in this violence, disorder and racism that we are seeing in parts of the country - that's no different to the type of racism that I experienced when I was growing up, and I just think that there's no place for that in our amazing country,\" she added.\n\nThe Tory MP for Witham in Essex said that claims there is \"two-tier policing\" in Britain, where right-wing protests are dealt with more harshly than left-wing ones, are \"not correct\".", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law,\" said Starmer in a statement on Sunday.\n\n\"There is no justification - none - for taking this action, and all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe and yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, (and) wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric. So, no, I won't shy away from calling this what it is: far-right thuggery,\" he said.\n\nUK police question teenage suspect after 2 children killed, 9 injured in stabbing\n\nHe will chair the emergency Cabinet Office Briefing Room A (COBRA) meeting with UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss the future course of action to curb the violence. The Home Office has also announced that mosques will be offered greater protection with new \"emergency security\" that can be rapidly deployed to respond to violent disorder targeting places of worship.\n\n\"They do not speak for our communities. It's a total disgrace, and there has to be a reckoning. Those individuals who are involved in the disorder need to know that they will pay a price,\" said Cooper, as she indicated that additional prosecutors and courts are on standby to charge those being arrested for a series of offences.\n\n\"We have made very clear to the police that they have our full support in pursuing the full range of prosecutions and penalties, including the serious prison sentences, long-term tagging, travel bans and more,\" she said.\n\nDuring clashes over the weekend, cars were set alight, windows smashed, large bins burnt and hurled at officers and stores looted. Masked anti-immigration mobs broke into a hotel housing asylum-seekers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and rocks and long pieces of wood were thrown at police officers who lined up in front of the building as they tried to protect it.\n\n\"The mindless actions of those today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield of South Yorkshire Police.\n\nSeveral police officers have suffered injuries as they faced off with the mobs, who are being fuelled by misinformation being spread online. The riots started in Southport, near Liverpool, last week following the stabbing of a group of young children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on July 29.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, who has been charged with three murders and other attempted murders, was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents. However, initial misinformed social media posts claimed he was a refugee who arrived last year on a small boat. Southport residents, including the mother of one of the girls who died, have called for the protesters to stop and that they do not speak for them.", "source": {"uri": "easternmirrornagaland.com",

A mob of up to 300 people, including members of the English Defense League - an anti-Muslim far-right group, targets a mosque in the town, attacks police, torches cars and destroys properties, leaving at least 50 officers injured. Merseyside Police arrest four people.\n\nJuly 31: The disorder spreads to Newton Heath, in north Manchester. Rioters target a Holiday Inn hotel that is believed to house asylum seekers, throwing missiles at police and attacking a bus driver. In Hartlepool, over 100 people clash with police, with some shouting anti-Islamic slurs. Violent scenes also unfold outside Downing Street in London, with rioters attacking police and throwing flares, resulting in over 100 arrests. A mob of about 200 people gathers outside a hotel in Aldershot that houses asylum seekers.\n\nAug. 2: Sunderland witnesses a lengthy riot in its city center. A car and a Citizens Advice Bureau are set ablaze, injuring several police officers.\n\nAug. 3: Far-right rallies spread to more cities across England and Belfast, Northern Ireland, resulting in over 100 arrests.\n\nAug. 4: The violence continues to escalate. In the northern town of Rotherham, hundreds of far-right demonstrators vandalize a Holiday Inn Express housing asylum seekers. Protesters throw bricks at police, break hotel windows, and set bins on fire. Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield of South Yorkshire Police condemns both the rioters and those who spread misinformation online. At least 10 officers have been injured, including one who has been left unconscious.\n\nIn addition to the chaos in Rotherham, protests break out in Bolton, Greater Manchester, Middlesbrough, and other towns.\n\nIn Bolton, police issue a dispersal order as several hundred demonstrators and counter-demonstrators clash, throwing missiles and escalating tensions. In Middlesbrough, 300 protesters break through a police line in the city center, hurling projectiles and vandalizing cars, police vans, and buildings.\n\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council announces the deployment of 4,000 extra officers across the country to handle the widespread disorder.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemns the targeting of Muslim and other ethnic minority communities, including attacks on mosques, and decries \"wanton violence\" by people displaying Nazi salutes.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police release a statement strongly condemning the violent acts in Rotherham.\n\n\"Those who simply stood on and watched the rioting were absolutely complicit in this,\" says Assistant Chief Constable Butterfield. The police emphasize that people who spread hate and misinformation online must take responsibility for inciting violence.\n\nAs the UK grapples with these violent demonstrations, more than 140 people have been arrested since Saturday night.

Individuals will be held on remand, charges will follow and convictions will follow.\n\n\"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves. This is not a protest, it is organised, violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets or online.\n\n\"There is no justification, none, for taking this action. And all right-minded people should be condemning this assault of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe. To those who feel targeted because of the colour of your skin or your faith, I know how frightening this must be.\n\n\"I want you to know that this violent mob do not represent our country, and we will bring them to justice.

Far-right groups have exploited the situation, spreading false claims that the suspect was an immigrant and radical Islamist. However, police have clarified that the suspect was born in Britain and are not treating the incident as terrorism.\n\nIn Rotherham, South Yorkshire, masked anti-immigration demonstrators vandalized a hotel used to house asylum seekers. The protests have spread to cities including Liverpool, Bristol, and Manchester, resulting in numerous arrests, vandalism, looting, and injuries to several police officers. On Sunday, hundreds of anti-immigration protesters assembled near another hotel in Rotherham, which the UK's interior minister confirmed was housing asylum seekers.\n\nREAD MORE: Torrential Downpours Devastate Pakistan, Result In 22 Deaths\n\nIn a TV address, Keir Starmer stated, \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder. Whether directly or those whipping up this action online, and then running away themselves.\" He emphasized that there was \"no justification\" for what he described as \"far-right thuggery\" and vowed to bring the perpetrators \"to justice.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister has convened an emergency security meeting to address the escalating anti-immigrant protests.\n\nBBC footage revealed rioters breaking into a Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham and pushing a burning bin into the building. It remains unclear whether asylum seekers were present inside, according to AFP. Although ten police officers were injured, local authorities confirmed that no hotel staff or guests were harmed.\n\nIn Middlesbrough, hundreds of protesters confronted riot police with shields, hurling bricks, cans, and pots. Protesters also seized and damaged a camera belonging to an AFP crew, though the journalists were unharmed.\n\nThis outbreak of violence is the most severe England has experienced since the summer of 2011, when riots erupted following the police shooting of a mixed-race man in north London. In response, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish leaders in Liverpool have jointly called for calm.\n\n(Includes inputs from oline sources)", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The protests began after last month's attack on a children's dance class where three young girls were stabbed to death. The identity of the minor attacker has not been revealed.\n\nSo far, more than 150 people have been arrested in connection with the violence, the BBC reported. According to the report, Starmer has condemned the attack this weekend on a Rotherham hotel housing asylum seekers. He said those involved in the clashes would face \"the full force of the law\", describing the violence as \"far-right thuggery\".\n\nEmergency response meetings in the UK are referred to as 'Cobra' or COBR meetings after the Cabinet Office Briefing Room A on Whitehall. \"It is an emergency response committee -- a get together of ministers, civil servants, the police, intelligence officers and other officials appropriate to the situation they are looking into,\" BBC reported.\n\nMonday's meeting, BBC reported, will be intended to provide the government with an update on the violence over the weekend and the response in the coming days. The meeting has been called as the riots are some of the worst clashes that the UK has witnessed in recent years.\n\nDuring a televised address on Sunday, the prime minister said people \"in this country have a right to be safe\". \"And yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques. Other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery,\" he added.\n\nAt least 10 police officers were injured during the clashes in Rotherham this weekend, with one left unconscious after anti-immigrant demonstrators threw planks of wood at police and sprayed them with fire extinguishers.\n\nSome members of the 700-large group smashed windows to gain access to a Holiday Inn Express and a large trash bin was set alight. The officer who was knocked unconscious suffered a head injury, and at least two others are suspected to have suffered broken bones, the force said, according to BBC.\n\nHotel employees and residents, including asylum seekers, were \"terrified\", although no one is said to have been injured.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Office_Briefing_Rooms", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bolton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bolton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesbrough", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middlesbrough"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Middlesbrough"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_salute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi salute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Inn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holiday Inn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/08/05/fe07c39fe39ace847d1661a1b3f3ab71172284905945819_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789876", "eventUri": "eng-9789876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.6235294117647059, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

This upheaval is linked to anti-immigration protests, exacerbated by misinformation and heightened tensions.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed the nation with a stern warning to far-right protesters, asserting they would \"regret\" their participation in the disturbances. Starmer emphasised there is \"no justification\" for the violent actions, which he condemned as \"far-right thuggery.\" He promised that those responsible would be brought to justice.\n\nIn Rotherham, South Yorkshire, masked demonstrators attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers. The attackers smashed windows and set fires, causing significant damage. Although ten police officers were injured during the clashes, there were no reports of injuries to hotel staff or residents.\n\nThe violence has spread across multiple towns and cities, fueled by misinformation regarding a mass stabbing in Southport last Monday.\n\nThe incident, which occurred at a children's dance class, led to the deaths of three young girls. False rumours on social media suggested the suspect was a radical Islamist migrant, although police confirmed the suspect was British-born.\n\nIn Middlesbrough, protesters clashed with riot police, leading to injuries among officers and considerable property damage.\n\nProtesters threw bricks, cans, and other objects at the police, escalating the violence.\n\nSince Saturday, more than 150 arrests have been made following violent far-right rallies in cities including Liverpool, Manchester, and Bristol. Rioters have looted shops, set fires, and hurled bricks and flares at police, resulting in substantial property damage and numerous injuries.\n\nIn response to the unrest, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish leaders in Liverpool issued a joint appeal for peace, urging communities to remain calm and united.\n\nThe government has been quick to respond, with Interior Minister Yvette Cooper and Prime Minister Keir Starmer both condemning the violence. Cooper stated that \"criminal violence and thuggery on our streets will not be tolerated,\" promising strong penalties for those involved.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesbrough_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middlesbrough F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_the_Interior_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of the Interior (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2024/08/05/600x338/BRITAIN-POLITICS-VOTE-DEBATE-DEMO-1_1722823122265_1722823144678.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789876", "eventUri": "eng-9789876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5372549019607843, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Individuals will be held on remand, charges will follow and convictions will follow.\" reports the Mirror.\n\nThe statement from Mr Starmer came shortly after mobs assaulted police officers and vandalised the windows of a Holiday Inn Express that was providing accommodation to asylum seekers in Rotherham. The Prime Minister labelled the rioters as: \"Marauding gangs intent on law-breaking or worse.\"\n\nHe further stated: \"Residents and staff in absolute fear. There is no justification for this action.\"\n\nIn light of assaults on mosques, displays of Nazi salutes, and the spouting of racist language on our streets, the PM declared: \"I won't shy away from calling this what it is: Far-right thuggery.\"\n\nMr Starmer is set to head an emergency Cobra meeting today with key government and police figures in light of the violent assault on a hotel. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has fiercely denounced the attack as \"criminal, violent\" and \"utterly appalling\".\n\nShe went on to say: \"Deliberately setting fire to a building with people known to be inside. South Yorkshire Police have full government support for the strongest action against those responsible.\"\n\nIn Middlesbrough, clashes with law enforcement escalated as officers faced bricks and flaming wheelie bins. Arrests were made in Nottingham's Market Square after unrest, and in Sunderland, police executed house raids and apprehended individuals following the unrest that erupted on Saturday.\n\nThe Home Office communicated last evening that mosques will now receive \"emergency security\" and over \u00a350 million is allocated for the safety of religious communities.\n\nMs Cooper further stated: \"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, alongside the support from local police forces... anyone involved in this disorder and violence will face the full force of the law.\"\n\nShe concluded by asserting that such

The protests reached a climax during the weekend.\n\nNational Police Chiefs' Council lead for public order, BJ Harrington, said on Sunday that since Saturday night, there have been 147 arrests connected to violence. He said he expected that the number would rise in the coming days.\n\n\"Disinformation is a huge driver of this appalling violence, and we know a lot of those attending these so-called protests are doing so in direct response to what they've read online,\" Harrington said.\n\nFollowing violent protests in major cities including London, Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, Leeds, Nottingham, Sunderland and Belfast on Saturday, riots were seen in places such as Middlesbrough, where burning wheelie bins were thrown at police, and Rotherham, where at least one police officer was injured as rioters hurled missiles and stormed a Holiday Inn Express thought to have housed migrants. In Bolton, police have been given extra powers to calm violence after bottles and missiles were thrown at them.\n\nReferring to the violent attack on the Rotherham hotel, Starmer said: \"There is no justification for taking this action.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister said he would not \"shy away from calling it what it is\" and called the violence \"far-right thuggery.\"\n\nIn a press conference on Friday, Starmer urged big social media companies to take responsibility for combatting misinformation and disinformation.\n\nFormer UK Prime Minister and leader of the opposition Conservative Party, Rishi Sunak said the unrest across the country is \"violent, criminal behaviour that has no place in our society.\"\n\n\"The shocking scenes we're seeing on the streets of Britain have nothing to do with the tragedy in Southport,\" Sunak said on X, adding that the police have \"our full support to deal with these criminals swiftly.\"\n\nHumza Yousaf, former first minister of Scotland, said on X that the police \"clearly do not have a handle on this situation\" and called for military intervention.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors":

A 17-year-old boy named Axel Rudakubana born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents has been charged with murder.\n\nHowever, disinformation spreading online about the nationality of the boy and his religious affiliation has fueled hatred towards Muslims and the immigrant population in general, leading to violent clashes between far-right protesters and police officers across the UK. The protests reached a climax during the weekend.\n\nNational Police Chiefs' Council lead for public order BJ Harrington said on Sunday that since Saturday night there have been 147 arrests connected to violence. He said he expected that number to rise in the coming days.\n\n\"Disinformation is a huge driver of this appalling violence and we know a lot of those attending these so-called protests are doing so in direct response to what they've read online,\" Harrington said.\n\nFollowing violent protests in major cities including London, Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, Leeds, Nottingham, Sunderland and Belfast on Saturday, riots were seen in places such as Middlesbrough where burning wheelie bins were thrown at police, and Rotherham where at least one police officer was injured as rioters hurled missiles and stormed a Holiday Inn Express thought to have housed migrants. In Bolton, police have been given extra powers to calm violence after bottles and missiles were thrown at them.\n\nReferring to the violent attack on the said Rotherham hotel, Starmer said: \"There is no justification for taking this action.\"\n\nThe prime minister said he would not \"shy away from calling it what it is\" and called the violence \"far-right thuggery.\"\n\nIn a press conference on

Conservative Party, said the unrest across the country is \"violent, criminal behavior that has no place in our society.\"\n\n\"The shocking scenes we're seeing on the streets of Britain have nothing to do with the tragedy in Southport,\" Sunak said on X, adding that the police have \"our full support to deal with these criminals swiftly.\"\n\nHumza Yousaf, former first minister of Scotland, said on X that the police \"clearly do not have a handle on this situation\" and called for military intervention.\n\n\"How much worse does it have to get before the army is sent in @Keir_Starmer?\" he

Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law,\" said Starmer in a statement on Sunday.\n\n\"There is no justification - none - for taking this action, and all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe and yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, (and) wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric. So, no, I won't shy away from calling this what it is: far-right thuggery,\" he said.\n\nHe will chair the emergency Cabinet Office Briefing Room A (COBRA) meeting with UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss the future course of action to curb the violence. The Home Office has also announced that mosques will be offered greater protection with new \"emergency security\" that can be rapidly deployed to respond to violent disorder targeting places of worship.\n\n\"They do not speak for our communities. It's a total disgrace, and there has to be a reckoning. Those individuals who are involved in the disorder need to know that they will pay a price,\" said Cooper, as she indicated that additional prosecutors and courts are on standby to charge those being arrested for a series of offences.\n\n\"We have made very clear to the police that they have our full support in pursuing the full range of prosecutions and penalties, including the serious prison sentences, long-term tagging, travel bans and more,\" she said.\n\nDuring clashes over the weekend, cars were set alight, windows smashed, large bins burnt and hurled at officers and stores looted. Masked anti-immigration mobs broke into a hotel housing asylum-seekers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and rocks and long pieces of wood were thrown at police officers who lined up in front of the building as they tried to protect it.\n\n\"The mindless actions of those today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield of South Yorkshire Police.\n\nSeveral police officers have suffered injuries as they faced off with the mobs, who are being fuelled by misinformation being spread online. The riots started in Southport, near Liverpool, last week following the stabbing of a group of young children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on July 29.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, who has been charged with three murders and other attempted murders, was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents. However, initial misinformed social media posts claimed he was a refugee who arrived last year on a small boat. Southport residents, including the mother of one of the girls who died, have called for the protesters to stop and that they do not speak for them.

Three girls aged between six and nine died while eight other children suffered stab wounds.\n\nRiots broke out the following day as a large crowd gathered outside a mosque, throwing bottles and bricks at police vans.\n\nMisinformation had spread that the suspected attacker was an immigrant and a radical Islamist, which led the protests to be seized by anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim groups.\n\nPolice said the 17-year-old suspect was born in Britain while some media reports added that his family is Christian.\n\nOn Saturday, the riots spread to Liverpool, Bristol, and Manchester.\n\nPolice said dozens of arrests were made as shops and businesses were vandalised and looted while some officers were injured.\n\nIn the latest violence, rioters attacked a hotel used to house asylum seekers in Rotherham.\n\nThe protesters threw objects and sprayed fire extinguishers at police officers during the clashes, and broke hotel windows.\n\nStarmer said there was no justification for the attacks, adding that every right-minded person would condemn the violence. \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,\" Starmer warned.\n\nEarlier Starmer pledged to give police forces the government's \"full support\" to take action against \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\".\n\nYvette Cooper, home secretary, also warned that anyone engaging in \"unacceptable disorder\" would face imprisonment and travel bans amongst other punishments.\n\n\"Criminal violence

Every Prime Minister has to have that family time and that break but from what I know of Keir - and I've met him many times, and sitting here in Blackpool several times - he will be continuing to work and monitor the situation wherever he is on holiday.'\n\nCities such as Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester and Belfast have seen vehicles burned, shops destroyed, pedestrians attacked and police officers injured this week following the Southport stabbings on Monday.\n\nArrests have been made across the country, with police warning of more to come once CCTV, social media and body-worn camera footage has been scoured.\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast, which saw several police officers injured.

I guarantee, you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up these actions online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nThe protests erupted over the weekend in several UK cities following a tragic knife attack at a Southport dance school on July 29, during a Taylor Swift event, where three young girls, aged six to nine, were killed, and eight other children were injured.\n\nRioting broke out the next day when a large crowd gathered outside a mosque, hurling bottles and bricks at police vehicles. The protests were fueled by misinformation suggesting that the attacker was an immigrant and radical Islamist, sparking anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiments.\n\nThe police clarified that the 17-year-old suspect was a British national, and media reports revealed his family is Christian. Despite this, the riots spread to Liverpool, Bristol, and Manchester on Saturday, resulting in multiple arrests, damaged shops, and injured officers.\n\nThe latest outbreak of violence involved rioters targeting a hotel in Rotherham that housed asylum seekers, throwing objects, using fire extinguishers against police officers, and breaking hotel windows.\n\nStarmer denounced the violence, saying there was no excuse for such behavior. \"There is no justification whatsoever for these actions, and all reasonable individuals should denounce this type of violence,\" he declared.\n\nHe continued, \"People in this country have a right to be safe, and yet we've seen muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out, nazi salutes in the streets, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric. So, no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is-far right thuggery. To those who feel targeted because of the colour of your skin or your faith, I know how frightening this must be.\n\n\"I want you to know that this violent mob do not represent our country and we will bring them to justice. Our police deserve our support as they tackle any and all violent disorder that flares up. Whatever the apparent cause or motivation, we make no distinction. Crime is crime and this government will tackle.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed Starmer's views, cautioning that those involved in \"unacceptable disorder\" would face imprisonment and travel restrictions.\n\nShe emphasized that criminal violence and disorder have no place on Britain's streets and assured that there were ample prison spaces available for offenders.", "source": {"uri":

If there was any expectation that the far-right violence that has spread across the UK since the killing of three young girls in Southport might fizzle out, it was dashed over the weekend.\n\nThere was disorder on Saturday in Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Blackpool and Belfast, and then yesterday in Rotherham, Tamworth, Middlesbrough, Bolton, Hull and Weymouth. In total, police attended 56 gatherings of the far right or counter-protesters over the two days. There were assaults on police officers and bystanders, missiles thrown, shops ransacked, and - amid flagrantly racist chanting - smashed windows and the lighting of fires at hotels housing asylum seekers.\n\nKeir Starmer called the attacks \"far right thuggery\" last night, and said that those involved would \"regret taking part in this disorder\". He will chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee this morning. As some of those charged meanwhile appear before magistrates, the most urgent question is whether the risk of those consequences will prove a deterrent - or if events now have a momentum of their own.\n\nToday's newsletter, with the Guardian's Robyn Vinter in Rotherham, runs you through the events of the weekend - and how communities, police, and politicians are attempting to bring things under control. Here are the headlines.\n\nIn Rotherham last night, one experienced South Yorkshire police officer told Robyn Vinter that it was the worst riot he had ever attended. At the same time, Robyn told me after leaving the scene, it wasn't a surprise. \"There was a protest last year at the same hotel that got quite heated - and because there hadn't been disorder in the last week around here yet and there have been tensions in Rotherham before, it did seem quite likely to happen. But I've not seen anything on this scale around here. It was shocking.\"\n\nThe trouble began at around midday, when a crowd started to congregate in the Manvers area outside the Holiday Inn Express, where asylum seekers are being housed. About 700 people, mostly men, smashed windows and forced a burning bin through a smashed window, as well as setting fires in the streets outside.\n\nThey clashed with the police and temporarily overwhelmed them, forcing them to retreat against a wall and hold up their riot shields for protection as missiles were thrown. The rioters also chanted racist words and surrounded a group of counter-protesters, calling one of them the p-word. They chanted \"Tommy Robinson\", \"we want our country back\", and \"get them out\". This video given to the Times' Tom Witherow, taken by a migrant from inside the hotel, shows a man in a balaclava pointing and then appearing to mime cutting his throat.\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured, including one who was left unconscious with a head injury and two with suspected broken bones. No hotel employees or asylum seekers were hurt.\n\n\"There were different groups taking part in it,\" Robyn said. \"There are those who are experienced members of the far right, a bit older and some from further afield, mostly 30s through to 50s, and they are very explicitly racist and chanting in those terms. There are some people who might not be using that language, but are sympathetic and taking part. And you have some local youths who are just seizing on this as an opportunity to go mad and attack the police and have a fight.\" Others again were \"mildly bewildered locals who were broadly spectators\".\n\nWhat else happened yesterday?\n\nIn Middlesbrough, Mark Brown reported that about 300 people gathered at the town's cenotaph, and that the mood was relatively calm until a large group of younger masked men arrived. They marched through town, smashing windows in shops, cars, and homes as they went. The unrest culminated in a confrontation with riot police where bricks, bottles and metal bars were thrown, and burning wheelie bins were pushed towards the officers.\n\nAnother hotel housing asylum seekers in Tamworth also came under attack. And there were violent scenes in Bolton, Hull, and Weymouth. After the trouble in Bolton, where there was a confrontation between a group of men with England flags and another group which chanted \"Allahu Akbar\", the police implemented a temporary order requiring people to remove face coverings and another granting additional stop and search powers.\n\nAcross the country, more than 247 arrests have been made. \"There is a real sense that people aren't thinking about the consequences,\" Robyn said. \"They don't seem to be thinking about the fact that some of what they're doing might attract long prison sentences, and their faces are being filmed. If it's part of a riot, it's not like kicking a police officer in the street on a night out. Some of the younger ones are wearing balaclavas, they know what they're doing, but some of the older ones seem to have forgotten about camera phones.\"\n\nOne particularly depressing strand has been the presence of children. \"I've seen little boys throwing rocks at the police, mimicking what they've seen, getting encouraged by their parents. It is extraordinary that people are bringing their kids to this kind of thing.\"\n\nWhat measures are being taken to bring the situation under control?\n\nKeir Starmer made an appearance at Downing Street in which he sought to emphasise that those who have participated in the riots will soon face justice. \"The police will be making arrests,\" he said. \"Individuals will be held on remand. Charges will follow. And convictions will follow. I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder.\" Police have sought to strike a similar note, with Avon and Somerset police, for example, saying that those involved in unrest in Bristol \"should expect a knock at your door soon\".\n\nOn Sunday morning, Diana Johnson, the policing minister, set out plans to have courts sit for 24 hours to deal with suspects and process them more rapidly. Meanwhile, Chief Constable BJ Harrington, the national lead for public order, told Vikram Dodd that those accused of inciting the unrest on social media, including Tommy Robinson, could also be charged.\n\nStarmer appeared to imply the same thing when he said that those \"whipping it up online and then running away themselves\" would be held accountable - apparently a reference to the fact that Robinson was posting on X from a resort hotel in Cyprus.\n\nSuspects are due to go before magistrates today. Meanwhile, as the monitoring group Tell Mama said that the surge in far right activity had been accompanied by a fivefold increase in threats to Muslims, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, announced a scheme to quickly provide additional security for mosques. 10 mosques have faced attacks or threats so far.\n\nHow are communities and politicians reacting?\n\nOne notable feature of Starmer's comments was his willingness to describe those responsible for the violence as being on the far right - but, as Rowena Mason writes in this analysis piece, he will also be under pressure to draw a line between the events of the last week and the kind of anti-migrant rhetoric that has been part of mainstream British political discourse for years.\n\nMeanwhile yesterday, there were calls for Nigel Farage to face investigation by the House of Commons standards watchdog over his comments questioning whether police were withholding information over who was responsible for the Southport murders - at a time when false information was circulating claiming that the suspect was a Muslim asylum seeker. And a Conservative shadow minister, Lord (Byron) Davies, apologised after writing of the disorder that \"Labour blocked the Rwanda bill 130+ times of course it's politically justified!\"\n\nIn many of the communities that have been affected by the violence, attempts to fix the damage and reassure residents have been central to attempts to reclaim the narrative. In Sunderland, for example, crowds gathered to clean up the city centre, with one participant saying: \"These people who rioted don't speak for Sunderland and we are ashamed and embarrassed.\"\n\nIn this piece for the Observer, Robyn wrote about an imam who handed out burgers to a group of far right protesters outside his mosque on Friday night - and how, while most refused to engage, at least one held a long conversation with him.\n\nBut as she also wrote that even this was an \"uneasy peace\". And it is not yet clear when the wider far-right violence will come to an end.\n\nEditor's note: In Friday's email, a headline stated Israel had claimed responsibility for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.

Are you white?' one could be heard shouting at a car trying to cross the intersection where hundreds marched with anti-immigration groups earlier today.\n\n'Yes, he is!' someone else was heard shouting back.\n\nTwo cars narrowly avoided colliding as they sped away from the mob, prompting one of the agitators to whine he had 'nearly been run over' and calling out 'where's your police?'\n\nRows of officers wielding riot shields were seen near the commotion as thugs circled on BMXs and continued stopping cars, standing in the middle of the road.\n\nCleveland Police said this afternoon they are continuing to deal with 'disorder' in Middlesbrough, claiming to have arrested nine people 'relating to violent disorder offences'.\n\n'We are urging members of the public to stay away from Middlesbrough while officers respond to violent disorder in the town,' Assistant Chief Constable David Felton said in a statement.\n\nThe horrifying TikTok video of the 'checkpoint' on Linthorpe Road in Middlesbrough drew outcry as it was shared across social media.\n\n'This is a pretty concerning development. I thought we were supposed to be moving towards a more inclusive and equitable society, not regressing back to the days of segregation,' one user wrote.\n\n'So utterly disappointed with this country and this disgusting behaviour,' another said.\n\n'This is beyond sad... what is going on fgs,' a third user added.\n\nMiddlesbrough has seen a thoroughly disturbing spate of violence over the weekend as far-right groups torched cars and hurled bricks.\n\nA so-called protest organised by anti-immigration groups was organised to travel along the Linthorpe Road, where a mob was later seen screening drivers.\n\nBuses announced they would change their schedules to avoid the disorder.\n\nHooligans set fire to cars and wheelie bins, pushed towards police trying to restore order.\n\nAbout 300 people gathered in front of a mosque in Waterloo Road in the town to guard it while police blocked off nearby streets.\n\nOne resident told the PA news agency: 'We're going to be paying for this, and for what?\n\n'This has got nothing to do with three little girls that have lost their lives. They've used it to cause utter mayhem on our streets.'\n\nA person was seen being stretchered into an ambulance after an incident at the Swatters Carr pub.\n\nPolice in riot gear were forced to retreat to get away from a group dressed in hoods and face coverings at one point.\n\nHumza Yousaf has called for the army to be called in to stop 'thugs' causing disorder on the streets as violence continued unabated through Sunday.\n\n'It doesn't look like, to me, the police have a handle on the situation,' the former first minister of Scotland said.\n\n'The police have not been able to protect those that are in the Holiday Inn [in Rotherham],' he added.\n\n'The army can help to get control where the police are unable.'\n\nDespite calls for police to have more powers to clamp down on the riots, Dame Diana Johnson, the Minister for Policing, said police have said they have 'all the resources they need' to deal with the disorder.\n\nIn Hull last night police used tear gas against thugs who smashed the windows of a hotel housing asylum seekers, while cars were set alight and vandalised through the afternoon.\n\nSimilar horror rocked Rotherham today as groups stormed a Holiday Inn housing asylum seekers.\n\nAround 700 violent anti-immigration protesters clad in balaclavas and draped in St George's flags clashed with officers trying to protect the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire since around 2pm this afternoon.\n\nObjects and pieces of wood were flung at officers who had lined up in front of the building with at least one cop in riot gear being carried away by their colleagues.\n\nThe grass around the hotel appears to have been set on fire as well.\n\nSome were seen preparing to throw bricks of concrete as the violence spiralled.\n\nIt is unclear if the migrants and asylum seekers housed in the property have been able to evacuate.\n\nMailOnline has contacted the Home Office.\n\nPolice said late this evening that officers were 'aware and responding proactively' to 'protest activity' in Tamworth, a small town in Staffordshire.\n\n'Robust action will be taken against those responsible for violence and disorder,' a statement read.\n\nFootage shared showed crowds standing around a Holiday Inn believed to be housing asylum seekers.\n\nBottles were launched at police, witnesses said.\n\nVideo appeared to show red flares being lit outside.\n\nA small group of demonstrators carried St George's Flag through Lancaster, shouting at a much larger crowd of counter-protestors in the main shopping district of the small university city.\n\nPolice were on guard to separate the groups, chanting back and forth at each other.\n\nChants of 'refugees are welcome here' were heard from the counter-protestors.\n\nOthers sang 'There are many many more of us than you' from the steps of the Town Hall.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police said several of its officers were injured during 'deplorable acts of violence' outside the Holiday Inn Express in the Manvers area of Rotherham today.\n\nAt least ten officers have been injured as a result of the violence, with one left unconscious following a head injury, another suffering a suspected fractured elbow and other suffering suspected broken bones.\n\nNo hotel employees or residents have been injured, police said.\n\nA heavy police presence will remain outside the hotel and in the surrounding area over the course of the rest of this evening and into tomorrow.\n\n'The behaviour we witnessed has been nothing short of disgusting,' said Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield.\n\n'While it was a smaller number of those in attendance who chose to commit violence and destruction, those who simply stood on and watched remain absolutely complicit in this.\n\n'Those who choose to spread misinformation and hate online, also need to take responsibility for the scenes today - this was not a protest, just angry people, reacting to a false narrative who have their own motivations for doing so.'\n\nThe Prime Minister this evening condemned the 'thuggery' of the far-right mob who stormed the hotel, promising those involved in the violence would 'regret it' as the government introduced emergency measures to bring rioters to justice.\n\nUK courts are to operate for 24 hours to expedite prosecutions of those involved in the riots, the government confirmed yesterday as violence erupted on the streets of Belfast, Hull, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Stoke.\n\nSaturday was the second night of violent confrontations after riots broke in Sunderland on Friday.\n\nA Citizens Advice bureau in Sunderland was set alight on Friday amid the senseless attacks on community pillars.\n\nITV journalist Jonny Blair wrote on Twitter/X on Saturday: 'Its manager this morning told me they're devastated and now trying to figure out how to help the people they were supposed to see.'\n\nSix people are due to appear in court following the night of disorder on Friday.\n\nThousands of protestors, including children as young as six, gathered in Keel Square in the city centre in response to the Southport stabbings.\n\nNorthumbria Police launched an investigation which has so far seen 14 people arrested for their role in the clashes with officers.\n\nFive men, aged 48, 41, 31, 29, 27, and a 43-year-old woman have been charged with violent disorder.\n\nThe 27-year-old man has also been charged with one count of burglary.\n\nAll are due to appear before Magistrates' tomorrow.\n\nAnd last night, thugs in Merseyside set fire to a library, which also functioned as a food bank, intended to help support deprived people in the community.\n\nAs firefighters tried to put on the flames that engulfed Spellow Lane Library Hub rioters threw a missile at the engine, before breaking the rear window of a nearby cab.\n\nHeartbreaking video of the centre as it opened last year went viral on Twitter/X as users denounced the shameless attacks.\n\nMany police units were pushed to breaking point last night as clashes continued in multiple cities.\n\nProtesters tried to kick down police officer's riot gear, while other demonstrators threw objects at their shields.\n\nLooters took advantage of the chaos, stealing phones, shoes and wine from the shelves of every-day stores, smashing their windows with bricks and stones.\n\nIn Liverpool, shameless yobs squealed 'get the phones! Get the phones!' as a group surrounded and battered their way into a phone repair and vape shop in the city centre.\n\nKicking the shutters with the feet and wrenching them up in a wild frenzy, the mob battered at the glass with what appeared to be a bollard before leaving the road outside strewn with packaging after they emptied the shelves.\n\nThe riots have swept across several UK cities following the deaths of three young girls in Southport.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, a 17-year-old from Lancashire, was identified as the suspect in the case, charged with murdering three children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on July 29.\n\nHe is accused of killing Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, with a kitchen knife on Monday.\n\nEight other children sustained knife wounds, with five of them left in critical condition.\n\nJudge Menary KC cited 'idiotic rioting' in parts of the UK in his reasoning for lifting the automatic anonymity given to Rudakubana, as misinformation spread online about the suspect's identity.\n\nClaims falsely circulated social media that the suspect was a Muslim asylum seeker.\n\nRudakubana was born in Cardiff, described as a 'quiet choir boy' with a family involved in the local Christian church.\n\nSammy Woodhouse, a high-profile victim of the Rotherham child grooming gang scandal, said of the suspect in a broadcast: '[People] feel like they are not being told any information.\n\n'They know the guy's not a British guy. They know he's of a different ethnicity. There's talk of him being a Muslim as well.'\n\nThe clip was shared by Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, after police had clarified that the claims were false, The Times reports.\n\nRobinson, 41, had a UK arrest warrant issued against him last Monday after he skipped a court appearance.\n\nMailOnline revealed exclusively that he has been staying at a five-star hotel in Cyprus as riots sweep England.\n\nCommunity leaders and families of the victims of the murders in Southport have criticised the unrest.\n\n'While this should be a time for quiet reflection and remembrance, since Monday, too many people have sought to use the tragedy to create division and hate,' a group of faith leaders from Liverpool said in a joint statement.", "source": {"uri":

protesters", "body": "Keir Starmer, prime minister of the United Kingdom, says those who took part in violent anti-immigration protests in some parts of the country will face the full force of the law.\n\nIn an address on Sunday, Starmer described the protest as an \"organised violent thuggery\" and vowed that arrests would be made.\n\nDemonstrations in several UK cities escalated during the weekend following a knife attack at a school in Southport that left three children dead.\n\nThe attack happened on July 29 during a Taylor Swift event at a dance school.\n\nThree girls aged between six and nine died while eight other children suffered stab wounds.\n\nRiots broke out the following day as a large crowd gathered outside a mosque, throwing bottles and bricks at police vans.\n\nMisinformation had spread that the suspected attacker was an immigrant and a radical Islamist, which led the protests to be seized by anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim groups.\n\nPolice said the 17-year-old suspect was born in Britain while some media reports added that his family is Christian.\n\nOn Saturday, the riots spread to Liverpool, Bristol, and Manchester.\n\nPolice said dozens of arrests were made as shops and businesses were vandalised and looted while some officers were injured.\n\nIn the latest violence, rioters attacked a hotel used to house asylum seekers in Rotherham.\n\nThe protesters threw objects and sprayed fire extinguishers at police officers during the clashes, and broke hotel windows.\n\nStarmer said there was no justification for the attacks, adding that every right-minded person would condemn the violence.\n\n\"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,\" Starmer warned.\n\nEarlier Starmer pledged to give police forces the government's \"full support\" to take action against \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\".\n\nYvette Cooper, home secretary, also warned that anyone engaging in \"unacceptable disorder\" would face imprisonment and travel bans amongst other punishments.\n\n\"Criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets,\" Cooper said adding that \"sufficient\" prison places had been made available.", "source": {"uri": "nigerianeye.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Prime Minister Keir Starmer has vowed that the rioters will \"face the full force of the law.\"\n\nHundreds of people gathered outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham on Sunday afternoon, pelting police officers with wood and bottles and chanting \"get them out,\" referring to the 130 asylum seekers housed in the hotel since 2022.\n\nSouth Yorkshire police said at least ten officers were injured in clashes with the rioters, who broke windows and set dumpsters ablaze outside the building, before setting a fire inside the hotel's ground floor.\n\nMultiple arrests were made, and the fire was extinguished shortly afterwards.\n\nDozens of British towns and cities have been rocked by right-wing protests and riots since Monday, when a British teenager of Rwandan descent stabbed three children to death and injured ten others in the town of Southport, near Liverpool. Although initially sparked by a false rumor that the knifeman responsible for the stabbings was Muslim, the demonstrations have since grown into a wider backlash against Islam, mass immigration, and the perception that political leaders are more concerned with suppressing right-wing dissent than tackling immigrant crime.\n\nMore than 150 people were arrested after riots in Liverpool, Manchester, Stoke, Leeds and other cities on Saturday. Similar riots took place in locations including Middlesbrough, Blackburn, and Tamworth on Sunday. Mobs of Muslim protesters, some armed with knives and machetes, have been seen in some cities, including Bolton and Stoke.\n\nIn a speech on Sunday, Starmer warned that more arrests would follow. \"Those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law,\" he declared, warning that those responsible \"will regret taking part in this disorder.\" In Sunday's address and in a similar speech earlier this week, Starmer did not discuss any of the root causes of the unrest. Instead he pinned all blame for the violence on \"far right hatred\" and online \"misinformation.\"\n\nRotherham is infamous for its Muslim 'grooming gang', a group of predominantly British-Pakistani men who sexually abused around 1,400 young girls between the late 1980s and 2013. Three separate reports published in 2013, 2014, and 2015 found that local politicians and police covered up the gang's crimes, partly out of fear that identifying and punishing the perpetrators would be seen as \"racist.\"", "source": {"uri": "theuknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The UK News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Inn", "type": "org",

The horrific scenes also depicted a small fire while windows in the hotel were smashed.\n\nThe violence is not limited to a single spot in the city as Staffordshire police confirmed that another hotel believed to have sheltered asylum-seekers was targeted near Birmingham.\n\nAn official statement in this regard said that a large group of individuals have been throwing projectiles, smashing windows, starting fires and targeting police at the hotel in the town of Tamworth; one officer was also left injured in the confrontation.\n\nIt is to be highlighted that media reports imply that there were more anti-immigration protests and counter-demonstrations elsewhere, including the northeastern city of Middlesborough.\n\nIn the cities of Liverpool, Bolton and Southport, extra ordinary measures were taken as the police were granted the right to issue dispersal orders, permitting them to stop protests from taking place on Sunday.\n\nCommenting on the developments, newly elected British Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the events as \"far-right thuggery.\"\n\n\"We will do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice,\" said Starmer.\n\n\"These thugs are mobile, they move from community to community, and we must have a police response that can do the same,\" he added.\n\n\"Mosques being attacked because they're mosques -- the far-right are showing who they are. We have to show who we are in response to that,\" Starmer noted.\n\nMeanwhile, Britain's Home Secretary Yvette Cooper branded the \"criminal, violent attack\" on the hotel utterly appalling adding that police had full Government support for the strongest action against those responsible.\n\nAs far as the arrests are concerned, around 100 people were arrested after far-right rallies in Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Blackpool and Hull, as well as Belfast in Northern Ireland.", "source": {"uri": "en.dailypakistan.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Pakistan Global"},

There were clashes in other towns.\n\nPM Sir Keir Starmer said those involved would face the \"full force of the law\".\n\nIn a hard-hitting message from Downing Street, the PM told them: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nHe went on: \"This is not a \u00adprotest, it is organised, violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets or online.\n\n\"All right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe.\n\n\"And yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted.\n\n\"I won't shy away from calling this what it is: Far-right thuggery.\"\n\nTowns and cities hit -- the fifth day of violence -- included Rotherham, Aldershot in Hants, Middlesbrough, Bolton, Manchester, Hull and Weymouth, Dorset.\n\nTerrifying footage from Rotherham showed masked yobs kicking out windows to storm the \u00adHoliday Inn Express, which houses migrants.\n\nAnother Holiday Inn where asylum seekers are thought to stay was set alight in Tamworth, Staffordshire.\n\nThe thugs in Rotherham forced their way past cops into the hotel after pelting them with bricks, \u00adbottles and even fence panels. Some then hurled chairs.\n\nFire broke out as they chanted: \"Get them out.\"\n\nPlacards carried by far-right \u00adsupporters had slogans such as \"stop the boats\" and, in a cruel barb aimed at asylum seekers: \"Men don't flee war.\"\n\nAnother made reference to Enoch Powell's inflammatory 1968 Rivers of Blood speech.\n\nThe thugs chased away around 100 counter-protesters.\n\nAt least one injured cop was seen being carried by colleagues, while a number of protesters were handcuffed as police battled to regain control.\n\nThe nationwide disorder has been fuelled by online lies following the murders of three girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nThe 41-year-old is understood to be staying at a \u00a3400-a-night chalet bungalow with his family.\n\nHe has been seen lazing on sun loungers and taking dips in a pool.\n\nA series of inflammatory posts he shared with his 800,000 followers include ones blasting the PM and police for cracking down on rioters.\n\nBut last night he insisted: \"I am not at fault.\"\n\nMeanwhile another migrant hotel, this time in Aldershot, was also targeted.\n\nA group of men outside Potters International Hotel brandished a banner insisting: \"We're not far right, we're just right.\"\n\nAt Middlesbrough's Cenotaph, hundreds of protesters squared up to police before throwing slate, cans and pots at the officers.\n\nA group of masked yobs walked through a residential area using metal bars and wooden posts to smash car windscreens and the windows of terraced houses.\n\nVehicles were torched, along with wheelie bins.\n\nOne victim, a white man in his 40s who did not want to be named, said: \"I'm born and bred in Middlesbrough and these morons target my house just for the hell of it. I could hear them yelling about immigrants, but they were smashing cars and house windows indiscriminately.\n\n\"They're the scum of the earth.\"\n\nCleveland Police confirmed \u00ada number of arrests had been made and warned the public to avoid the area.\n\nIn the centre of Bolton, large crowds of anti-immigration demonstrators gathered along with \u00adcounter-protesters while police tried to keep them apart.\n\nAn anti-immigrant rally on Weymouth seafront was met by a counter-protest.\n\nThree far-right sympathisers were said to have been handcuffed and arrested trying to break through police lines.\n\nThere was a large turnout in Hull, scene of earlier violence.\n\nGreater Manchester Police said a Section 34 dispersal notice had been authorised until 10pm yesterday, giving officers extra powers to deal with anyone causing anti-social behaviour.\n\nChief Inspector Natasha Evans said the force was acting to \"prevent serious disruption and ensure everyone can go about their lives without fear or risk of harm\".\n\nMerseyside Police introduced two Section 60 orders in Liverpool and Southport between 2pm yesterday and 2am today, giving officers greater stop-and-search powers.\n\nLast night faith leaders in Merseyside issued a joint statement calling for calm and urging people to hold the families of Southport stabbing victims Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, at \"the forefront of all our thoughts\".\n\nThey said: \"Division can destroy the very relationships and environment that we depend upon every day of our lives and there is no place for hate in our communities.\n\n\"It can -- and has -- left communities in fear and has put people in danger. At this difficult time, let us remember that there is far more that unites than divides us.\n\n\"The people of all faiths and none who came out to sweep the streets, to rebuild walls and have so generously donated money in memory of those three girls -- that is the spirit that will help us through this incredibly challenging time.\"\n\nSaturday saw forces pushed to the brink with more than 100 arrests and dozens of \u00adofficers hurt.\n\nTrouble flared in Belfast, Blackpool, Stoke, Leeds, Hull, Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Bristol and Portsmouth.\n\nLast night National Police Chiefs' Council lead for public order, BJ Harrington, said leave had been cancelled by many forces and 4,000 officers put on standby.\n\nMr Harrington warned those involved in disorder: \"Make no mistake, if you haven't had a knock on the door yet, your time will come.\"\n\nHe said fake news inflamed the trouble and urged social media users to be careful what they share, adding: \"Think twice before you act.\"\n\nPolicing minister Dame Diana Johnson suggested courts could sit overnight to ensure \"thugs who maraud our streets\" are brought to justice.\n\nThose at risk of violent disorder will be offered additional security personnel.\n\nShe said: \"Britain is a proud and tolerant country, and nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops or attacking people based on the colour of their skin.\n\n\"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the Government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

This action comes in the wake of the Prime Minister's firm stance that far-right troublemakers will be brought to justice for the chaos that unfolded over the weekend.\n\nTowns and cities throughout England were marred by violence, disorder, and looting carried out by hostile anti-immigrant groups. In a stern emergency address from Downing Street last night, the PM warned those involved: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part.\"\n\nHe added: \"Whether directly, or those whipping up this action online, and then running away themselves. This is not a protest. It is organised, violent thuggery.\"\n\nGet the latest news straight to your phone by joining us on WhatsApp\n\n\"Be in no doubt, those that have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law. The police will be making arrests. Individuals will be held on remand, charges will follow and convictions will follow.\"\n\nThe statement from Mr Starmer came shortly after mobs targeted police and vandalised a Holiday Inn Express that was providing accommodation to asylum seekers in Rotherham. The rioters were described by the PM as: \"Marauding gangs intent on law-breaking or worse.\"\n\nHe further stated: \"Residents and staff in absolute fear. There is no justification for this action.\"\n\nAmidst assaults on mosques, displays of Nazi salutes, and racist chants on our streets, the PM declared: \"I won't shy away from calling this what it is: Far-right thuggery.\"\n\nMr Starmer is set to preside over a critical Cobra meeting today, engaging with top ministers and police chiefs. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has vociferously condemned the \"criminal, violent\" onslaught on the hotel as \"utterly appalling\", reports the Mirror.\n\nShe further commented: \"Deliberately setting fire to a building with people known to be inside. South Yorkshire Police have full government support for the strongest action against those responsible.\"\n\nIn Middlesbrough, incidents escalated with bricks and burning debris being launched at law enforcement, while Nottingham saw detentions related to disturbance in Market Square. Concurrently, Sunderland police conducted home raids triggering arrests after the tumult on Saturday.\n\nThe Home Office disclosed last night that mosques will receive additional \"emergency security\" with a substantial fund of over \u00a350million earmarked to safeguard faith communities.\n\nMs Cooper declared: \"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, alongside the support from local police forces... anyone involved in this disorder and violence will face the full force of the law.\"\n\nShe added a strong message, asserting: \"As a nation, we will not tolerate criminal behaviour, extremism and racist attacks that go against everything our country stands for.\"", "source": {"uri": "nottinghampost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nottingham Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the scenes as \"utterly appalling\" and assured that police will have full support to take decisive action against those responsible. Enhanced security measures will be introduced for mosques to ensure the swift deployment of security forces and protect worshippers.\n\nIn an emergency statement from No 10 last night, Starmer warned the rioters that they would face severe consequences. \"I guarantee you will regret taking part,\" he declared, addressing both the direct participants and those inciting the violence online. His statement followed an attack on a Holiday Inn Express housing asylum seekers in Rotherham, where demonstrators assaulted police officers and engaged in vandalism.\n\nIn response to the violence, Bolton police imposed a Section 60AA order requiring individuals to remove face coverings. The unrest has sparked discussions about fast-tracking prosecutions, similar to the 2011 riots, with potential 24/7 court operations to expedite cases.\n\nThe riots began in Southport late Tuesday after a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed party and quickly spread across England. The disturbances were exacerbated by false social media rumours about British-born suspect Axel Rudakubana, who is accused of killing three children and injuring ten others. Agitators have targeted mosques, prompting the UK interior ministry to enhance security for Islamic places of worship. The protests, organised on far-right social media under the banner \"Enough is enough,\" feature participants waving flags and chanting anti-migrant slogans.\n\nThe violence extended beyond Rotherham; in Middlesbrough, police officers in riot gear were assaulted with bricks and burning debris-filled wheelie bins. During the disorder in Nottingham's Market Square, arrests were made, while police in Sunderland conducted home raids and made arrests related to Saturday's disturbances. In response to the attacks on mosques, the Home Office has introduced \"emergency security\" measures and allocated over \u00a350 million to protect faith communities.", "source": {"uri":

Earlier in the evening, police had challenged a group of protestors who had gathered at the hotel, housing asylum seekers, leading to clashes where officers attempted to disperse the mob from the entrance.\n\nPolice dogs were deployed as support while demonstrators were forced back. Witnesses reported seeing many among the disorderly group wearing black face masks and chanting of \"Whose streets? Our streets.\"\n\nThe scene escalated as the rioters lobbed items like bottles and bricks at the police, with video footage reportedly displaying several attacks on law enforcement, including thrown projectiles smashing hotel windows and cheers ringing out when officers were struck, reports the Mirror.\n\nOther footage showed flares being thrown and members of the crowd confronting police. Officers were also heard shouting \"get back\" multiple times during the confrontation. Another video gave a clearer view of windows that had been smashed at the hotel.\n\nThe mob did nothing to stop or confront those who were throwing projectiles. Later it appeared police had extinguished the fire. Graffiti was seen having been sprayed on the side reading: \"Get out England (sic).\"\n\nAlarms were also heard going off either inside or close to the Holiday Inn Express as people shouted nearby. A police officer has been injured outside a hotel in Tamworth as officers continue to deal with \"violent acts of thuggery\", Staffordshire Police said.\n\nThe force said: \"We're urging members of the public to avoid the area around the Holiday Inn, Tamworth, as specialist officers continue to deal with violent acts of thuggery. Officers are working valiantly to keep the public safe. Specialist drone surveillance and the national police air service have been sweeping the area as our efforts to identify those involved continue.\"\n\nA helicopter was later spotted hovering above as police officers continued to secure the entrance to the building. Tamworth Police, a division of Staffordshire Police, told The Mirror: \"A large number of officers are deployed in the area in specialist public order equipment.\n\n\"We are working to balance the right to peaceful protest, reassuring the local community and protecting the public. Robust action will be taken against those responsible for violence and disorder.\"\n\nThe Holiday Inn is the second in the hotel chain to be targeted by far-right mobs today. Earlier today, hooligans targeted a Holiday Inn in Rotherham that also accommodated asylum seekers. Far-right rioters clashed with police outside the building and were seen hurling projectiles at officers.\n\nA fire was ignited outside one of the ground floor windows and protesters were later able to force their way into the building. One individual has been arrested on suspicion of public order offences in Rotherham, South Yorkshire Police confirmed.\n\nA group of men residing in the hotel expressed their terror as a mob attempted to break into the building. Speaking to The Mirror, they revealed how they had escaped from war-torn regions but had never felt such fear before.\n\nIt's estimated that around 235 men have been staying at the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham for as long as seven months, with some hailing from Iran and Afghanistan.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

Individuals will be held on remand. Charges will follow. And convictions will follow.\n\n\"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder. Whether directly or those whipping up this action online, and then running away themselves.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is not protest. I won't shy away from calling this what it is - far-Right thuggery.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister was warned not to be \"selective\" in his response to the groups involved in the disorder.\n\nRobert Jenrick, a frontrunner to become the next Tory leader, said the Prime Minister must not show any \"squeamishness or selectivity\" in tackling all those responsible.\n\nHe said the streets should be flooded with tens of thousands of police, with all leave cancelled and officers diverted from unaffected areas to riot hotspots.\n\n\"The ringleaders should be arrested, swiftly prosecuted and jailed for the longest possible time,\" the former immigration minister told The Telegraph.\n\n\"Groups that gather in town or city centres that become violent must be immediately dispersed, with violent thugs arrested.\n\n\"If force is needed to achieve this, it should be used. There must be no squeamishness or selectivity whatsoever to robust law enforcement.\"\n\nNadhim Zahawi, the former Chancellor, also warned that there must be zero tolerance for anyone taking part in riots, including those \"taking matters into their own hands\".\n\nHe said: \"There needs to be a clear, consistent message for all those rioting, even if they think they are 'taking matters into their own hands'; law breaking is not the answer and there must be a zero tolerance response.\n\n\"The Government needs to realise that there is legitimate frustration and pain felt in communities across the country, with recent murders and other violence becoming emblematic of people feeling that their society is becoming unrecognisable. But the violence must be punished.\n\n\"Similarly, the Government needs to say to those thugs who hijack Islam that it will not be tolerant of intolerance. If you settle in Britain like I did, you respect its values and traditions, integrate and be proud of this country, otherwise you must go somewhere else.\"\n\nProtests broke out in the wake of the Southport killings after false information was spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker.\n\nOn Sunday more than 200 hooded rioters descended on the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, which has previously been used to house asylum seekers.\n\nAfter smashing several ground floor windows, the attackers then attempted to set the hotel on fire, torching bins and then using them to blockade the exits.\n\nMosques have been targeted on previous days of the unrest and the Home Office on Sunday announced that extra police and security forces will be deployed to protect mosques after they were targeted by far-Right rioters.\n\nAmid escalating community tensions, in Bolton there were scuffles on the town's streets between anti-immigration protesters and Muslim counter demonstrators.\n\nBy early afternoon the counter-protesters, who were mostly Asian and many in Muslim dress, outnumbered the anti-immigration protest by two to one.\n\nFootage on social media also appeared to show groups of Asian men attacking white males in Middlesbrough.\n\nA reporter for Channel 4 News said groups of Asian and white men were on the streets of the town \"looking for trouble\".\n\nTommy Robinson, who is the subject of an arrest warrant issued by a judge after failing to turn up to court last Monday, was reported to be stoking the riots through his social media posts while on holiday in Cyprus. He denies encouraging or orchestrating violence.\n\nSir Keir is under increasing pressure to bring the violence under control.\n\nIn his statement on Sunday, he opened the door to tougher prison sentences for rioters and announced suspects will be held on remand and locked up immediately after being charged, mirroring action to tackle the 2011 riots when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nThe Prime Minister will lead a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee on Monday alongside Cabinet ministers and senior police figures.\n\nHowever doubts have been raised over whether there are enough jail places available for Sir Keir to mount a 2011-style response to the unrest.\n\nLabour inherited a system that is running at almost full capacity, with only around 700 spaces available in male prisons around the country.\n\nAround 150 arrests have been made across England since Saturday evening, the National Police Chiefs' Council said, with that number expected to rise.\n\nYvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, on Sunday night warned rioters they would face a \"reckoning\" and that police have the Government's backing to take the \"strongest possible action\".\n\nWriting in The Times, she said: \"Make no mistake, there will be a reckoning for the individuals who took part in this violence, those who whipped them up on social media and in online chat forums and those who have felt emboldened by this moment to stir up racial hatred.\"\n\nCassia Rowland, a researcher at the Institute for Government, said locking up all the rioters was \"not an option\" unless more prisoners are released.\n\nShe said: \"The situation in prisons is desperate. We simply don't have the prison spaces available for mass arrests like we saw in 2011.\"\n\nThe Government has announced that, as of Sept 10, thousands of prisoners will be freed when they have served 40pc of their sentence to free up cells.\n\nBut that date has been written into law, meaning the scheme could only be brought forward if Parliament were recalled from recess to amend the legislation.\n\nGovernment sources insisted that internal modelling of prisoner numbers showed there would be enough space to lock up all the rioters.\n\nNo 10 was forced to scotch rumours that Sir Keir was planning to go on holiday on Monday insisting he would be working at Downing Street all week.\n\nThe Prime Minister is now facing demands to recall Parliament so that MPs can debate his response, as Lord Cameron did at the same point during the 2011 unrest.\n\nSir Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, added that Sir Keir \"needs to bring people back to explain what he's doing\".\n\nMeanwhile officials were forced to dampen down speculation they could call the Army in if police forces are stretched to breaking point in the coming days.\n\nHumza Yousaf, a former Scottish first minister, and Tobias Ellwood, an ex-Armed Forces minister, were among those urging Sir Keir to use the military.\n\nMr Yousaf warned the UK was experiencing \"far-Right race riots\" which amounted to \"pogroms against the Muslim community, against people of colour\".\n\nNeil Basu, a former assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, said the riots had made him feel afraid to be black for the first time in decades.\n\nHe said: \"I was born a few weeks before Enoch Powell made a speech that changed my parents' lives. I am the son of immigrants and I am not a white person.\n\n\"I spent 30 years as a police officer feeling pretty secure in my ability to handle myself, I don't feel like that this week and that is a terrible thing for a man in his 57th year to say.\n\n\"But I remember growing up in the 1970s, I watched the National Front march down streets, and this feels very much like that.\"", "source":

This decision comes in response to a recent surge in far-right violence across the nation. From Downing Street, Starmer issued a stern warning to those involved in the riots, stating \"Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law.\"\n\nThe violence escalated on Sunday with rioters attempting to set fire to a hotel housing asylum seekers. The Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire was attacked by violent gangs. In Middlesbrough, rioters smashed windows of houses and cars in residential areas. Cleveland police reported 43 arrests related to these events by early Monday morning.\n\nRioters gathered outside another Holiday Inn in Tamworth on Sunday evening, leading to smashed windows and fires started by petrol bombs. Staffordshire police reported one officer sustained a suspected broken arm. Over the weekend, at least 247 arrests were made across England and Northern Ireland, including London, Hartlepool, Bristol, Belfast, Southport, Hull, Stoke-on-Trent and Liverpool.\n\nChief Constable BJ Harrington revealed that a range of criminal offenses are being investigated in relation to the recent surge in violence. This wave of unrest is considered the worst mass disorder since the 2011 riots across England. Harrington also highlighted the role of social media platforms in inciting and encouraging such violent behavior.\n\nMuslim leaders have voiced their concerns over the safety of their communities amidst the surge in extreme right-wing activity. In response, the Home Office has introduced new emergency security measures aimed at protecting mosques. According to Tell Mama, a national monitoring group, there has been a fivefold increase in threats to Muslims and a threefold increase in hate crime incidents over the past week.\n\nHome Office Minister Diana Johnson confirmed the government's approach to dealing with the rioters, stating that courts would sit for longer hours to process cases swiftly. The Police Federation warned that regular policing might suffer as officers are pulled to respond to the widespread disorder. Despite these concerns, Johnson reassured that the police have sufficient resources to handle the situation and there is no need for military intervention.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com",

Are you white?' one could be heard shouting at a car trying to cross the intersection where hundreds marched with anti-immigration groups earlier today.\n\n'Yes, he is!' someone else was heard shouting back.\n\nTwo cars narrowly avoided colliding as they sped away from the mob, prompting one of the agitators to whine he had 'nearly been run over' and calling out 'where's your police?'\n\nRows of officers wielding riot shields were seen near the commotion as thugs circled on BMXs and continued stopping cars, standing in the middle of the road.\n\nCleveland Police said this afternoon they are continuing to deal with 'disorder' in Middlesbrough, claiming to have arrested nine people 'relating to violent disorder offences'.\n\n'We are urging members of the public to stay away from Middlesbrough while officers respond to violent disorder in the town,' Assistant Chief Constable David Felton said in a statement.\n\nThe horrifying TikTok video of the 'checkpoint' on Linthorpe Road in Middlesbrough drew outcry as it was shared across social media.\n\n'This is a pretty concerning development. I thought we were supposed to be moving towards a more inclusive and equitable society, not regressing back to the days of segregation,' one user wrote.\n\n'So utterly disappointed with this country and this disgusting behaviour,' another said.\n\n'This is beyond sad... what is going on fgs,' a third user added.\n\nMiddlesbrough has seen a thoroughly disturbing spate of violence over the weekend as far-right groups torched cars and hurled bricks.\n\nA so-called protest organised by anti-immigration groups was organised to travel along the Linthorpe Road, where a mob was later seen screening drivers.\n\nBuses announced they would change their schedules to avoid the disorder.\n\nHooligans set fire to cars and wheelie bins, pushed towards police trying to restore order.\n\nAbout 300 people gathered in front of a mosque in Waterloo Road in the town to guard it while police blocked off nearby streets.\n\nOne resident told the PA news agency: 'We're going to be paying for this, and for what?\n\n'This has got nothing to do with three little girls that have lost their lives. They've used it to cause utter mayhem on our streets.'\n\nA person was seen being stretchered into an ambulance after an incident at the Swatters Carr pub.\n\nPolice in riot gear were forced to retreat to get away from a group dressed in hoods and face coverings at one point.\n\nHumza Yousaf has called for the army to be called in to stop 'thugs' causing disorder on the streets as violence continued unabated through Sunday.\n\n'It doesn't look like, to me, the police have a handle on the situation,' the former first minister of Scotland said.\n\n'The police have not been able to protect those that are in the Holiday Inn [in Rotherham],' he added.\n\n'The army can help to get control where the police are unable.'\n\nDespite calls for police to have more powers to clamp down on the riots, Dame Diana Johnson, the Minister for Policing, said police have said they have 'all the resources they need' to deal with the disorder.\n\nIn Hull last night police used tear gas against thugs who smashed the windows of a hotel housing asylum seekers, while cars were set alight and vandalised through the afternoon.\n\nSimilar horror rocked Rotherham today as groups stormed a Holiday Inn housing asylum seekers.\n\nAround 700 violent anti-immigration protesters clad in balaclavas and draped in St George's flags clashed with officers trying to protect the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire since around 2pm this afternoon.\n\nObjects and pieces of wood were flung at officers who had lined up in front of the building with at least one cop in riot gear being carried away by their colleagues.\n\nThe grass around the hotel appears to have been set on fire as well.\n\nSome were seen preparing to throw bricks of concrete as the violence spiralled.\n\nIt is unclear if the migrants and asylum seekers housed in the property have been able to evacuate.\n\nMailOnline has contacted the Home Office.\n\nJohn Healey MP urged anyone with information about the disorder at the Holiday Inn, Manvers and the wider area to report it by contacting SYP on 101, quoting 'incident number 239' of August 4, 2024.\n\nPolice said late this evening that officers were 'aware and responding proactively' to 'protest activity' in Tamworth, a small town in Staffordshire.\n\n'Robust action will be taken against those responsible for violence and disorder,' a statement read.\n\nFootage shared showed crowds standing around a Holiday Inn believed to be housing asylum seekers.\n\nBottles were launched at police, witnesses said.\n\nVideo appeared to show red flares being lit outside.\n\nA small group of demonstrators carried St George's Flag through Lancaster, shouting at a much larger crowd of counter-protestors in the main shopping district of the small university city.\n\nPolice were on guard to separate the groups, chanting back and forth at each other.\n\nChants of 'refugees are welcome here' were heard from the counter-protestors.\n\nOthers sang 'There are many many more of us than you' from the steps of the Town Hall.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police said several of its officers were injured during 'deplorable acts of violence' outside the Holiday Inn Express in the Manvers area of Rotherham today.\n\nAt least ten officers have been injured as a result of the violence, with one left unconscious following a head injury, another suffering a suspected fractured elbow and other suffering suspected broken bones.\n\nNo hotel employees or residents have been injured, police said.\n\nA heavy police presence will remain outside the hotel and in the surrounding area over the course of the rest of this evening and into tomorrow.\n\n'The behaviour we witnessed has been nothing short of disgusting,' said Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield.\n\n'While it was a smaller number of those in attendance who chose to commit violence and destruction, those who simply stood on and watched remain absolutely complicit in this.\n\n'Those who choose to spread misinformation and hate online, also need to take responsibility for the scenes today - this was not a protest, just angry people, reacting to a false narrative who have their own motivations for doing so.'\n\nThe Prime Minister this evening condemned the 'thuggery' of the far-right mob who stormed the hotel, promising those involved in the violence would 'regret it' as the government introduced emergency measures to bring rioters to justice.\n\nUK courts are to operate for 24 hours to expedite prosecutions of those involved in the riots, the government confirmed yesterday as violence erupted on the streets of Belfast, Hull, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Stoke.\n\nSaturday was the second night of violent confrontations after riots broke in Sunderland on Friday.\n\nA Citizens Advice bureau in Sunderland was set alight on Friday amid the senseless attacks on community pillars.\n\nITV journalist Jonny Blair wrote on Twitter/X on Saturday: 'Its manager this morning told me they're devastated and now trying to figure out how to help the people they were supposed to see.'\n\nSix people are due to appear in court following the night of disorder on Friday.\n\nThousands of protestors, including children as young as six, gathered in Keel Square in the city centre in response to the Southport stabbings.\n\nNorthumbria Police launched an investigation which has so far seen 14 people arrested for their role in the clashes with officers.\n\nFive men, aged 48, 41, 31, 29, 27, and a 43-year-old woman have been charged with violent disorder.\n\nThe 27-year-old man has also been charged with one count of burglary.\n\nAll are due to appear before Magistrates' tomorrow.\n\nAnd last night, thugs in Merseyside set fire to a library, which also functioned as a food bank, intended to help support deprived people in the community.\n\nAs firefighters tried to put on the flames that engulfed Spellow Lane Library Hub rioters threw a missile at the engine, before breaking the rear window of a nearby cab.\n\nHeartbreaking video of the centre as it opened last year went viral on Twitter/X as users denounced the shameless attacks.\n\nMany police units were pushed to breaking point last night as clashes continued in multiple cities.\n\nProtesters tried to kick down police officer's riot gear, while other demonstrators threw objects at their shields.\n\nLooters took advantage of the chaos, stealing phones, shoes and wine from the shelves of every-day stores, smashing their windows with bricks and stones.\n\nIn Liverpool, shameless yobs squealed 'get the phones! Get the phones!' as a group surrounded and battered their way into a phone repair and vape shop in the city centre.\n\nKicking the shutters with the feet and wrenching them up in a wild frenzy, the mob battered at the glass with what appeared to be a bollard before leaving the road outside strewn with packaging after they emptied the shelves.\n\nThe riots have swept across several UK cities following the deaths of three young girls in Southport.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, a 17-year-old from Lancashire, was identified as the suspect in the case, charged with murdering three children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on July 29.\n\nHe is accused of killing Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, with a kitchen knife on Monday.\n\nEight other children sustained knife wounds, with five of them left in critical condition.\n\nJudge Menary KC cited 'idiotic rioting' in parts of the UK in his reasoning for lifting the automatic anonymity given to Rudakubana, as misinformation spread online about the suspect's identity.\n\nClaims falsely circulated social media that the suspect was a Muslim asylum seeker.\n\nRudakubana was born in Cardiff, described as a 'quiet choir boy' with a family involved in the local Christian church.\n\nSammy Woodhouse, a high-profile victim of the Rotherham child grooming gang scandal, said of the suspect in a broadcast: '[People] feel like they are not being told any information.\n\n'They know the guy's not a British guy. They know he's of a different ethnicity. There's talk of him being a Muslim as well.'\n\nThe clip was shared by Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, after police had clarified that the claims were false, The Times reports.\n\nRobinson, 41, had a UK arrest warrant issued against him last Monday after he skipped a court appearance.\n\nMailOnline revealed exclusively that he has been staying at a five-star hotel in Cyprus as riots sweep England.\n\nCommunity leaders and families of the victims of the murders in Southport have criticised the unrest.\n\n'While this should be a time for quiet reflection and remembrance, since Monday, too many people have sought to use the tragedy to create division and hate,' a group of faith leaders from Liverpool said in a joint statement.", "source": {"uri":

This false narrative fueled anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiment, leading to violent riots.\n\nREAD ALSO: 14-Year-Old Nigeria killed in London sword attack\n\nRiots first broke out the day after the attack, with large crowds gathering outside a mosque and throwing bottles and bricks at police vans. Despite police clarification that the 17-year-old suspect was born in Britain and came from a Christian family, the unrest continued to escalate.\n\nBy Saturday, the violence had spread to Liverpool, Bristol, and Manchester, resulting in dozens of arrests. Shops and businesses were vandalized and looted, and several police officers were injured.\n\nIn the latest wave of violence, rioters attacked a hotel in Rotherham that houses asylum seekers, throwing objects, spraying fire extinguishers at police officers, and smashing windows.\n\nStarmer denounced the attacks, stating that there was no justification for such violence and urging all right-minded individuals to condemn the disorder. \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or by whipping up this action online and then running away,\" he warned.\n\nEarlier, Starmer pledged the government's full support to police forces to take decisive action against \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper also issued a strong warning, stating that those engaging in \"unacceptable disorder\" would face imprisonment, travel bans, and other severe punishments. \"Criminal violence and disorder have no place on Britain's streets,\" Cooper said, adding that \"sufficient\" prison spaces had been made available to detain those arrested.", "source": {"uri": "nationaldailyng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Daily NG"},

Individuals will be held on remand. Charges will follow. And convictions will follow.\n\n\"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder. Whether directly or those whipping up this action online, and then running away themselves.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is not protest. I won't shy away from calling this what it is - far-Right thuggery.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister was warned not to be \"selective\" in his response to the groups involved in the disorder.\n\nRobert Jenrick, a frontrunner to become the next Tory leader, said the Prime Minister must not show any \"squeamishness or selectivity\" in tackling all those responsible.\n\nHe said the streets should be flooded with tens of thousands of police, with all leave cancelled and officers diverted from unaffected areas to riot hotspots.\n\n\"The ringleaders should be arrested, swiftly prosecuted and jailed for the longest possible time,\" the former immigration minister told The Telegraph.\n\n\"Groups that gather in town or city centres that become violent must be immediately dispersed, with violent thugs arrested.\n\n\"If force is needed to achieve this, it should be used. There must be no squeamishness or selectivity whatsoever to robust law enforcement.\"\n\n'Law breaking is not the answer'\n\nNadhim Zahawi, the former Chancellor, also warned that there must be zero tolerance for anyone taking part in riots, including those \"taking matters into their own hands\".\n\nHe said: \"There needs to be a clear, consistent message for all those rioting, even if they think they are 'taking matters into their own hands'; law breaking is not the answer and there must be a zero tolerance response.\n\n\"The Government needs to realise that there is legitimate frustration and pain felt in communities across the country, with recent murders and other violence becoming emblematic of people feeling that their society is becoming unrecognisable. But the violence must be punished.\n\n\"Similarly, the Government needs to say to those thugs who hijack Islam that it will not be tolerant of intolerance. If you settle in Britain like I did, you respect its values and traditions, integrate and be proud of this country, otherwise you must go somewhere else.\"\n\nProtests broke out in the wake of the Southport killings after false information was spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker.\n\nOn Sunday more than 200 hooded rioters descended on the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, which has previously been used to house asylum seekers.\n\nAfter smashing several ground floor windows, the attackers then attempted to set the hotel on fire, torching bins and then using them to blockade the exits.\n\nMosques have been targeted on previous days of the unrest and the Home Office on Sunday announced that extra police and security forces will be deployed to protect mosques after they were targeted by far-Right rioters.\n\nAmid escalating community tensions, in Bolton there were scuffles on the town's streets between anti-immigration protesters and Muslim counter demonstrators.\n\nBy early afternoon the counter-protesters, who were mostly Asian and many in Muslim dress, outnumbered the anti-immigration protest by two to one.\n\nFootage on social media also appeared to show groups of Asian men attacking white males in Middlesbrough.\n\nA reporter for Channel 4 News said groups of Asian and white men were on the streets of the town \"looking for trouble\".\n\nSir Keir is under increasing pressure to bring the violence under control.\n\nIn his statement on Sunday, he opened the door to tougher prison sentences for rioters and announced suspects will be held on remand and locked up immediately after being charged, mirroring action to tackle the 2011 riots when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nThe Prime Minister will lead a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee on Monday alongside Cabinet ministers and senior police figures.\n\nHowever doubts have been raised over whether there are enough jail places available for Sir Keir to mount a 2011-style response to the unrest.\n\nLabour inherited a system that is running at almost full capacity, with only around 700 spaces available in male prisons around the country.\n\nAround 150 arrests have been made across England since Saturday evening, the National Police Chiefs' Council said, with that number expected to rise.\n\nCassia Rowland, a researcher at the Institute for Government, said locking up all the rioters was \"not an option\" unless more prisoners are released.\n\nShe said: \"The situation in prisons is desperate. We simply don't have the prison spaces available for mass arrests like we saw in 2011.\"\n\nThe Government has announced that, as of Sept 10, thousands of prisoners will be freed when they have served 40pc of their sentence to free up cells.\n\nBut that date has been written into law, meaning the scheme could only be brought forward if Parliament were recalled from recess to amend the legislation.\n\nGovernment sources insisted that internal modelling of prisoner numbers showed there would be enough space to lock up all the rioters.\n\nNo 10 was forced to scotch rumours that Sir Keir was planning to go on holiday on Monday insisting he would be working at Downing Street all week.\n\nThe Prime Minister is now facing demands to recall Parliament so that MPs can debate his response, as Lord Cameron did at the same point during the 2011 unrest.\n\nSir Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, added that Sir Keir \"needs to bring people back to explain what he's doing\".\n\nMeanwhile officials were forced to dampen down speculation they could call the Army in if police forces are stretched to breaking point in the coming days.\n\nHumza Yousaf, a former Scottish first minister, and Tobias Ellwood, an ex-Armed Forces minister, were among those urging Sir Keir to use the military.\n\nMr Yousaf warned the UK was experiencing \"far-Right race riots\" which amounted to \"pogroms against the Muslim community, against people of colour\".\n\nNeil Basu, a former assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, said the riots had made him feel afraid to be black for the first time in decades.\n\nHe said: \"I was born a few weeks before Enoch Powell made a speech that changed my parents' lives. I am the son of immigrants and I am not a white person.\n\n\"I spent 30 years as a police officer feeling pretty secure in my ability to handle myself, I don't feel like that this week and that is a terrible thing for a man in his 57th year to say.\n\n\"But I remember growing up in the 1970s, I watched the National Front march down streets, and this feels very much like that.\"", "source":

Individuals will be held on remand. Charges will follow. And convictions will follow.\n\n\"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder. Whether directly or those whipping up this action online, and then running away themselves.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is not protest. I won't shy away from calling this what it is - far-Right thuggery.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister was warned not to be \"selective\" in his response to the groups involved in the disorder.\n\nRobert Jenrick, a frontrunner to become the next Tory leader, said the Prime Minister must not show any \"squeamishness or selectivity\" in tackling all those responsible.\n\nHe said the streets should be flooded with tens of thousands of police, with all leave cancelled and officers diverted from unaffected areas to riot hotspots.\n\n\"The ringleaders should be arrested, swiftly prosecuted and jailed for the longest possible time,\" the former immigration minister told The Telegraph.\n\n\"Groups that gather in town or city centres that become violent must be immediately dispersed, with violent thugs arrested.\n\n\"If force is needed to achieve this, it should be used. There must be no squeamishness or selectivity whatsoever to robust law enforcement.\"\n\nNadhim Zahawi, the former Chancellor, also warned that there must be zero tolerance for anyone taking part in riots, including those \"taking matters into their own hands\".\n\nHe said: \"There needs to be a clear, consistent message for all those rioting, even if they think they are 'taking matters into their own hands'; law breaking is not the answer and there must be a zero tolerance response.\n\n\"The Government needs to realise that there is legitimate frustration and pain felt in communities across the country, with recent murders and other violence becoming emblematic of people feeling that their society is becoming unrecognisable. But the violence must be punished.\n\n\"Similarly, the Government needs to say to those thugs who hijack Islam that it will not be tolerant of intolerance. If you settle in Britain like I did, you respect its values and traditions, integrate and be proud of this country, otherwise you must go somewhere else.\"\n\nProtests broke out in the wake of the Southport killings after false information was spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker.\n\nOn Sunday more than 200 hooded rioters descended on the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, which has previously been used to house asylum seekers.\n\nAfter smashing several ground floor windows, the attackers then attempted to set the hotel on fire, torching bins and then using them to blockade the exits.\n\nMosques have been targeted on previous days of the unrest and the Home Office on Sunday announced that extra police and security forces will be deployed to protect mosques after they were targeted by far-Right rioters.\n\nAmid escalating community tensions, in Bolton there were scuffles on the town's streets between anti-immigration protesters and Muslim counter demonstrators.\n\nBy early afternoon the counter-protesters, who were mostly Asian and many in Muslim dress, outnumbered the anti-immigration protest by two to one.\n\nFootage on social media also appeared to show groups of Asian men attacking white males in Middlesbrough.\n\nA reporter for Channel 4 News said groups of Asian and white men were on the streets of the town \"looking for trouble\".\n\nSir Keir is under increasing pressure to bring the violence under control.\n\nIn his statement on Sunday, he opened the door to tougher prison sentences for rioters and announced suspects will be held on remand and locked up immediately after being charged, mirroring action to tackle the 2011 riots when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nThe Prime Minister will lead a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee on Monday alongside Cabinet ministers and senior police figures.\n\nHowever doubts have been raised over whether there are enough jail places available for Sir Keir to mount a 2011-style response to the unrest.\n\nLabour inherited a system that is running at almost full capacity, with only around 700 spaces available in male prisons around the country.\n\nAround 150 arrests have been made across England since Saturday evening, the National Police Chiefs' Council said, with that number expected to rise.\n\nCassia Rowland, a researcher at the Institute for Government, said locking up all the rioters was \"not an option\" unless more prisoners are released.\n\nShe said: \"The situation in prisons is desperate. We simply don't have the prison spaces available for mass arrests like we saw in 2011.\"\n\nThe Government has announced that, as of Sept 10, thousands of prisoners will be freed when they have served 40pc of their sentence to free up cells.\n\nBut that date has been written into law, meaning the scheme could only be brought forward if Parliament were recalled from recess to amend the legislation.\n\nGovernment sources insisted that internal modelling of prisoner numbers showed there would be enough space to lock up all the rioters.\n\nNo 10 was forced to scotch rumours that Sir Keir was planning to go on holiday on Monday insisting he would be working at Downing Street all week.\n\nThe Prime Minister is now facing demands to recall Parliament so that MPs can debate his response, as Lord Cameron did at the same point during the 2011 unrest.\n\nSir Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, added that Sir Keir \"needs to bring people back to explain what he's doing\".\n\nMeanwhile officials were forced to dampen down speculation they could call the Army in if police forces are stretched to breaking point in the coming days.\n\nHumza Yousaf, a former Scottish first minister, and Tobias Ellwood, an ex-Armed Forces minister, were among those urging Sir Keir to use the military.\n\nMr Yousaf warned the UK was experiencing \"far-Right race riots\" which amounted to \"pogroms against the Muslim community, against people of colour\".\n\nNeil Basu, a former assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, said the riots had made him feel afraid to be black for the first time in decades.\n\nHe said: \"I was born a few weeks before Enoch Powell made a speech that changed my parents' lives. I am the son of immigrants and I am not a white person.\n\n\"I spent 30 years as a police officer feeling pretty secure in my ability to handle myself, I don't feel like that this week and that is a terrible thing for a man in his 57th year to say.\n\n\"But I remember growing up in the 1970s, I watched the National Front march down streets, and this feels very much like that.\"", "source":

There were clashes in other towns.\n\nPM Sir Keir Starmer said those involved would face the \"full force of the law\".\n\nIn a hard-hitting message from Downing Street, the PM told them: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nHe went on: \"This is not a \u00adprotest, it is organised, violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets or online.\n\n\"All right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe.\n\n\"And yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted.\n\n\"I won't shy away from calling this what it is: Far-right thuggery.\"\n\nTowns and cities hit -- the fifth day of violence -- included Rotherham, Aldershot in Hants, Middlesbrough, Bolton, Manchester, Hull and Weymouth, Dorset.\n\nTerrifying footage from Rotherham showed masked yobs kicking out windows to storm the \u00adHoliday Inn Express, which houses migrants.\n\nAnother Holiday Inn where asylum seekers are thought to stay was set alight in Tamworth, Staffordshire.\n\nThe thugs in Rotherham forced their way past cops into the hotel after pelting them with bricks, \u00adbottles and even fence panels. Some then hurled chairs.\n\nFire broke out as they chanted: \"Get them out.\"\n\nPlacards carried by far-right \u00adsupporters had slogans such as \"stop the boats\" and, in a cruel barb aimed at asylum seekers: \"Men don't flee war.\"\n\nAnother made reference to Enoch Powell's inflammatory 1968 Rivers of Blood speech.\n\nThe thugs chased away around 100 counter-protesters.\n\nAt least one injured cop was seen being carried by colleagues, while a number of protesters were handcuffed as police battled to regain control.\n\nThe nationwide disorder has been fuelled by online lies following the murders of three girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nPosts wrongly claimed suspect Axel Rudakubana, 17, was a Muslim asylum seeker.\n\nDemonstrations were promoted on X/Twitter by former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson -- from the safety of an all-inclusive resort on the outskirts of Ayia Napa, Cyprus.\n\nThe 41-year-old is understood to be staying at a \u00a3400-a-night chalet bungalow with his family.\n\nHe has been seen lazing on sun loungers and taking dips in a pool.\n\nA series of inflammatory posts he shared with his 800,000 followers include ones blasting the PM and police for cracking down on rioters.\n\nBut last night he insisted: \"I am not at fault.\"\n\nMeanwhile another migrant hotel, this time in Aldershot, was also targeted.\n\nA group of men outside Potters International Hotel brandished a banner insisting: \"We're not far right, we're just right.\"\n\nAt Middlesbrough's Cenotaph, hundreds of protesters squared up to police before throwing slate, cans and pots at the officers.\n\nA group of masked yobs walked through a residential area using metal bars and wooden posts to smash car windscreens and the windows of terraced houses.\n\nVehicles were torched, along with wheelie bins.\n\nOne victim, a white man in his 40s who did not want to be named, said: \"I'm born and bred in Middlesbrough and these morons target my house just for the hell of it. I could hear them yelling about immigrants, but they were smashing cars and house windows indiscriminately.\n\n\"They're the scum of the earth.\"\n\nCleveland Police confirmed \u00ada number of arrests had been made and warned the public to avoid the area.\n\nIn the centre of Bolton, large crowds of anti-immigration demonstrators gathered along with \u00adcounter-protesters while police tried to keep them apart.\n\nAn anti-immigrant rally on Weymouth seafront was met by a counter-protest.\n\nThree far-right sympathisers were said to have been handcuffed and arrested trying to break through police lines.\n\nThere was a large turnout in Hull, scene of earlier violence.\n\nGreater Manchester Police said a Section 34 dispersal notice had been authorised until 10pm yesterday, giving officers extra powers to deal with anyone causing anti-social behaviour.\n\nChief Inspector Natasha Evans said the force was acting to \"prevent serious disruption and ensure everyone can go about their lives without fear or risk of harm\".\n\nMerseyside Police introduced two Section 60 orders in Liverpool and Southport between 2pm yesterday and 2am today, giving officers greater stop-and-search powers.\n\nLast night faith leaders in Merseyside issued a joint statement calling for calm and urging people to hold the families of Southport stabbing victims Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, at \"the forefront of all our thoughts\".\n\nThey said: \"Division can destroy the very relationships and environment that we depend upon every day of our lives and there is no place for hate in our communities.\n\n\"It can -- and has -- left communities in fear and has put people in danger. At this difficult time, let us remember that there is far more that unites than divides us.\n\n\"The people of all faiths and none who came out to sweep the streets, to rebuild walls and have so generously donated money in memory of those three girls -- that is the spirit that will help us through this incredibly challenging time.\"\n\nSaturday saw forces pushed to the brink with more than 100 arrests and dozens of \u00adofficers hurt.\n\nTrouble flared in Belfast, Blackpool, Stoke, Leeds, Hull, Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Bristol and Portsmouth.\n\nLast night National Police Chiefs' Council lead for public order, BJ Harrington, said leave had been cancelled by many forces and 4,000 officers put on standby.\n\nMr Harrington warned those involved in disorder: \"Make no mistake, if you haven't had a knock on the door yet, your time will come.\"\n\nHe said fake news inflamed the trouble and urged social media users to be careful what they share, adding: \"Think twice before you act.\"\n\nPolicing minister Dame Diana Johnson suggested courts could sit overnight to ensure \"thugs who maraud our streets\" are brought to justice.\n\nSimilar action was taken in the wake of the 2011 London riots.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper announced new emergency measures to protect mosques.\n\nThose at risk of violent disorder will be offered additional security personnel.\n\nShe said: \"Britain is a proud and tolerant country, and nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops or attacking people based on the colour of their skin.\n\n\"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the Government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme.\"", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors":

The anti-immigrant hooligans chanted \"get them out\", \"you're not welcome anymore\" and \"Yorkshire\" as they encouraged each other to attack the hotel.\n\nAnother young group of men held a banner saying: \"Stopping the boats means stopping the stabbings\" and other offensive chants could be heard targeting Muslims and immigrants.\n\nHome secretary condemned the incident in a statement on Twitter and warned those taking part of the repercussions.\n\n\"The criminal, violent attack on a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham is utterly appalling,\" she said. \"Deliberately setting fire to a building with people known to be inside. South Yorkshire Police have full Government support for the strongest action against those responsible.\n\nTensions in Rotherham had been running high earlier in the day as the protesters gathered outside the hotel to be met by anti-racism protesters who chanted \"refugees welcome\". It escalated out of control as the anti-immigrant protesters hurled missiles at the hotel and attacked police officers with pieces of wood and chairs. One officer has been dragged away from the scene with a suspected injury.\n\nRotherham's MP Sarah Champion, said: \"I'm extremely concerned at the escalating violence we are seeing at Holiday Inn, Manvers. The people causing damage and attacking police do not represent our town and I am disgusted by their actions. This is criminal disorder and intimidation - not protest.\"\n\nAnd Shadow home secretary James Cleverly hit out at the scenes, saying: \"There is not and can never be any excuse, justification or rationale for behavior like this.\n\n\"This should be condemned by everybody, and those taking part should expect to be met with the full weight of the law.\"\n\nIt marks another day of far-right violence on the streets of Britain after battles between police and anti-immigrant thugs on Saturday in various cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Hull.\n\nThe far-right has drawn widespread condemnation after disorder in multiple towns and cities in the wake of the killings of three young girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect, later identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana from Lancashire, was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nSir Keir held crisis talks with ministers on Saturday over the unrest, with Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood telling colleagues \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nElsewhere, more than 300 members of the far-right started marching through Middlesbrough at 4.25pm after gathering at the city's Cenotaph.\n\nThey carried a banner saying: \"Tom Jones is Welsh, Axel Rudakubana isn't\" and chanted \"We want our country back\" as they made their way through the city centre.\n\nAt one point police used dogs to keep the group back and stop them breaking through and running ahead of the officers patrolling the march.\n\nAt least two people were taken away in handcuffs within the first half hour, while several pieces of slate were thrown, along with vapes and full plastic bottles.\n\nSome people kicked bollards into the road so that police vehicles driving ahead of the group could not get through, and one man sat on the bonnet of a police car to stop it from moving.\n\nBusinesses including McDonald's locked their doors as hundreds of demonstrators walked through the city centre.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Prime Minister addressed the nation following days of disorder across the UK, including in Liverpool.\n\nViolent disorder took place in Liverpool city centre and in Walton on Saturday, August 3. The staging of a protest at the Pier Head led to scenes of destruction and looting across the city centre before rioters descended on Walton on Saturday evening, causing major damage on County Road in what police described as \"serious violent disorder\".\n\nChaos, violence and destruction followed as looters targeted businesses, bins were used to start fires and the Spellow Library & Community Hub was set alight. The chaos started when people began to assemble near County Road Mosque.\n\nAddressing the nation from Downing Street, the Prime Minister said: \"Be in no doubt, those that have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law. The police will be making arrests. Individuals will be held on remand, charges will follow and convictions will follow.\n\n\"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves. This is not a protest, it is organised, violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets or online.\"\n\nViolence has also taken place on the streets of Sunderland, Rotherham, Manchester, Belfast and many other cities this week, with ethnic minorities targeted. Sir Keir said he wanted those who \"feel targeted because of the colour of their skin\" to know \"this violent mob do not represent our country, and we will bring them to justice\".\n\nHe said: \"There is no justification, none, for taking this action. And all right-minded people should be condemning this assault of violence.\n\n\"People in this country have a right to be safe. And yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques.\n\n\"Other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery. To those who feel targeted because of the colour of your skin or your faith, I know how frightening this must be.\n\n\"I want you to know that this violent mob do not represent our country, and we will bring them to justice.

A large bin close to a window of the hotel was also set alight but the small fire was extinguished.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police, which is responsible for Rotherham, said at least 10 officers were injured, including one who was left unconscious.\n\n\"The behavior we witnessed has been nothing short of disgusting. While it was a smaller number of those in attendance who chose to commit violence and destruction, those who simply stood on and watched remain absolutely complicit in this,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield. \"We have officers working hard, reviewing the considerable online imagery and footage of those involved, and they should expect us to be at their doors very soon.\"\n\nFar-right agitators have sought to take advantage of last week's stabbing attack by tapping into concerns about the scale of immigration in the U.K., in particular the tens of thousands of migrants arriving in boats from France. Tensions were also running high Sunday in the northeastern town of Middlesbrough, where some protesters broke free of a police guard. One group walked through a residential area smashing the windows of houses and cars. When asked by a resident why they were breaking windows, one man replied, \"Because we're English.\"\n\nStarmer said anyone targeting people for the color of their skin or their faith is far-right.\n\n\"People in this country have a right to be safe, and yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery,\" he

Masked rioters threw wooden planks and sprayed fire extinguishers at police officers outside the hotel. A police helicopter hovered above, and at least one injured officer in riot gear was removed from the scene as tensions escalated.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer sharply condemned the attack on the hotel housing asylum seekers on Sunday, denouncing it as \"far-right thuggery\".\n\nThe government pledged tough action against those it said were exploiting the murder of three girls to stir up disorder. Starmer on Sunday pledged to put an end to the ongoing violent protests against immigration, asserting that those responsible will face the full force of the law.\n\n\"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves. This is not a protest, it is organised, violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets or online,\" he added.\n\nTiffany Lynch, from the Police Federation of England and Wales, told the BBC, \"We're seeing officers that are being pulled from day-to-day policing. But while that's happening, the communities that are out there that are having incidents against them -- victims of crime -- unfortunately, their crimes are not being investigated.\"\n\nThe hotel is said to have been used to accommodate migrants, but it is uncertain whether any are still residing there after the previous Conservative government pledged to shut down over a hundred such facilities this year.\n\nAnti-Immigration Protests Hit Parts Of UK\n\nSimilar protests are anticipated in Bolton, Lancaster, Middlesborough, Weymouth, and Newcastle upon Tyne. Since Saturday evening, approximately 150 arrests related to the disorder have been made across England, with the National Police Chiefs' Council expecting the number to increase in the coming days.\n\nOn Saturday, far-right activists clashed with anti-racism protesters throughout the UK, leading to violent incidents in cities including Belfast, Liverpool, and Bristol. Additional arrests are expected as police examine CCTV, social media, and body-worn camera footage.\n\nThe violence erupted after false rumours circulated online claiming that the suspect in the dance class stabbing attack was a Muslim immigrant, which incited anger among far-right supporters.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [],

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth, Staffordshire, became the scene of chaos as a far-right group celebrated while setting fires inside the property amidst violent demonstrations. Dramatic footage captured the moment when yobs smashed their way into the hotel through a window, while onlookers from the far-right crowd cheered as flames took hold within.\n\nAnother fire was seen outside the hotel as rioters hurled missiles into the building. Tension escalated at the hotel following the arrival of numerous protestors earlier in the evening, which resulted in clashes with police officers. The officers moved to disperse the demonstrators from the entrance of the hotel.\n\nIn the midst of the disorder, at least one police dog was present at the scene as authorities attempted to push the crowd away from the hotel, which is currently accommodating asylum seekers.\n\nRead more: Ten people arrested amid protest disorder after clashes in Midlands town\n\nVideos shot by the rioters themselves showed projectiles such as bottles and bricks being thrown towards police lines. Despite the use of riot shields, windows were shattered.\n\nOther footage revealed flares being launched and crowd members confronting police. Officers were also heard repeatedly shouting \"get back\" during the face-off. Another video provided a clearer view of windows that had been shattered at the hotel. The mob did nothing to intervene or confront those who were hurling projectiles.\n\nPolice had put out the fire, it has been confirmed. Graffiti was spotted sprayed on the side reading: \"Get out England (sic).\" Alarms were also heard ringing either inside or near the Holiday Inn as people yelled nearby.\n\nTamworth Police, a division of Staffordshire Police, informed The Mirror: \"A large number of officers are deployed in the area in specialist public order equipment. We are working to balance the right to peaceful protest, reassuring the local community and protecting the public. Robust action will be taken against those responsible for violence and disorder.\"\n\nAn unverified image, thought to depict the same hotel, showed several individuals preparing to enter the building. In the video, one man could be heard saying: \"We've had a f****** nuff haven't we (sic).\"\n\nThe Holiday Inn is the second in the hotel chain to be targeted by far-right mobs today. Earlier today, hooligans targeted a Holiday Inn in Rotherham that also housed asylum seekers. Far-right rioters clashed with police outside the building and were seen throwing projectiles at officers.\n\nA fire was ignited outside a ground-floor window and later, protesters managed to break into the building. South Yorkshire Police reported one arrest on suspicion of public order offences in Rotherham.\n\nA group of men inside the hotel expressed their fear for their lives as the mob attempted to break into the building. They shared with The Mirror that despite fleeing from war zones, they had never experienced such terror. It's estimated that around 235 men have been residing at the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham for as long as seven months. Some of these men are from Iran and Afghanistan.", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "annabal_bagdi@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Annabal Bagdi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "anders_anglesey@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Anders Anglesey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamworth,_Staffordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tamworth, Staffordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamworth, Staffordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Inn", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Holiday Inn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_hooliganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football hooliganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Inn_Express", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holiday Inn Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffordshire_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Staffordshire Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yorkshire_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Yorkshire Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29676715.ece/alternates/s1200/1_screenshot-2024-08-04-at-213244.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789876", "eventUri": "eng-9789876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

\"tearing communities apart\".\n\nBrent Council leader, Muhammed Butt, said that while the borough had been \"spared specific protests\", the authority understands \"the unease and fear some residents may feel\".\n\nHe urged anyone with concerns to reach out directly to their ward councillor.\n\nThe intervention by senior politicians in north London comes amid a sixth day of disorder.\n\nRiots have

Prime Minister Keir Starmer has vowed that the rioters will \"face the full force of the law.\"\n\nHundreds of people gathered outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham on Sunday afternoon, pelting police officers with wood and bottles and chanting \"get them out,\" referring to the 130 asylum seekers housed in the hotel since 2022.\n\nSouth Yorkshire police said at least ten officers were injured in clashes with the rioters, who broke windows and set dumpsters ablaze outside the building, before setting a fire inside the hotel's ground floor.\n\nMultiple arrests were made, and the fire was extinguished shortly afterwards.\n\nDozens of British towns and cities have been rocked by right-wing protests and riots since Monday, when a British teenager of Rwandan descent stabbed three children to death and injured ten others in the town of Southport, near Liverpool. Although initially sparked by a false rumor that the knifeman responsible for the stabbings was Muslim, the demonstrations have since grown into a wider backlash against Islam, mass immigration, and the perception that political leaders are more concerned with suppressing right-wing dissent than tackling immigrant crime.\n\nMore than 150 people were arrested after riots in Liverpool, Manchester, Stoke, Leeds and other cities on Saturday. Similar riots took place in locations including Middlesbrough, Blackburn, and Tamworth on Sunday. Mobs of Muslim protesters, some armed with knives and machetes, have been seen in some cities, including Bolton and Stoke.\n\nIn a speech on Sunday, Starmer warned that more arrests would follow. \"Those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law,\" he declared, warning that those responsible \"will regret taking part in this disorder.\" In Sunday's address and in a similar speech earlier this week, Starmer did not discuss any of the root causes of the unrest. Instead he pinned all blame for the violence on \"far right hatred\" and online \"misinformation.\"\n\nRotherham is infamous for its Muslim 'grooming gang', a group of predominantly British-Pakistani men who sexually abused around 1,400 young girls between the late 1980s and 2013. Three separate reports published in 2013, 2014, and 2015 found that local politicians and police covered up the gang's crimes, partly out of fear that identifying and punishing the perpetrators would be seen as \"racist.\"", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Authorities confirm the suspect is British-born.Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to subscribe!\n\nFootage verified by CNN shows protesters attacking two Holiday Inns: one in Tamworth, previously criticized by a local politician for housing asylum seekers, and another in Rotherham. In Tamworth, rioters threw projectiles, smashed windows, and started fires, injuring one police officer. In Rotherham, protesters used fire extinguishers against officers, set fires near the hotel, and smashed windows to enter the building, which was occupied by terrified residents and staff.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the violence, calling it \"far-right thuggery\" and emphasizing that those involved will face legal consequences. At least 147 people have been arrested since Saturday night.\n\nUK Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson announced a \"nick them quick\" approach for handling rioters but stated there is currently no need for military intervention. She emphasized that the police have sufficient resources and support.\n\nThe unrest, the worst since the 2011 riots, presents a significant challenge to the Labour government of Keir Starmer. The Home Office has introduced new emergency security measures for mosques to protect communities and allow them to return to worship safely.\n\nJoe Mulhall, Director of Research at Hope Not Hate, highlighted the role of social media platform X (formerly Twitter) in spreading disinformation and exacerbating tensions.

Several pieces of slate were also thrown, along with vapes and full plastic bottles.\n\nSome people kicked bollards into the road so that police vehicles driving ahead of the group could not get through, and one man sat on the bonnet of a police car to stop it moving.\n\nIn Bolton, Greater Manchester, violent clashes between protesters and police broke out, with footage showing the activists pushing against officers who had formed a human barricade.\n\nThere was also an counter protest in Bolton, where it was reported that large groups of Asian men could be heard shouting 'Allahu Akbar' as they clashed with the far-right.\n\nLast night experts condemned the 'dangerous' behaviour and also called for stricter action against those spreading misinformation.\n\nFestus Akinbusoye, a former police and crime commissioner, said: 'Of course there are discussions to be had about the level of immigration, the type of immigration and issues like integration.\n\n'But misinformation and xenophobic narratives are wrong, irresponsible and dangerous. These actions are having real world consequences and the people spreading dangerous lies need to be brought to book.'\n\nMIDDLESBROUGH: A car burns on Parliament Road after it was set alight by far-right thugs\n\nMIDDLESBROUGH: Police raced off with far-right agitators on Parliament Road yesterday\n\nA man is detained as Far-right activists hold a demonstration in Middlesbrough\n\nAn anti-immigration protester wearing a Union Jack mask outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nAn aerial view of the anti-migration protesters stand outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nCounter-protesters shout at police officers as they push against a cordon in Bolton\n\nObjects thrown at the hotel as trouble flares during an anti-immigration protest outside the Holiday Inn Express\n\nLIVERPOOL: Police officers attend to a shell-shocked colleague after a face-off with protesters on Saturday\n\nMr Akinbusoye, who was Britain's first black PCC, added: 'Our entire criminal justice system is going to have to be revisited in terms of how the authorities are going to be able to legitimately counter and pre-empt these narratives.\n\n'I understand that police forces need to be careful about what they put into the public domain but they need to... publish safe information whenever possible.'\n\nTory leadership hopeful Mel Stride said the scrapping of pilots of rapid-response police units, introduced by the Tories last March, may make it harder to tackle the current disorder.\n\nIt comes after an angry far-right mob stormed into a hotel in Rotherham yesterday, hurling chairs and spraying fire extinguishers at riot police, while setting bins, a generator and furniture alight.\n\nAround 700 violent anti-immigration protesters clad in balaclavas and draped in St George's flags clashed with officers trying to protect the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire since around 2pm this afternoon.\n\nAt least 10 officers have been injured in the chaos outside the hotel on the northern outskirts of the post-industrial town. One was left unconscious following a head injury, another suffered a suspected fractured elbow and other suspected broken bones.\n\nIt marks yet another day of violent riots of Britain's streets, with crowds in Middlesbrough setting fire to a car and pushing burning wheelie bins at police, while thugs in Rotherham smash windows and doors as riot police use shields to push them back.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police said one person has been arrested on suspicion of public order offences.\n\nSimilar scenes could be seen in Weymouth, as around 400 protesters from opposing sides gathered on the seafront to chant at each other. One side could be heard chanting 'Nazis go home', while the other shouted 'Tommy Robinson'.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

And all right-minded people should be condemning this assault of violence,\" he said.\n\n\"People in this country have a right to be safe. And yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques.\n\n\"Other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery.\"\n\nMerseyside Police released a statement on behalf of religious communities, including Catholic, Muslim and Jewish leaders.\n\n\"Too many people have sought to use the tragedy to create division and hate.\n\n\"Division can destroy the very relationships and environment that we depend upon every day of our lives and there is no place for hate in our communities.\n\n\"It can - and has - left communities in fear and has put people in danger.\"\n\nMassive brawls have broken out in more than 20 cities across the

Misinformation about a stabbing fuels unrest\n\nAn emergency response meeting will be held at 10 Downing Street on Monday following a weekend of violent unrest across the UK, which has resulted in over 150 arrests.\n\nThe violence, which has been described as \"far-right thuggery,\" erupted in various towns, including Rotherham, Middlesbrough, and Bolton, amid rising anti-immigrant sentiment following the tragic stabbing of three young girls in Southport last week.\n\nThe meeting, known as a Cobra meeting, will involve ministers, police, and intelligence officers to assess the situation and coordinate responses. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has called the scenes \"utterly appalling\" and assured that police are backed to take strong action against the perpetrators. Enhanced protections for mosques will also be implemented, allowing for rapid security deployments to ensure safe worship.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the violence, particularly an attack on a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham, where demonstrators clashed with police, injuring at least ten officers. He said that those involved in the unrest would face \"the full force of the law\" and warned that they would \"regret\" their actions. He emphasized the need for safety, noting that Muslim communities and other minorities have been targeted during these protests.\n\nREAD MORE: Britain's Starmer Warns Far-Right 'Thugs' Will Regret Participating In Worst Riots In A Decade | WATCH\n\nIn the wake of the violence, police in Bolton enforced a Section 60AA order to manage the situation, requiring individuals to remove face coverings. The unrest has sparked discussions about potentially fast-tracking prosecutions, reminiscent of the government's response to the 2011 riots, with courts possibly operating around the clock to expedite legal proceedings.\n\nRiots first flared in Southport late Tuesday following Monday's frenzied knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in the northwest coastal city, before spreading up and down England. They were fuelled by false rumours on social media about the background of British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana, who is accused of killing a six, seven, and nine-year-old, and injuring another 10 people.\n\nAgitators have targeted at least two mosques, and the UK interior ministry announced Sunday it was offering new emergency security to Islamic places of worship. The rallies have been advertised on far-right social media channels under the banner \"Enough is enough\". Participants have waved English and British flags while chanting slogans like \"Stop the boats\" -- a reference to irregular migrants crossing the Channel to Britain from France.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Downing_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "10 Downing Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bolton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bolton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesbrough", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middlesbrough"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Middlesbrough"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/08/untitled-design-2024-08-85620ffa29a71295bf8435f7de0e19b3-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789876", "eventUri": "eng-9789876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Videos posted on social media show the police retreating under a hail of objects thrown by anti-immigration protesters outside the Holiday Inn Express in Manvers, Rotherham.\n\nThe scenes are some of the worst so far as unrest across Britain enters its fifth day, after three young girls were stabbed to death in Southport on Monday. The Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, in responding to the events in Rotherham, vowed 'to bring these thugs to justice as quickly as possible'.\n\nThere are pictures of protestors hurling pieces of wood and chairs at riot police, while setting bins and furniture alight. The rioters are seen trying to smash the windows of the hotel before attempting to storm the building. The group, some clad in balaclavas, and others wearing Union Jack masks and draped in the St George flag, launch themselves at police officers lined up to protect the hotel and the people inside. Glass bottles were thrown at officers, according to a BBC reporter at the scene. A bin was set on fire, and others overturned. One image shows officers tending to an injured colleague inside the hotel: the officer was later carried away from the scene. The crowd could be heard cheering and chanting: 'Get them out' and 'Yorkshire'.\n\nA group of young men held a banner that read 'We're not far right, we're just right'. Another placard being waved around said: 'Stopping the boats means stopping the stabbings.' One report spoke of terrified people inside the hotel watching on from their rooms. Hundreds of onlookers, some accompanied by children, witnessed the shocking scenes unfold. The job of the police was made even more difficult by the presence of a small group of about 100 people who turned up to for a 'Stand Up to Racism' counter protest. They held banners reading: 'Refugees welcome: Stop the far right.' Officers had to be deployed to keep the two groups apart, with tensions running high throughout.\n\nThere is no disguising the chaos on Britain's streets, with vehicles set alight, shops destroyed, and innocent bystanders targeted. Arrests have been made, with warnings of more to come once CCTV and other evidence has been assessed. Extra prosecutors have been called in to work and the courts are sitting this weekend. These are welcome and significant moves but the crisis shows no signs of abating. If anything, the violence associated with the protests is becoming more serious by the day. The latest mayhem in Rotherham is proof of that.\n\nThe former Home Secretary James Cleverly said rioters should be hit with 'the full weight of the law', pointing out that there could never be any excuse or justification or rationale for behaviour like this. Keir Starmer was due to go on holiday with his family at the start of this week but Downing Street insists that the Prime Minister is working this weekend and next week. In his address to the country in the wake of the Rotherham riot, Starmer said time has been spent over recent days working with the police and justice system to 'make sure that the necessary arrangements for law enforcement are in place'. He explained that this means the system can get 'arrests, charge, remand and custody and conviction done very quickly'.\n\nThis sounds sensible enough but the words don't match reality. This is the nub of the government's problem: unrest on the ground in numerous towns and cities is developing at pace and it tells a somewhat different story of increasing violence and mayhem. The Prime Minister must get a grip of this situation.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jawad_iqbal@spectator.us", "name": "Jawad Iqbal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Jack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Jack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaclava_(clothing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balaclava (clothing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Inn", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holiday Inn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yorkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Yorkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Yorkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_Against_Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unite Against Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cleverly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Cleverly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2161618285_d88c4c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789876", "eventUri": "eng-9789876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

'I utterly condemn the far-right thuggery we have seen this weekend,' Keir Starmer says. 'Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law.' The Labour leader goes on to say that 'the police will be making arrests' and he can 'guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder'.\n\nIt comes as the Home Office announces that emergency security will be provided to mosques immediately - which have already become a target for the mob violence. While there have been a spate of demonstrations since the Southport stabbings, Starmer mentions specifically what is happening in Rotherham this afternoon. There, protesters have targeted a hotel thought to be used to house refugees - a fire has been started and windows have been smashed. Referring to the events, Starmer said: 'The police will be making arrests. Individuals will be held on remand. Charges will follow. And convictions will follow.'\n\nAs for who is behind the violence, Starmer made clear he views it as a form of extremism that ought to be called out - referring it to as 'far-right thuggery':\n\nPeople in this country have a right to be safe. And yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted. Attacks on Mosques. Other minority communities singled out. Nazi salutes in the street. Attacks on the police. So, no, I won't shy away from calling this what it is: Far-right thuggery.\n\nTo those who feel targeted because of the colour of your skin... Or your faith... I know how frightening this must be. I want you to know this violent mob do not represent our country. And we will bring them to justice.\n\nThe comments come after Starmer has faced criticism for being more willing to call out certain forms of extremism than others.\n\nSo, will the statement succeed in calming the situation? It's clear that Starmer plans to respond to the events so far with a law and order crackdown - perhaps drawing lessons from his time as Director of Public Prosecutions during the London riots. Back then, around 3,000 people were arrested with more than 2,000 going on to face criminal charges and prison sentences. However, these riots offer fresh challenges - in terms of who is participating and the underlying currents behind the disruption. It means Starmer will need a longer term strategy for addressing the root causes regarding concern over integration.\n\nLast week Starmer used his press conference to address riots planned for the weekend: the Prime Minister said he would 'not permit, under any circumstances, a breakdown in law and order on our streets'. While Starmer had promised the full weight of the law in response, if the disruption continues at the current pace, the new prime minister will face questions as to whether he really has a grip on the situation.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katy_balls@spectator.us", "name": "Katy Balls", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_salute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi salute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_Public_Prosecutions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Director of Public Prosecutions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2164158354.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789876", "eventUri": "eng-9789876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

And all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe.\"\n\nOn 4th August (local time) Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Keir Starmer, issued a statement condemning the violence that happened across the country creating chaos. He said, \"I utterly condemn the far-right thuggery we have seen this weekend,\" blaming the protesting groups and individuals against immigrants for the violence. He made it clear that those involved in the violence would face the full force of the law. However, there have been reports that the government's action is going to be selective.\n\nKeir Starmer added that those who participated in the violence would face severe consequences. He said, \"Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law. The police will be making arrests. Individuals will be held on remand. Charges will follow. And convictions will follow. I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder.\"\n\nAdding that those fanning protester sentiments online would also face the law. Keir Starmer said, \"Whether directly or those whipping up this action online, and then running away themselves. This is not a protest. It is organized, violent thuggery. And it has no place on our street or online.\" Detailing the current situation of the attacks on a hotel in Rotherham where immigrants were housed, he said, \"Right now, attacks are happening on a hotel in Rotherham. Marauding gangs are intent on law breaking. Or worse. Windows smashed. Fires set ablaze. Residents and staff in absolute fear.\"\n\nHe added, \"There is no justification - none - for taking this action. And all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe.\" Keir Starmer further highlighted that Muslims were being targeted along with other minority communities and said, \"We've seen Muslim communities targeted. Attacks on Mosques. Other minority communities were singled out. Nazi salutes in the street. Attacks on the police. Wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric.\" He added, \"So, no, I won't shy away from calling this what it is: Far-right thuggery. To those who feel targeted because of the colour of your skin or your faith, I know how frightening this must be. I want you to know this violent mob does not represent our country. And we will bring them to justice.\"\n\nSeveral videos of Islamist mobs shouting Allah-hu-Akbar went viral om social media. X user \"Concerned Citizen\" wrote, \"Huge mob descend on Bolton City Centre - looks like they are baying for blood. If you're in & around a city centre right now it's advisable not to be. Seriously.\"\n\nAmy Mek wrote, \"Jihadi Gangs Rampage Through UK Towns, Attacking Citizens!\"\n\nX user J Stewart wrote, \"A mob of young Muslim men attack a lone protester in Middlesbrough, kicking and punching him repeatedly. Someone is going to get killed if this carries on. Keir Starmer has put a target on every protesters back by labelling them \"far right\".\"\n\nNotably, Visegrad 24 reported that the UK Government has confirmed that Jewish synagogues and Christian churches would not receive any emergency security support during the riots. On the other hand, the Home Secretary of Britain announced emergency security for all the mosques in the UK.\n\nOn 29th July, three young girls ages 6, 7 and 9 were killed in a stabbing incident at a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga class in northwestern England. Two of the girls lost their lives on the day of the incident while the third girl died the next day. Eight children and two adults were hospitalised after the attack. A 17-year-old suspect was arrested by the police for murder and attempted murder. Witnesses described the scene as \"from a horror movie\" as blood-soacked children ran from the attack to save themselves.\n\nOn 3rd August, anti-immigrant protests erupted across the United Kingdom after the stabbing incident at a dance class where three little girls were killed and several others were injured. Dozens of protests have been taking place across the country and law enforcement agencies are facing difficulties in controlling the protesters. Initially, far-right groups protested against the immigrants which led to protests by left-leaning groups to take on the roads.\n\nThe protests erupted following misleading information about the identity of the under 18 suspect of stabbing incident. It was said that he was Muslim immigrant but it was later revealed on a judge's order that the suspect was 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, a resident of Wales to Rwandan parents to stop the spread of misinformation.\n\nNotably, online campaigns to gather support for the anti-immigrants protests have also raised alarms among law enforcement agencies. Phrases including \"Enough are enough\", \"save our kids\" and \"Stop the boats\" have been identified by police officials as part of the campaigns.\n\nEven though violence happened from both sides of the protesters, the UK government has decided to provide protection only to Muslims and establishments like Mosques that are directly linked to the Muslims living in the UK. The rhetoric being set by the UK government is that if someone is against immigrants, he or she will be labelled far-right immediately. Police action and the wrath of the law will follow. On the other hand, if someone is anti-Israel or pro-Shariat, no one is going to label him or her far-left. The rhetoric is no different from what we see in general India. Anyone supporting the idea of Hindu Rashtra gets labelled as a \"Hindu extremist\" immediately but the media, left-liberals and their ilks find ways to \"humanise\" even the most dangerous terrorists.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 5,

A large group of individuals is in the area with people throwing projectiles, smashing windows, starting fires and targeting police.\n\n\"We're urging members of the public to avoid the area around the Holiday Inn, Tamworth, as specialist officers continue to deal with violent acts of thuggery,\" the force said. \"Officers are working valiantly to keep the public safe. Specialist drone surveillance and the national police air service have been sweeping the area as our efforts to identify those involved continue.\"\n\nVideos shot by the rioters themselves showed projectiles such as bottles and bricks being thrown towards police lines. Despite the use of riot shields, windows were shattered.\n\nRead more: Ten people arrested amid protest disorder after clashes in Midlands town\n\nOther footage revealed flares being launched and crowd members confronting police. Officers were also heard repeatedly shouting \"get back\" during the face-off. Another video provided a clearer view of windows that had been shattered at the hotel. The mob did nothing to intervene or confront those who were hurling projectiles.\n\nPolice had put out the fire, it has been confirmed. Graffiti was spotted sprayed on the side reading: \"Get out England (sic).\" Alarms were also heard ringing either inside or near the Holiday Inn as people yelled nearby.\n\nThe Holiday Inn is the second in the hotel chain to be targeted by far-right mobs today. Earlier today, hooligans targeted a Holiday Inn in Rotherham that also housed asylum seekers. Far-right rioters clashed with police outside the building and were seen throwing projectiles at officers.\n\nA fire was ignited outside a ground-floor window and later, protesters managed to break into the building. South Yorkshire Police reported one arrest on suspicion of public order offences in Rotherham.\n\nA group of men inside the hotel expressed their fear for their lives as the mob attempted to break into the building.

I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder,\" he said. \"All right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence.\"\n\nRiots have taken place in towns and cities throughout the United Kingdom following false information spread online that the suspect in a knife attack on a children's dance class in Southport on Monday, in which three young girls were killed, was a Muslim migrant.\n\nOn Tuesday, rioters descended on Southport and attacked a mosque, clashing with and injuring police officers. Authorities have since said the suspect in the Southport stabbing case, 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, was born in Britain. But rioting and attacks on mosques and other buildings have continued.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, alongside the support from local police forces.\"\n\nThere have been riots in Belfast in Northern Ireland, Bristol in south-west England, London in the south east, and numerous towns and cities throughout the midlands and north of England such as Blackpool, Hull, Leeds, Manchester, Middlesbrough, Stoke-on-Trent and Sunderland.\n\nAnti-racist groups have also mobilized, organizing counter demonstrations in several towns. In Liverpool, police intervened to prevent clashes between far right rioters and antifascists on Saturday.\n\nLater that day, rioters set a library on fire and attempted to prevent firefighters from reaching the blaze, Merseyside Police said. They made 23 arrests.\n\nRioting took an even more sinister turn on Sunday in Rotherham, a town beset with racial tensions following a child sexual exploitation scandal and cover-up involving a gang of mostly British-Pakistani men in the 2000s.\n\nAnti-immigration rioters broke into a hotel housing asylum seekers, attempted to set the building on fire and blocked the exits. Police forced the rioters back, arresting one. Staff and residents were \"terrified\" but not injured, reported Sky News.\n\nRioters, including children, attacked police, causing at least 10 injuries. Some wore face coverings, others wore England football shirts and carried British or English flags.

Trouble broke out from Aldershot in the south to Sunderland in the north and Liverpool in the west. Belfast, in Northern Ireland, was also drawn into the fray.\n\nIn some cases, the protesters were merely unruly, but in others the violence was far more pronounced.\n\nOn Sunday, rioters set upon a hotel that has housed asylum seekers in the town of Rotherham, in northern England, breaking windows before surging inside as the police struggled to control them. It remained unclear whether asylum seekers were still staying at the hotel and no guests were injured in the melee, police said.\n\nIn Middlesbrough, a group of rioters, some masked, hurled bottles and rocks at officers. Cars were set on fire, and at least nine people were arrested. On Saturday, a library and a food bank were set alight in Liverpool as groups damaged and looted businesses, and in Hull, fires were set and storefronts smashed in the city center.\n\nNearly 150 people were arrested over the weekend, national police representatives said, and dozens of police suffered injuries, including some that required trips to the hospital.\n\nThe unrest began after a 17-year-old wielding a knife attacked a children's dance class on Monday in the seaside town of Southport, which is near Liverpool. Three children were killed, and eight were wounded.\n\nThe suspect was born and raised in Britain, but online rumors soon circulated that he was an undocumented immigrant. To counter those false claims, the authorities took the unusual step of publicly identifying him. But with migration a flashpoint issue in Britain, especially on the far right, the rumors were all it took.\n\nExtremist groups urged their followers to take to the streets, and the day after the stabbings, they began to do so, starting in Southport.\n\nThe riots prompted a heavy police response. Nearly 4,000 additional officers were deployed, a law enforcement association said.\n\n\"Be in no doubt: Those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law,\" Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement on Sunday.\n\n\"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, \" Mr. Starmer said, \"whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves. This is not protest. It is organized, violent thuggery.\"\n\nBJ Harrington, the head of public order for Britain's National Police Chiefs' Council, said online disinformation had been \"a huge driver of this appalling violence.\"\n\nIntelligence teams, detectives and neighborhood officers, Mr. Harrington said, are working to identify the people fomenting the violence.\n\n\"They won't win,\" he said.\n\nEven as the authorities vow to crack down on the violence, they have long struggled to tamp down disinformation on social media, one of the accelerants behind the riots. Britain and other democracies have found that policing the internet is legally murky terrain, where individual rights and free speech protections are balanced against a desire to block harmful material.\n\nThe riots are the first political crisis for Mr. Starmer, who took office only a month ago after his Labour Party defeated the Conservatives, who had been in power in Britain for 14 years.\n\nWhile in power, the Conservatives tried to capitalize on public unhappiness over immigration, vowing to reduce it (though they failed to do so). But in recent days, they joined Labour in condemning the violent protests.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is now the opposition leader, said the unrest had \"nothing to do with the tragedy in Southport.\" The police, he said, have \"our full support to deal with these criminals swiftly.\"\n\nMr. Starmer will hold an emergency meeting on Monday, Downing Street confirmed, part of an established protocol that brings together relevant government ministers, civil servants, and representatives from the police and intelligence services.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType":

Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law,\" said Starmer in a statement on Sunday.\n\n\"There is no justification - none - for taking this action, and all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe and yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, (and) wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric. So, no, I won't shy away from calling this what it is: far-right thuggery,\" he said.\n\nHe will chair the emergency Cabinet Office Briefing Room A (COBRA) meeting with UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss the future course of action to curb the violence. The Home Office has also announced that mosques will be offered greater protection with new \"emergency security\" that can be rapidly deployed to respond to violent disorder targeting places of worship.\n\n\"They do not speak for our communities. It's a total disgrace, and there has to be a reckoning. Those individuals who are involved in the disorder need to know that they will pay a price,\" said Cooper, as she indicated that additional prosecutors and courts are on standby to charge those being arrested for a series of offences.\n\n\"We have made very clear to the police that they have our full support in pursuing the full range of prosecutions and penalties, including the serious prison sentences, long-term tagging, travel bans and more,\" she said.\n\nDuring clashes over the weekend, cars were set alight, windows smashed, large bins burnt and hurled at officers and stores looted. Masked anti-immigration mobs broke into a hotel housing asylum-seekers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and rocks and long pieces of wood were thrown at police officers who lined up in front of the building as they tried to protect it.\n\n\"The mindless actions of those today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield of South Yorkshire Police.\n\nSeveral police officers have suffered injuries as they faced off with the mobs, who are being fuelled by misinformation being spread online. The riots started in Southport, near Liverpool, last week following the stabbing of a group of young children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on July 29.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, who has been charged with three murders and other attempted murders, was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents. However, initial misinformed social media posts claimed he was a refugee who arrived last year on a small boat. Southport residents, including the mother of one of the girls who died, have called for the protesters to stop and that they do not speak for them.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nIt has been a weekend of horrendous violence across many towns and cities in the UK.\n\nIt was confirmed in the early hours of this morning (Monday) that 43 people were arrested in Middlesbrough after shocking scenes of violence on Sunday. There were also violent scenes in Sunderland on Friday night and in Hartlepool on Wednesday.\n\nOutside of the region protests and counter-protests took place in Liverpool, Manchester, and Nottingham; while thugs attempted to storm hotels housing asylum seekers in Rotherham and Tamworth. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned rioters engaging in \"far-right thuggery\" and promised those involved would \"face the full force of the law\" as he addressed the nation on Sunday.\n\nRead more: 43 arrested as Middlesbrough hit by 'staggering' violence on Sunday\n\nKeep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter\n\nOn Monday, Downing Street is holding Cobra emergency response meeting to discuss how to tackle the outbreak of disorder. Today's meeting is due to involve relevant ministers and police representatives who will discuss the response in the coming days with the aim of preventing any further violent scenes.\n\nMr Starmer already announced last week that a dedicated unit would be set up to tackle violent disorder by far-right groups who are rioting around the country. Here are some more of the options which could, and currently are, being used to tackle the riots.\n\nDispersal orders\n\nSection 34 Dispersal Orders give police officers and police community support traffic officers powers to direct people who are engaging in antisocial behaviour or are likely to become involved in such incidents. Under the legislation, officers have the power to seize any items used in the commission of anti-social behaviour.\n\nA person returning to the area after previously being directed to leave is committing an offence, and they may ultimately be arrested. These powers do not apply to people who are going about their regular daily business.\n\nSection 34 Orders have been put in place in Southport and Liverpool in the last week by Merseyside Police, and in Bolton by Greater Manchester Police.\n\nEnhanced Stop and Search powers\n\nA section 60 order gives officers extra powers to stop and search people in define areas within a specific timeframe, while a Section 60AA allows police to require people to remove their face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance. Both orders have been authorised across the weekend in Bolton by Greater Manchester Police, with the aim of preventing harm and disorder where there is increased 'protest' activity.\n\nKeep courts open 24/7\n\nSir Keir Starmer served as the director of public prosecutions during the 2011 London riots, which spread to other cities across the UK. Government officials have hinted at the possibility of courts operating round-the-clock to expedite prosecutions, a measure which was previously implemented back in 2011 when police forces are prepared to call in additional officers to manage potential disturbances.\n\nHowever, courts and prisons are considerably more overcrowded than when this was previously implemented.\n\nSir Keir said: \"We do have standing arrangements for law enforcement which means that we can get arrests, charge remanded in custody and convictions done very quickly. I myself was part of that in 2011 when I was director of public prosecutions, and I'm determined we will do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice as quickly as possible.\"\n\nPublic Order-trained Police\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said that Public Order-trained police were not deployed this weekend, but could be if necessary. She said that there are \"considerable additional policing resources\" that forces can call upon.\n\nBring the army in\n\nScotland's former first minister, Humza Yousaf, said that the army should be called in to stop \"thugs\" causing disorder on the streets. However, ministers have so far police have the resources required to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army.\n\nJohn Healey MP, Defence Secretary, said that the established system of mutual aid between police forces had worked so far and that it is the police's responsibility to respond first.", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle

The demonstration quickly escalated, with protestors hurling objects at police officers, forcing them to retreat.\n\nFootage posted on social media captured the chaotic scene as protesters broke into the hotel's ground floor through shattered windows and set it on fire.\n\nA counter rally in support of migrant rights was also held, with participants chanting pro-migrant slogans in response to the anti-immigrant sentiment.

far-right thugs involved have been heard chanting \"Tommy Robinson\" at many of the riots across England.\n\n(Image: Danny Lawson/PA Wire.)\n\nBefore fleeing the country, Robinson was arrested under anti-terror laws, but was then released on unconditional bail.\n\nA High Court judge has subsequently issued a warrant for his arrest after he failed to appear at a hearing last week in his latest alleged contempt of court case.\n\nJustice Johnson said that he would issue the warrant but ordered that it not be carried out \"until early October\" to allow Robinson time to indicate that he would attend the next hearing voluntarily, or to apply to \"set aside\" the warrant.\n\nIn an address to the country on Sunday afternoon, Keir Starmer also vowed rioters would \"regret\" taking part in \"far-right thuggery\" as the Government announced emergency security for mosques amid the threat of further disorder.\n\nThe Prime Minister condemned the attack on the hotel in Rotherham and promised those involved in unrest would \"face the full force of the law\".\n\nSpeaking from Downing Street, he also suggested that rioters taking to the streets, and those \"whipping up this action online and then running away themselves,\" would face consequences.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Reasons for violent disorder explained", "body": "A number of riots have taken place across the UK in the past week, fueled by anti-immigration sentiment from the far-right.\n\nPlenty of vandalism and violence has occurred, with cars and buildings burnt, projectiles thrown at mosques, police attacked and hotels believed to be housing asylum seekers broken into.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer gave a televised address on Sunday (August 4) and warned those involved that they would \"regret\" taking part.\n\nHe said: \"People in this country have a right to be safe, and yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques.\n\n\"Other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery.\"\n\nBut why have the riots taken place and why has it escalated as the week has gone on?\n\nThe riots happened in the wake of the killing of three young girls at a dance studio in Southport on Monday (July 29).\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were killed and eight others were injured, some severely.\n\nRumours emerged on social media claiming that the attacker was a man called Ali Al-Shakati who was a Muslim asylum seeker.\n\nHowever, this wasn't true, with the individual being identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana in court.\n\nJudge Andrew Menary made the exceptional decision to lift reporting restrictions despite his age in an attempt to stop misinformation.\n\nRudakubana was born in Cardiff to parents of Rwanda heritage, before moving to the village of Banks just outside of Southport.\n\nA vigil in Southport was held on Tuesday (July 30) but on the same evening, hundreds of protestors gathered outside a mosque in the town.\n\nThere were chants expressing Islamophobic and anti-immigration sentiment alongside support for Tommy Robinson, the founder of the EDL (English Defence League).\n\nObjects were also thrown at the mosque and at riot police who came in to deal with the disorder, with a police van being set alight.\n\nAfter that, similar riots followed across the UK for the rest of the week in places such as Rotherham, Hull, Middlesbrough, Bristol, Tamworth and Liverpool.\n\nMuch of the reasoning behind the riots has been Islamophobia and anger towards immigration, both legal and illegal.\n\nThe Financial Times writes: \"The killings in Southport -- although by a UK-born resident -- prompted a torrent of disinformation blaming both immigrants in general, and Muslims in particular, for crime.\n\n\"Far-right sympathisers also accuse the police of treating nationalist and white protesters more harshly on the streets than they do, for example, pro-Palestine demonstrators.\"\n\nStarmer has indicated that the response to the violence could mirror elements of how the 2011 riots were handled, at which time he was the director of public prosecutions.\n\nRecommended reading:\n\n\"We do have standing arrangements for law enforcement which means that we can get arrests... and convictions done very quickly,\" he said.\n\n\"I myself was part of that in 2011 when I was director of public prosecutions, and I'm determined we will do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe Home Office also announced that mosques would be offered greater protection under a new \"rapid response process\" designed to quickly tackle the threat of further attacks on places of worship.", "source": {"uri": "wandsworthguardian.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wandsworth Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki",

It does not augur well for Britain nor for urban tension in multiple European countries where illegal immigrants and asylum seekers are testing the patience of a weary public.\n\nThe suspect in the July 29 attacks at Southport has been named as a Welsh-born 17-year-old, Axel Muganwa Rudakubana. His parents migrated to Britain from Rwanda. Mr. Rudakubana has been charged with three counts of murder and ten counts of attempted murder.\n\nThe misperception that the teenager was seeking asylum, coupled with the heinous nature of the knife attacks, triggered riots in a number of British towns in recent days. It underscores tensions in British society that are impossible to paper over. Yet Mr. Starmer is apparently seeking to do just that.\n\nOn Sunday he said that \"People in this country have a right to be safe, and yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out...attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery.\"\n\nHe added that \"To those who feel targeted because of the color of your skin or your faith: I know how frightening this must be\" and \"this violent mob does not represent this country.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Britain's Sky News reported that \"mosques at risk of violent targeting\" can now \"be provided with additional security personnel as part of a rapid security response to boost the work being done by local police.\"\n\nThere were reports of an attempted attack at a mosque at Southport, but no others. Scenes of police fending off rioters hurling stones and chairs at them at various parks and other locations around the country dominated British television news over the weekend. As of Monday police had made more than 420 arrests.\n\nOn Sunday a Holiday Inn Express at Rotherham was the scene of a sometimes violent standoff between police in riot gear and hundreds of protestors -- who have now all seemingly been lumped into the category of \"far right thugs.\" Sky News described the Holiday Inn as an \"asylum hotel.\"\n\nWhat exactly are asylum seekers doing at a Holiday Inn in South Yorkshire? Visitors to the hotel's website will find the message that \"the hotel remains closed for guest stays.\" The same message appears on the website for another Holiday Inn Express, at Tamworth, which the Daily Mail reported \"is believed to be housing migrants and asylum seekers\" and where rioters were reported to have smashed windows.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the messages were posted on account of the violence or if it is because Holiday Inn has a government concession to temporarily house asylum-seekers, which would then limit available inventory at the relevant properties. A call on Monday morning to one of the Holiday Inn properties affected by the recent events was not immediately returned.\n\nIf Mr. Starmer thought he could sweep the issue of immigration under the carpet, a growing number of politicians are reminding him of his miscalculation. The Reform lawmaker and former Tory deputy chair, Lee Anderson, wrote on X that \"This problem has been caused by smug politicians who have refused to listen to the concerns of British people. It has festered and now it has boiled over. Parliament must listen, parliament must act but it must not blame the British people.\"\n\nIn a video message, the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, said that the riots were \"a reaction to fear, to discomfort, to unease that is out there shared by tens of millions of people.\"\n\nEven after the dust of the riots settles, Britain will likely wrestle with the immigration question for a long time because there is no easy answer. Last year nearly 30,000 undocumented migrants crossed the English Channel in small boats -- and now the number is likely higher. The total of illegal arrivals in 2024 is already nearly 20 percent higher than the number of arrivals recorded around this time last year.\n\nThe crisis is compounded by the fact that social services meant to process asylum claims are close to overwhelmed. There is nowhere to house the migrants except, apparently, hotels where there is literally no longer room at the inn for British citizens or tourists.\n\nThis is happening while the national health service, the NHS, is broken.\n\nBritons are now demonstrably fed up. While there can be little doubt that the people hurling rocks and furniture at police can be called thugs, this is just the most visible sign of a general, nationwide discontent long in the making.\n\nThe cover of this week's Private Eye, a satirical magazine, features Mr. Starmer asking, \"So we blame the Tories and then what?\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news",

leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear.\"\n\nAnother Holiday Inn Express accused of housing migrants was attacked by a mob in Tamworth, Staffordshire, last night.\n\nThe crowd chanted \"our streets\" before smashing windows on the hotel's bottom floor.\n\nViolence also engulfed Middlesbrough where yobs hijacked a \"peaceful\" \"pro-British\" march and attacked cars and houses before turning on TV crews.\n\nIn Bolton, around 300 masked Muslims shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" - or \"God is greatest\" - charged towards anti-immigration marchers, with rival groups throwing missiles at each another.\n\nThis came as clean-up efforts began in cities blighted by violence on Saturday, including in Liverpool where demonstrators targeting a mosque set fire to a community library, which also hosts a foodbank.\n\nOne distraught resident said: \"Nazis burned books - these have gone one step further and burned a library.\"\n\nAmong other victims of the anarchy were Filipino nurses who had rocks thrown at them on their way to provide \"emergency cover\" at a hospital in Sunderland on Friday.\n\nAs footage of the violence spread globally, Malaysia - where almost two-thirds of the population are Muslims - became the first country to update its travel advice in Britain, telling its citizens to \"stay away from protest areas\" and \"remain vigilant\".\n\nFormer Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf labelled the Rotherham anarchy a \"pogrom against Muslims and people of colour\" and called for the Army to be sent in to protect them.\n\nIn chilling scenes in South Yorkshire - where tensions have festered over a long-running child sex grooming scandal involving men of mainly Pakistani origin - heavily outnumbered police had to retreat from masked gangs.\n\nAfter initially being forced to pull back, officers brought in reinforcements and pushed yobs away, leaving a tense stand-off.\n\nIn Middlesbrough, demonstrators went on the rampage, smashing cars and windows, telling terrified residents that the violence was \"because we're English\".\n\nIn a reference to the Cardiff-born teenage suspect in the Southport killings, they carried a banner saying \"Tom Jones is Welsh, Axel Rudakubana isn't\".\n\nCrowds chanted \"We want our country back!\" before some pelted police with bottles and pieces of slate or set wheelie bins alight.\n\nIn Dorset, police moved people off Weymouth beach as evening fell and rival marches faced off, one side shouting in support of English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson, while the other side bellowed \"Nazis go home\".\n\nThe latest scenes came after a mob who had attempted to target a mosque in the Walton area of Liverpool on Saturday evening torched a community library that only opened last year after locals helped raise \u00a3900,000.\n\nAs firefighters tried to put out the flames that engulfed Spellow Lane library hub - which also functions as a food bank - rioters threw missiles, breaking the rear window of a fire appliance.\n\nFaith leaders across Merseyside yesterday called on communities to \"remain calm and peaceful\" and ignore those seeking to \"use the Southport tragedy to create division and hate\".\n\nElsewhere on Saturday, looters took advantage of the mayhem, stealing everything from phones, shoes and even gingerbread men and cookies from shops.\n\nIn parts of Belfast, stores and cafes were set on fire and destroyed by anti-Muslim mobs on Saturday, with shopkeepers claiming police \"did nothing\".\n\n\"What kind of police are letting the people burn everything down?\" one asked.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland said it was treating reports of criminal damage as hate crimes and had so far made four arrests.\n\nBy last night, police across the UK had made more than 150 arrests in connection with the trouble since Saturday.\n\nLast week a judge took the unusual step of allowing Axel Rudakubana, 17, to be identified as the suspect in the Southport knife attack.\n\nFalse claims that he was a Muslim illegal migrant prompted police to reveal he was born in Cardiff before moving to Merseyside with his Christian parents, who are originally from Rwanda.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Assistant Chief Constable Butterfield said: \"Those who choose to spread misinformation and hate online also need to take responsibility for the scenes today - this was not a protest, just angry people reacting to a false narrative who have their own motivations for doing so.\"\n\n\"Those who stood on and watched the violence and destruction remain absolutely complicit in this.\"\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news",

Those individuals who are involved in the disorder need to know that they will pay a price.'\n\n'I've made clear to the police they have my full support in going after the full range of offenders, from those who turned up at the last minute and joined in the looting, to some of the most serious offenders who were pursuing really dangerous arson, really dangerous damage and criminal violence, because we simply cannot stand for this.\n\n'So we should be clear, there will be people who were thinking they were going on their summer holidays this week, and instead they will face a knock on the door from the police.\n\n'They will face arrest and... a police cell, while they wait for trial in order to make sure that they do pay the price for what they have done,' she added.\n\nMs Cooper claimed that social media has put 'rocket boosters' under far-right organisations.\n\nBut she said the courts are on 'stand-by' to ensure 'swift justice': 'We have made sure that the courts are on stand-by. We've made sure that there are additional prosecutors in place this weekend, and hundreds of arrests have already taken place. So we do expect swift justice to take place.'\n\nScenes in Middlesbrough on Monday morning after residents wake up to the after-effects of rioting\n\nResidents saw their car windows smashed and businesses suffered attacks including arson\n\nAsked if the Army would be called upon, Ms Cooper said: 'So, the police have the expertise and also the powers in terms of dealing with public order and crime, because this is crime.\n\n'There are also significant additional numbers of public order-trained police, who were not deployed this weekend, so there are considerable additional policing resources that forces can call upon.'\n\nPressed on whether the Government will take action against Tommy Robinson, who has been accused of stoking tensions from afar, Ms Cooper said: 'If it's a crime offline, it's a crime online.'\n\n'You can't just have the the armchair thuggery or the people being able to incite and organise violence and also not face consequences for this,' she added.\n\nShadow Secretary James Cleverly said: 'The things that we have seen are completely unjustified. These are the actions of people who are clearly responding to disinformation online but are obviously motivated by racism.\n\n'We've seen people with Swastika tattoos and making the Nazi salute... attacking people who have no link at all to the terrible incidents that we saw in Southport last week and it is absolutely right that the government is taking firm action.\n\n'When you've people giving Nazi salutes with Swastika tattoos that is clearly far-right extremism.\n\n'It's clearly these attacks on mosques on hotels these are clearly driven by racism and should be unequivocally condemned.'\n\nBut he also criticised Starmer's new government for not reacting quickly enough: 'They could and should have been quicker, it's worrying that it's only today that cobra is meeting.\n\nA masked thug faces off with police officers at the Holiday Inn in Rotherham while fire rages in the background\n\nMembers of the public with bin bags, dustpans and brushes took to the streets today\n\nVolunteers pick up rubbish and debris from outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham\n\nRacist graffiti was daubed on the side of the hotel in Tamworth and windows and doors were smashed before thugs attempted to set the building on fire with people still inside\n\nOne man was filmed threatening to slit the throats of those inside the hotel\n\n'We want to support the government taking firm action against this violence but they have to move much more quickly and they have to be more agile, more decisive. Had I still be Home Secretary I would have called a Cobra much earlier than this.'\n\nHe continued: 'I'm really uncomfortable with the idea that somehow this violence reflects a wider national move. This is a group of extreme people.\n\n'People committing arson, attacking mosques, targeting asylum hotels, they are not reflective of the country. This is a generous and open hearted country. The people in this country are not represented by the thugs that are attacking people, committing arson and targeting places of worship.'\n\nThe former first minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf said the army should be called in to stop 'thugs' causing disorder on the streets.\n\nMinisters have so far insisted police have the resources required to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army.\n\nSir Keir said he wanted those who 'feel targeted because of the colour of their skin' to know 'this violent mob do not represent our country'.\n\nIn his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: 'I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.'\n\nDame Sara Khan, who was Rishi Sunak's independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience until May, blamed the Conservative government for leaving the country open to far-right violence.\n\n'The writing was clearly on the wall for some time,' she told the Guardian.\n\nWriting in The Times, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said 'there will be reckoning' for people who took part in the unrest and those who 'whipped them up on social media and in online chat forums'.\n\n'Whatever they and some of their political supporters may tell us, these are not patriots standing up for their communities,' she said.\n\n'They are thugs, criminals and extremists who betray the values our country is built on.'\n\nShe said those responsible would be 'paying the price for years to come'.\n\nMs Cooper slammed actions taken by rioters this week after more than 420 people were arrested, as she warned 'many more will follow' as authorities scour CCTV footage to identify all those involved.\n\nClashes, sparked by the murder of three little girls in Southport last Monday, deteriorated further yesterday when a second migrant hotel was set ablaze in Tamworth, while hundreds cheered and clinked beers outside.\n\nIn Middlesbrough far-right yobs were filmed stopping traffic to interrogate the passengers to check they were 'white and English'.\n\nKeir Starmer also waded in to warn far-Right rioters 'you'll regret taking part' as he tried to stamp his authority over the first major test of his Premiership.\n\nHe blasted 'far-Right thuggery', for which he promised swift justice as he is expected to call a COBRA meeting today.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tories were forced to reprimanded Shadow Wales Secretary Lord Davies of Gower after The Mail on Sunday columnist Dan Hodges said there was 'no political justification' for the riots and Lord Davies retorted: 'Labour blocked the Rwanda Bill 130+ times, of course it's politically justified!'\n\nThis comes as:\n\nRioters descend on second migrant hotel as far-right mob try to set fire to Holiday Inn housing asylum seekers in TamworthTommy Robinson suns himself at an all-inclusive five-star hotel in Cyprus while his foot soldiers run riot in violent protests The Tory Police and Crime Commissioner claimed far-right protesters are trying to 'protect Britain's sovereignty and identity' Malaysia becomes the first country issues warning over travelling to the UK amid the violent protests The Tories were forced to reprimanded Shadow Wales Secretary after he justified the rioting by saying: 'Labour blocked the Rwanda Bill 130+ times, of course it's politically justified!'\n\nROTHERHAM: Police defend themselves as far-right thugs launch planks of wood on Sunday\n\nROTHERHAM: Violent thugs yesterday attacked a hotel reported to be housing asylum seekers\n\nROTHERHAM: A rioter throws blocks of concrete towards a hotel on Sunday\n\nThis came after Tommy Robinson posted a video of a confrontation in Stoke and falsely claimed two 'protesters' had been stabbed 'by Muslims'.

On Friday night, he posted a list of dozens of acts of violence he alleged had been committed by immigrants under the caption: 'Anyone else had enough?'\n\nAmong them was the claim that a 'woman [was] beaten to death by two Somalis while walking her dog' - understood to have been a reference to last month's murder of Anita Rose, 57, in Brantham, Suffolk.\n\nThree people have been arrested in connection with the murder, but Suffolk Police last night confirmed Fox's tweet was not correct.\n\nHundreds of people gathered as a group of masked thugs threw a burning bush inside the side entrance of the Hotel Inn Express, Leisure Island, in Tamworth yesterday evening.\n\n'Get out England' was graffitied on the side of the building, as police worked to extinguish the fire inside the hotel's stairwell.\n\nSome people could be heard chanting 'England, England, England,' while others threw objects at police and set off flares and fireworks. One man could be seen running towards police with what appeared to be a large speaker.\n\nOfficers clad in riot gear were seen standing in a line guarding the entrance to the hotel. One police officer has suffered a suspected broken arm.\n\nPolice have said the violent disorder has been 'successfully dispersed' as they appeal to anyone with information to help identify those responsible.\n\nA group of protesters were kept apart from counter protesters in Bolton this afternoon\n\nA fire extinguisher is sprayed at riot police in Rotherham\n\nProperty is vandalised as far-right activists in Middlesbrough\n\nThugs try to cram into the migrant hotel through a damaged fire exit in Rotherham\n\nROTHERHAM: Police have been trying to fend off agitators outside the hotel yesterday\n\nYvette Cooper slammed actions taken by rioters this week, as more than 420 people have been arrested, warning 'many more will follow' as authorities scour CCTV footage for criminals\n\nStarmer blasted 'far-Right thuggery', for which he promised swift justice amid another day of violent scenes nationwide.\n\nHe is today expected to hold an emergency COBRA Cabinet meeting, attended by police chiefs, in a bid to ensure the crisis does not spiral further out of control.\n\nHe also opened the door yesterday to tougher sentences to act as a 'deterrent', saying he will do 'whatever it takes' to crack down on the violence. He said the sentences would mirror action taken to deal with thuggery during the 2011 riots, when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nRead More Rioters descend on second migrant hotel in Tamworth\n\nAn asylum seeker who was staying at the Holiday Inn in Tamworth when it was set alight, told the Times of his terror as he was beaten up by the mob when they broke in.\n\n'They came onto this floor and hit me until the police drove them down the corridor.'\n\nWhile another 55-year-old Palestinian said his window was pelted with rocks thrown at his window.\n\n'I was taking some tea when they ran down shouting f***, f***, f***. A shirtless man was shouting and making so much noise. They broke the windows. There were eight on my floor.'\n\nWhile John Woodcock, a former Labour MP, called for MI6, MI5 and GCHQ to be given additional powers that would allow them to ask social media firms to take down accounts that try to 'fan the flames of British extreme actors'.\n\nMalaysia has become the first country to warn its citizens about the dangers of visiting Britain at the moment.\n\nThe statement released by Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: 'Malaysians residing in or travelling to the United Kingdom are urged to stay away from protest areas, remain vigilant and follow the latest updates and guidance provided by local authorities.'\n\nMore than 300 started marching through Middlesbrough after gathering at the city's Cenotaph.\n\nThe thugs chanted 'We want our country back' as they made their way through the city centre, before at least two people were taken away in handcuffs.\n\nPolice officers stand near the broken windows of the hotel during an anti-immigration riot\n\nROTHERHAM: Police try to control the deplorable violence after a mob attacked a hotel\n\nA thug throws a brick at a parked car during an anti-immigration riot in Middlesbrough\n\nPolice have said that there was a 'staggering' surge of violence which led to 35 people being arrested in Middlesbrough on Sunday.\n\nRioters smashed the windows of houses and cars and hurled objects at officers, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: 'It's our f****** country.'\n\nThere was significant damage to the crown court, the university and a number of properties in the Parliament Road area.\n\nCleveland Police said it has now arrested 55 people because of the violence that has swept across Teesside as 20 suspects were also arrested after rioting in Hartlepool on Wednesday.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable David Felton said: 'The level of violence we have seen today is staggering.\n\n'We know the shocking scenes across Middlesbrough today will have caused alarm amongst communities.\n\n'I want to reassure the people of Teesside that we will continue to identify those involved in these acts of violence and arrest them and put them before the courts.'\n\nAt one point police used dogs to keep the group back and stop them breaking through and running ahead of the officers patrolling the march. Several pieces of slate were also thrown, along with vapes and full plastic bottles.\n\nSome people kicked bollards into the road so that police vehicles driving ahead of the group could not get through, and one man sat on the bonnet of a police car to stop it moving.\n\nIn Bolton, Greater Manchester, violent clashes between rioters and police broke out, with footage showing the activists pushing against officers who had formed a human barricade.\n\nThere was also an counter protest in Bolton, where it was reported that large groups of Asian men could be heard shouting 'Allahu Akbar' as they clashed with the far-right.\n\nLast night experts condemned the 'dangerous' behaviour and also called for stricter action against those spreading misinformation.\n\nFestus Akinbusoye, a former police and crime commissioner, said: 'Of course there are discussions to be had about the level of immigration, the type of immigration and issues like integration.\n\n'But misinformation and xenophobic narratives are wrong, irresponsible and dangerous. These actions are having real world consequences and the people spreading dangerous lies need to be brought to book.'\n\nMIDDLESBROUGH: A car burns on Parliament Road after it was set alight by far-right thugs\n\nMIDDLESBROUGH: Police raced off with far-right agitators on Parliament Road yesterday\n\nA man is detained as Far-right activists hold a demonstration in Middlesbrough\n\nAn thug wearing a Union Jack mask outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nAn aerial view of the rioters gathering outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nCounter-protesters shout at police officers as they push against a cordon in Bolton\n\nObjects thrown at the hotel as trouble flares during an anti-immigration attack outside the Holiday Inn Express\n\nLIVERPOOL: Police officers attend to a shell-shocked colleague after a face-off with thugs on Saturday\n\nMr Akinbusoye, who was Britain's first black PCC, added: 'Our entire criminal justice system is going to have to be revisited in terms of how the authorities are going to be able to legitimately counter and pre-empt these narratives.\n\n'I understand that police forces need to be careful about what they put into the public domain but they need to... publish safe information whenever possible.'\n\nTory leadership hopeful Mel Stride said the scrapping of pilots of rapid-response police units, introduced by the Tories last March, may make it harder to tackle the current disorder.\n\nIt comes after an angry far-right mob stormed into a hotel in Rotherham yesterday, hurling chairs and spraying fire extinguishers at riot police, while setting bins, a generator and furniture alight.\n\nAround 700 violent thugs clad in balaclavas and draped in St George's flags clashed with officers trying to protect the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire since around 2pm this afternoon.\n\nAt least 10 officers have been injured in the chaos outside the hotel on the northern outskirts of the post-industrial town. One was left unconscious following a head injury, another suffered a suspected fractured elbow and other suspected broken bones.\n\nIt marks yet another day of violent riots of Britain's streets, with crowds in Middlesbrough setting fire to a car and pushing burning wheelie bins at police, while thugs in Rotherham smash windows and doors as riot police use shields to push them back.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police said one person has been arrested on suspicion of public order offences.\n\nSimilar scenes could be seen in Weymouth, as around 400 protesters from opposing sides gathered on the seafront to chant at each other. One side could be heard chanting 'Nazis go home', while the other shouted 'Tommy Robinson'.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

Chaos has engulfed Britain this week, leaving officers broken, cars set alight, shops looted and innocent civilians targeted on the streets\n\nThe statement from the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: \"Malaysians living in or travelling to the United Kingdom are urged to stay away from protest areas, remain vigilant and follow the latest updates and guidance from local authorities.\"\n\nThe warning comes as Britain is once again reeling from violent riots, which have seen chaos this week, with officers breaking bones, cars being set on fire, shops being looted and innocent civilians being targeted on the streets.\n\nAlthough photographs from Rotherham show alleged hotel residents peering out of windows at rioters, it remains unclear whether migrants and asylum seekers staying at the property have been able to evacuate. MailOnline has contacted the Home Office.\n\nOther images appear to show far-right protesters breaking into the hotel, with the BBC reporting that people wearing balaclavas were seen forcing their way in.\n\nObjects and pieces of wood were thrown at officers stationed outside the building. At least one officer in riot gear was carried away by his colleagues.\n\nOne person was fully covered in a Union Jack mask as he waved a large English flag outside the hotel, while others waved cans of beer inside and chanted offensive slogans.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Mayor Oliver Coppard said he was \"deeply shocked by the violence\" in Rotherham.\n\n\"What we are seeing is not a protest, but brutal violence targeting some of the most vulnerable people in our society,\" he said in a statement.\n\nProtesters in Rotherham. Malaysia's Foreign Ministry said: 'Malaysians living in or travelling to the UK are urged to stay away from protest areas, remain vigilant and follow the latest updates and guidance from local authorities'\n\nA man throws a brick during a protest in Liverpool. The violent unrest was sparked on Tuesday after misinformation spread on social media claiming that the teenager suspected of murdering three young girls was a radical Muslim migrant.\n\n\"The people who carry out these attacks do not represent the beautiful, brilliant place and people I know. We will deal with those who carry out this violence to the full force of the law,\" he added.\n\nThere are also ongoing protests in Bolton and Middlesbrough.\n\nThe violent unrest on Tuesday was sparked by misinformation spread on social media claiming that the teenager suspected of killing Bebe King (6), Elsie Dot Stancombe (7) and Alice Dasilva Aguiar (9) was a radical Muslim migrant.\n\nPolice have named the suspect as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, who was born in Cardiff to Christian parents from Rwanda. Rudakubana has since been charged with murder and attempted murder.\n\nThe misinformation sparked far-right protests across the country, with violence breaking out last night in Hull, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast - with many police forces pushed to the limit.\n\nMeanwhile, as rioters tore through Sunderland on Friday night, the crowd of protesters attacked the Masjid E Anwaar E Madinah mosque.\n\nSunderland Church leader Zaf Iqbal and three other people had to lock themselves in the place of worship to avoid the dangerous crowds outside.\n\nSpeak with the BBChe burst into tears as he recalled the \"very frightening\" ordeal.\n\nZaf Iqbal (pictured), a taxi driver and co-chair of the Sunderland Interfaith Forum, says the riots in Sunderland have left members of the Muslim community terrified and unwilling to leave their homes.\n\nHe said: \"We had to close the mosques on Friday night and could not continue our normal activities because we did not want our elderly to be put at risk.\n\n\"It's very scary because you have a mob attacking a building that is a place of worship. Like a church or a Sikh Gurdwara or a Hindu temple.\"\n\nShocking images from outside the mosque show mounted police officers trying to keep the rioters at bay.\n\nMr Iqbal said Friday night's events had left some Muslims in the area too scared to leave their homes. Meanwhile, members of the Sikh community also told the faith leader they were more vigilant.\n\nHorrifying video from Hull shows a group of rioters rushing towards a grey car in a car park and shouting racist abuse at the driver.\n\nAs the video continues, bystanders can be heard shouting for police as a group of men surround the vehicle.\n\nA shopping cart can be seen on the front of the car as one of the rioters, wearing a cap and a bandana around his face, reaches for it.\n\nThe man recording the conversation says that there are 'foreigners in the car'.\n\nThe windshield also appears to have been smashed and the windshield wipers appear to have been pulled up.\n\nA police car set on fire in Sunderland. As part of the clean-up operation, Northumbria Police are now hunting for those responsible for the widespread destruction and have said those responsible 'can expect to be dealt with to the full force of the law'\n\nFrom left to right: Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and six-year-old Bebe King. The three girls tragically died after being stabbed at a Taylor Swift dance event\n\nHowever, the group of men, some of whom have their faces covered, begins to disperse as a riot police unit carrying protective shields arrives at the scene.\n\nAccording to reports, the motorist was dragged from his vehicle by criminals, who then vandalized the vehicle.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged his \"full support\" to police in taking action against \"extremists\" who seek to \"spread hatred\" by intimidating communities as he holds emergency talks with ministers over unrest in parts of England.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said those involved in the fighting \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder have no place on the streets of Britain\".", "source":

He was actually born in Cardiff and raised Christian.\n\nTerrifying days of violence followed the attack in Southport, before spreading to Hartlepool and Manchester on Wednesday, Sunderland and Blackpool on Friday then 11 more cities by Saturday.\n\nFootage from Rotherham on Sunday showed masked yobs kicking out windows to storm the \u00adHoliday Inn Express, which houses migrants.\n\nAnother Holiday Inn where asylum seekers are thought to stay was petrol bombed in Tamworth, Staffordshire, as those inside watched through windows.\n\nMeanwhile, in Weymouth cops were tasked with keeping protesters and counter-protesters separate along the beach. Cops confirmed two officers were injured, one hit in the face with a bottle while the other was punched.\n\nThe thugs in Rotherham forced their way past cops into the hotel after pelting them with bricks, glass \u00adbottles and even fence panels. Some then hurled chairs.\n\nA towering blaze broke out as the group of 700 outside the hotel chanted: \"Get them out.\"\n\nOne injured cop was seen being carried to safety by colleagues.\n\nCops later confirmed at least 10 were injured, including an officer who was knocked unconscious, another who suffered a suspected broken elbow and another suffering from suspected broken bones.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield said: \"Today in Rotherham we have seen our officers attacked and at least ten injured, significant damage caused and a fire set outside a hotel full of terrified residents and staff.\n\n\"The behaviour we witnessed has been nothing short of disgusting.\"\n\nLater in the night hundreds descended on the Holiday Inn in Tamworth, where three petrol bombs were used to start \"a series of fires,\" according to Staffordshire Police.\n\nFootage shared widely online showed a towering blaze ignite inside a smashed window of the hotel.\n\nOfficers were assaulted, with one left with a suspected broken arm.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Stuart Ellison said: \"The senseless violence and acts of despicable thuggery in Tamworth tonight are completely inexcusable. The local community do not deserve to be subject to this behaviour, and neither do the brave officers putting themselves in harm's way to keep everyone safe.\"\n\nMeanwhile another migrant hotel, this time in Aldershot, was also targeted.\n\nA group of men outside Potters International Hotel brandished a banner insisting: \"We're not far right, we're just right.\"\n\nBy 6.45pm a crowd of some 200 \"got involved in criminal activity, throwing objects and subjecting people to racist abuse,\" according to Hampshire Police.\n\nThe force confirmed five men were arrested aged 32, 25, 18, 28 and 60.\n\nAt Middlesbrough's Cenotaph, hundreds of protesters squared up to police before throwing slate, cans and pots at the officers.\n\nA group of masked yobs walked through a residential area using metal bars and wooden posts to smash car windscreens and the windows of terraced houses.\n\nVehicles were torched, along with wheelie bins.\n\nOne victim, a white man in his 40s who did not want to be named, said: \"I'm born and bred in Middlesbrough and these morons target my house just for the hell of it. I could hear them yelling about immigrants, but they were smashing cars and house windows indiscriminately.\n\n\"They're the scum of the earth.\"\n\nCleveland Police confirmed \u00ad43 people were arrested by 1.28am on Monday, adding: \"A full investigation is now underway.\"\n\nACC David Felton, said: \"The level of violence we have seen today is staggering. We know the shocking scenes across Middlesbrough today will have caused alarm amongst communities.\n\n\"I want to reassure the people of Teesside that we will continue to identify those involved in these acts of violence and arrest them and put them before the courts.\"\n\nIn the centre of Bolton, large crowds of anti-immigration demonstrators gathered along with \u00adcounter-protesters while police tried to keep them apart.\n\nAn anti-immigrant rally on Weymouth seafront was met by a counter-protest.\n\nThree men, aged 42, 62 and 27, were arrested trying to break through police lines.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Mark Callaghan said: \"There were rumours circulating that asylum seekers currently housed on the Bibby Stockholm would be moved to Portland, Weymouth or the wider Dorset Council area but the Home Office have confirmed this is not the case. In addition, there are no asylum seekers housed in hotels in the Weymouth area.\"\n\nThere was a large turnout in Hull, scene of earlier violence.\n\nGreater Manchester Police said a Section 34 dispersal notice had been authorised until 10pm yesterday, giving officers extra powers to deal with anyone causing anti-social behaviour.\n\nChief Inspector Natasha Evans said the force was acting to \"prevent serious disruption and ensure everyone can go about their lives without fear or risk of harm\".\n\nMerseyside Police introduced two Section 60 orders in Liverpool and Southport between 2pm yesterday and 2am today, giving officers greater stop-and-search powers.\n\nLast night faith leaders in Merseyside issued a joint statement calling for calm and urging people to hold the families of Southport stabbing victims Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, at \"the forefront of all our thoughts\".\n\nThey said: \"Division can destroy the very relationships and environment that we depend upon every day of our lives and there is no place for hate in our communities.\n\n\"It can -- and has -- left communities in fear and has put people in danger. At this difficult time, let us remember that there is far more that unites than divides us.\n\n\"The people of all faiths and none who came out to sweep the streets, to rebuild walls and have so generously donated money in memory of those three girls -- that is the spirit that will help us through this incredibly challenging time.\"\n\nSince the horror a week ago, the country has been plagued by riots.\n\nOn Wednesday, 111 people were arrested in London and 11 more in Hartlepool, two in Manchester and two in Aldershot.\n\nOn Friday, violence erupted outside a Liverpool mosque.\n\nSaturday saw forces pushed to the brink with more than 100 arrests and dozens of \u00adofficers hurt.\n\nTrouble flared in Belfast, Blackpool, Stoke, Leeds, Hull, Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Bristol and Portsmouth.\n\nLast night National Police Chiefs' Council lead for public order, BJ Harrington, said leave had been cancelled by many forces and 4,000 officers put on standby.\n\nMr Harrington warned those involved in disorder: \"Make no mistake, if you haven't had a knock on the door yet, your time will come.\"\n\nHe said fake news inflamed the trouble and urged social media users to be careful what they share, adding: \"Think twice before you act.\"\n\nPolicing minister Dame Diana Johnson suggested courts could sit overnight to ensure \"thugs who maraud our streets\" are brought to justice.\n\nSimilar action was taken in the wake of the 2011 London riots.\n\nIn a hard-hitting message from Downing Street, the PM said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\"\n\nHe went on: \"This is not a \u00adprotest, it is organised, violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets or online.\n\n\"All right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence. People in this country have a right to be safe.\n\n\"And yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques.\n\n\"Other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: Far-right thuggery.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper announced new emergency measures to protect mosques.\n\nThose at risk of violent disorder will be offered additional security personnel.\n\nShe said: \"Britain is a proud and tolerant country, and nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops or attacking people based on the colour of their skin.\n\n\"In light of the disgraceful threats and attacks that local mosques have also faced in many communities, the Government is providing rapid additional support through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme.\"", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker",

But no hotel staff or residents were hurt.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield said: \"The mindless actions today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear.\"\n\nAnother Holiday Inn Express accused of housing migrants was attacked by a mob in Tamworth, Staffordshire, last night.\n\nThe crowd chanted \"our streets\" before smashing windows on the hotel's bottom floor.\n\nViolence also engulfed Middlesbrough where yobs hijacked a \"peaceful\" \"pro-British\" march and attacked cars and houses before turning on TV crews.\n\nIn Bolton, around 300 masked Muslims shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" - or \"God is greatest\" - charged towards anti-immigration marchers, with rival groups throwing missiles at each another.\n\nThis came as clean-up efforts began in cities blighted by violence on Saturday, including in Liverpool where demonstrators targeting a mosque set fire to a community library, which also hosts a foodbank.\n\nOne distraught resident said: \"Nazis burned books - these have gone one step further and burned a library.\"\n\nAmong other victims of the anarchy were Filipino nurses who had rocks thrown at them on their way to provide \"emergency cover\" at a hospital in Sunderland on Friday.\n\nAs footage of the violence spread globally, Malaysia - where almost two-thirds of the population are Muslims - became the first country to update its travel advice in Britain, telling its citizens to \"stay away from protest areas\" and \"remain vigilant\".\n\nFormer Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf labelled the Rotherham anarchy a \"pogrom against Muslims and people of colour\" and called for the Army to be sent in to protect them.\n\nIn chilling scenes in South Yorkshire - where tensions have festered over a long-running child sex grooming scandal involving men of mainly Pakistani origin - heavily outnumbered police had to retreat from masked gangs.\n\nAfter initially being forced to pull back, officers brought in reinforcements and pushed yobs away, leaving a tense stand-off.\n\nIn Middlesbrough, demonstrators went on the rampage, smashing cars and windows, telling terrified residents that the violence was \"because we're English\".\n\nIn a reference to the Cardiff-born teenage suspect in the Southport killings, they carried a banner saying \"Tom Jones is Welsh, Axel Rudakubana isn't\".\n\nCrowds chanted \"We want our country back!\" before some pelted police with bottles and pieces of slate or set wheelie bins alight.\n\nIn Dorset, police moved people off Weymouth beach as evening fell and rival marches faced off, one side shouting in support of English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson, while the other side bellowed \"Nazis go home\".\n\nThe latest scenes came after a mob who had attempted to target a mosque in the Walton area of Liverpool on Saturday evening torched a community library that only opened last year after locals helped raise \u00a3900,000.\n\nAs firefighters tried to put out the flames that engulfed Spellow Lane library hub - which also functions as a food bank - rioters threw missiles, breaking the rear window of a fire appliance.\n\nFaith leaders across Merseyside yesterday called on communities to \"remain calm and peaceful\" and ignore those seeking to \"use the Southport tragedy to create division and hate\".\n\nElsewhere on Saturday, looters took advantage of the mayhem, stealing everything from phones, shoes and even gingerbread men and cookies from shops.\n\nIn parts of Belfast, stores and cafes were set on fire and destroyed by anti-Muslim mobs on Saturday, with shopkeepers claiming police \"did nothing\".\n\n\"What kind of police are letting the people burn everything down?\" one asked.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland said it was treating reports of criminal damage as hate crimes and had so far made four arrests.\n\nBy last night, police across the UK had made more than 150 arrests in connection with the trouble since Saturday.\n\nLast week a judge took the unusual step of allowing Axel Rudakubana, 17, to be identified as the suspect in the Southport knife attack.\n\nFalse claims that he was a Muslim illegal migrant prompted police to reveal he was born in Cardiff before moving to Merseyside with his Christian parents, who are originally from Rwanda.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Assistant Chief Constable Butterfield said: \"Those who choose to spread misinformation and hate online also need to take responsibility for the scenes today - this was not a protest, just angry people reacting to a false narrative who have their own motivations for doing so.\"\n\n\"Those who stood on and watched the violence and

At least one cop has been injured in the chaos outside the hotel on the northern outskirts of the post-industrial town.\n\nIt marks yet another day of violent riots of Britain's streets, after chaos ensued this week leaving cops with broken bones, cars set on fire and innocent pedestrians targeted on the streets. The outburst comes after three young girls were stabbed to death in Southport by alleged knifeman Axel Muganwa Rudakubana on July 29.\n\nWhile photos from the scene have shown some occupants looking out of the hotel window onto rioters, it is still unclear if the migrants and asylum seekers housed in the property have been able to evacuate. MailOnline has contacted the Home Office.\n\nObjects and pieces of wood were flung at officers who had lined up in front of the building with at least one cop in riot gear being carried away by their colleagues.\n\nOne person's face was seen completely covered with a Union Jack mask while they waved a large England flag outside the hotel while others swung back cans of bears while chanting offensive slogans.\n\nA group of young men held a banner that read 'we're not far right we're just right' while another placard being waved around said: 'Stopping the boats means stopping the stabbings'.\n\nThe protest has already been strongly criticise by anti-racism groups as well as campaigner Brendan Cox, whose MP wife Jo Cox was killed in her West Yorkshire constituency in 2016.\n\nHe said: 'The scenes in Rotherham aren't a protest, they aren't even a far right riot, they are an ongoing attempt to murder the men, women and children inside by burning them alive.\n\n'The stench of these days will hang around those who incited and justified it for the rest of their lives.'\n\nAn anti-racism counter protest at the scene has increased tensions for police, who arrived to find banners reading: 'Refugees welcome: Stop the far right.'\n\nWatching the scenes of chaos unfold, former home secretary and Tory party leader hopeful James Cleverly said rioters should be hit with 'the full weight of the law'.\n\n'There is not and can never be any excuse, justification or rationale for behaviour like this,' he tweeted. 'This should be condemned by everybody, and those taking part should expect to be met with the full weight of the law.'\n\nIGH, the parent company of the Holiday Inn chain, told the BBC: 'The safety and security of our guests and colleagues is always our priority.'\n\nElsewhere in Middlesbrough, more than 300 protesters started marching towards the city's Cenotaph.\n\nThey carried a banner that read: 'Tom Jones is Welsh, Axel Rudakubana isn't' Rudakubana is the 17-year-old accused for murdering the three little girls in Southport and is charged with attempted murder of 10 others.\n\nHis parents were born in Rwanda before moving to the UK in 2002. Rudakubana was born in Cardiff in 2006 before moving to near Southport in 2013.\n\nOthers marching through the city chanted 'we want our country back' as they made their way through the city centre.\n\nAt least two people were taken away in handcuffs within the first half hour, while several pieces of slate were thrown, along with vapes and full plastic bottles.\n\nSome people kicked bollards into the road so that police vehicles driving ahead of the group could not get through, and one man sat on the bonnet of a police car to stop it from moving.\n\nThe fresh day of riots comes as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to go on holiday with his family, it is understood, a decision which has been slammed by MPs.\n\nTory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick criticised Sir Keir for the getaway plan, branding it 'completely wrong' amid a period of chaos in the country.\n\nNo10 did not dispute the claims when approached by MailOnline but said the Prime Minister is working this weekend and next week.\n\nThe disruption across England and Northern Ireland began on Tuesday in Southport, after three little girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class.\n\nSlamming Sir Keir's alleged plans to go on holiday, Mr Jenrick told GBN Live: 'I think it would be completely wrong for the Prime Minister to go on holiday whilst parts of Britain are burning.\n\n'I'm sure that the government, like the whole country, sees the severity of the situation.'\n\nThe politician added: 'I know they're trying to get a grip on it and I welcome some of the measures they've already taken, like having more persecutors, having the courts sit weekends, but this is a very serious situation.'\n\nHowever, Chris Webb, the Labour MP for Blackpool South, said Sir Keir 'has to have family time'.\n\nHe told LBC's Matthew Wright: 'The government will continue and we've got an excellent Deputy Prime Minister.\n\n'Keir has to have family time, there's no doubt about it. Every Prime Minister has to have that family time and that break but from what I know of Keir - and I've met him many times, and sitting here in Blackpool several times - he will be continuing to work and monitor the situation wherever he is on holiday.'\n\nCities such as Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester and Belfast have seen vehicles burned, shops destroyed, pedestrians attacked and police officers injured this week following the Southport stabbings on Monday.\n\nArrests have been made across the country, with police warning of more to come once CCTV, social media and body-worn camera footage has been scoured.\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast, which saw several police officers injured. It followed a riot in Sunderland on Friday evening.\n\nA community library on the Merseyside that only opened last year after months of fundraising was set on fire last night as more than 300 people descended on the streets of a deprived city suburb.\n\nAs firefighters tried to put on the flames that engulfed Spellow Lane Library Hub - which also functions as a food bank - rioters threw a missile at the engine, before breaking the rear window of a nearby cab.\n\nShocking photos from this morning show the burnt out interior of the library, with bookshelves tipped on their side, and glass surrounding the remaining computers.\n\nOne officer was shoved off his motorbike while another was looked after by colleagues after appearing shell-shocked following a violent confrontation with a protester.\n\nElsewhere, shameless looters took advantage of the violent mayhem, stealing everything from phones, shoes and wine from local shops.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType":

Several videos on social media showed shops in Hull city centre being looted and being set on fire.\n\nA cafe in Belfast was set on fire during the anti-immigration protests in the city, Daily Mail reported.\n\nThe street cleaning teams in Hull have been deployed to clean up the city after the damage caused by the rioters, after getting a clearance from the police.\n\nA large group of far-right protesters, with many draped in British flags and chanting nationalist slogans, stood in front of the Holiday Inn Express hotel in Rotherham, where a significant number of asylum seekers are accommodated. After some time, they began throwing projectiles at police, smashing windows, and eventually entered the building and set it ablaze.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer warned that \"far-right thugs\" would \"regret\" their actions and face the \"full force of the law\", following the incident.

Reasons for violent disorder explained", "body": "A number of riots have taken place across the UK in the past week, fueled by anti-immigration sentiment from the far-right.\n\nPlenty of vandalism and violence has occurred, with cars and buildings burnt, projectiles thrown at mosques, police attacked and hotels believed to be housing asylum seekers broken into.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer gave a televised address on Sunday (August 4) and warned those involved that they would \"regret\" taking part.\n\nHe said: \"People in this country have a right to be safe, and yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques.\n\n\"Other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery.\"\n\nBut why have the riots taken place and why has it escalated as the week has gone on?\n\nThe riots happened in the wake of the killing of three young girls at a dance studio in Southport on Monday (July 29).\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were killed and eight others were injured, some severely.\n\nRumours emerged on social media claiming that the attacker was a man called Ali Al-Shakati who was a Muslim asylum seeker.\n\nHowever, this wasn't true, with the individual being identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana in court.\n\nJudge Andrew Menary made the exceptional decision to lift reporting restrictions despite his age in an attempt to stop misinformation.\n\nRudakubana was born in Cardiff to parents of Rwanda heritage, before moving to the village of Banks just outside of Southport.\n\nA vigil in Southport was held on Tuesday (July 30) but on the same evening, hundreds of protestors gathered outside a mosque in the town.\n\nThere were chants expressing Islamophobic and anti-immigration sentiment alongside support for Tommy Robinson, the founder of the EDL (English Defence League).\n\nObjects were also thrown at the mosque and at riot police who came in to deal with the disorder, with a police van being set alight.\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nAfter that, similar riots followed across the UK for the rest of the week in places such as Rotherham, Hull, Middlesbrough, Bristol, Tamworth and Liverpool.\n\nMuch of the reasoning for the riots appears to be Islamophobia and far-right hostility towards immigration, both illegal and legal.\n\nAdditionally, there have been claims of 'two-tier policing' with the rioters believing that they are treated more harshly in their actions than those of more left-wing protests.", "source": {"uri": "somersetcountygazette.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Somerset County Gaz"}, "authors":

Previous warnings didn't work. The British prime minister announced a nationwide violence disorder unit last week, after protests broke out following the murder of three little girls at a dance class in Southport. He hoped the threat of sharing intelligence and advanced technologies between police forces would deter further rioting. Instead:\n\nThe X factor. The riots have been organised and livestreamed on social media platforms, which helped foment the initial unrest by allowing disinformation about the Southport murders to spread largely unchecked, amplified by the likes of Tommy Robinson and Andrew Tate.\n\nElon Musk, who runs X, where the false claim that the Southport suspect was a Muslim asylum-seeker was rapidly disseminated last week, has been silent on his site's role in the riots. Instead the billionaire replied to a post suggesting the disorder was caused by mass migration and open borders by writing that \"civil war is inevitable\". It's worth emphasising that the suspect was born in Britain to Rwandan parents.\n\nIn Rotherham, a far-right mob, some draped in England and Union Jack flags, started a fire outside a Holiday Inn housing asylum-seekers; a crowd smashed a glass door to gain access to the hotel, chanting \"get them out\". One police officer was knocked unconscious. Violence also erupted in:\n\nStarmer has vowed to \"do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice\", saying those who took part \"whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves\" would face justice. The prime minister has repeatedly used the term thugs.\n\nBut one month into the job, Starmer is facing:\n\nBack to the future. Starmer has experience dealing with public unrest. Back in 2011, he was director of public prosecutions when riots broke out after Mark Duggan, a black British man, was shot dead by police officers. It led to civil unrest across the country and more than 3,000 arrests. Starmer kept courts going around the clock, with heavy sentences handed out, in a bid to restore order.\n\nBut... even if the government utilises so-called \"Nightingale Courts\" to fast-track sentencing, there is no guarantee that British prisons will have the space to take them. And unlike in 2011, police and eyewitnesses suggest the rioters are not local to the communities that have been targeted.\n\nWhat's more. As in 2011, this year's wave of unrest is taking place during a heatwave. Rain is forecast and may bring some respite. Tackling the underlying anger of protesters will take longer.\n\nThanks for reading. This article is part of our Daily Sensemaker, a free newsletter from Tortoise.

Yvette Cooper slammed actions taken by rioters this week as 'disgraceful thuggery', after more than 420 people were arrested, as she warned 'many more will follow' as authorities scour CCTV footage to identify all those involved.\n\nClashes, sparked by the murder of three little girls in Southport last Monday, deteriorated further yesterday when a second migrant hotel was set ablaze in Tamworth, while hundreds cheered and clinked beers outside. While in Middlesbrough the protestors were filmed stopping traffic to interrogate the passengers to check they are 'white and English'. Keir Starmer also waded in to warn far-Right rioters 'you'll regret taking part' as he tried to stamp his authority over the first major test of his Premiership. He blasted 'far-Right thuggery', for which he promised swift justice as he is expected to call a COBRA meeting today.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tories were forced to reprimanded Shadow Wales Secretary Lord Davies of Gower after The Mail on Sunday columnist Dan Hodges said there was 'no political justification' for the riots and Lord Davies retorted: ' Labour blocked the Rwanda Bill 130+ times, of course it's politically justified!' This comes as: Rioters descend on second migrant hotel as far-right mob try to set fire to Holiday Inn housing asylum seekers in Tamworth Tommy Robinson suns himself at an all-inclusive five-star hotel in Cyprus while his foot soldiers run riot in violent protests The Tory Police and Crime Commissioner claimed far-right protesters are trying to 'protect Britain's sovereignty and identity' Malaysia becomes the first country issues warning over travelling to the UK amid the violent protests The Tories were forced to reprimanded Shadow Wales Secretary after he justified the rioting by saying: ' Labour blocked the Rwanda Bill 130+ times, of course it's politically justified!'\n\nWriting in the Times the Home Secretary held nothing back when she said: 'Make no mistake: there will be a reckoning for the individuals who took part in this violence, those who whipped them up on social media and in online forums and those who have felt emboldened by this moment to stir up racial hatred.' Ms Cooper made clear that the crackdown would also cover those spreading misinformation online. This came after Tommy Robinson posted a video of a confrontation in Stoke and claimed two protesters had been stabbed 'by Muslims'. The post was viewed two million times on X. Two hours later, Staffordshire Police confirmed the information was false. Those injured were hit by something thrown by their own side.\n\nActor Laurence Fox has also shared a string of false claims. On Friday night, he posted a list of dozens of acts of violence he alleged had been committed by immigrants under the caption: 'Anyone else had enough?' Among them was the claim that a 'woman [was] beaten to death by two Somalis while walking her dog' - understood to have been a reference to last month's murder of Anita Rose, 57, in Brantham, Suffolk. Three people have been arrested in connection with the murder, but Suffolk Police last night confirmed Fox's tweet was not correct. Hundreds of people gathered as a group of masked thugs threw a burning bush inside the side entrance of the Hotel Inn Express, Leisure Island, in Tamworth yesterday evening. 'Get out England' was graffitied on the side of the building, as police worked to extinguish the fire inside the hotel's stairwell.\n\nSome people could be heard chanting 'England, England, England,' while others threw objects at police and set off flares and fireworks. One man could be seen running towards police with what appeared to be a large speaker. Officers clad in riot gear were seen standing in a line guarding the entrance to the hotel. One police officer has suffered a suspected broken arm. Police have said the violent disorder has been 'successfully dispersed' as they appeal to anyone with information to help identify those responsible. Starmer blasted 'far-Right thuggery', for which he promised swift justice amid another day of violent scenes nationwide. He is today expected to hold an emergency COBRA Cabinet meeting, attended by police chiefs, in a bid to ensure the crisis does not spiral further out of control.\n\nHe also opened the door yesterday to tougher sentences to act as a 'deterrent', saying he will do 'whatever it takes' to crack down on the violence. He said the sentences would mirror action taken to deal with thuggery during the 2011 riots, when he was Director of Public Prosecutions. An asylum seeker who was staying at the Holiday Inn in Tamworth when it was set alight, told the Times of his terror as he was beaten up by the mob when they broke in. 'They came onto this floor and hit me until the police drove them down the corridor.' While another 55-year-old Palestinian said his window was pelted with rocks thrown at his window. 'I was taking some tea when they ran down shouting [expletive]. A shirtless man was shouting and making so much noise. They broke the windows. There were eight on my floor.' While John Woodcock, a former Labour MP, called for MI6, MI5 and GCHQ to be given additional powers that would allow them to ask social media firms to take down accounts that try to 'fan the flames of British extreme actors'.\n\nMalaysia has become the first country to warn its citizens about the dangers of visiting Britain at the moment. The statement released by Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: 'Malaysians residing in or travelling to the United Kingdom are urged to stay away from protest areas, remain vigilant and follow the latest updates and guidance provided by local authorities.' More than 300 protesters started marching through Middlesbrough after gathering at the city's Cenotaph. The thugs chanted 'We want our country back' as they made their way through the city centre, before at least two people were taken away in handcuffs. Police have said that there was a 'staggering' surge of violence which led to 35 people being arrested in Middlesbrough on Sunday. Rioters smashed the windows of houses and cars and hurled objects at officers, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: 'It's our [expletive] country.'\n\nThere was significant damage to the crown court, the university and a number of properties in the Parliament Road area. Cleveland Police said it has now arrested 55 people because of the violence that has swept across Teesside as 20 suspects were also arrested after rioting in Hartlepool on Wednesday. Assistant Chief Constable David Felton said: 'The level of violence we have seen today is staggering. 'We know the shocking scenes across Middlesbrough today will have caused alarm amongst communities. 'I want to reassure the people of Teesside that we will continue to identify those involved in these acts of violence and arrest them and put them before the courts.' At one point police used dogs to keep the group back and stop them breaking through and running ahead of the officers patrolling the march. Several pieces of slate were also thrown, along with vapes and full plastic bottles. Some people kicked bollards into the road so that police vehicles driving ahead of the group could not get through, and one man sat on the bonnet of a police car to stop it moving.\n\nIn Bolton, Greater Manchester, violent clashes between protesters and police broke out, with footage showing the activists pushing against officers who had formed a human barricade. There was also an counter protest in Bolton, where it was reported that large groups of Asian men could be heard shouting 'Allahu Akbar' as they clashed with the far-right. Last night experts condemned the 'dangerous' behaviour and also called for stricter action against those spreading misinformation. Festus Akinbusoye, a former police and crime commissioner, said: 'Of course there are discussions to be had about the level of immigration, the type of immigration and issues like integration. 'But misinformation and xenophobic narratives are wrong, irresponsible and dangerous. These actions are having real world consequences and the people spreading dangerous lies need to be brought to book.' Mr Akinbusoye, who was Britain's first black PCC, added: 'Our entire criminal justice system is going to have to be revisited in terms of how the authorities are going to be able to legitimately counter and pre-empt these narratives. 'I understand that police forces need to be careful about what they put into the public domain but they need to... publish safe information whenever possible.'\n\nTory leadership hopeful Mel Stride said the scrapping of pilots of rapid-response police units, introduced by the Tories last March, may make it harder to tackle the current disorder. It comes after an angry far-right mob stormed into a hotel in Rotherham yesterday, hurling chairs and spraying fire extinguishers at riot police, while setting bins, a generator and furniture alight. Around 700 violent anti-immigration protesters clad in balaclavas and draped in St George's flags clashed with officers trying to protect the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire since around 2pm this afternoon. At least 10 officers have been injured in the chaos outside the hotel on the northern outskirts of the post-industrial town. One was left unconscious following a head injury, another suffered a suspected fractured elbow and other suspected broken bones.\n\nIt marks yet another day of violent riots of Britain's streets, with crowds in Middlesbrough setting fire to a car and pushing burning wheelie bins at police, while thugs in Rotherham smash windows and doors as riot police use shields to push them back. South Yorkshire Police said one person has been arrested on suspicion of public order offences. Similar scenes could be seen in Weymouth, as around 400 protesters from opposing sides gathered on the seafront to chant at each other. One side could be heard chanting 'Nazis go home', while the other shouted 'Tommy Robinson'.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

She vowed that those involved 'will pay the price'.\n\nREAD NEXT: Urgent Cobra meeting to be held after weekend of rioting and disorder across UK\n\nShe told Sky News: \"It's a total disgrace and there has to be a reckoning. Those individuals who are involved in the disorder need to know that they will pay a price.\n\n\"I've made clear to the police they have my full support in going after the full range of offenders, from those who turned up at the last minute and joined in the looting, to some of the most serious offenders who were pursuing really dangerous arson, really dangerous damage and criminal violence, because we simply cannot stand for this.\n\n\"So we should be clear, there will be people who were thinking they were going on their summer holidays this week, and instead they will face a knock on the door from the police. They will face arrest and... a police cell, while they wait for trial in order to make sure that they do pay the price for what they have done.\"\n\nMs Cooper also claimed that social media has put 'rocket boosters' under far-right organisations. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: \"Social media companies need to take some responsibility, we also need to make sure that criminal activity online is being pursued, and I think it's really important that none of us forget this minority of thugs do not speak for Britain.\"\n\nLarge-scale riots broke out in Middlesborough, Rotherham and Tamworth last night, following disorder in cities such as Manchester, Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Blackpool and Belfast on Saturday. Downing Street will hold a Cobra emergency response meeting today after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer vowed rioters would 'regret' engaging in 'far-right thuggery'.\n\nMonday's meeting is due to involve relevant ministers and police representatives who will discuss the response in the coming days to ensure there is no repeat of the violent scenes. A number of MPs have said Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots.\n\nThis morning, Dame Priti Patel said politicians need to 'get some kind of grip of this'. She told Times Radio: \"What we are seeing across the country right now is just extraordinary criminality.\n\n\"At the end of the day, crime and criminality is the responsibility of those who are perpetrating this and we now need to, in my view, as politicians, get some kind of grip of this, which is why I am calling for the recall of Parliament right now so that we can actually discuss these issues in a similar way...back in 2011 those discussions took place and actually we put our arm around the communities that were affected at the time. And I think that's really what we should be doing right now.\"\n\nNigel Farage also called for Parliament to be recalled 'for a proper debate'. The Reform UK leader said 'in the short team we will quell the riots, but deeper long-term problems remain'.\n\nRead more of today's top stories here", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk",

Several pieces of slate were also thrown, along with vapes and full plastic bottles.\n\nSome people kicked bollards into the road so that police vehicles driving ahead of the group could not get through, and one man sat on the bonnet of a police car to stop it moving.\n\nIn Bolton, Greater Manchester, violent clashes between protesters and police broke out, with footage showing the activists pushing against officers who had formed a human barricade.\n\nROTHERHAM: A bin on fire outside the Holiday Inn Migrant hotel in Rotherham\n\nROTHERHAM: Serious violence and rioting by far right protesters led to a man being caught by police dogs\n\nMIDDLESBOROUGH: A car is set on fire in Middlesborough amid the chaos\n\nROTHERHAM: Protesters try to cram into the migrant hotel through a damaged fire exit in Rotherham\n\nROTHERHAM: A man looks out of The Holiday Inn hotel in Rotherham as counter demonstrators stand outside with signs saying 'refugees welcome'\n\nROTHERHAM: A bin is chucked towards a fire as a group of far right protestes gather in Rotherham\n\nROTHERHAM: A woman and a man take cover as objects are thrown during an anti-immigration protest outside the Holiday Inn Express\n\nBOLTON: Police officers stand guard as counter-protesters push against the police cordon\n\nROTHERHAM: A man with a bloodied mouth is detained by police amid today's chaos\n\nROTHERHAM: Riot police detain an anti-migration protester outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nROTHERHAM: Riot police clash with anti-migration protesters outside of the Holiday Inn Express\n\nBOLTON: Protesters gather in Bolton, Greater Manchester\n\nBOLTON: Protesters clash with police today in Bolton, Greater Manchester\n\nBOLTON: Police officers stand guard during an anti-immigration protest in Bolton\n\nBOLTON: People confront police officers during a protest in Bolton\n\nBOLTON: Police officers stand guard as counter-protesters push against the police cordon\n\nBOLTON: Police officers stand guard as counter-protesters push against the police cordon\n\nDistressing footage posted on social media appears to show masked individuals in Sheffield attacking a man with an England flag and repeatedly kicking him on the ground.\n\nOne group of protesters in Middlesbrough walked through a residential area smashing the windows of houses and cars.\n\nMeanwhile, one person threw a piece of broken glass through the window of a home.\n\nA scuffle broke out between protesters and a small group of people whose cars were smashed.\n\nA woman shouted 'you fascist thugs' while a man who was with her shouted at police: 'You're letting them rampage through the city.'\n\nThe violence marks yet another day riots of Britain's streets, after chaos ensued this week leaving cops with broken bones, cars set on fire and innocent pedestrians targeted on the streets.\n\nThe outburst comes after three young girls were stabbed to death in Southport by alleged knifeman Axel Muganwa Rudakubana on July 29.\n\nIn a speech today, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned the violence. 'This is not protest, it is organised violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets or online.\n\n'Right now there are attacks happening at a hotel in Rotherham. Marauding gangs intent on lawbreaking or worse.'\n\nSir Keir added: 'Windows smashed, fires set ablaze, residents and staff in absolute fear. There is no justification, none, for taking this action, and all right-minded people should be condemning this sort of violence.'\n\nWhile photos from the scene in Rotherham today have shown some occupants looking out of the hotel window onto rioters, it is still unclear if the migrants and asylum seekers housed in the property have been able to evacuate.

Every Prime Minister has to have that family time and that break but from what I know of Keir - and I've met him many times, and sitting here in Blackpool several times - he will be continuing to work and monitor the situation wherever he is on holiday.'\n\nCities such as Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester and Belfast have seen vehicles burned, shops destroyed, pedestrians attacked and police officers injured this week following the Southport stabbings on Monday.\n\nArrests have been made across the country, with police warning of more to come once CCTV, social media and body-worn camera footage has been scoured.\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast, which saw several police officers injured.

Rioters targeted the Merseyside town following a vigil for the three young girls.\n\nKeir Starmer will hold an emergency meeting today (Monday, August 5) following his address to the nation the previous day. In his address, he said that violent rioters that have taken to streets in locations in England and Northern Ireland would 'regret' engaging in 'far-right thuggery', adding that those involved would 'face the full force of the law'.\n\nMinister and police representatives are expected to attend the meeting. It comes as official attempt to quell rioters to avoid a repeat of violent scenes seen in cities over the past week.\n\nThe Worthing Labour Group, led by Sophie Cox, issued a statement today, which read: \"We are shocked and appalled by the violence and extremism that has occurred in the past week across the country since the tragic events in Southport.\n\n\"Racism, lawlessness and any form of hatred directed to the diversity of our communities have no place in a civilised society and we are united in our condemnation of those who threaten the cohesion and inclusiveness on which our country's values are built.\n\n\"We extend our unshakeable support to all our communities.\n\n\"If you experience or witness any behaviour that is threatening, abusive or targeting minority groups, please contact Sussex Police by calling 101 or reporting online. Similarly, social media content inciting hatred or violence should be reported immediately to the platform provider and the police.\n\n\"It is vital that we all come together to keep hatred and extremism out of our community.\"\n\nMosques have been targeted by groups of protesters, with the Home Office announcing that the religious buildings would be offered new protected from rioters under a new 'rapid response process'.", "source": {"uri": "sussexexpress.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "SussexWorld"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_morton@sussexexpress.co.uk", "name": "Sam Morton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worthing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Worthing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Worthing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sussex Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Disorders", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.sussexexpress.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOmY3MDUxOTNlLTQ5M2YtNDllZC1iOTQxLTJlMzQ0NmVkNGU5OTo0MzA2ZmIyZi1jZDA3LTRjMmQtODM4My0yMmNhZWYxOTZhNzg=.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789876", "eventUri": "eng-9789876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 558, "textEnd": 566}], "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

"FAR-RIGHT riot thugs have been warned they face a \"reckoning\" - as the PM holds a Cobra meeting after a weekend of fiery carnage.\n\nMore than 420 people have been arrested after social media lies whipped up riots across the UK.\n\nLast night hundreds of thugs petrol-bombed a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham near Sheffield.\n\nRioters in balaclavas hurled brick and fire extinguishers at cops who tried in vain to stop them surrounding the hotel.\n\nTen riot cops were injured - including one who was knocked out after suffering a head injury.\n\nThugs also petrol-bombed a Holiday Inn hosting asylum seekers in Tamworth, Staffordshire.\n\nA children's library in Liverpool and a Citizens' Advice centre in Sunderland were also torched over the weekend.\n\nMosques across the country have been attacked and shops owned by ethnic minority Brits have been looted.\n\nToday Sir Keir Starmer will summon ministers and police chiefs for the first Cobra meeting since the riots started.\n\nLast night the PM said the \"far-right thugs\" behind the riots would regret their actions.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper slammed the \"disgraceful\" riots - saying they betray Britain's values.\n\nWriting in The Times, Cooper said: \"Make no mistake - there will be a reckoning for the individuals who took part in this violence.\n\n\"Whatever they and some of their political supporters may tell us, these are not patriots standing up for their communities.\n\n\"They are thugs, criminals, and extremists who betray the very values our country is built on.\"\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage called for Parliament to be recalled this morning.\n\nPosting on Twitter, Farage added: \"We should not discount the use of the army if the situation were to deteriorate further.\"\n\nViolent clashes broke out in dozens of UK towns and cities last week and continued over the weekend.\n\nThey have been fuelled by online lies following the murders of three girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nPosts wrongly claimed suspect Axel Rudakubana was a Muslim asylum seeker.\n\nRudakubana, 17, was actually born in Cardiff and raised as a Christian.\n\nTerrifying violence followed the attack in Southport, before unrest spread to Hartlepool and Manchester on Wednesday.\n\nRiots then broke out in Sunderland and Blackpool on Friday - and in 11 more cities on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAt Middlesbrough's Cenotaph, hundreds of protesters squared up to police before throwing slate, cans and pots at the officers.\n\nA group of masked yobs walked through a residential suburb of the city.\n\nThey used metal bars and wooden posts to smash car windscreens and the windows of terraced houses.\n\nVehicles were torched, along with wheelie bins.\n\nMeanwhile, in Weymouth cops were tasked with keeping protesters and counter-protesters separate along the beach.\n\nCops confirmed two officers were injured, one hit in the face with a bottle while the other was punched.\n\nAnother migrant hotel in the Hampshire town of Aldershot was also targeted.\n\nA group of men outside Potters International Hotel brandished a banner insisting: \"We're not far right, we're just right.\"\n\nBy 6.45pm a crowd of some 200 \"got involved in criminal activity, throwing objects and subjecting people to racist abuse,\" according to Hampshire Police.\n\nA group of men outside Potters International Hotel brandished a banner insisting: \"We're not far right, we're just right.\"\n\nIn the centre of Bolton, large crowds of anti-immigration demonstrators gathered along with \u00adcounter-protesters while police tried to keep them apart.\n\nTrouble also flared in Belfast, Blackpool, Stoke, Leeds, Hull, Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Bristol and Portsmouth.\n\nSnaps show the devastation which rioters have left behind in many towns this morning.\n\nOne photo shows a torched upside-down car in Middlesbrough - with thugs responsible nowhere to

There had been hopes that bad weather might drown out the violent disorder that has escalated over the last six days, but instead dry conditions did nothing to help flatten growing unrest. Hundreds of people have been arrested, with warnings there will be many more to come. On Sunday Sir Keir Starmer used a public address to say he wanted those who \"feel targeted because of the colour of their skin\" to know \"this violent mob do not represent our country\". In a message to rioters, he said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.\" His law and order response to the violence should not surprise anyone. More than 10 years ago, Sir Keir was a key part of the justice system dealing with the 2011 riots - one of the most serious episodes of civil unrest the country has witnessed in recent times. How might that influence what happens next? We'll take a look, after the headlines.\n\nToday's news, and why it matters\n\nThe former health minister who ran a Government review into social care in the UK says Labour have been \"misguided\" to scrap plans to reform the sector. Lord Norman Warner, a crossbench peer who served as a Minister in the Department for Health under Tony Blair and sat on the 2011 Dilnot Review, said the system would remain \"unfair and unfixed\" as long as the problem was not tackled.\n\nBritons have lost more than \u00a3450m to pyramid and Ponzi schemes over the last three years, i can reveal. Police have seen a 27 per cent rise in this type of investment fraud in the past year, according to data revealed in a freedom of information (FOI) request.\n\nCovid cases are close to their highest level for more than a year after numbers started rising again in the last week, new figures indicate. Scientists are warning, however, that they are likely to go even higher in late summer and early Autumn as people return from the Olympics and the school year resumes.\n\nMore was done tackle river pollution by the Conservative government than they get credit for, an ex-environment minister has said. Former MP Rebecca Pow - who lost her Somerset seat to the Lib Dems - said Tories should have pushed their environmental credentials more in the election, including on monitoring river pollution.\n\nPolice are investigating an alleged death threat sent to actress Amanda Abbington over a complaint she made about her Strictly Come Dancing partner Giovanni Pernice. Abbington made a formal complaint about Pernice's teaching methods after she left the BBC One show in October.\n\nThree questions over the riots:\n\nWhat lessons could be learnt from 2011? Many will remember the tough sentences handed out in relation to the summer riots some 13 years ago. They included a four-year jail sentence for two men who used Facebook to incite disorder, another who was handed six months in prison for stealing \u00a33.50 worth of water, and a man who was given 18 months for possessing a stolen TV in his car. One lawyer who said he represented clients during the riots said the system was \"brutal\". \"Bail refused prior to court. People remanded in custody however minor their involvement pending trial at the Crown Court for heavier sentencing.\" At the time, Sir Keir Starmer was the director of public prosecutions (DPP), the most senior public prosecutor in England and Wales and the head of the Crown Prosecution Service. He has said that the key to the response then was not the length of the sentences, but how swiftly people were brought to justice. In 2012 he said: \"For me it was the speed [of processing cases] that I think may have played some small part in bringing the situation back under control. I don't think they [rioters] would have thought: 'Oh well, am I going to get 12 months or 18 months?' I don't think people gamble on the length of sentence, particularly. They gamble on: 'Am I going to get caught? Am I going to get sentenced and sent to prison?' And if the answer is: 'I'm now watching on the television some other people who had been caught 24 hours or 48 hours after they were on the streets with us' - I think that's a very powerful message.\" Keeping courts open 24 hours a day was one way this was achieved at the time, and appears to be a serious consideration again. Speaking to Sky News, policing minister Dame Diana Johnson said: \"I know that you'll recognise that the Prime Minister was the Director of Public Prosecutions in 2011 when we had similar issues, and the courts at that stage did sit through the night. So I think the PM is very well versed alongside the Lord Chancellor, in terms of what's needed.\"\n\nWhat has Sir Keir and other authorities said they will do? The PM has told rioters they will face the \"full force of the law\". He said: \"Be in no doubt: those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law. The police will be making arrests. Individuals will be held on remand. Charges will follow. And convictions will follow. I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder.\" His message was also reiterated by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who, in a piece for the Times, warned there would be a \"reckoning\" not just for those who took part but also for those who \"whipped them up on social media and online chat forums\". She said police would be examining video recordings to identify all of those who vandalised and attacked buildings, cars and people, and that police had the government's backing to take the \"strongest possible action\". Sir Keir also announced emergency security for mosques that can be rapidly deployed if they feel under threat. Various police forces have also issued stern messages to those involved in the violence. After acts of \"despicable thuggery\" outside a hotel believed to be housing asylum seekers in Tamworth, Staffordshire police's Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Ellison said they would \"be using footage from CCTV, air support and our officers' body-worn video devices to identify those responsible and seek the toughest possible punishment for these acts of senseless violence.\"\n\nWhat else should the PM be doing? One of the big driving factors behind these riots has been the explosion of misinformation online, and some observers believe the government should have been quicker to act. One of those is former Brexit minister David Davis, who said: \"Remember, the riots started with a lie, or three lies...I don't have that many criticisms of the Government or the police on this to be honest. But what I would say is, perhaps they should have been faster to crush all that misinformation.\" Ian Birrell suggests more robust laws as well as progressive education within schools is needed. He writes: \"Politicians must act, whether alone in Britain or with allies. They passed a flawed law to protect online safety for children in 2023. Now they should impose tough financial penalties backed by criminal sanctions on executives for any platform that does not tackle the sewage seeping out from social media. This is not about censoring controversial views or reports. We need to find legal ways to protect citizens and society, just as broadcasters and publishers are subjected to some restrictions for the wider well-being. The final issue is to focus remorselessly on restoration of faith in politics. One idea is to import Finland's smart idea of embedding critical thinking in schools to equip future generations with the tools to challenge misinformation.\" Read his full piece here. Others say that Sir Keir needs to address some of the thornier issues behind the riots. The Guardian's Rowena Mason suggests \"there may come a time soon when he needs to more strongly confront the anti-migrant rhetoric that lies behind the violence as well, whether it comes from protesters or politicians.\" Sky's Adam Boulton writes that the PM's message that only \"a tiny mindless minority\" and \"gang of thugs\" are behind the violence \"may be true but it avoids confronting deeper issues in our society.\" He says: \"The slogan 'enough is enough' about immigration is shared by peaceful protesters and 'thugs' alike and it resonates more widely than those present at the violence - including swing voters in places like Southport who voted Labour for the first time this year.\" It's a point also made by Professor Stephen Reicher, author of Mad Mobs and Englishmen and expert on riots, who told i: \"However pernicious the thugs might be, they're not mindless, they have very specific targets in mind. They are clearly being led by ideology but there is another group of people being brought along too. They may not agree with everything the far right stands for, but they share a sense of alienation from 'the establishment' and from the police who, in their everyday experience, represent the face of authority. The challenge for politicians is not just to condemn them, it's to work to regain the trust of a generation who feel let down by politics.\" Read the full piece, here.\n\nAround the world\n\nThe UK has \"temporarily withdrawn\" the families of embassy officials from Lebanon amid concerns that the killings of leading Hamas and Hezbollah leaders last week could spark fresh conflict in the region. British citizens living in Lebanon have already been advised to leave the country, with David Lammy warning on Saturday that \"tensions are high, and the situation could deteriorate rapidly\".\n\nThe world's hope for avoiding all-out war in the Middle East hangs in the balance as Iran weighs how to respond to an alleged Israeli covert operation that killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.

In a televised address, Starmer vowed to take swift and decisive action against those responsible for the violence.\n\nThe riots, which erupted in response to the murder of three young girls in northwest England, were fueled by false information spread on social media claiming the suspect was a radical Muslim migrant. However, police have confirmed that the suspect, 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, was born in Britain.\n\nStarmer was unequivocal in his condemnation, stating, \"This is not protest. It is organised, violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets or online.\" He promised that those involved in the violence would face the full force of the law, with arrests, charges, and convictions to follow.\n\nThe Prime Minister also emphasized that the attacks on Muslim communities, mosques, and other minority groups were unacceptable, saying, \"People in this country have a right to be safe... I won't shy away from calling it what it is. Far-right thuggery.\"\n\nStarmer pledged to take swift action, drawing parallels with the 2011 riots, where swift judicial action was taken against perpetrators. He assured the public that the government would do whatever it takes to ensure that those involved in the violence regret their actions and are brought to justice as quickly as possible.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority group"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/08/04/1459167-uk-pm.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789876", "eventUri": "eng-9789876", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

It's only today that Cobra is going to sit.\"\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage called for Parliament to be recalled this morning.\n\nPosting on X, Farage added: \"We should not discount the use of the army if the situation were to deteriorate further.\"\n\nViolent clashes broke out in dozens of UK towns and cities last week and continued over the weekend.\n\nThey have been fuelled by online lies following the murders of three girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nPosts wrongly claimed suspect Axel Rudakubana was a Muslim asylum seeker.\n\nRudakubana, 17, was actually born in Cardiff and raised as a Christian.\n\nTerrifying violence followed the attack in Southport, before unrest spread to Hartlepool and Manchester on Wednesday.\n\nRiots then broke out in Sunderland and Blackpool on Friday - and in 11 more cities on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAt Middlesbrough's Cenotaph, hundreds of protesters squared up to police before throwing slate, cans and pots at the officers.\n\nA group of masked yobs walked through a residential suburb of the city.\n\nThey used metal bars and wooden posts to smash car windscreens and the windows of terraced houses.\n\nVehicles were torched, along with wheelie bins.\n\nMeanwhile, in Weymouth cops were tasked with keeping protesters and counter-protesters separate along the beach.\n\nCops confirmed two officers were injured, one hit in the face with a bottle while the other was punched.\n\nAnother migrant hotel in the Hampshire town of Aldershot was also targeted.\n\nA group of men outside Potters International Hotel brandished a banner insisting: \"We're not far right, we're just right.\"\n\nBy 6.45pm a crowd of some 200 \"got involved in criminal activity, throwing objects and subjecting people to racist abuse,\" according to Hampshire Police.\n\nIn the centre of Bolton, large crowds of anti-immigration demonstrators gathered along with \u00adcounter-protesters while police tried to keep them apart.\n\nTrouble also flared in Belfast, Blackpool, Stoke, Leeds, Hull, Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Bristol and Portsmouth.\n\nSnaps show the devastation which rioters have left behind in many towns this morning.\n\nOne photo shows a torched

Christopher Furlong/Getty Images Europe .\n\n. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images Europe\n\nIn the past few days, Britain has seen widespread riots led by hundreds of far-right protesters.\n\nThe violent protests began Tuesday night after a knife attack that left three young girls dead and several others injured during a children's dance and yoga class in northwest England.\n\nThe attack sparked Islamophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment in Britain, leading to hundreds of arrests, dozens of police injuries and damage to several buildings, including a mosque and a hotel believed to be housing refugees.\n\nThe riots entered their sixth day on Sunday and show no sign of abating. Here's what you need to know.\n\nWhat sparked the riots\n\nThe riots followed a stabbing incident during a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga class in Southport, England, on July 29.\n\nThree girls, Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, were killed and 10 people, including eight children and two adults, were injured. Police arrested a 17-year-old male at the scene but did not initially release his name because the suspect is under 18.\n\nWe can confirm the names of the three girls who were tragically murdered in Southport on Monday (July 29).\n\nThey are Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9.\n\nFor more information, visit here: https://t.co/CZ3hIM7ycn pic.twitter.com/Xz8ea1LglU\n\n-- Merseyside Police (@MerseyPolice) July 30, 2024\n\nThen false rumours began to spread online, claiming that an asylum seeker was behind the attack (the suspect, officially identified by police on Thursday as Axel Rudakubana, was born in Wales).\n\nOn Tuesday night, a mob stormed the streets of Southport and targeted a local mosque. The Southport mosque said in a statement that congregants were trapped inside the building while throwing petrol bombs and bricks at it. According to Merseyside Police, 53 police officers were injured in clashes with protesters.\n\nWhich towns and cities were affected?\n\nProtests took place across Britain beyond Southport, in Manchester, Hartlepool, Liverpool, Bristol, London and the Northern Ireland capital Belfast for several days.\n\nOn Sunday, a mob of about 700 surrounded the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, which is known to be housing refugees. Windows were smashed and burning bins were thrown into the building, according to South Yorkshire Police.\n\nRioters threw bricks, bottles and planks at police and sprayed them with fire extinguishers during the riots in Rotherham, according to local police. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images Europe .\n\n. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images Europe\n\nThe Irish Times reported that a cafe, a supermarket and several vehicles were set on fire in Belfast following protests on Saturday night.\n\nThe supermarket manager told the newspaper that people had attacked the place and that there had been racism against Islam and Muslims, particularly the Muslim community.\n\nA total of 111 people were arrested on Wednesday night in Whitehall near Downing Street. Five officers were injured when bottles and other objects were thrown at them, and some were physically attacked, according to the Metropolitan Police.\n\nProtesters hold a banner reading \"Enough is enough - stop the boats\" during a demonstration near the entrance to 10 Downing Street in Whitehall on July 31. Benjamin Cremel/AFP via Getty Images .\n\nCaption toggle Benjamin Cremel/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHow Britain is responding to the protests\n\nOn Sunday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the riots \"far-right violence\" and added that they would not be tolerated.\n\n\"This is not a protest,\" Starmer said on X. \"It's organised, it's violent, it's abusive and it has no place on our streets or online.\"\n\nBritain's Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said police had \"full support\" for the rioters in X, including jail terms and travel bans.\n\nDespite the chaos, examples of solidarity and generosity emerged across Britain.\n\nIn Southport, where the riots began, Merseyside police said residents were cleaning the streets and handing out free food the day after the protest.\n\nLocal residents offer food and snacks to police officers as they stand in line during a demonstration by far-right activists in Middlesbrough, England, on Sunday. Ian Forsyth/Getty Images Europe .\n\n. Ian Forsyth/Getty Images Europe\n\nAnd last week, several landmarks across the UK, including Downing Street, were lit in pink to show continued support for the families and the Southport community following the stabbing.\n\nWe stand in solidarity with Southport.\n\nTonight, Downing Street will be lit in pink as a sign of respect and solidarity for all those affected by the tragic events that occurred earlier this week. #SouthportTogether pic.twitter.com/eaAbv4RzLG\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType":

It remained unclear whether asylum seekers were still staying at the hotel and no guests were injured in the melee, police said.\n\nIn Middlesbrough, a group of rioters, some masked, hurled bottles and rocks at officers. Cars were set on fire, and at least nine people were arrested. On Saturday, a library and a food bank were set alight in Liverpool as groups damaged and looted businesses, and in Hull, fires were set and storefronts smashed in the city center.\n\nNearly 150 people were arrested over the weekend, national police representatives said, and dozens of police suffered injuries, including some that required trips to the hospital.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunderland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunderland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunderland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldershot", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aldershot"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aldershot"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston_upon_Hull", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kingston upon Hull"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingston upon Hull"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesbrough", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middlesbrough"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Middlesbrough"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/05/multimedia/05ukprotests-wwk-lzpq/05ukprotests-wwk-lzpq-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789876", "eventUri": "eng-9789876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

at police at Rotherham hotel\n\nA counter-demonstration by anti-racists had earlier drawn around 100 people, but after a short time they were ushered away by a police escort for their own safety after they were surrounded.\n\nThe BBC's Cathy Killick, who was at the scene, said that the atmosphere was \"hostile\".\n\nShe said that the two groups had been kept apart by a police line, before the anti-racist protesters were moved a \"safe distance away\" when they became outnumbered and surrounded.\n\nGuests staying in the hotel were seen looking out of their windows at the demos below and appeared \"bemused\".\n\nLater, riot officers wearing helmets lined up between the hotel and the crowd, as objects were thrown at the hotel windows, with some shattering as a result.\n\nA police van was rocked by the protesters, who were heard chanting \"Get them out\" and \"Yorkshire\".\n\nProtesters then cheered as hotel windows were shattered, as the crowd moved from one side to another.\n\nA spokesperson for IHG, which owns the Holiday Inn Express brand, said: \"The safety and security of our guests and colleagues is always our priority.\n\n\"Any further questions should be directed to the Home Office.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Sheffield, anti-racist protesters heavily outnumbered rival demonstrators as crowds gathered peacefully in the city centre.\n\nPeople were heard chanting 'Nazi scum off our streets' and 'Refugees are welcome here'.\n\nThe scenes followed violence erupting across the UK on Saturday, which resulted in more than 100 people being arrested.\n\nTrouble flared at

They have been chanting \"Yorkshire, Yorkshire\" at the 100-strong line of police officers holding them back.\n\nThey had earlier rammed several big blazing bins up against a fire exit at the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham. Police had to use their own small extinguishers to control but it raged for a terrifying half an hour untouched as guests looked on from above.\n\nA generator, patches of grass outside and several bins full of cardboard were set alight. Balaclava and masked men at one stage lay flat on the road to stop a fire engine - which they'd just chased away - returning.\n\nHave protests broken out in your area? Get in touch at webnews@reachplc.com\n\nAs I move away and take a look at the damage caused to the hotel, two men appear at a window above and as I show my Mirror ID to them they make a heart with their hands.\n\nBeneath them are upturned melted plastic bins, a charred fence panel and wood piled against the fire exit. In the distance those protesting chant for \"Tommy Robinson\". Nearby an Enoch Powell poster had been abandoned.\n\nAs I return to the riot front line, I show the police officer my ID and he tells me: '\"We need more numbers.\" It's the second riot I've attended in a week after witnessing the disorder in Southport and both times police have told me how they are struggling to keep control.\n\nBut locals watching the drama unfold are sympathetic to those rioting. They told me of their anger about the hotel guests - mainly men - who \"came on the boats\" and who've been housed in the middle of a residential estate. They claimed women were scared to walk around the local lake.\n\nOne banner left behind by rioters pushed back away from the hotel spoke of Enoch Powell and another said \"Save our kids\".\n\nBut the most heartbreaking sight of all was the little blonde girl - who looked no more than six, watching it all. She was standing with her mum just a few feet away from all the officers with their shields. She was wearing a full England kit.

Something the Prime Minister also denied as he insisted policing was \"without fear or favour\".\n\nThe most senior police officer in the country, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley, appeared to grab a reporter's microphone and throw it on the ground when he was asked about two-tier policing as he left the Cobra meeting. Asked about the incident, the force said he was \"in a hurry\".\n\nAmong the latest scenes of widespread and continued disorder, which broke out in the wake of a knife attack last week which left three girls dead, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham at the weekend before starting fires.\n\nMasked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles with some spraying fire extinguishers at police officers amid the 700-strong crowd.\n\nAt least 10 officers were injured, with one knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police said. One arrest had already been made and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\", the force warned.\n\nOn Sunday evening, a similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth, Staffordshire, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed, in a scene which saw fires, smashed windows and missiles being thrown at officers, Staffordshire Police said.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, a group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\"\n\nThere were 43 arrests, with crown court and university buildings sustaining significant damage, Cleveland Police said.\n\nMeanwhile, Greater Manchester Police used powers amid disturbances in Bolton to order people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nThe unrest has prompted some MPs to demand Parliament is recalled so the problems can be debated in the Commons, as it was during the 2011 riots.\n\nThe Board of Deputies of British Jews called for a \"national conversation\" on promoting respect for the country and each other, as it condemned the \"lawlessness and thuggery\".", "source": {"uri": "dailyecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Southern Daily Echo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

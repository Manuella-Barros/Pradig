The Staggies came through a second successive play-off to secure top-flight football for the 12th season out of the last 13. With Dundee United returning to the Premiership, and last season\u2019s underachievers Aberdeen and Hibernian under new management, Ferguson expects the league to be as difficult as ever. While taking pride in the Staggies\u2019 long-lasting stay in the top-flight, he says keeping the Dingwall outfit competing among Scotland\u2019s elite is getting harder. Ferguson said: \u201cWith every football club, no matter what league they are in and where they are in their history, there are always real challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to the football club, the chairman, and to how we have done things over 12 of the last 13 years in the Premiership, that we are still fighting in there. \u201cFor us to continue to sustain that is really difficult. \u201cI found last year an exceptionally tough year, both on and off the pitch. To be honest, I\u2019m not expecting anything different this year. \u201cPlaying top-flight football in Scotland for Ross County has always been a massive challenge. \u201cI just feel that is getting harder. The gap between city clubs and community clubs is getting bigger. \u201cWe envisage a real challenge both on and off the pitch.\u201d Staggies aiming to strike balance The Staggies have released their season ticket package ahead of the new campaign, with the early bird period ending on Monday. Prices have been increased by 10%, however Ferguson says club costs have risen by nearly 30% during the same period. Ferguson says the Staggies are trying to strike a balancing act between providing good value for supporters, while also remaining as competitive as possible in the Premiership. He added: \u201cThe landscape around how supporters engage on matchdays has definitely changed since Covid. We try to work with our supporters, regarding keeping costs as low as possible. \u201cI think we are probably one of the cheapest options for a season ticket to watch Premiership football in Scotland. \u201cWe continually try and keep our retail prices as low as we can, in terms of strips and leisurewear. \u201cWith the financial challenges, as well as challenges on the pitch, that becomes harder. \u201cWe are striving to keep not only playing in the Premiership, but to compete in the Premiership. \u201cHow does Ross County become sustainable, if the bar keeps getting raised on criteria? \u201cWe want the best possible experience for our supporters \u2013 but it needs to be affordable, both for the supporter and the club. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are striving to try and get \u2013 and to try and compete at this level.\u201d Ferguson has sympathy for neighbours Caley Thistle County\u2019s neighbours Caley Thistle face the possibility of administration in the coming days \u2013 if they fail to secure fresh investment. Inverness scrapped a highly-controversial plan to relocate their training base to Kelty, as they looked to make it easier to sign players following their relegation to League One. Ferguson says County face the same geographical challenges, which puts a strain on the Staggies\u2019 playing budget. He added: \u201cThe situation around Inverness has been well documented and we have the same challenges. \u201cI feel for Inverness, and the city, because we all want to have our teams competing at the highest level we can. \u201cThe reality is, for that to happen it costs a hell of a lot of money. \u201cThe investment and input into the infrastructure, before you even get on to the pitch, is pretty seismic. \u201cWe are the same in where we are geographically. Recruiting players and moving them to the area are all costs that Central Belt clubs don\u2019t have the challenge of. \u201cThe travel element is exactly the same for us as it is Inverness. We spend more time on a bus than any other club in the Premiership. Including our academy, we can have four buses on the road every week. \u201cWe spend more time overnight in hotels than any other team in the Premiership. \u201cWe understand that, and realise that if we want to compete in the Premiership, they are challenges we need embrace and find a best practice solution.\u201d", "summary": "County are approaching their 12th season in the top-flight out of the last 13 years.", "url": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/sport/football/ross-county/6494721/steven-ferguson-on-ross-county-challenge-in-sustaining-premiership-football/", "image": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/21074506_57971498-3i3liuyre-e1717770658727.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:13:33", "author": "Andy Skinner", "authors": ["Andy Skinner"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.104}

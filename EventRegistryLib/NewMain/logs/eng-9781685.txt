However, it is not clear whether it is a teaser, trailer, or release date. Citadel: Honey Bunny will be released on Prime Video.\n\nSpeaking of being a part of the series, Samantha said, \"I never would have imagined that I would do action. But today, for me, being at this event is already such a victory for me, because the last moment I didn't really think I could do it. I didn't think I would be a part of citadel. I'm extremely grateful to Raj, DK, Sita and Amazon for really coming to my rescue. I just had to prep physically. I am just so incredibly proud already that this is the way it is, this is the way it looks. I can't believe - this is how it looks.\" Karan Johar then said, \"Both you and Varun have literally owned it.\"\n\nHoney Bunny is the Indian series within the Citadel universe. Prime Video India dropped the trailer at a grand event last month and also released a short clip as part of a montage of all the titles. In the clip, Varun and Samantha engage in intense action sequences. In one scene, Samantha is seen holding two pistols, preparing for combat with two opponents. She also appears in a fight sequence alongside Varun.\n\nVarun Dhawan is one of the busiest actors in the industry currently. He has been shooting for multiple films including John Baby.

And now in a fresh update, Varun Dhawan and Mrunal Thakur have completed the first schedule of shooting.\n\nPinkvilla quoted a source close to the development saying that the first shooting schedule of the upcoming David Dhawan caper with Varun Dhawan and Mrunal Thakur has wrapped in Mumbai.

Reflecting on those times she shared, \"There were moments when we South actors couldn't source garments because designers would dismiss us questioning 'Who are you? A South actor?'\"\n\nThis statement has clearly explained the bias within the fashion industry that has historically favored Bollywood over regional cinema. The South Indian film industry despite its massive following and talented actors wasn't always given the recognition it deserved in the fashion world. However, from being overlooked by designers to becoming trendsetters, actors like Samantha have played a crucial role in this transformation.\n\nSamantha's career continues to flourish as she has lot of projects in pipeline. She was last seen in the Telugu romantic comedy Khushi with Vijay Deverakonda. Her next major appearance will be alongside Bollywood star Varun Dhawan in the web series Citadel: Honey Bunny. This series is an Indian adaptation of the Russo brothers' Citadel that stars Priyanka Chopra and Richard Madden.\n\nCitadel: Honey Bunny features a stellar cast including Emma Canning, Sikandar Kher and Saqib Saleem. Directed by Raj & DK, this spy action thriller will premiere on Amazon Prime Video this year. Samantha recently teased her fans with quirky pictures on Instagram, hinting at updates about the series.\n\nAdditionally Samantha will make her debut as a producer with the film Maa inti Bangaram, which she announced on her 37th birthday.

At this release event, Varun recalled that he was required to punch Samatha on the first day of their shoot.\n\nVarun said that after he was told by the director duo Raj and DK to punch Samantha, \"Samantha's like, 'Hit me, hit me.' So there's a lot of hitting also going on for various reasons. It's a violent love story.\" Citadel not only marks Varun Dhawan's web-series' debut but also his first collaboration with Samantha.\n\nVarun praised Samantha's determination in the face of illness and said that his preparation for the action-packed series was easier than what the actress had to endure. Varun Dhawan expressed, \"Honestly, my preparation was very easy compared to Samantha's. It's public knowledge what she was battling when she joined the show. I thought my rehearsals were tough, but then I saw her incredible work ethic despite her struggles, and it truly inspired me. We became partners in making things happen.\"\n\nHe added, \"I've never been on a shoot or a creative process like that before, where I witnessed a co-actor going through such challenges. You learn a lot about human resilience and strength when you see someone battling something and still succeeding. Samantha inspired not just me, but also Raj, DK, Sita, and everyone at Amazon. Her dedication to this action show is truly inspirational.\"\n\nFor the unversed, Samantha Ruth Prabhu revealed in 2022 that she had been diagnosed with an autoimmune condition called Myositis. The actress then took a break from films so that she could focus on her health. Talking about working with Varun for the first time, Samantha said, \"It was a partnership, like when we'd do action, it really felt like a dance. It felt like, you know, we discussed this, action felt like romantic song because there was just so much sync... It's the both of us with a cameraman and everyone has to be in absolute sync. So I've never felt that kind of chemistry with anyone and I believe it shows because that action sequence is truly special, if I should say so myself, but just making it was absolutely beautiful.\"\n\nHoney Bunny is the Indian series within the Citadel universe, originally headlined by Priyanka Chopra and Richard Madden. The show was announced at Prime Video's special event earlier this year. Besides Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Varun Dhawan, the series also features Kay Kay Menon, Simran, Soham Majumdar, Shivankit Singh Parihar, Kashvi Majumdar, Saquib Saleem, and Sikandar Kher in pivotal roles.

The actress, known for her striking presence and impeccable style, looked stunning in a chic black top paired with grey trousers and stylish sunglasses. Her wavy locks added a touch of elegance to her look, which effortlessly combined casual comfort with style.\n\nSamantha's appearance in Mumbai is ahead of the much-anticipated event for Citadel: Honey Bunny, an upcoming Indian spy action thriller TV series. The show, a spin-off of the popular American series Citadel, is created by the talented duo Raj & DK and promises to be a gripping watch. Alongside Samantha, the series stars Varun Dhawan, Sikandar Kher, Kay Kay Menon, Saqib Saleem, and Emma Canning, and has already generated significant buzz in the industry.\n\nHowever, this cheerful appearance comes in the midst of a controversy involving Samantha and a well-known medical professional, The Liver Doc. The spat began when The Liver Doc criticised Samantha for promoting hydrogen peroxide nebulization as a remedy for viral infections. The doctor labeled the recommendation as \"dangerous\" and \"irresponsible,\" igniting a heated debate on social media. The exchange has sparked a broader conversation about the responsibilities of celebrities when endorsing health-related information. Despite the ongoing controversy, Samantha seemed unfazed as she made her way through the city, maintaining her poise and charm.\n\nFollowing the criticism, Samantha discussed supplements with David Jockers, a doctor of natural medicine and an author, but included a disclaimer in her post this time, a contrast to her previous episodes featuring wellness coaches and functional nutritionists.

We became partners in making things happen.\"\n\n\"I've never been on a shoot or a creative process like that before, where I witnessed a co-actor going through such challenges.

Appointed to the top position in 2014 and having been with the business - formerly known as the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) - since its inception in 1984, Duthie is credited with playing an integral part in all aspects of its evolution. He has been a member of the senior management team since 1991 and will step down at the end of June. During his tenure as chief executive, the SEC has hosted events such as the Commonwealth Games and COP26, while the Ovo Hydro has become one of the top live entertainment arenas in the world, hosting the likes of Elton John, Roger Waters and the Pet Shop Boys, who are due to play there next week.

Duthie was appointed chair of Scotland\u2019s Event Industry Advisory Group (EIAG) to help the industry, as well as the SEC, negotiate the pandemic. Duthie, who last year was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Strathclyde in recognition of his contribution to culture, business and society. said: \u201cIt has been a privilege to be part of the SEC\u2019s journey and to have been involved in the development of all sectors of our business.

He has played an important role in ensuring that the SEC has a global reputation for event delivery and he has been a great ambassador for the business and for Glasgow.\u201d The campus includes the 14,200-capacity Ovo Hydro and the SEC Armadillo, both designed by world-renowned architects Foster + Partners.

Go ahead and Subscribe here.\n\nPrincess Cruises revealed on May 7 that the Grand Princess will no longer operate in Australian waters starting October 2025. Instead, the vessel will be homeported in San Juan, Puerto Rico, marking a significant shift in deployment strategy.\n\nGrand Princess' exit from Australia will result in the cancellation of its 2025-2026 scheduled voyages there, with the redeployment commencing on October 12, 2025.\n\n\"We constantly review and revise our deployments as part of our ongoing product strategy,\" Princess Cruises said in an official statement. \"As a result, we have made some changes to our 2025/2026 itineraries and will be redeploying Grand Princess from her planned Australia summer season to San Juan, Puerto Rico, starting 12 October 2025 and running through 29 March 2026.\"\n\nThe move aims to align Grand Princess with new market opportunities in the Caribbean.\n\nThe redeployment of the 2,610-passenger Grand Princess has led to the cancellation of several scheduled voyages in Australia. This includes a 2-night \"seacation\" from Sydney to Brisbane on October 16, 2025, as well as a number of Tasmania, Queensland, and New Zealand voyages through March 2026.\n\nIn response, Princess Cruises has arranged for affected passengers to be rebooked on alternative voyages aboard Crown Princess and Discovery Princess, which will now serve the Australian region with both amended and new voyages.\n\nGuests affected by these changes will be automatically rebooked, receiving any adjustments to their fare to match what they originally paid, and any higher fare difference will be covered by the cruise line in an expression of goodwill for the inconvenience.\n\n\"We are pleased to automatically rebook you on a replacement voyage that offers a similar itinerary,\" said the cruise line, noting full details and booking confirmation would be delivered to passengers by May 31 via email.\n\nDiscovery Princess, which holds 3,660 passengers, is currently not scheduled to sail in Australia in October, December, or January 2025 and is traveling between Australia and Asia in November. Its first Australian cruise launches from Sydney on February 28, 2026. In March, Discovery Princess is also slated to provide a seacation and Queensland voyage.\n\nRead Also: How to Make the Most of Your Cruise Without Overspending\n\nConversely, the 3,090-passenger Crown Princess is not scheduled in Australian waters until December 2025, when it launches on a Southern Australia voyage. Departing from Fremantle, Australia, on December 10, the ship is slated to call in Margaret River, Albany, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Hobart before arriving in Sydney. From there, Crown Princess will begin offering various cruise lengths between Sydney and Brisbane.\n\nThe cruise line, however, may change Crown Princess and Discovery Princess cruises to accommodate itinerary changes caused by the cancelation of Grand Princess. In its statement, it hinted additional cancellations would arise on both ships.\n\nBesides the automatic rebookings, pre-booked shore excursions, spa, and dining reservations are also automatically canceled, with costs refunded back to passengers via the original form of payment.\n\nFor passengers on the 37-night Tahiti, Hawaii, and South Pacific cruise originally scheduled to depart from Sydney on October 16 and Brisbane on October 18, 2025, $250 additional onboard credit is being offered. To receive the compensation, passengers must rebook onto the 28-night Round Australia cruise from Sydney on November 23, 2024, or a similar 25-night voyage from Brisbane on November 26, 2025.\n\nGuests on the 11-night Fiji holiday from Brisbane on December 24, 2025, will receive $200 EZair credit per person toward flights if rebooked on the 14-day sailing from Sydney on December 21, or a 3-night seacation on March 18, 2026.", "source": {"uri": "cruisehive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cruise Hive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lissa_poirot@cruisehive.com", "name": "Lissa Poirot",

Perhaps you think of long lines at the buffet and loop-de-loop water slides that never seem to end on the lido deck. For some, this image isn't relaxing, but not all ships are created equal.\n\nThe lovely Discovery Princess, the second newest cruise ship among Princess Cruises' fleet, is one of the most elegant I've voyaged on -- and I've been on 10+ cruises (read: best cruises I reviewed). So, you can say I've become quite the cruise critic over the years.\n\nWhile each cruise ship has something unique to offer, I can honestly say my experience setting sail on the Discovery Princess was my favorite cruise yet.\n\nRELATED: Princess unveils its new Sun Princess ship\n\nAs part of the itinerary's Pacific Wine Country Tour for an April 2024 sailing, I embarked from the Los Angeles port in San Pedro, CA and then traveled to San Diego; San Francisco; Astoria, OR; and Victoria and Vancouver, Canada. The best part was experiencing Napa Valley and Sonoma Valley on one of Princess Cruises' excursions, but more on that later.\n\nTo assemble an in-depth review of my experience, I divided this piece into a few sections: who it's good for, activities and entertainment, food and drink options, excursions and special features. Consider this your all-in-one guide. After all, I did plenty of research myself -- a discovery, if you will -- via YouTube videos, Discovery Princess Facebook groups and by way of the easy-to-use Princess app. Not to mention, since I've cruised on other lines, including Carnival, Celebrity, NCL and Royal Caribbean, you'll find some comparison notes as well.\n\nEven better, this cruise vacation was with my high school best friend, Veronica, who has never been aboard a cruise ship. It was such a unique experience seeing all that Discovery Princess had to offer with her first-time perspective, which is infused within this review as well.\n\nMost cruise lines are designed for whatever you'd like your vacation to be, whether it's solo travel, couples traveling, a best friend cruise (I'm representing this demographic here) and family trips. Aboard Discovery Princess, I even saw a 20+ family reunion. The possibilities are endless, and some sailings may yield older or younger demographics depending on the itinerary, length of the cruise and other factors.\n\nVeronica and I are both in our early 20s, and we found the Discovery Princess to cater to an older crowd, as we saw many middle- and senior-aged couples. However, we scouted a handful of young adult couples, just not nearly as many as you'd find on more \"family-friendly\" cruise lines, like Carnival and Royal Caribbean.\n\nHowever, this isn't a dealbreaker in the slightest. A cruise is what you make of it, and we enjoyed trying top-of-the-line specialty restaurants, heading to Broadway-production-style shows, booking excursions for each port we docked at and relaxing in the Lotus Spa, the latter being a true R&R highlight. Pro tip: pick up a Miami Vice or your favorite cocktail at one of Discovery's bars before heading to The Enclave, the spa's modern, state-of-the-art relaxation centers with a jet pool, two different sauna rooms and heated lounge chairs. You definitely won't be sorry.\n\nBecause Discovery Princess was my first trip with Princess Cruises, I can't speak if the slightly older clientele is characteristic of the cruise line at large or this specific itinerary. Granted, it was a wine-centric itinerary at the end of April, so I wasn't expecting to see many passengers younger than 21-years-old on each deck. Additionally, we didn't sail in peak summertime months when school's out and more family vacations may take place.\n\nWhile I certainly remember way more families aboard other cruise lines, that's not to say Princess isn't family-friendly. There's a variety of entertainment options, which you'll find on the stateroom patter (otherwise known as a printed itinerary) each evening, placed at the foot of your bed by a stateroom attendant. Or, you can follow along on the Princess app.\n\nOne of the highlights from the Discovery Princess ship is, without question, the activities and entertainment that I'd say is world-class. I grew up going to theaters, Broadway shows and local productions and it was clear as day that the variety of shows featured well-versed actors, performers, dancers, singers and a legitimate crew to put together the lighting, choreography and the entire setup from start to finish.\n\nIf heading to shows isn't entirely your thing, that's OK, too; Discovery Princess had a multitude of game shows, comedians, dance and deck parties (sometimes, dance parties on the deck), trivia and more. Below, I ran through some of the activities and entertainment options Veronica and I experienced during our April 2024 sailing:\n\nOne of the most memorable experiences aboard Discovery Princess was heading to the Production Shows during the eight-day cruise. Show times and type may vary depending on the sailing, though you can expect two Production-level shows. These mimic the vibe exuded on Broadway.\n\nAboard Discovery, I went to the \"Spotlight Bar\" show, where the full cast sang radio, sing-along hits in front of a bar scene. The group dances and individual ballads were nothing short of phenomenal. As much as I loved watching the first Production-level show, I adored the \"Rock Opera\" show, a fusion of 80s rock with opera-style performances. Think: \"The Greatest Showman\" meets Cyndi Lauper. The costumes, set and overall segue from song to song was unparalleled; I didn't want it to end.\n\nAdditionally, Princess Cruises has two show times for its Production-level shows: one at 7:30 p.m. and another at 9:30 p.m. This works out well, that way you have options to work around your dinner reservations or late-night activities, like the after-hours comedian or DJ.\n\nAside from Production Shows at Princess Theater, there were two to three other shows performed by soloists Willis White and Nick Petris who paid homage to music icons Lionel Richie and Michael Bubl\u00e9, respectively. Both were excellent and entertaining. Princess Theater also hosted a magician one night, though we didn't attend.\n\nAnother sit-back-and-relax moment aboard Discovery was the schedule of game shows from the first to last evening on the cruise. Sometimes, game shows can be corny, but the Princess crew truly knew how to entertain.\n\nVeronica and I attended a few, including \"Top, Middle or Bottom\" where passengers took turns selecting Jeopardy-style tiles and either passing through to the next column (a checkmark), receiving one of three X-es (a firecracker symbol) or a trivia question (a question mark). It was a pretty suspenseful guessing game and one that kept us pretty entertained.\n\nAnother game show we attended one evening was called \"Majority Rules,\" where we'd answer somewhat controversial questions like, \"Who's the best female singer?\" or \"What's the greatest film of all time?\" As the name suggests, the majority rules, and each \"team\" tallies up their points to crown the ultimate victor.\n\nThe vibe of the game shows was the perfect after-dinner activity. Many cruisers sat in armchairs with a drink in hand, just relaxing and enjoying the atmosphere. The best part? Most game shows were hosted by the cruise director. Kristoff, if you're reading this, we love you.\n\nFor fans of stand-up comedy, Discovery hosted quite a few comedy shows, divided among three comedians on my particular sailing. These shows were hosted at Vista Lounge, a sophisticated and snazzy venue space, though the backdrop transforms into a brick-style background with a neon \"Laugh Lounge\" sign in cursive, apropos of the crew's production team.\n\nSome comedians starred on Comedy Central and popular Late Night shows and had us laughing to no end. Whether it's your first cruise or you're a four-times-a-year cruiser, the banter and jokes made about cruising pet peeves is witty, relatable and entertaining.\n\nMost of all, I loved the variety of comedians aboard Discovery. On a previous Carnival cruise, there was only one comedian who, although was great at improv comedy and picking on audience members, didn't inspire me to see all seven of his shows. The comedians aboard Discovery were proof that live entertainment on this ship is purely unforgettable.\n\nSlightly hidden on the itinerary, the Princess Dance Competition allows passengers and crew members to be selected at random in the cruise's version of \"Dancing with the Stars.\" Spoiler alert: this was one of my favorite moments from the cruise. I ended up participating, dancing with a crew member from the buffet team and ended up *winning* the whole competition. And yes, I ended up doing a split. There's something I didn't think I'd do on a cruise ship...\n\nFrom regular perusing of the daily itinerary, there are additional activities to enjoy. Discovery ensured that there were enough options to choose from on both sea days and days at port. On some other cruise lines, there was next to nothing to do in the afternoons, so this was a nice touch.\n\nBelow, find a sampling of events and activities you may expect to experience aboard Discovery Princess:\n\nAn incredible, standout feature aboard Discovery Princess was its wealth of well-varied food and beverage options. If you've been on a cruise before, you know you'll never go hungry, but this ship's prized dining room service, quality and flair was a step above other cruises I've been on.\n\nDiscovery Princess has three main dining rooms: Ketchikan, Juneau and Skagway, all named after locations in Alaska, one of the ship's most-traveled-to destinations. Each passenger or passenger group will be assigned one of the three main dining rooms to eat at each evening with different times as well. Wonderfully, there was much flexibility at each dining room if you preferred to dine a bit earlier or later than your scheduled time.\n\nCompared to other ships, the food in the main dining rooms was much better and closely on par with the multitude of specialty dining options you'll find on board. You'll find at least one formal night (aka, lobster night for seafood fans) where nearly everyone is decked out in cocktail attire to take professional photos and enjoy a delicious menu. Production-level shows are usually this night as well.\n\nBreakfast in the main dining room was also an enjoyable experience, where you can enjoy fresh juices, pastries, fruits and main courses. The menu was smaller than other cruises I've been on, but this wasn't a dealbreaker.\n\nThe World Fresh Marketplace, otherwise known as the buffet, didn't have a miles-long line like some other cruises I've sailed on. The options were diverse, delicious and perfect for a quick bite. Veronica and I loved the taco bar and pasta station, as well as the fresh fruit counter. Not to mention, the service is one of the best; waitstaff circles around tables to offer you fresh water, juice or soda on trays, making it extra convenient for your overall dining experience.\n\nLocated on Deck 5 next to The Piazza, International Caf\u00e9 is a complimentary, luxury-leaning, grab-and-go counter where you'll find fresh pastries (note: the almond croissants, heated up, are to die for), desserts and handcrafted sandwiches. This is also where you can grab lattes, cappuccinos and other beverages.\n\nVeronica and I dined here nearly every morning before an early excursion because it's delicious, in a great location and, overall, a quick venue. The service was top-notch and well-loved by passengers; plenty of people aboard grabbed a coffee and sat at one of the tables along The Piazza to enjoy live pianists, vocalists and other entertainment throughout the day and into the evening.\n\nWhat's more, the International Caf\u00e9 is complimentary. On other cruise lines, each specialty coffee and pastry was an extra charge. This is a testament to Princess Cruises' affinity for quality-first dining experiences.\n\nThe love I have for Ocean Terrace Sushi Bar is tenfold. Before dinner on some evenings, Veronica and I would head to this modern counter -- located right above and overlooking The Piazza -- to enjoy fresh crab, shrimp and spicy tuna rolls that are handmade right in front of our eyes. The quality was some of the best I've had. It's a casual yet spectacular setting. Additional charges may apply depending on what you order.\n\nAlso one deck above The Piazza, Gigi's Pizzeria by Alfredo is another sit-down locale where you can enjoy live music surrounding you. This was the first food venue Veronica and I dined at for lunch on embarkation day and we loved the fresh Margherita and veggie pizzas, as well as the salads.\n\nUniquely, the pizza options are certified authentic Neapolitan pizza, much like its gelato on board (which is located on the same deck as The Piazza, and one of the only cruise ships to boast gelato that's certified by the Italian government). Pretty iconic, to say the least.\n\nIf you ask me about the most memorable experience aboard Discovery Princess of them all, it was what's called 360. This isn't just any specialty dining venue. For an additional charge per person (about $150 or so), the dining staff will take you through \"a journey through tastes, sights, sounds, textures and scents,\" per the cruise line.\n\nThis seven-course journey is both filling and fantastically put together. Without giving too much away, the meals are inspired by the Mediterranean and, according to the hostess Magdalena, \"you won't find this food anywhere else on board -- even at the specialty dining venues.\"\n\nThis 360 Experience is reserved for 13-year-olds and older, though my group had nobody younger than 21-years-old. For some, the idea of not knowing what you'll be eating can be somewhat terrifying but rest assured, the team takes any dietary restrictions into account. For instance, Veronica has a shellfish allergy an they made an equally delicious substitute. If you take anything away from this review, book 360.\n\nVeronica and I enjoyed The Catch by Rudi, Discovery's seafood specialty restaurant. Everything from the service to the presentation was extravagant and this was my favorite specialty restaurant on the ship. It's a pure celebration of all things ocean.\n\nTypical of other specialty restaurants you'll find, you'll choose one appetizer, one main course and one dessert. The cocktails at The Catch by Rudi were some of our favorites. My dish, called the Triple S Platter because it contained salmon, scallops and shrimp, was mouthwatering. There was even a hanging prawn on my plate when our waitress brought it out!\n\nYou can take the girl out of New Jersey, but you can't take New Jersey out of the girl. From someone who comes from a family making their own sauce each Sunday, Sabatini's Italian Trattoria was a much-needed dining option in my books. Here, you'll actually find a five-course meal: an appetizer, a soup or salad, a pasta, an entree and a dessert. In short, come hungry.\n\nThe food and cocktails here were incredible and we loved the on-the-house rice balls the waitstaff presented to each table. It was so delicious that we ordered room service from Sabatini's Italian Trattoria one evening as we watched Discovery sail away from one of our ports. It was heaven.\n\nSometimes, you just want a comfort meal, like lasagna or lemon chicken. Sabatini's Italian Trattoria 100% satisfied that craving for both of us, and we enjoyed every minute of our time here.\n\nAh, we've landed at Discovery's steakhouse. Ranked one of the best cruise ship steakhouses, per Princess Cruises website, Crown Grill features premium aged beef and fresh seafood items. Its open kitchen design and elegant setting make it a lovely choice. Not to mention, you can have a tasting of all of the sides.\n\nAbove all else, you'll want to experience Crown Grill's ribeye steak and filet mignon if you're a lover of chops. The glazes, sauces, whipped butter and specialty salts (yes, you read that correctly) made the experience very upscale.\n\nWhether you take excursions is entirely based on personal preference. On the Pacific Wine Country Tour aboard Discovery Princess, Veronica and I embarked on the following crew-organized options:\n\nFrom experiencing some of the best wine in the Pacific to learning the ins and outs of popular locations like San Francisco and Vancouver Island, we felt each tour was well-organized and worth the added cost. Among all the excursions on this particular voyage, we enjoyed Sonoma Wine Country the most because, after all, who doesn't want to travel to Napa?\n\nBooking excursions is simple to do so on the Princess app. Or, you can opt to check in regularly with the Shore Excursions desk on Deck 5 near The Piazza to ask any questions you may have. Veronica and I decided to swap our previously booked biking excursion in Oregon to experience more of wine country and the crew staff was able to reprint new tickets as the tour wasn't fully booked.\n\nIf you aren't able to book your first-choice excursion, I wouldn't worried. While there aren't guarantees, Princess will hold you on an organized waitlist. In fact, Veronica and I were on a waitlist for Sonoma Wine Country and luckily joined the tour.\n\nAdditionally, every excursion through Princess guarantees your arrival back on the ship as it departs. You've likely heard of \"cruise horror stories\" where certain cruise lines will leave you if you're not back by the arranged on-board time. Even if an excursion is running a bit late (like mine in Oregon), rest assured the ship will not depart without you. If you opt to journey at a port on your own and you're late, that may be a different story.\n\nWithout a doubt, Discovery Princess had a catalog of special features that I remember even after my cruise. Below, find them listed:\n\nEverything from the dining experiences to activities and overall service on the Discovery Princess made our voyage extremely memorable. Each step of the way, I felt as if I was on a luxury vacation, even though some experiences -- like specialty dining and the Lotus Spa -- were additional costs. The Production Shows, endless entertainment and accommodations deserve awards of their own, and I would surely set sail on another Princess Cruise again. Veronica, first-time cruiser, would, too!\n\nFor over 200 years, the New York Post has been America's go-to source for bold news, engaging stories, in-depth reporting, and now, insightful shopping guidance.

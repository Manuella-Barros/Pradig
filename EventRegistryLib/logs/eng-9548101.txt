Sheriff Bill Waybourn, who is regularly in attendance at commissioners court meetings, was not present Tuesday, nor was any representative of his office.\n\nJanell Johnson suggested their absence was because they were scared of her. She said she would speak and not let Waybourn leave or ignore her until he was crying and red in the face, feeling at least some measure of her pain.\n\nThe family and other members of the community want answers about how Anthony Johnson died. The 31-year-old Marine veteran, called A.J. by his family, was arrested and jailed in Tarrant County while he was experiencing a mental health crisis.\n\nHis death came after his family says they took him to WellBridge Healthcare in Fort Worth, a behavioral health hospital, on April 19 because he was at the beginning of a schizophrenic episode.\n\nWellBridge turned him away because he wasn't yet violent to himself or others, the family told the Star-Telegram. They were told they should come back when he was.\n\nWellBridge declined Monday to comment on whether Johnson was ever a patient or what the mental health facility's standards are for admissions, directing questions to the facility's corporate leadership. A spokesperson for corporate could not be reached for comment.\n\nLater that same day, he was arrested after being found in an intersection in Saginaw, wielding a knife, according to police.\n\nJacqualyne Johnson, Anthony Johnson's mother, said when she got word that her son had been arrested, she was relieved.\n\n\"My heart was at rest because I was like, 'OK, he's not going to harm anyone. He's safe.' \"\n\nBut two days later, he was dead.\n\nAnthony Johnson died April 21 after an altercation with jailers during which he was pepper-sprayed, according to the sheriff's office. Daryl Washington, a Dallas attorney representing Johnson's family, told the Star-Telegram Monday that Johnson had bruises on his body, suggesting the use of force.\n\n\"If there was something to justify this, that would be known very early on,\" Washington said. \"We haven't heard anything for justification of what happened, what went on. But it's evident to us that there was more involved in this than pepper spray. More force.\"\n\nFamily demands answers\n\nCommissioner Alisa Simmons has called for a federal investigation into Johnson's death and the county jail. The family said they want the same thing.\n\n\"They can't be the ones to prosecute themselves, because they won't,\" Chanell Johnson, one of Anthony Johnson's sisters, said after addressing the commissioners.\n\nThe family is also demanding the release of two videos. The Star-Telegram has requested the footage, too. On Monday, Tarrant County District Attorney Phil Sorrells, who represents the county, sent a letter to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office seeking to withhold the video.\n\nWashington also wants the county to release the video.\n\n\"We are asking and we are demanding that any video footage be released,\" Washington said. \"They talk about transparency and how they want to be transparent to the public, but in this situation we feel like they're hiding something that took place.\"\n\nJohnson's case isn't the first time an inmate has died after being pepper sprayed in the jail. A Star-Telegram investigation in 2022 found that the 2019 death of Robert Miller was likely due to complications from being pepper sprayed multiple times at close range. His death was ruled \"natural.\"\n\nBefore Johnson was booked into the Tarrant County jail, his family said, he sought medical attention when he began noticing the symptoms of a schizophrenic episode coming on.\n\n\"You killed my son,\" his mother, Jacqualyne Johnson, said to the commissioners.\n\nShe said her comments were directed to County Judge Tim O'Hare and all the commissioners except Simmons. Simmons, she said, is the only commissioner she believes has shown any willingness to address problems in the county and in the jail.\n\n\"This has been festering in the county for years and you've done nothing about it,\" Jacqualyne Johnson said. \"My son served. He was in the Marine Corps. Whoever approached him in his cell, he defended himself. He was mentally unstable and it didn't start here. We took him to a facility and they rejected him. ... Had they held him for 24 hours, 24 hours, this wouldn't have happened.\"\n\nKnowledge that he had schizophrenia should have been known to police, the jail and anybody else in the justice system in Tarrant County, his sister Janell Johnson said. Anthony Johnson had been in a behavioral health facility before, received his medication for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder from a county program and told officers who were arresting him that he had schizophrenia.\n\nJacqualyne Johnson said she shouldn't have to be there addressing the county commissioners.\n\n\"I haven't even buried my son yet,\" she said. \"The next time I see him will be when I bury him.\"\n\nCommunity speaks out\n\nAnthony Johnson's family wasn't alone in demanding answers. Members of the community lined up to address the court.\n\nMany demanded answers. They want the videos made public. They want Waybourn to speak publicly about what happened. They aren't satisfied with the sheriff's explanation that he won't speak about Anthony Johnson's death because there is an ongoing investigation.\n\nThe Star-Telegram has tried multiple times to get more information from the Sheriff's Office. In an email Monday evening, a spokesperson for the sheriff told the Star-Telegram that speaking about the case could impact the outcome of the investigation.\n\n\"For the integrity of the investigation and to make sure that people are held accountable, we need to let a thorough process continue without being hindered by rumors or comments from this office,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"We cannot and will not comment on any open investigations until they have been completed.\"\n\nSimmons said during the session that she personally requested Waybourn be present to answer questions at the meeting. He declined, she said.\n\nShe wanted to question him about what happened leading up to Johnson's death, but said he refused to even send a representative.\n\nSimmons also said she requested to view the videos from the jail in a closed session, where the public and media would not be able to see them, and was told no.\n\nAfter Anthony Johnson's family spoke, Simmons followed them out of the chambers. There in the hallway, she embraced them.\n\n\"That touched me in a particular way so I had to take a break,\" she said when she returned to the chambers.\n\nThe family said they won't rest until they have answers. Chanell Johnson said her brother was murdered. She and her family want justice.\n\n\"Everybody is going to understand our pain,\" Janell Johnson told reporters after speaking to the commissioners. \"Don't be sorry. Get this changed. This has to change. Nobody should have died.\"\n\nThere have been more than 60 deaths in the custody of the Tarrant County Jail since Waybourn took office in 2017.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType":

Johnson sought mental health care at Wellbridge Hospital in southwest Fort Worth on April 19, but was denied by hospital staff, according to his mother Jacqualyne Johnson.\n\nShe called the proclamation \"disheartening\" and accused the county of failing her son, who served in the Marines until his illness prevented him from continuing his service.\n\n\"I call BS,\" said Chanell Johnson, Anthony Ray's sister, in an interview with the Star-Telegram before Tuesday's session. \"You had someone that was schizophrenic. So if we're here to talk about mental health, what are you doing in your workforce to ensure that your employees are aware of mental health?\"\n\n\u2192 Attorney: Bruising on man who died in Tarrant jail custody suggests use of force\n\n\u2192 2 hurt when pickup hits power pole in police chase on Hemphill\n\n\u2192 Evicted tenant sentenced in murder of West 7th apartment worker\n\n\ud83d\udea8Get free alerts when news breaks.\n\nJohnson's mother and sisters called out the chain of law enforcement -- from Saginaw police, who arrested him, to the Tarrant County Sheriff's Office -- for failing to provide adequate care for Anthony Ray, despite officers' awareness that he was suffering from a schizophrenic episode.\n\n\"He told you he was schizophrenic,\" Jacqualyne Johnson said. \"Did you relay that information to Tarrant County when you moved him from Saginaw to the jail? That's a big question mark.\"\n\nThe Saginaw Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEveryone who interacted with her son is responsible for his death, Jacqualyne Johnson said.\n\n\"You have a history of his mental illness, all those broken pieces in this process,\" she said. \"In my opinion, they should all be held accountable.

It's going to be damning. You're going to see someone who didn't want to die.\"\n\nJacqualyne Johnson, Anthony Johnson's mother, and Washington met with the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office on Wednesday, after she and her daughters spoke out at the Tarrant County Commissioner's Court meeting on Tuesday. Washington said he didn't leave the meeting angry and is hoping for progress soon.\n\n\"I want to believe that there are going to be some attempts to move forward with something,\" Washington told the Star-Telegram. \"I didn't come out of the meeting pissed off, but we need something and I hope it will come out soon.\"\n\nJacqualyne Johnson said in a text to the Star-Telegram that she doesn't feel like anything changed after the meeting.\n\nThe Johnson family has been demanding the release of any video of the April 21 altercation with Tarrant County Jail detention officers that led to Johnson's death. They, and Washington, say they deserve to know exactly how Anthony Johnson, a 31-year-old Marine veteran, died.\n\nDuring the commissioners court meeting Tuesday, Johnson's family demanded transparency, answers and the release of the video. They told the commissioners present -- all but Roy Charles Brooks, who was absent and at a conference -- that they don't understand the torment his death has caused the family.\n\n\"You can't see my pain right now, but I can make sure y'all turn colors and see pain,\" Anthony Johnson's sister Janell Johnson told county commissioners.\n\nThe family has also said they have been unable to get in touch with the Texas Rangers, who are investigating the in-custody death. The Texas Rangers have not responded to Star-Telegram requests for information.\n\nThe Star-Telegram has requested copies of any video from the Tarrant County Sheriff's Office. The district attorney sent that request to the Texas Attorney General's Office requesting to withhold the video, citing an ongoing investigation. Authorities may request permission to withhold records based on an ongoing investigation, but are allowed to release documents and files such as video if they wish.\n\nMedia outlets and the family aren't the only people being denied the video.\n\nCounty Commissioner Alisa Simmons said during commissioners court Tuesday that she had requested to watch the video during executive session, outside of the public view, but that request was denied.\n\nA spokesperson for Waybourn's office could not be reached for comment on whether or not the sheriff directly ordered the video not to be shown.\n\nState law says the sheriff is a \"custodian\" of the video.\n\nDuring commissioners court Simmons echoed this and argued that as the custodian of the footage the sheriff does not own the video and that it is property of the county.\n\nSimmons has asked for the Department of Justice to investigate the jail. A spokesperson for the DOJ confirmed to the Star-Telegram on Tuesday they had received that request but had no further comment.\n\nThe video was not shown during the meeting. Washington said he's hopeful that it will be shown soon, at the very least shown confidentially to the family. They need to know and see what happened, he said.\n\n\"Not knowing is killing the family,\" Washington told the Star-Telegram. \"They go to bed every night not knowing how their son, their brother died.\"", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_hartley@star-telegram.com", "name": "James Hartley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "noah_alcala_bach@star-telegram.com", "name": "Noah Alcala Bach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Johnson_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Johnson (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrant_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tarrant County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tarrant County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Johnson_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Johnson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth_Star-Telegram", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/AudioVisual", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/AudioVisual", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital_Video", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital Video", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative_Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative Video", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/m4d249/picture288399490/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Johnson%20family01", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548101", "eventUri": "eng-9548101", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-21", "textStart": 1371, "textEnd": 1379}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

He was charged with possession of a controlled substance, tampering with evidence and evading arrest.\n\nAnthony Johnson informed police he was schizophrenic, Jacqualyne said. He died in custody the day after he was booked into the jail.\n\nJacqualyne called on the sheriff's office to show her the video of her son's altercation with jail staff, even if it's not released to the public.\n\n\"The family? We should be able to see that film,\" Jacqualyne said.\n\nThe county has already moved to withhold the video from the public. KERA News requested the video but has not yet heard back from the county. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram submitted a public records request for the video, but the county appealed the request to the state Attorney General's office.\n\nDemocratic County Commissioner Alisa Simmons put a discussion about recent jail deaths on the agenda for Tuesday's meeting. Days before Johnson's death, Roderick Johnson, 42, died in custody after being found unresponsive in his cell, according to the sheriff's office. His cause of death is also pending.\n\nThe Tarrant County Sheriff's Office, which runs the jail, did not send anyone to the meeting to give a briefing or answer Simmons' questions.\n\nThat's because the investigations of those deaths are still open, spokesperson Robbie Hoy wrote in a text message.\n\n\"It would be unprecedented to interview on this case and could interfere with the integrity of the investigation,\" Hoy wrote. \"In order for the case to be completed properly and people to be held accountable, we will allow the outside agency, the Texas Rangers, to complete their investigation before our office makes additional comments.\"\n\nSimmons wants the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate Anthony Johnson's death, a request his mother echoed Tuesday.\n\n\"This is too many deaths. I mean, it should never have gotten to this point. The feds need to come in and do some investigation,\" Jacqualyne said. \"To me, that would be the independent investigation that needs to happen. And until that happens, they're just policing themselves.\"\n\nOther community members who spoke during the public comment period compared Johnson's death to the death of Robert Miller.\n\nMiller died in Tarrant County jail custody in 2019. A Fort Worth Star-Telegram investigation cast doubt on the county's explanation he died of a sickle cell crisis. Miller didn't have sickle cell disease, and he likely died of the consequences of being pepper sprayed repeatedly by jailers, the paper suggested.\n\nThe county initially promised to submit Miller's autopsy for an independent review, but KERA News found that review never happened. The county maintains Miller died of a sickle cell crisis.\n\nGot a tip? Email Miranda Suarez at msuarez@kera.org.

They said JPS medical staff was on the scene, as is standard procedure, to check the inmate after the incident. The office said during that examination, Johnson became unresponsive.\n\nThey said staff began CPR and then took Johnson to JPS Hospital, where he was pronounced dead just after 10 a.m.\n\nTuesday's commissioners court agenda listed an item related to this, \"Tarrant County Sheriff's Office Update Regarding Incidents in the County Jail.\"\n\nHowever, no one from the office was present, and Chandler Merritt, Tarrant County Administrator, read press releases and data into the record that the office had previously released.\n\nNBC 5 asked why no one from the sheriff's office was present to give the briefing.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson said the office does not comment on open investigations.\n\n\"It would be unprecedented to interview on this case and could interfere with integrity of the investigation. In order for the case to be completed properly and people to be held accountable, we will allow the outside agency, the Texas Rangers, to complete their investigation before our office makes additional comments.\"\n\nCommissioner Alisa Simmons still asked her questions to the absent sheriff.\n\n\"Does the Tarrant County Jail have some form of a special response team on a 24/7 basis?\" she said, wondering if there are detention officers who can coax noncompliant inmates.\n\nJohnson's family and the sheriff said that Johnson tried to check into a mental health facility on Friday, just hours before he was arrested in Saginaw.\n\nHis mother, Jacqualyne, said he was turned away from the facility because he didn't present an immediate threat to himself or someone else's safety at the time.\n\nThe sheriff's office said Johnson was standing in an intersection brandishing a knife at a driver, then ran away from officers.\n\nOn Saturday, Johnson was taken to Tarrant County Jail, where he called his mother, Jacqualyne.\n\n\"I told him to take care, be safe in there,\" she recalled.\n\nShe said she was relieved when officers picked him up because she thought he and others would be safe in jail from the effects of his manic episodes.\n\nThe next morning, Jacqualyne said she was informed of her son's death, but was only told that he had died at the hospital.\n\nShe said they didn't find out Johnson died in jail until they heard it on the news.\n\nThe family said they have been searching for answers since then.\n\nThey said the sheriff met with them to tell them there may have been an altercation before Johnson's death, and that it was being investigated, but the family said they haven't received any communication from the Rangers.\n\nThey're calling on commissioners to enact change.\n\n\"How do you tell somebody who has been following everything from the rule book; from the Marine Corps who taught him how to defend himself, to contacting [My Health My Resources of Tarrant County], to finding a facility, all the way down to letting the arresting officers know that he was schizophrenic... How are you going to sit here and tell me every step of the way that my brother went through work, and he's dead now?\" Janell told commissioners.\n\nThe Johnsons want a federal investigation into the jail, something Simmons has also called for.\n\n\"It should never have gotten to this point. The feds need to come in and do some investigation, said Jacqualyne.\n\nIn a press conference about Johnson's death last month, Sheriff Bill Waybourn said the incident highlights the need for more mental health resources in the county.\n\n\"We have got to change some of this, we have got to go a different direction,\" Waybourn said. \"Because you never know what would have changed had that happened.\"\n\nAfter that press conference, NBC 5 asked for a response to calls for a federal investigation, but Waybourn declined to answer.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesperson for his office said they still would not be offering any comment on that.\n\nThe Johnsons want every step of the county's mental health system reviewed and fixed.\n\n\"We need to look back on the policies, procedures being used,\" Janell said.\n\nAccording to data, Tarrant County jail has had 63 reported inmate deaths since 2017.\n\nThe Johnsons pointed the finger at commissioners for not taking enough action to prevent their brother's death, one of the most recent.\n\n\"How you guys treat your vets, how you treat people with mental illnesses here in Tarrant county, the lack thereof, is arrogant and irresponsible,\" said Chanell, Johnson's little sister.\n\n\"Take accountability for what happened, and let's focus on change,\" Chanell added.\n\nSomething many neighbors also voiced support for during public comment.\n\n\"Why must this keep happening before our eyes, with no change in the status quo?\" Commissioners Court, you must do more,\" said one neighbor.\n\nThe Johnsons said they are ready to organize and affect change through the ballot box.\n\n\"We have a lot of heavy hitters behind us, to vote get them out. Because that's where the change is going to start,\" Jacqulyne told reporters.\n\n\"If I have to spend the next 15 years of my life to get your seat, and every last one of y'all's seat, I will do that. I'm educated enough to do it,\" Janell told commissioners.\n\n\"Everybody's going to feel my pain, I'm sharing it,\" she said.\n\nThe Johnsons said they've retained attorney Darryl Washington to help in their search for answers and to possibly pursue prosecution of those responsible in Anthony's death.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Johnson_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Johnson (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pepper spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrant_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tarrant County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tarrant County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raycom_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Raycom Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_release", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press release"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chandler, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chandler, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saginaw,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saginaw, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saginaw, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Schizophrenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://media.nbcdfw.com/2024/05/Resized_Resized_20240422_194701_1715108004084_1715108007839.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548101", "eventUri": "eng-9548101", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-21", "textStart": 285, "textEnd": 295}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

They, and Washington, say they deserve to know exactly how Anthony Johnson, a 31-year-old Marine veteran, died.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 More top stories from our newsroom:\n\n\u2192 Tim O'Hare, Alisa Simmons chastised over heated exchange\n\n\u2192 Family of ex-Marine Anthony Johnson demand answers over jail death\n\n\u2192 Are these Austin's best tacos?

They told the commissioners present -- all but Roy Charles Brooks, who was absent and at a conference -- that they don't understand the torment his death has caused the family.\n\n\"You can't see my pain right now, but I can make sure y'all turn colors and see pain,\" Anthony Johnson's sister Janell Johnson told county commissioners.\n\nThe family has also said they have been unable to get in touch with the Texas Rangers, who are investigating the in-custody death. The Texas Rangers have not responded to Star-Telegram requests for information.\n\nThe Star-Telegram has requested copies of any video from the Tarrant County Sheriff's Office. The district attorney sent that request to the Texas Attorney General's Office requesting to withhold the video, citing an ongoing investigation. Authorities may request permission to withhold records based on an ongoing investigation, but are allowed to release documents and files such as video if they wish.\n\nMedia outlets and the family aren't the only people being denied the video.\n\nCounty Commissioner Alisa Simmons said during commissioners court Tuesday that she had requested to watch the video during executive session, outside of the public view, but that request was denied.\n\nA spokesperson for Waybourn's office could not be reached for comment on whether or not the sheriff directly ordered the video not to be shown.\n\nState law says the sheriff is a \"custodian\" of the video.\n\nDuring commissioners court Simmons echoed this and argued that as the custodian of the footage the sheriff does not own the video and that it is property of the county.\n\nSimmons has asked for the Department of Justice to investigate the jail. A spokesperson for the DOJ confirmed to the Star-Telegram on Tuesday they had received that request but had no further comment.\n\nThe video was not shown during the meeting. Washington said he's hopeful that it will be shown soon, at the very least shown confidentially to the family. They need to know and see what happened, he said.\n\n\"Not knowing is killing the family,\" Washington told the Star-Telegram. \"They go to bed every night not knowing how their son, their brother died.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Johnson_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Johnson (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrant_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tarrant County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tarrant County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Johnson_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Johnson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Hare_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O'Hare International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breaking news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth_Star-Telegram", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/fort_worth_star_telegram_mcclatchy_952/4970b79a5d5c952542ece8359cbee68d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548101", "eventUri": "eng-9548101", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-21", "textStart": 1371, "textEnd": 1379}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The death of Anthony Johnson Jr. after he was pepper-sprayed while reportedly fighting officers during a contraband check threatens to roil Fort Worth. The citizens ultimately responsible for the application of justice deserve to know how a 31-year-old former Marine died so suddenly. They need answers so they can demand better administration of justice from their elected officials and hold them accountable for it.\n\nDistrict Attorney Phil Sorrells cited an ongoing investigation when he asked the attorney general's office, on the sheriff's behalf, to deny a Star-Telegram reporter's request for documentation around Johnson's death. That's a sound legal tactic, and the county is likely to prevail.\n\nBut allowing Johnson's family and the broader public to see what happened need not jeopardize the investigation. If the videos absolve jailers or show evidence of a crime, that won't change because more eyes have seen them. Another common concern is tainting a potential jury pool. Any case probably wouldn't go to trial for months or even a year, and in a county of 2.2 million people, it won't be hard to find people who never saw the videos or don't even remember the case.\n\nCounty Commissioner Alisa Simmons, an Arlington Democrat, said Tuesday that even she and her colleagues -- who will have to approve costs arising from the case and whatever changes are needed at the jail -- had been denied access to the videos.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies have, understandably, developed different strategies for handling footage of lethal encounters. When the video absolves officers, particularly showing that their lives were in danger, police release them in days. Some are not so clear-cut, and in those cases, too, the public needs to understand what officers faced and where they may have crossed the line.\n\nIt's a matter of tradeoffs, and with so many questions surrounding the jail, it would be better for Waybourn to get the facts out. Johnson's death was the fifth at the jail this year and the second in a span of a week. Yes, many inmates arrive with complicated medical histories, chronic disease and years of damaging substance abuse. No urban jail can prevent certain deaths. But there are plenty of signs this wasn't the case with Johnson.\n\nHis case seems to symbolize the sharpened crisis of mental health, which lands at the jail's doorstep. His family said they tried to get Johnson help for schizophrenia at a hospital but were turned away. He was soon arrested in Saginaw on charges of possession of a controlled substance, tampering with or fabricating evidence and evading arrest.\n\nJohnson was taken to jail April 20. He died the next morning.\n\nWe lack money, facilities and systems for adequate treatment, so we ask law enforcement officials to serve as the last resort for treatment, and if they're involved, it's probably in a crisis. Waybourn has long lamented this and urged more attention and resources for the issue, and he's right.\n\nThe sheriff took the rare step of speaking publicly on Johnson's case just a few days after his April 21 death. Waybourn asked the public for patience, a reasonable request in a complicated case. The videos and other information might raise uncomfortable issues about poor staffing, stressful working conditions and other problems in the jail operation. They might pinpoint one bad actor. But whatever the answer, the questions should be aired while there's focus and a willingness to act.\n\nResponsibility for the latter falls on Waybourn, his staff and county commissioners. We've said repeatedly that commissioners must involve themselves in the jail's problems at a granular level. The 3-2 Republican majority on the court cannot turn its head because of the potential political risk to Waybourn or anyone else.\n\nAfter all, improving the jail would ease political pressure. It might be more fiscally responsible in the long run. Legal settlements are government spending, too. And if the federal government steps in and demands reform, the bills could mount quickly.\n\nBut it's the human cost that matters most. Johnson's mother and sister made their anguish plain at Tuesday's Commissioners Court meeting. Also hurting, no doubt, are the dedicated men and women who strive to do their duty every day and night at the jail.\n\nEveryone involved deserves better.

He asked his mother to take him to a hospital because he didn't want to become a danger to himself or others, his family told the Star-Telegram.\n\nInstead of getting help, though, his family said the facility turned him away because he was not yet violent.\n\nWellBridge in Fort Worth declined Monday to comment on whether Johnson was ever a patient or what the mental health facility's standards are for admissions, directing questions to the facility's corporate leadership. A spokesperson for corporate could not be reached for comment Monday.\n\nJohnson, a 31-year-old Marine Corps veteran who was assigned to combat logistics, was diagnosed with schizophrenia after his time in the military, his family said. He took the diagnosis seriously and wasn't ashamed to seek help, they said.\n\nA military spokesperson told the Star-Telegram that details on his early discharge in 2013 after two years in the Marine Corps cannot be released.\n\nJohnson was arrested in Saginaw later on April 19, the same day he tried to seek help, according to the Tarrant County Sheriff's Office, which handles administration of the jail. He was found holding a knife in an intersection, police said. His family said the schizophrenic episode had taken hold. On April 20, his family said, they heard from him in a phone call from the jail and he seemed to be doing better.\n\nThen, on the morning of April 21, Johnson refused to leave his cell during a routine contraband check, leading to an altercation with detention officers, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nThe sheriff's office said Johnson was pepper-sprayed and then given medical attention, which is routine. But Daryl Washington, an attorney representing Johnson's family in their quest to get answers about what happened to him, said he suspects there was more to it.\n\nBruising on his body suggests more force was used against Johnson than just pepper spray, Washington told the Star-Telegram in a phone interview.\n\n\"If there was something to justify this, that would be known very early on,\" Washington said. \"We haven't heard anything for justification of what happened, what went on. But it's evident to us that there was more involved in this than pepper spray. More force.\"\n\nThe Star-Telegram has filed an open records request for video from the jail showing what happened. The county has sent that request to the Texas Attorney General's Office seeking permission to withhold the video.\n\nWashington said he hasn't seen the video, either, but has heard it exists.\n\n\"We are asking and we are demanding that any video footage be released,\" he said. \"They talk about transparency and how they want to be transparent to the public, but in this situation we feel like they're hiding something that took place.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to comment, citing the Texas Rangers' involvement in the investigation. In a statement April 23, the Texas Department of Public Safety, of which the Texas Rangers are a department, said the Rangers' criminal investigation is ongoing and \"there is no further information available.\"\n\nThe Tarrant County Commissioners Court is expected to discuss Johnson's death and other recent deaths in the Tarrant County Jail at a meeting Tuesday morning.", "source": {"uri":

The death of Anthony Johnson Jr. after he was pepper-sprayed while reportedly fighting officers during a contraband check threatens to roil Fort Worth. The citizens ultimately responsible for the application of justice deserve to know how a 31-year-old former Marine died so suddenly. They need answers so they can demand better administration of justice from their elected officials and hold them accountable for it.\n\nDistrict Attorney Phil Sorrells cited an ongoing investigation when he asked the attorney general's office, on the sheriff's behalf, to deny a Star-Telegram reporter's request for documentation around Johnson's death. That's a sound legal tactic, and the county is likely to prevail.\n\nBut allowing Johnson's family and the broader public to see what happened need not jeopardize the investigation. If the videos absolve jailers or show evidence of a crime, that won't change because more eyes have seen them. Another common concern is tainting a potential jury pool. Any case probably wouldn't go to trial for months or even a year, and in a county of 2.2 million people, it won't be hard to find people who never saw the videos or don't even remember the case.\n\nCounty Commissioner Alisa Simmons, an Arlington Democrat, said Tuesday that even she and her colleagues -- who will have to approve costs arising from the case and whatever changes are needed at the jail -- had been denied access to the videos.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies have, understandably, developed different strategies for handling footage of lethal encounters. When the video absolves officers, particularly showing that their lives were in danger, police release them in days. Some are not so clear-cut, and in those cases, too, the public needs to understand what officers faced and where they may have crossed the line.\n\nIt's a matter of tradeoffs, and with so many questions surrounding the jail, it would be better for Waybourn to get the facts out. Johnson's death was the fifth at the jail this year and the second in a span of a week. Yes, many inmates arrive with complicated medical histories, chronic disease and years of damaging substance abuse. No urban jail can prevent certain deaths. But there are plenty of signs this wasn't the case with Johnson.\n\nHis case seems to symbolize the sharpened crisis of mental health, which lands at the jail's doorstep. His family said they tried to get Johnson help for schizophrenia at a hospital but were turned away. He was soon arrested in Saginaw on charges of possession of a controlled substance, tampering with or fabricating evidence and evading arrest.\n\nJohnson was taken to jail April 20. He died the next morning.\n\nWe lack money, facilities and systems for adequate treatment, so we ask law enforcement officials to serve as the last resort for treatment, and if they're involved, it's probably in a crisis. Waybourn has long lamented this and urged more attention and resources for the issue, and he's right.\n\nThe sheriff took the rare step of speaking publicly on Johnson's case just a few days after his April 21 death. Waybourn asked the public for patience, a reasonable request in a complicated case. The videos and other information might raise uncomfortable issues about poor staffing, stressful working conditions and other problems in the jail operation. They might pinpoint one bad actor. But whatever the answer, the questions should be aired while there's focus and a willingness to act.\n\nResponsibility for the latter falls on Waybourn, his staff and county commissioners. We've said repeatedly that commissioners must involve themselves in the jail's problems at a granular level. The 3-2 Republican majority on the court cannot turn its head because of the potential political risk to Waybourn or anyone else.\n\nAfter all, improving the jail would ease political pressure. It might be more fiscally responsible in the long run. Legal settlements are government spending, too. And if the federal government steps in and demands reform, the bills could mount quickly.\n\nBut it's the human cost that matters most. Johnson's mother and sister made their anguish plain at Tuesday's Commissioners Court meeting. Also hurting, no doubt, are the dedicated men and women who strive to do their duty every day and night at the jail.\n\nEveryone involved deserves better. The first step is transparency.\n\nWe love to hear from Texans with opinions on the news -- and to publish those views in the Opinion section.\n\n* Letters should be no more than 150 words.\n\n* Writers should submit letters only once every 30 days.\n\n* Include your name, address (including city of residence), phone number and email address, so we can contact you if we have questions.\n\nPlease note: Letters will be edited for style and clarity.

But, because of his mental illness she fears for his life.\n\nShantel Taylor says she is constantly worried sick about her son surviving his stay in jail. His health challenges started at a very early age.\n\n\"Kaiyere was diagnosed with an IBD and high functioning autism at the age of 2,\" she said.\n\nTaylor said she is worried sick about her son surviving his stay in jail. She says he's mentally ill, needs help, and what she saw during jail visits was disturbing.\n\n\"Just in his cell urinating, defecating in there, food all over the place,\" she said. \"He is naked in there.\"\n\nFort Worth police arrested Kaiyere Campbell on Dec. 11 last year after police say he attacked an elderly group home worker. Court documents show a Tarrant County judge declared Campbell incompetent to stand trial and ordered him transferred to a state mental health facility.\n\nBut the wait time for a state hospital bed is anywhere from 200 days to almost a year-and-a-half, according to State Health and Human Services. The documents also contain handwritten notes showing Campbell stopped taking his medication and has refused to eat.\n\nHis mother said she is concerned about his drastic weight loss and the impact that it could have on his body.\n\n\"I'm afraid that I'm going to lose him,\" Taylor said. \"So that's why I'm taking the detrimental steps that I need.\"\n\nWFAA reached out to the Tarrant County Jail, but has not heard back. Campbell's case has the attention of Pamela Young's organization called \"United Fort Worth.\"\n\n\"United Fort Worth is a grassroots organization,\" said Young, \"We're community organizers, and we organize around criminal justice, immigration, justice and civic empowerment in black and brown communities in Fort Worth and Tarrant County.\"\n\nUnited Fort Worth is also focused on helping people in jail who suffer from mental health issues by assisting their families with resources and services. Young said she believes Kaiyere's case mirrors some of the 64 Tarrant County Jail deaths over the past few years.\n\n\"If you can take your loved one directly to the hospital yourself, go through a probate court and have them involuntarily committed through the civil process, not a criminal process, so that they can get the proper level of care that they need,\" Young said, \"Kaiyere will never be deemed competent to stand trial because he has an intellectual developmental disability.\"\n\nYoung and Campbell's mother both say they hope to convince Tarrant County officials to drop his criminal charges and expedite his transfer to a hospital.", "source": {"uri": "wfaa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAA-TV Channel 8"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrant_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tarrant County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tarrant County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suicide watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autism spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFAA", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WFAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competence_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competence (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_commitment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Involuntary commitment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developmental disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probate_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probate court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media.wfaa.com/assets/WFAA/images/c31d3bc9-7068-4fcf-abd1-7765f432bfc3/20240508T231005/c31d3bc9-7068-4fcf-abd1-7765f432bfc3_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548101", "eventUri": "eng-9548101", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-11", "textStart": 741, "textEnd": 748}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Instead of a briefing for commissioners, county administrator Chandler Merritt read from two press releases the sheriff had used weeks earlier to announce the deaths.\n\nJohnson's family has demanded information about how he died, including the release of video from inside the jail. The sheriff has refused, saying the case is under investigation. The Star-Telegram has also sought the video through public records requests.\n\nRamirez stopped short of calling on the sheriff to release the video.\n\n\"After observing the response to several recent critical incidents, including the most recent death in custody of Mr. Anthony Johnson, it has become apparent that we are not doing enough to share information with the public,\" Ramirez, a former police officer, wrote in a one-page statement. \"While every critical incident is unique and will undoubtedly demand a sensitive decision-making process, the public should know what the process is and what to expect as the process proceeds.\"\n\nJohnson, 31, died on April 21 after being pepper-sprayed in an altercation with guards during a routine contraband check of his cell, the sheriff's office has said. He was arrested on April 19 in the throes of a mental health crisis, after his family says he was turned away from a mental hospital.\n\nCommissioner Alisa Simmons has demanded that the sheriff's office release video of altercation that led to Johnson's death.\n\nSimmons is one of two Democrats on the Commissioners Court. Ramirez is one of three Republicans. Their fellow commissioners have not publicly commented on the Johnson case.\n\nDemocrat Roy Brooks was not in attendance for Tuesday's meeting.\n\nRamirez said his proposed policy changes for the sheriff's office largely mirror best practices and will include proposed timelines to release video, notify next of kin and provide media briefings. Ramirez is the former president of the Fort Worth Police Officers Association.\n\n\"The Tarrant County Sheriff's Office needs more transparent, structured, and consistent communication policies for handling critical incident reporting and releasing video,\" Ramirez said.\n\nJohnson's family, their attorney, Simmons and members of the community have previously called for the release of the video.\n\nWhile the statement from Ramirez does not call for the video's release, it does lay out plans to set schedules for when videos are released, news conferences are held, news releases are disseminated and next-of-kin are updated.\n\nRamirez said the potential policy models after that of similarly sized law enforcement agencies. The policy would also allow the public to have a timeline they could count on for the release of information, he wrote.\n\n\"Only when our community members clearly understand the consistent and uniformly applied process when there are critical incidents or in-custody deaths can they develop trust that these processes are followed,\" the release read. \"In Tarrant County, when we face challenges, we will step up and solve them no matter how tough.\"\n\nWhile the sheriff and no representatives of his staff attended Tuesday's commissioners meeting, Johnson's family was there.\n\n\"You can't see my pain right now, but I can make sure y'all turn colors and see pain,\" Anthony Johnson's sister Janell Johnson told commissioners.\n\nDaryl Washington, the attorney for the Johnson family, has called for Waybourn to release the video or resign.\n\n\"If it's too much pressure for the sheriff to expose wrongdoing ... he needs to resign,\" Washington said in a phone call Wednesday with the Star-Telegram. \"They're going to try to keep it from coming out for a long time. It's going to be damning.

That total arrest number includes some who say they were never part of the protest but were in the area of the encampment when state police arrived. UVa issued all 27 who were arrested \"no trespass\" orders, or NTOs, preventing them from legally returning to Grounds. Most of those orders have since been lifted or modified.\n\nMustafa Abdelhamid's has not.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nAbdelhamid, who has now filed suit against the university, claims he was not participating in the protest but completing a delivery order near the encampment. And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race.\n\nAbdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Charlottesville Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities.\n\nBut despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid's order, citing \"continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being\" of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination.\n\nBefore receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is something I'm looking forward to because it's going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I'm interested in,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nBut due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation.\n\nAfter learning of Abdelhamid's circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session.\n\n\"I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,\" Coughlin told The Daily Progress. \"My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn't act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.\"\n\nHer repeated requests were denied.\n\nOn Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded.\n\nIt had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program.\n\nHis graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted.\n\nWhen the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC's Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school.\n\nAny person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo.\n\n\"I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,\" Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email.\n\nAbdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4.\n\n\"I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say he's required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo's sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid's appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was \"actively participating\" in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,\" Longo wrote.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\"Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn't wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,\" UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. \"When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.\"\n\nOrians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process. Orians said that, unlike Abdelhamid, other individuals who appealed their NTOs did not include any information about their involvement in the protest, and their NTOs were modified anyway.\n\n\"Candor did not matter in those cases,\" Orians said.\n\nShe also noted that NTOs include a list of boxes that the university police can check off. One of those boxes: the individual demonstrated \"conduct that threatens\" the safety of the UVa community. For Abdelhamid, that box was never checked, indicating university police did not consider him to be a threat.\n\nTwo other arrestees, Cierra Biel and Evan Urquhart, shared their appeal letters with The Daily Progress. Neither letter included an explanation for why they were at the protest, despite the requirement that they offer a \"complete and candid explanation for the conduct that precipitate[d] the Trespass Warning.\"\n\nBoth Biel and Urquhart said they'd been advised by attorneys to withhold that information.\n\nBiel went so far as to write Longo that the university's response against protesting students was an \"overreaction\" as well as \"unjust and unwarranted.\"\n\nBoth Biel's and Urquhart's NTOs were lifted.\n\nLongo wrote them that NTOs are meant to \"mitigate a threat to health and safety.\" He concluded that any risk from Biel or Urquhart had been \"sufficiently mitigated.\"\n\nHe did not reach the same conclusion with Abdelhamid.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt's a conclusion with which the U.S. government disagrees.\n\nAbdelhamid first arrived in the U.S. on a visa that required he return to his home country every six months. He did so until one trip home in the fall of 2015 when he was detained by his home government's authorities.\n\nThey found it suspicious that he was traveling to and from the U.S. every six months. They believed he was a spy. And they found out that during the 2011 Arab Spring, Abdelhamid had been a part of the protests, where he had provided medical assistance to injured protesters. During the revolution, his home government is alleged to have committed many human rights abuses and murdered hundreds of demonstrators.\n\n\"There would be two million people in one square, and police were just shooting at us,\" Abdelhamid recalled.\n\nHe was detained and brutally tortured for more than a week, deprived of sunlight and subjected to torture sessions three to five times per day. It is difficult for Abdelhamid to talk about, and he became choked up when recalling the traumatic period in an interview with The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities only released him under the condition that he be strictly supervised and told him that if he ever returned to the U.S. he would be killed.\n\n\"They made it very clear,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe took the risk anyway, fleeing his home country in 2015.\n\nUpon arriving back at UVa, he told a professor what had happened. He did not understand the complex U.S. immigration system but was terrified of returning home. He wanted to know if he could change his visa so that he would not be required to fly back home every six months, which he feared would effectively be a death sentence.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Abdelhamid was ordered to go to the UVa Police Department where he was questioned by an agent with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. He was released after the interview.\n\nAfter not receiving a response on how to change his visa status, and fearful about returning home, Abdelhamid overstayed his visa. The day after he passed the six-month mark without returning to his home country, he was in the emergency room with his now ex-wife. She was having a miscarriage.\n\nWhile in the ER, Abdelhamid received a call from the same ICE agent who had questioned him previously. She demanded to meet with him immediately. A UVa police officer met Abdelhamid in the ER, forcing him to leave his wife behind. He was escorted from the building, taken to the ICE officer and detained.\n\nSoon after, he was in immigration court for removal proceedings, a hearing where a judge determines whether an individual may remain in the U.S.\n\n\"I stood in front of the immigration judge and told him my situation and why I cannot go back home,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe also got in touch with a nonprofit group that recommended he apply for political asylum. Abdelhamid was released on bond and was granted asylum in October of 2023, after being thoroughly vetted by U.S. law enforcement. The vetting was especially thorough because he had previously been on the \"removal docket\"; asylum seekers who have been involved in removal proceedings are subjected to heavier scrutiny than those who have not.\n\n\"The asylum process is extremely extensive in terms of credibility standards you have to meet to qualify for asylum and the background checks you have to meet with the Department of Homeland Security,\" Karla McKanders, director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities investigate if asylum seekers have any criminal record in the U.S. or abroad; even loose connections with anyone associated with a terrorist organization will result in a denial. And an applicant must also get a green light from an immigration judge.\n\n\"Even if you meet all the criteria, it's in the judge's discretion to deny asylum,\" McKanders said.\n\nAbdelhamid's yearslong ordeal with immigration authorities effectively prevented him from doing a medical residency in the U.S.; priority is given to prospective residents who are within three years of graduating medical school, and it had been eight years since Abdelhamid had graduated from his home university.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, he chose to enroll in the PVCC nursing program.\n\n\"He wanted to do a medical residency to get his full MD here in the United States. And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,\" Orians said. \"So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.\"\n\nMultiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid's NTO be lifted.\n\nUVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid's. UVa also has not released who has and hasn't had their NTOs modified after the events of May 4.\n\nWith his future at stake, people in the UVa community are making regular efforts to have the university reconsider its decision.\n\nOn May 20, the UVa chapter of the American Association of University Professors penned a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan. It asked that the NTO be dropped, or at least modified so Abdelhamid can pursue his education.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the denial of Mr. Abdelhamid's NTO appeal grossly infringes on his student rights,\" reads the letter, \"and unjustly impairs his ability to pursue his education.\"\n\nIt also floats the same possibility that people familiar with Abdelhamid's case have considered: that his appeal was denied because he is Arab.\n\n\"This extremely punitive state of affairs, selectively applied to him, as it appears to us, is prejudicial to his minority status,\" reads the letter.\n\nNeither Biel nor Urquhart, two arrestees who had their NTOs lifted, understand why Abdelhamid is being treated any differently. Unlike Abdelhamid, Urquhart doesn't spend much time on Grounds.\n\n\"It wasn't super high urgency for me to get back on campus,\" Urquhart, who is a local freelance journalist who says he was covering not participating in the protest when he was arrested, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAbdelhamid has been \"incredibly nice\" in all the interactions she's had with him, said Biel, who is an administrative coordinator in the school's Department of Pharmacology. As a UVa employee, she said she's done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo's reasoning.\n\n\"I'm suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,\" said Biel. \"Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.\"\n\nBiel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The \"dragnet\" deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville's Black community and its police department.\n\nWith the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo's decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Mustafa does not want to sue UVa. It's been a decade since he first got here, and all he has wanted to do is contribute to the health and well-being of UVa and the greater Charlottesville community,\" Orians said. \"UVa has left him in a position where he's run out of options except to sue to have his rights respected so he can fulfill his dream to be a health care provider in this community.\"\n\nJason Armesto (717)

And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race.\n\nAbdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Charlottesville Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities.\n\nBut despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid's order, citing \"continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being\" of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination.\n\nBefore receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is something I'm looking forward to because it's going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I'm interested in,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nBut due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation.\n\nAfter learning of Abdelhamid's circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session.\n\n\"I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,\" Coughlin told The Daily Progress. \"My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn't act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.\"\n\nHer repeated requests were denied.\n\nOn Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded.\n\nIt had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program.\n\nHis graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted.\n\nWhen the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC's Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school.\n\nAny person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo.\n\n\"I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,\" Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email.\n\nAbdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4.\n\n\"I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say he's required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo's sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid's appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was \"actively participating\" in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,\" Longo wrote.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\"Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn't wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,\" UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. \"When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.\"\n\nOrians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process. Orians said that, unlike Abdelhamid, other individuals who appealed their NTOs did not include any information about their involvement in the protest, and their NTOs were modified anyway.\n\n\"Candor did not matter in those cases,\" Orians said.\n\nShe also noted that NTOs include a list of boxes that the university police can check off. One of those boxes: the individual demonstrated \"conduct that threatens\" the safety of the UVa community. For Abdelhamid, that box was never checked, indicating university police did not consider him to be a threat.\n\nTwo other arrestees, Cierra Biel and Evan Urquhart, shared their appeal letters with The Daily Progress. Neither letter included an explanation for why they were at the protest, despite the requirement that they offer a \"complete and candid explanation for the conduct that precipitate[d] the Trespass Warning.\"\n\nBoth Biel and Urquhart said they'd been advised by attorneys to withhold that information.\n\nBiel went so far as to write Longo that the university's response against protesting students was an \"overreaction\" as well as \"unjust and unwarranted.\"\n\nBoth Biel's and Urquhart's NTOs were lifted.\n\nLongo wrote them that NTOs are meant to \"mitigate a threat to health and safety.\" He concluded that any risk from Biel or Urquhart had been \"sufficiently mitigated.\"\n\nHe did not reach the same conclusion with Abdelhamid.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt's a conclusion with which the U.S. government disagrees.\n\nAbdelhamid first arrived in the U.S. on a visa that required he return to his home country every six months. He did so until one trip home in the fall of 2015 when he was detained by his home government's authorities.\n\nThey found it suspicious that he was traveling to and from the U.S. every six months. They believed he was a spy. And they found out that during the 2011 Arab Spring, Abdelhamid had been a part of the protests, where he had provided medical assistance to injured protesters. During the revolution, his home government is alleged to have committed many human rights abuses and murdered hundreds of demonstrators.\n\n\"There would be two million people in one square, and police were just shooting at us,\" Abdelhamid recalled.\n\nHe was detained and brutally tortured for more than a week, deprived of sunlight and subjected to torture sessions three to five times per day. It is difficult for Abdelhamid to talk about, and he became choked up when recalling the traumatic period in an interview with The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities only released him under the condition that he be strictly supervised and told him that if he ever returned to the U.S. he would be killed.\n\n\"They made it very clear,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe took the risk anyway, fleeing his home country in 2015.\n\nUpon arriving back at UVa, he told a professor what had happened. He did not understand the complex U.S. immigration system but was terrified of returning home. He wanted to know if he could change his visa so that he would not be required to fly back home every six months, which he feared would effectively be a death sentence.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Abdelhamid was ordered to go to the UVa Police Department where he was questioned by an agent with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. He was released after the interview.\n\nAfter not receiving a response on how to change his visa status, and fearful about returning home, Abdelhamid overstayed his visa. The day after he passed the six-month mark without returning to his home country, he was in the emergency room with his now ex-wife. She was having a miscarriage.\n\nWhile in the ER, Abdelhamid received a call from the same ICE agent who had questioned him previously. She demanded to meet with him immediately. A UVa police officer met Abdelhamid in the ER, forcing him to leave his wife behind. He was escorted from the building, taken to the ICE officer and detained.\n\nSoon after, he was in immigration court for removal proceedings, a hearing where a judge determines whether an individual may remain in the U.S.\n\n\"I stood in front of the immigration judge and told him my situation and why I cannot go back home,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe also got in touch with a nonprofit group that recommended he apply for political asylum. Abdelhamid was released on bond and was granted asylum in October of 2023, after being thoroughly vetted by U.S. law enforcement. The vetting was especially thorough because he had previously been on the \"removal docket\"; asylum seekers who have been involved in removal proceedings are subjected to heavier scrutiny than those who have not.\n\n\"The asylum process is extremely extensive in terms of credibility standards you have to meet to qualify for asylum and the background checks you have to meet with the Department of Homeland Security,\" Karla McKanders, director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities investigate if asylum seekers have any criminal record in the U.S. or abroad; even loose connections with anyone associated with a terrorist organization will result in a denial. And an applicant must also get a green light from an immigration judge.\n\n\"Even if you meet all the criteria, it's in the judge's discretion to deny asylum,\" McKanders said.\n\nAbdelhamid's yearslong ordeal with immigration authorities effectively prevented him from doing a medical residency in the U.S.; priority is given to prospective residents who are within three years of graduating medical school, and it had been eight years since Abdelhamid had graduated from his home university.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, he chose to enroll in the PVCC nursing program.\n\n\"He wanted to do a medical residency to get his full MD here in the United States. And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,\" Orians said. \"So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.\"\n\nMultiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid's NTO be lifted.\n\nUVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid's. UVa also has not released who has and hasn't had their NTOs modified after the events of May 4.\n\nWith his future at stake, people in the UVa community are making regular efforts to have the university reconsider its decision.\n\nOn May 20, the UVa chapter of the American Association of University Professors penned a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan. It asked that the NTO be dropped, or at least modified so Abdelhamid can pursue his education.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the denial of Mr. Abdelhamid's NTO appeal grossly infringes on his student rights,\" reads the letter, \"and unjustly impairs his ability to pursue his education.\"\n\nIt also floats the same possibility that people familiar with Abdelhamid's case have considered: that his appeal was denied because he is Arab.\n\n\"This extremely punitive state of affairs, selectively applied to him, as it appears to us, is prejudicial to his minority status,\" reads the letter.\n\nNeither Biel nor Urquhart, two arrestees who had their NTOs lifted, understand why Abdelhamid is being treated any differently. Unlike Abdelhamid, Urquhart doesn't spend much time on Grounds.\n\n\"It wasn't super high urgency for me to get back on campus,\" Urquhart, who is a local freelance journalist who says he was covering not participating in the protest when he was arrested, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAbdelhamid has been \"incredibly nice\" in all the interactions she's had with him, said Biel, who is an administrative coordinator in the school's Department of Pharmacology. As a UVa employee, she said she's done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo's reasoning.\n\n\"I'm suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,\" said Biel. \"Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.\"\n\nBiel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The \"dragnet\" deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville's Black community and its police department.\n\nWith the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo's decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Mustafa does not want to sue UVa. It's been a decade since he first got here, and all he has wanted to do is contribute to the health and well-being of UVa and the greater Charlottesville community,\" Orians said. \"UVa has left him in a position where he's run out of options except to sue to have his rights respected so he can fulfill his dream to be a health care provider in this community.\"\n\nJason Armesto (717) 599-8470\n\njarmesto@dailyprogress.com\n\n@rmest0 on X\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Lee-national University Of Virginia Asylum Seeker U.s.

And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race.\n\nAbdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Charlottesville Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities.\n\nBut despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid's order, citing \"continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being\" of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination.\n\nBefore receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is something I'm looking forward to because it's going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I'm interested in,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nBut due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation.\n\nAfter learning of Abdelhamid's circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session.\n\n\"I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,\" Coughlin told The Daily Progress. \"My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn't act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.\"\n\nHer repeated requests were denied.\n\nOn Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded.\n\nIt had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program.\n\nHis graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted.\n\nWhen the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC's Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school.\n\nAny person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo.\n\n\"I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,\" Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email.\n\nAbdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4.\n\n\"I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say he's required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo's sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid's appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was \"actively participating\" in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,\" Longo wrote.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\"Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn't wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,\" UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. \"When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.\"\n\nOrians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process. Orians said that, unlike Abdelhamid, other individuals who appealed their NTOs did not include any information about their involvement in the protest, and their NTOs were modified anyway.\n\n\"Candor did not matter in those cases,\" Orians said.\n\nShe also noted that NTOs include a list of boxes that the university police can check off. One of those boxes: the individual demonstrated \"conduct that threatens\" the safety of the UVa community. For Abdelhamid, that box was never checked, indicating university police did not consider him to be a threat.\n\nTwo other arrestees, Cierra Biel and Evan Urquhart, shared their appeal letters with The Daily Progress. Neither letter included an explanation for why they were at the protest, despite the requirement that they offer a \"complete and candid explanation for the conduct that precipitate[d] the Trespass Warning.\"\n\nBoth Biel and Urquhart said they'd been advised by attorneys to withhold that information.\n\nBiel went so far as to write Longo that the university's response against protesting students was an \"overreaction\" as well as \"unjust and unwarranted.\"\n\nBoth Biel's and Urquhart's NTOs were lifted.\n\nLongo wrote them that NTOs are meant to \"mitigate a threat to health and safety.\" He concluded that any risk from Biel or Urquhart had been \"sufficiently mitigated.\"\n\nHe did not reach the same conclusion with Abdelhamid.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt's a conclusion with which the U.S. government disagrees.\n\nAbdelhamid first arrived in the U.S. on a visa that required he return to his home country every six months. He did so until one trip home in the fall of 2015 when he was detained by his home government's authorities.\n\nThey found it suspicious that he was traveling to and from the U.S. every six months. They believed he was a spy. And they found out that during the 2011 Arab Spring, Abdelhamid had been a part of the protests, where he had provided medical assistance to injured protesters. During the revolution, his home government is alleged to have committed many human rights abuses and murdered hundreds of demonstrators.\n\n\"There would be two million people in one square, and police were just shooting at us,\" Abdelhamid recalled.\n\nHe was detained and brutally tortured for more than a week, deprived of sunlight and subjected to torture sessions three to five times per day. It is difficult for Abdelhamid to talk about, and he became choked up when recalling the traumatic period in an interview with The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities only released him under the condition that he be strictly supervised and told him that if he ever returned to the U.S. he would be killed.\n\n\"They made it very clear,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe took the risk anyway, fleeing his home country in 2015.\n\nUpon arriving back at UVa, he told a professor what had happened. He did not understand the complex U.S. immigration system but was terrified of returning home. He wanted to know if he could change his visa so that he would not be required to fly back home every six months, which he feared would effectively be a death sentence.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Abdelhamid was ordered to go to the UVa Police Department where he was questioned by an agent with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. He was released after the interview.\n\nAfter not receiving a response on how to change his visa status, and fearful about returning home, Abdelhamid overstayed his visa. The day after he passed the six-month mark without returning to his home country, he was in the emergency room with his now ex-wife. She was having a miscarriage.\n\nWhile in the ER, Abdelhamid received a call from the same ICE agent who had questioned him previously. She demanded to meet with him immediately. A UVa police officer met Abdelhamid in the ER, forcing him to leave his wife behind. He was escorted from the building, taken to the ICE officer and detained.\n\nSoon after, he was in immigration court for removal proceedings, a hearing where a judge determines whether an individual may remain in the U.S.\n\n\"I stood in front of the immigration judge and told him my situation and why I cannot go back home,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe also got in touch with a nonprofit group that recommended he apply for political asylum. Abdelhamid was released on bond and was granted asylum in October of 2023, after being thoroughly vetted by U.S. law enforcement. The vetting was especially thorough because he had previously been on the \"removal docket\"; asylum seekers who have been involved in removal proceedings are subjected to heavier scrutiny than those who have not.\n\n\"The asylum process is extremely extensive in terms of credibility standards you have to meet to qualify for asylum and the background checks you have to meet with the Department of Homeland Security,\" Karla McKanders, director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities investigate if asylum seekers have any criminal record in the U.S. or abroad; even loose connections with anyone associated with a terrorist organization will result in a denial. And an applicant must also get a green light from an immigration judge.\n\n\"Even if you meet all the criteria, it's in the judge's discretion to deny asylum,\" McKanders said.\n\nAbdelhamid's yearslong ordeal with immigration authorities effectively prevented him from doing a medical residency in the U.S.; priority is given to prospective residents who are within three years of graduating medical school, and it had been eight years since Abdelhamid had graduated from his home university.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, he chose to enroll in the PVCC nursing program.\n\n\"He wanted to do a medical residency to get his full MD here in the United States. And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,\" Orians said. \"So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.\"\n\nMultiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid's NTO be lifted.\n\nUVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid's. UVa also has not released who has and hasn't had their NTOs modified after the events of May 4.\n\nWith his future at stake, people in the UVa community are making regular efforts to have the university reconsider its decision.\n\nOn May 20, the UVa chapter of the American Association of University Professors penned a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan. It asked that the NTO be dropped, or at least modified so Abdelhamid can pursue his education.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the denial of Mr. Abdelhamid's NTO appeal grossly infringes on his student rights,\" reads the letter, \"and unjustly impairs his ability to pursue his education.\"\n\nIt also floats the same possibility that people familiar with Abdelhamid's case have considered: that his appeal was denied because he is Arab.\n\n\"This extremely punitive state of affairs, selectively applied to him, as it appears to us, is prejudicial to his minority status,\" reads the letter.\n\nNeither Biel nor Urquhart, two arrestees who had their NTOs lifted, understand why Abdelhamid is being treated any differently. Unlike Abdelhamid, Urquhart doesn't spend much time on Grounds.\n\n\"It wasn't super high urgency for me to get back on campus,\" Urquhart, who is a local freelance journalist who says he was covering not participating in the protest when he was arrested, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAbdelhamid has been \"incredibly nice\" in all the interactions she's had with him, said Biel, who is an administrative coordinator in the school's Department of Pharmacology. As a UVa employee, she said she's done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo's reasoning.\n\n\"I'm suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,\" said Biel. \"Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.\"\n\nBiel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The \"dragnet\" deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville's Black community and its police department.\n\nWith the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo's decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Mustafa does not want to sue UVa. It's been a decade since he first got here, and all he has wanted to do is contribute to the health and well-being of UVa and the greater Charlottesville community,\" Orians said. \"UVa has left him in a position where he's run out of options except to sue to have his rights respected so he can fulfill his dream to be a health care provider in this community.\"\n\nJason Armesto (717)

And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race.\n\nAbdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Charlottesville Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities.\n\nBut despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid's order, citing \"continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being\" of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination.\n\nBefore receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is something I'm looking forward to because it's going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I'm interested in,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nBut due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation.\n\nAfter learning of Abdelhamid's circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session.\n\n\"I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,\" Coughlin told The Daily Progress. \"My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn't act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.\"\n\nHer repeated requests were denied.\n\nOn Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded.\n\nIt had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program.\n\nHis graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted.\n\nWhen the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC's Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school.\n\nAny person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo.\n\n\"I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,\" Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email.\n\nAbdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4.\n\n\"I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say he's required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo's sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid's appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was \"actively participating\" in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,\" Longo wrote.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\"Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn't wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,\" UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. \"When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.\"\n\nOrians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process. Orians said that, unlike Abdelhamid, other individuals who appealed their NTOs did not include any information about their involvement in the protest, and their NTOs were modified anyway.\n\n\"Candor did not matter in those cases,\" Orians said.\n\nShe also noted that NTOs include a list of boxes that the university police can check off. One of those boxes: the individual demonstrated \"conduct that threatens\" the safety of the UVa community. For Abdelhamid, that box was never checked, indicating university police did not consider him to be a threat.\n\nTwo other arrestees, Cierra Biel and Evan Urquhart, shared their appeal letters with The Daily Progress. Neither letter included an explanation for why they were at the protest, despite the requirement that they offer a \"complete and candid explanation for the conduct that precipitate[d] the Trespass Warning.\"\n\nBoth Biel and Urquhart said they'd been advised by attorneys to withhold that information.\n\nBiel went so far as to write Longo that the university's response against protesting students was an \"overreaction\" as well as \"unjust and unwarranted.\"\n\nBoth Biel's and Urquhart's NTOs were lifted.\n\nLongo wrote them that NTOs are meant to \"mitigate a threat to health and safety.\" He concluded that any risk from Biel or Urquhart had been \"sufficiently mitigated.\"\n\nHe did not reach the same conclusion with Abdelhamid.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt's a conclusion with which the U.S. government disagrees.\n\nAbdelhamid first arrived in the U.S. on a visa that required he return to his home country every six months. He did so until one trip home in the fall of 2015 when he was detained by his home government's authorities.\n\nThey found it suspicious that he was traveling to and from the U.S. every six months. They believed he was a spy. And they found out that during the 2011 Arab Spring, Abdelhamid had been a part of the protests, where he had provided medical assistance to injured protesters. During the revolution, his home government is alleged to have committed many human rights abuses and murdered hundreds of demonstrators.\n\n\"There would be two million people in one square, and police were just shooting at us,\" Abdelhamid recalled.\n\nHe was detained and brutally tortured for more than a week, deprived of sunlight and subjected to torture sessions three to five times per day. It is difficult for Abdelhamid to talk about, and he became choked up when recalling the traumatic period in an interview with The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities only released him under the condition that he be strictly supervised and told him that if he ever returned to the U.S. he would be killed.\n\n\"They made it very clear,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe took the risk anyway, fleeing his home country in 2015.\n\nUpon arriving back at UVa, he told a professor what had happened. He did not understand the complex U.S. immigration system but was terrified of returning home. He wanted to know if he could change his visa so that he would not be required to fly back home every six months, which he feared would effectively be a death sentence.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Abdelhamid was ordered to go to the UVa Police Department where he was questioned by an agent with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. He was released after the interview.\n\nAfter not receiving a response on how to change his visa status, and fearful about returning home, Abdelhamid overstayed his visa. The day after he passed the six-month mark without returning to his home country, he was in the emergency room with his now ex-wife. She was having a miscarriage.\n\nWhile in the ER, Abdelhamid received a call from the same ICE agent who had questioned him previously. She demanded to meet with him immediately. A UVa police officer met Abdelhamid in the ER, forcing him to leave his wife behind. He was escorted from the building, taken to the ICE officer and detained.\n\nSoon after, he was in immigration court for removal proceedings, a hearing where a judge determines whether an individual may remain in the U.S.\n\n\"I stood in front of the immigration judge and told him my situation and why I cannot go back home,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe also got in touch with a nonprofit group that recommended he apply for political asylum. Abdelhamid was released on bond and was granted asylum in October of 2023, after being thoroughly vetted by U.S. law enforcement. The vetting was especially thorough because he had previously been on the \"removal docket\"; asylum seekers who have been involved in removal proceedings are subjected to heavier scrutiny than those who have not.\n\n\"The asylum process is extremely extensive in terms of credibility standards you have to meet to qualify for asylum and the background checks you have to meet with the Department of Homeland Security,\" Karla McKanders, director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities investigate if asylum seekers have any criminal record in the U.S. or abroad; even loose connections with anyone associated with a terrorist organization will result in a denial. And an applicant must also get a green light from an immigration judge.\n\n\"Even if you meet all the criteria, it's in the judge's discretion to deny asylum,\" McKanders said.\n\nAbdelhamid's yearslong ordeal with immigration authorities effectively prevented him from doing a medical residency in the U.S.; priority is given to prospective residents who are within three years of graduating medical school, and it had been eight years since Abdelhamid had graduated from his home university.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, he chose to enroll in the PVCC nursing program.\n\n\"He wanted to do a medical residency to get his full MD here in the United States. And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,\" Orians said. \"So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.\"\n\nMultiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid's NTO be lifted.\n\nUVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid's. UVa also has not released who has and hasn't had their NTOs modified after the events of May 4.\n\nWith his future at stake, people in the UVa community are making regular efforts to have the university reconsider its decision.\n\nOn May 20, the UVa chapter of the American Association of University Professors penned a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan. It asked that the NTO be dropped, or at least modified so Abdelhamid can pursue his education.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the denial of Mr. Abdelhamid's NTO appeal grossly infringes on his student rights,\" reads the letter, \"and unjustly impairs his ability to pursue his education.\"\n\nIt also floats the same possibility that people familiar with Abdelhamid's case have considered: that his appeal was denied because he is Arab.\n\n\"This extremely punitive state of affairs, selectively applied to him, as it appears to us, is prejudicial to his minority status,\" reads the letter.\n\nNeither Biel nor Urquhart, two arrestees who had their NTOs lifted, understand why Abdelhamid is being treated any differently. Unlike Abdelhamid, Urquhart doesn't spend much time on Grounds.\n\n\"It wasn't super high urgency for me to get back on campus,\" Urquhart, who is a local freelance journalist who says he was covering not participating in the protest when he was arrested, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAbdelhamid has been \"incredibly nice\" in all the interactions she's had with him, said Biel, who is an administrative coordinator in the school's Department of Pharmacology. As a UVa employee, she said she's done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo's reasoning.\n\n\"I'm suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,\" said Biel. \"Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.\"\n\nBiel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The \"dragnet\" deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville's Black community and its police department.\n\nWith the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo's decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Mustafa does not want to sue UVa. It's been a decade since he first got here, and all he has wanted to do is contribute to the health and well-being of UVa and the greater Charlottesville community,\" Orians said. \"UVa has left him in a position where he's run out of options except to sue to have his rights respected so he can fulfill his dream to be a health care provider in this community.\"\n\nJason Armesto (717) 599-8470\n\njarmesto@dailyprogress.com\n\n@rmest0 on X\n\nTags Lee-national University Of Virginia Asylum Seeker U.s.

Nevertheless, his life could be forever changed by it. JASON ARMESTO Charlottesville Daily Progress\n\nA nursing student arrested during a May 4 anti-war protest at the University of Virginia is still being denied access to Grounds, a prohibition that has already cost him a job and could result in him failing his academic program.\n\nA total of 27 people were arrested when Virginia State Police broke up an encampment of protesters opposed to Israel's monthslong war with Palestinian terror group Hamas, which has killed tens of thousands of people since Hamas launched a surprise attack on the country on Oct. 7. That total arrest number includes some who say they were never part of the protest but were in the area of the encampment when state police arrived. UVa issued all 27 who were arrested \"no trespass\" orders, or NTOs, preventing them from legally returning to Grounds. Most of those orders have since been lifted or modified.\n\nMustafa Abdelhamid's has not.\n\nAbdelhamid, who has now filed suit against the university, claims he was not participating in the protest but completing a delivery order near the encampment. And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race.\n\nAbdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities.\n\nBut despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid's order, citing \"continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being\" of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination.\n\nBefore receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is something I'm looking forward to because it's going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I'm interested in,\" Abdelhamid told The Daily Progress.\n\nBut due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation.\n\nAfter learning of Abdelhamid's circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session.\n\n\"I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,\" Coughlin told The Daily Progress. \"My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn't act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.\"\n\nHer repeated requests were denied.\n\nOn Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded.\n\nIt had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program.\n\nHis graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted.\n\nWhen the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC's Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school.\n\nAny person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo.\n\n\"I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,\" Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email.\n\nAbdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4.\n\n\"I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say he's required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo's sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid's appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was \"actively participating\" in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,\" Longo wrote.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\"Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn't wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,\" UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. \"When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.\"\n\nOrians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process.

She was having a miscarriage.\n\nWhile in the ER, Abdelhamid received a call from the same ICE agent who had questioned him previously. She demanded to meet with him immediately. A UVa police officer met Abdelhamid in the ER, forcing him to leave his wife behind. He was escorted from the building, taken to the ICE officer and detained.\n\nSoon after, he was in immigration court for removal proceedings, a hearing where a judge determines whether an individual may remain in the U.S.\n\n\"I stood in front of the immigration judge and told him my situation and why I cannot go back home,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe also got in touch with a nonprofit group that recommended he apply for political asylum. Abdelhamid was released on bond and was granted asylum in October of 2023, after being thoroughly vetted by U.S. law enforcement. The vetting was especially thorough because he had previously been on the \"removal docket\"; asylum seekers who have been involved in removal proceedings are subjected to heavier scrutiny than those who have not.\n\n\"The asylum process is extremely extensive in terms of credibility standards you have to meet to qualify for asylum and the background checks you have to meet with the Department of Homeland Security,\" Karla McKanders, director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities investigate if asylum seekers have any criminal record in the U.S. or abroad; even loose connections with anyone associated with a terrorist organization will result in a denial. And an applicant must also get a green light from an immigration judge.\n\n\"Even if you meet all the criteria, it's in the judge's discretion to deny asylum,\" McKanders said.\n\nAbdelhamid's yearslong ordeal with immigration authorities effectively prevented him from doing a medical residency in the U.S.; priority is given to prospective residents who are within three years of graduating medical school, and it had been eight years since Abdelhamid had graduated from his home university.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, he chose to enroll in the PVCC nursing program.\n\n\"He wanted to do a medical residency to get his full MD here in the United States. And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,\" Orians said. \"So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.\"\n\nMultiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid's NTO be lifted.\n\nUVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid's. UVa also has not released who has and hasn't had their NTOs modified after the events of May 4.\n\nWith his future at stake, people in the UVa community are making regular efforts to have the university reconsider its decision.\n\nOn May 20, the UVa chapter of the American Association of University Professors penned a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan. It asked that the NTO be dropped, or at least modified so Abdelhamid can pursue his education.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the denial of Mr. Abdelhamid's NTO appeal grossly infringes on his student rights,\" reads the letter, \"and unjustly impairs his ability to pursue his education.\"\n\nIt also floats the same possibility that people familiar with Abdelhamid's case have considered: that his appeal was denied because he is Arab.\n\n\"This extremely punitive state of affairs, selectively applied to him, as it appears to us, is prejudicial to his minority status,\" reads the letter.\n\nNeither Biel nor Urquhart, two arrestees who had their NTOs lifted, understand why Abdelhamid is being treated any differently. Unlike Abdelhamid, Urquhart doesn't spend much time on Grounds.\n\n\"It wasn't super high urgency for me to get back on campus,\" Urquhart, who is a local freelance journalist who says he was covering not participating in the protest when he was arrested, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAbdelhamid has been \"incredibly nice\" in all the interactions she's had with him, said Biel, who is an administrative coordinator in the school's Department of Pharmacology. As a UVa employee, she said she's done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo's reasoning.\n\n\"I'm suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,\" said Biel. \"Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.\"\n\nBiel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The \"dragnet\" deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville's Black community and its police department.\n\nWith the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo's decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Mustafa does not want to sue UVa. It's been a decade since he first got here, and all he has wanted to do is contribute to the health and well-being of UVa and the greater Charlottesville community,\" Orians said. \"UVa has left him in a position where he's run out of options except to sue to have his rights respected so he can fulfill his dream to be a health care provider in this community.\"\n\nJason Armesto (717) 599-8470\n\njarmesto@dailyprogress.com\n\n@rmest0 on X\n\nTags Lee-national Asylum Seeker University Of Virginia U.s.

That total arrest number includes some who say they were never part of the protest but were in the area of the encampment when state police arrived. UVa issued all 27 who were arrested \"no trespass\" orders, or NTOs, preventing them from legally returning to Grounds. Most of those orders have since been lifted or modified.\n\nMustafa Abdelhamid's has not.\n\nPeople are also reading...

And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race.\n\nAbdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Charlottesville Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities.\n\nBut despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid's order, citing \"continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being\" of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination.\n\nBefore receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is something I'm looking forward to because it's going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I'm interested in,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nBut due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation.\n\nAfter learning of Abdelhamid's circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session.\n\n\"I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,\" Coughlin told The Daily Progress. \"My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn't act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.\"\n\nHer repeated requests were denied.\n\nOn Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded.\n\nIt had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program.\n\nHis graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted.\n\nWhen the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC's Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school.\n\nAny person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo.\n\n\"I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,\" Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email.\n\nAbdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4.\n\n\"I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say he's required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo's sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid's appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was \"actively participating\" in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,\" Longo wrote.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\"Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn't wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,\" UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. \"When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.\"\n\nOrians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process. Orians said that, unlike Abdelhamid, other individuals who appealed their NTOs did not include any information about their involvement in the protest, and their NTOs were modified anyway.\n\n\"Candor did not matter in those cases,\" Orians said.\n\nShe also noted that NTOs include a list of boxes that the university police can check off. One of those boxes: the individual demonstrated \"conduct that threatens\" the safety of the UVa community. For Abdelhamid, that box was never checked, indicating university police did not consider him to be a threat.\n\nTwo other arrestees, Cierra Biel and Evan Urquhart, shared their appeal letters with The Daily Progress. Neither letter included an explanation for why they were at the protest, despite the requirement that they offer a \"complete and candid explanation for the conduct that precipitate[d] the Trespass Warning.\"\n\nBoth Biel and Urquhart said they'd been advised by attorneys to withhold that information.\n\nBiel went so far as to write Longo that the university's response against protesting students was an \"overreaction\" as well as \"unjust and unwarranted.\"\n\nBoth Biel's and Urquhart's NTOs were lifted.\n\nLongo wrote them that NTOs are meant to \"mitigate a threat to health and safety.\" He concluded that any risk from Biel or Urquhart had been \"sufficiently mitigated.\"\n\nHe did not reach the same conclusion with Abdelhamid.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt's a conclusion with which the U.S. government disagrees.\n\nAbdelhamid first arrived in the U.S. on a visa that required he return to his home country every six months. He did so until one trip home in the fall of 2015 when he was detained by his home government's authorities.\n\nThey found it suspicious that he was traveling to and from the U.S. every six months. They believed he was a spy. And they found out that during the 2011 Arab Spring, Abdelhamid had been a part of the protests, where he had provided medical assistance to injured protesters. During the revolution, his home government is alleged to have committed many human rights abuses and murdered hundreds of demonstrators.\n\n\"There would be two million people in one square, and police were just shooting at us,\" Abdelhamid recalled.\n\nHe was detained and brutally tortured for more than a week, deprived of sunlight and subjected to torture sessions three to five times per day. It is difficult for Abdelhamid to talk about, and he became choked up when recalling the traumatic period in an interview with The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities only released him under the condition that he be strictly supervised and told him that if he ever returned to the U.S. he would be killed.\n\n\"They made it very clear,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe took the risk anyway, fleeing his home country in 2015.\n\nUpon arriving back at UVa, he told a professor what had happened. He did not understand the complex U.S. immigration system but was terrified of returning home. He wanted to know if he could change his visa so that he would not be required to fly back home every six months, which he feared would effectively be a death sentence.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Abdelhamid was ordered to go to the UVa Police Department where he was questioned by an agent with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. He was released after the interview.\n\nAfter not receiving a response on how to change his visa status, and fearful about returning home, Abdelhamid overstayed his visa. The day after he passed the six-month mark without returning to his home country, he was in the emergency room with his now ex-wife. She was having a miscarriage.\n\nWhile in the ER, Abdelhamid received a call from the same ICE agent who had questioned him previously. She demanded to meet with him immediately. A UVa police officer met Abdelhamid in the ER, forcing him to leave his wife behind. He was escorted from the building, taken to the ICE officer and detained.\n\nSoon after, he was in immigration court for removal proceedings, a hearing where a judge determines whether an individual may remain in the U.S.\n\n\"I stood in front of the immigration judge and told him my situation and why I cannot go back home,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe also got in touch with a nonprofit group that recommended he apply for political asylum. Abdelhamid was released on bond and was granted asylum in October of 2023, after being thoroughly vetted by U.S. law enforcement. The vetting was especially thorough because he had previously been on the \"removal docket\"; asylum seekers who have been involved in removal proceedings are subjected to heavier scrutiny than those who have not.\n\n\"The asylum process is extremely extensive in terms of credibility standards you have to meet to qualify for asylum and the background checks you have to meet with the Department of Homeland Security,\" Karla McKanders, director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities investigate if asylum seekers have any criminal record in the U.S. or abroad; even loose connections with anyone associated with a terrorist organization will result in a denial. And an applicant must also get a green light from an immigration judge.\n\n\"Even if you meet all the criteria, it's in the judge's discretion to deny asylum,\" McKanders said.\n\nAbdelhamid's yearslong ordeal with immigration authorities effectively prevented him from doing a medical residency in the U.S.; priority is given to prospective residents who are within three years of graduating medical school, and it had been eight years since Abdelhamid had graduated from his home university.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, he chose to enroll in the PVCC nursing program.\n\n\"He wanted to do a medical residency to get his full MD here in the United States. And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,\" Orians said. \"So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.\"\n\nMultiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid's NTO be lifted.\n\nUVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid's.

As a UVa employee, she said she's done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo's reasoning.\n\n\"I'm suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,\" said Biel. \"Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.\"\n\nBiel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The \"dragnet\" deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville's Black community and its police department.\n\nWith the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo's decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Mustafa does not want to sue UVa. It's been a decade since he first got here, and all he has wanted to do is contribute to the health and well-being of UVa and the greater Charlottesville community,\" Orians said. \"UVa has left him

That total arrest number includes some who say they were never part of the protest but were in the area of the encampment when state police arrived. UVa issued all 27 who were arrested \"no trespass\" orders, or NTOs, preventing them from legally returning to Grounds. Most of those orders have since been lifted or modified.\n\nMustafa Abdelhamid's has not.\n\nPeople are also reading...

And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race.\n\nAbdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Charlottesville Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities.\n\nBut despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid's order, citing \"continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being\" of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination.\n\nBefore receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is something I'm looking forward to because it's going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I'm interested in,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nBut due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation.\n\nAfter learning of Abdelhamid's circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session.\n\n\"I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,\" Coughlin told The Daily Progress. \"My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn't act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.\"\n\nHer repeated requests were denied.\n\nOn Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded.\n\nIt had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program.\n\nHis graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted.\n\nWhen the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC's Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school.\n\nAny person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo.\n\n\"I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,\" Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email.\n\nAbdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4.\n\n\"I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say he's required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo's sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid's appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was \"actively participating\" in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,\" Longo wrote.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\"Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn't wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,\" UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. \"When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.\"\n\nOrians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process. Orians said that, unlike Abdelhamid, other individuals who appealed their NTOs did not include any information about their involvement in the protest, and their NTOs were modified anyway.\n\n\"Candor did not matter in those cases,\" Orians said.\n\nShe also noted that NTOs include a list of boxes that the university police can check off. One of those boxes: the individual demonstrated \"conduct that threatens\" the safety of the UVa community. For Abdelhamid, that box was never checked, indicating university police did not consider him to be a threat.\n\nTwo other arrestees, Cierra Biel and Evan Urquhart, shared their appeal letters with The Daily Progress. Neither letter included an explanation for why they were at the protest, despite the requirement that they offer a \"complete and candid explanation for the conduct that precipitate[d] the Trespass Warning.\"\n\nBoth Biel and Urquhart said they'd been advised by attorneys to withhold that information.\n\nBiel went so far as to write Longo that the university's response against protesting students was an \"overreaction\" as well as \"unjust and unwarranted.\"\n\nBoth Biel's and Urquhart's NTOs were lifted.\n\nLongo wrote them that NTOs are meant to \"mitigate a threat to health and safety.\" He concluded that any risk from Biel or Urquhart had been \"sufficiently mitigated.\"\n\nHe did not reach the same conclusion with Abdelhamid.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt's a conclusion with which the U.S. government disagrees.\n\nAbdelhamid first arrived in the U.S. on a visa that required he return to his home country every six months. He did so until one trip home in the fall of 2015 when he was detained by his home government's authorities.\n\nThey found it suspicious that he was traveling to and from the U.S. every six months. They believed he was a spy. And they found out that during the 2011 Arab Spring, Abdelhamid had been a part of the protests, where he had provided medical assistance to injured protesters. During the revolution, his home government is alleged to have committed many human rights abuses and murdered hundreds of demonstrators.\n\n\"There would be two million people in one square, and police were just shooting at us,\" Abdelhamid recalled.\n\nHe was detained and brutally tortured for more than a week, deprived of sunlight and subjected to torture sessions three to five times per day. It is difficult for Abdelhamid to talk about, and he became choked up when recalling the traumatic period in an interview with The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities only released him under the condition that he be strictly supervised and told him that if he ever returned to the U.S. he would be killed.\n\n\"They made it very clear,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe took the risk anyway, fleeing his home country in 2015.\n\nUpon arriving back at UVa, he told a professor what had happened. He did not understand the complex U.S. immigration system but was terrified of returning home. He wanted to know if he could change his visa so that he would not be required to fly back home every six months, which he feared would effectively be a death sentence.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Abdelhamid was ordered to go to the UVa Police Department where he was questioned by an agent with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. He was released after the interview.\n\nAfter not receiving a response on how to change his visa status, and fearful about returning home, Abdelhamid overstayed his visa. The day after he passed the six-month mark without returning to his home country, he was in the emergency room with his now ex-wife. She was having a miscarriage.\n\nWhile in the ER, Abdelhamid received a call from the same ICE agent who had questioned him previously. She demanded to meet with him immediately. A UVa police officer met Abdelhamid in the ER, forcing him to leave his wife behind. He was escorted from the building, taken to the ICE officer and detained.\n\nSoon after, he was in immigration court for removal proceedings, a hearing where a judge determines whether an individual may remain in the U.S.\n\n\"I stood in front of the immigration judge and told him my situation and why I cannot go back home,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe also got in touch with a nonprofit group that recommended he apply for political asylum. Abdelhamid was released on bond and was granted asylum in October of 2023, after being thoroughly vetted by U.S. law enforcement. The vetting was especially thorough because he had previously been on the \"removal docket\"; asylum seekers who have been involved in removal proceedings are subjected to heavier scrutiny than those who have not.\n\n\"The asylum process is extremely extensive in terms of credibility standards you have to meet to qualify for asylum and the background checks you have to meet with the Department of Homeland Security,\" Karla McKanders, director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities investigate if asylum seekers have any criminal record in the U.S. or abroad; even loose connections with anyone associated with a terrorist organization will result in a denial. And an applicant must also get a green light from an immigration judge.\n\n\"Even if you meet all the criteria, it's in the judge's discretion to deny asylum,\" McKanders said.\n\nAbdelhamid's yearslong ordeal with immigration authorities effectively prevented him from doing a medical residency in the U.S.; priority is given to prospective residents who are within three years of graduating medical school, and it had been eight years since Abdelhamid had graduated from his home university.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, he chose to enroll in the PVCC nursing program.\n\n\"He wanted to do a medical residency to get his full MD here in the United States. And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,\" Orians said. \"So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.\"\n\nMultiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid's NTO be lifted.\n\nUVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid's. UVa also has not released who has and hasn't had their NTOs modified after the events of May 4.\n\nWith his future at stake, people in the UVa community are making regular efforts to have the university reconsider its decision.\n\nOn May 20, the UVa chapter of the American Association of University Professors penned a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan. It asked that the NTO be dropped, or at least modified so Abdelhamid can pursue his education.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the denial of Mr. Abdelhamid's NTO appeal grossly infringes on his student rights,\" reads the letter, \"and unjustly impairs his ability to pursue his education.\"\n\nIt also floats the same possibility that people familiar with Abdelhamid's case have considered: that his appeal was denied because he is Arab.\n\n\"This extremely punitive state of affairs, selectively applied to him, as it appears to us, is prejudicial to his minority status,\" reads the letter.\n\nNeither Biel nor Urquhart, two arrestees who had their NTOs lifted, understand why Abdelhamid is being treated any differently. Unlike Abdelhamid, Urquhart doesn't spend much time on Grounds.\n\n\"It wasn't super high urgency for me to get back on campus,\" Urquhart, who is a local freelance journalist who says he was covering not participating in the protest when he was arrested, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAbdelhamid has been \"incredibly nice\" in all the interactions she's had with him, said Biel, who is an administrative coordinator in the school's Department of Pharmacology. As a UVa employee, she said she's done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo's reasoning.\n\n\"I'm suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,\" said Biel. \"Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.\"\n\nBiel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The \"dragnet\" deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville's Black community and its police department.\n\nWith the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo's decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Mustafa does not want to sue UVa.

Nevertheless, his life could be forever changed by it.\n\nA nursing student arrested during a May 4 anti-war protest at the University of Virginia is still being denied access to Grounds, a prohibition that has already cost him a job and could result in him failing his academic program.\n\nA total of 27 people were arrested when Virginia State Police broke up an encampment of protesters opposed to Israel's monthslong war with Palestinian terror group Hamas, which has killed tens of thousands of people since Hamas launched a surprise attack on the country on Oct. 7. That total arrest number includes some who say they were never part of the protest but were in the area of the encampment when state police arrived. UVa issued all 27 who were arrested \"no trespass\" orders, or NTOs, preventing them from legally returning to Grounds. Most of those orders have since been lifted or modified.\n\nMustafa Abdelhamid's has not.\n\nSt. Louis alt-weekly Riverfront Times sold, lays off all staff Sisters, 8 and 10, who died in wreck on I-270 were best friends, family says The end of Riverfront Times brings shock, sense of loss.

It's time for Cardinals to swing trade for rotation help.\n\nAbdelhamid, who has now filed suit against the university, claims he was not participating in the protest but completing a delivery order near the encampment. And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race.\n\nAbdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Charlottesville Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities.\n\nBut despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid's order, citing \"continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being\" of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination.\n\nBefore receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is something I'm looking forward to because it's going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I'm interested in,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nBut due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation.\n\nAfter learning of Abdelhamid's circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session.\n\n\"I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,\" Coughlin told The Daily Progress. \"My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn't act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.\"\n\nHer repeated requests were denied.\n\nOn Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded.\n\nIt had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program.\n\nHis graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted.\n\nWhen the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC's Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school.\n\nAny person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo.\n\n\"I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,\" Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email.\n\nAbdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4.\n\n\"I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say he's required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo's sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid's appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was \"actively participating\" in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,\" Longo wrote.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\"Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn't wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,\" UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. \"When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.\"\n\nOrians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process. Orians said that, unlike Abdelhamid, other individuals who appealed their NTOs did not include any information about their involvement in the protest, and their NTOs were modified anyway.\n\n\"Candor did not matter in those cases,\" Orians said.\n\nShe also noted that NTOs include a list of boxes that the university police can check off. One of those boxes: the individual demonstrated \"conduct that threatens\" the safety of the UVa community. For Abdelhamid, that box was never checked, indicating university police did not consider him to be a threat.\n\nTwo other arrestees, Cierra Biel and Evan Urquhart, shared their appeal letters with The Daily Progress. Neither letter included an explanation for why they were at the protest, despite the requirement that they offer a \"complete and candid explanation for the conduct that precipitate[d] the Trespass Warning.\"\n\nBoth Biel and Urquhart said they'd been advised by attorneys to withhold that information.\n\nBiel went so far as to write Longo that the university's response against protesting students was an \"overreaction\" as well as \"unjust and unwarranted.\"\n\nBoth Biel's and Urquhart's NTOs were lifted.\n\nLongo wrote them that NTOs are meant to \"mitigate a threat to health and safety.\" He concluded that any risk from Biel or Urquhart had been \"sufficiently mitigated.\"\n\nHe did not reach the same conclusion with Abdelhamid.\n\nIt's a conclusion with which the U.S. government disagrees.\n\nAbdelhamid first arrived in the U.S. on a visa that required he return to his home country every six months. He did so until one trip home in the fall of 2015 when he was detained by his home government's authorities.\n\nThey found it suspicious that he was traveling to and from the U.S. every six months. They believed he was a spy. And they found out that during the 2011 Arab Spring, Abdelhamid had been a part of the protests, where he had provided medical assistance to injured protesters. During the revolution, his home government is alleged to have committed many human rights abuses and murdered hundreds of demonstrators.\n\n\"There would be two million people in one square, and police were just shooting at us,\" Abdelhamid recalled.\n\nHe was detained and brutally tortured for more than a week, deprived of sunlight and subjected to torture sessions three to five times per day. It is difficult for Abdelhamid to talk about, and he became choked up when recalling the traumatic period in an interview with The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities only released him under the condition that he be strictly supervised and told him that if he ever returned to the U.S. he would be killed.\n\n\"They made it very clear,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe took the risk anyway, fleeing his home country in 2015.\n\nUpon arriving back at UVa, he told a professor what had happened. He did not understand the complex U.S. immigration system but was terrified of returning home. He wanted to know if he could change his visa so that he would not be required to fly back home every six months, which he feared would effectively be a death sentence.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Abdelhamid was ordered to go to the UVa Police Department where he was questioned by an agent with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. He was released after the interview.\n\nAfter not receiving a response on how to change his visa status, and fearful about returning home, Abdelhamid overstayed his visa. The day after he passed the six-month mark without returning to his home country, he was in the emergency room with his now ex-wife. She was having a miscarriage.\n\nWhile in the ER, Abdelhamid received a call from the same ICE agent who had questioned him previously. She demanded to meet with him immediately. A UVa police officer met Abdelhamid in the ER, forcing him to leave his wife behind. He was escorted from the building, taken to the ICE officer and detained.\n\nSoon after, he was in immigration court for removal proceedings, a hearing where a judge determines whether an individual may remain in the U.S.\n\n\"I stood in front of the immigration judge and told him my situation and why I cannot go back home,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe also got in touch with a nonprofit group that recommended he apply for political asylum. Abdelhamid was released on bond and was granted asylum in October of 2023, after being thoroughly vetted by U.S. law enforcement. The vetting was especially thorough because he had previously been on the \"removal docket\"; asylum seekers who have been involved in removal proceedings are subjected to heavier scrutiny than those who have not.\n\n\"The asylum process is extremely extensive in terms of credibility standards you have to meet to qualify for asylum and the background checks you have to meet with the Department of Homeland Security,\" Karla McKanders, director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities investigate if asylum seekers have any criminal record in the U.S. or abroad; even loose connections with anyone associated with a terrorist organization will result in a denial. And an applicant must also get a green light from an immigration judge.\n\n\"Even if you meet all the criteria, it's in the judge's discretion to deny asylum,\" McKanders said.\n\nAbdelhamid's yearslong ordeal with immigration authorities effectively prevented him from doing a medical residency in the U.S.; priority is given to prospective residents who are within three years of graduating medical school, and it had been eight years since Abdelhamid had graduated from his home university.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, he chose to enroll in the PVCC nursing program.\n\n\"He wanted to do a medical residency to get his full MD here in the United States. And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,\" Orians said. \"So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.\"\n\nMultiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid's NTO be lifted.\n\nUVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid's. UVa also has not released who has and hasn't had their NTOs modified after the events of May 4.\n\nWith his future at stake, people in the UVa community are making regular efforts to have the university reconsider its decision.\n\nOn May 20, the UVa chapter of the American Association of University Professors penned a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan. It asked that the NTO be dropped, or at least modified so Abdelhamid can pursue his education.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the denial of Mr. Abdelhamid's NTO appeal grossly infringes on his student rights,\" reads the letter, \"and unjustly impairs his ability to pursue his education.\"\n\nIt also floats the same possibility that people familiar with Abdelhamid's case have considered: that his appeal was denied because he is Arab.\n\n\"This extremely punitive state of affairs, selectively applied to him, as it appears to us, is prejudicial to his minority status,\" reads the letter.\n\nNeither Biel nor Urquhart, two arrestees who had their NTOs lifted, understand why Abdelhamid is being treated any differently. Unlike Abdelhamid, Urquhart doesn't spend much time on Grounds.\n\n\"It wasn't super high urgency for me to get back on campus,\" Urquhart, who is a local freelance journalist who says he was covering not participating in the protest when he was arrested, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAbdelhamid has been \"incredibly nice\" in all the interactions she's had with him, said Biel, who is an administrative coordinator in the school's Department of Pharmacology. As a UVa employee, she said she's done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo's reasoning.\n\n\"I'm suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,\" said Biel. \"Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.\"\n\nBiel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The \"dragnet\" deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville's Black community and its police department.\n\nWith the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo's decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Mustafa does not want to sue UVa. It's been a decade since he first got here, and all he has wanted to do is contribute to the health and well-being of UVa and the greater Charlottesville community,\" Orians said. \"UVa has left him in a position where he's run out of options except to sue to have his rights respected so he can fulfill his dream to be a health care provider in this community.\"\n\nJason Armesto (717)

That total arrest number includes some who say they were never part of the protest but were in the area of the encampment when state police arrived. UVa issued all 27 who were arrested \"no trespass\" orders, or NTOs, preventing them from legally returning to Grounds. Most of those orders have since been lifted or modified.\n\nMustafa Abdelhamid's has not.\n\nPeople are also reading...

And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race.\n\nAbdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities.\n\nBut despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid's order, citing \"continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being\" of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination.\n\nBefore receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is something I'm looking forward to because it's going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I'm interested in,\" Abdelhamid told The Daily Progress.\n\nBut due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation.\n\nAfter learning of Abdelhamid's circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session.\n\n\"I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,\" Coughlin told The Daily Progress. \"My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn't act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.\"\n\nHer repeated requests were denied.\n\nOn Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded.\n\nIt had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program.\n\nHis graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted.\n\nWhen the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC's Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school.\n\nAny person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo.\n\n\"I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,\" Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email.\n\nAbdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4.\n\n\"I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say he's required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo's sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid's appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was \"actively participating\" in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,\" Longo wrote.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\"Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn't wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,\" UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. \"When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.\"\n\nOrians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process. Orians said that, unlike Abdelhamid, other individuals who appealed their NTOs did not include any information about their involvement in the protest, and their NTOs were modified anyway.\n\n\"Candor did not matter in those cases,\" Orians said.\n\nShe also noted that NTOs include a list of boxes that the university police can check off. One of those boxes: the individual demonstrated \"conduct that threatens\" the safety of the UVa community. For Abdelhamid, that box was never checked, indicating university police did not consider him to be a threat.\n\nTwo other arrestees, Cierra Biel and Evan Urquhart, shared their appeal letters with The Daily Progress. Neither letter included an explanation for why they were at the protest, despite the requirement that they offer a \"complete and candid explanation for the conduct that precipitate[d] the Trespass Warning.\"\n\nBoth Biel and Urquhart said they'd been advised by attorneys to withhold that information.\n\nBiel went so far as to write Longo that the university's response against protesting students was an \"overreaction\" as well as \"unjust and unwarranted.\"\n\nBoth Biel's and Urquhart's NTOs were lifted.\n\nLongo wrote them that NTOs are meant to \"mitigate a threat to health and safety.\" He concluded that any risk from Biel or Urquhart had been \"sufficiently mitigated.\"\n\nHe did not reach the same conclusion with Abdelhamid.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt's a conclusion with which the U.S. government disagrees.\n\nAbdelhamid first arrived in the U.S. on a visa that required he return to his home country every six months. He did so until one trip home in the fall of 2015 when he was detained by his home government's authorities.\n\nThey found it suspicious that he was traveling to and from the U.S. every six months. They believed he was a spy. And they found out that during the 2011 Arab Spring, Abdelhamid had been a part of the protests, where he had provided medical assistance to injured protesters. During the revolution, his home government is alleged to have committed many human rights abuses and murdered hundreds of demonstrators.\n\n\"There would be two million people in one square, and police were just shooting at us,\" Abdelhamid recalled.\n\nHe was detained and brutally tortured for more than a week, deprived of sunlight and subjected to torture sessions three to five times per day. It is difficult for Abdelhamid to talk about, and he became choked up when recalling the traumatic period in an interview with The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities only released him under the condition that he be strictly supervised and told him that if he ever returned to the U.S. he would be killed.\n\n\"They made it very clear,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe took the risk anyway, fleeing his home country in 2015.\n\nUpon arriving back at UVa, he told a professor what had happened. He did not understand the complex U.S. immigration system but was terrified of returning home. He wanted to know if he could change his visa so that he would not be required to fly back home every six months, which he feared would effectively be a death sentence.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Abdelhamid was ordered to go to the UVa Police Department where he was questioned by an agent with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. He was released after the interview.\n\nAfter not receiving a response on how to change his visa status, and fearful about returning home, Abdelhamid overstayed his visa. The day after he passed the six-month mark without returning to his home country, he was in the emergency room with his now ex-wife. She was having a miscarriage.\n\nWhile in the ER, Abdelhamid received a call from the same ICE agent who had questioned him previously. She demanded to meet with him immediately. A UVa police officer met Abdelhamid in the ER, forcing him to leave his wife behind. He was escorted from the building, taken to the ICE officer and detained.\n\nSoon after, he was in immigration court for removal proceedings, a hearing where a judge determines whether an individual may remain in the U.S.\n\n\"I stood in front of the immigration judge and told him my situation and why I cannot go back home,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe also got in touch with a nonprofit group that recommended he apply for political asylum. Abdelhamid was released on bond and was granted asylum in October of 2023, after being thoroughly vetted by U.S. law enforcement. The vetting was especially thorough because he had previously been on the \"removal docket\"; asylum seekers who have been involved in removal proceedings are subjected to heavier scrutiny than those who have not.\n\n\"The asylum process is extremely extensive in terms of credibility standards you have to meet to qualify for asylum and the background checks you have to meet with the Department of Homeland Security,\" Karla McKanders, director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities investigate if asylum seekers have any criminal record in the U.S. or abroad; even loose connections with anyone associated with a terrorist organization will result in a denial. And an applicant must also get a green light from an immigration judge.\n\n\"Even if you meet all the criteria, it's in the judge's discretion to deny asylum,\" McKanders said.\n\nAbdelhamid's yearslong ordeal with immigration authorities effectively prevented him from doing a medical residency in the U.S.; priority is given to prospective residents who are within three years of graduating medical school, and it had been eight years since Abdelhamid had graduated from his home university.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, he chose to enroll in the PVCC nursing program.\n\n\"He wanted to do a medical residency to get his full MD here in the United States. And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,\" Orians said. \"So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.\"\n\nMultiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid's NTO be lifted.\n\nUVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid's. UVa also has not released who has and hasn't had their NTOs modified after the events of May 4.\n\nWith his future at stake, people in the UVa community are making regular efforts to have the university reconsider its decision.\n\nOn May 20, the UVa chapter of the American Association of University Professors penned a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan. It asked that the NTO be dropped, or at least modified so Abdelhamid can pursue his education.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the denial of Mr. Abdelhamid's NTO appeal grossly infringes on his student rights,\" reads the letter, \"and unjustly impairs his ability to pursue his education.\"\n\nIt also floats the same possibility that people familiar with Abdelhamid's case have considered: that his appeal was denied because he is Arab.\n\n\"This extremely punitive state of affairs, selectively applied to him, as it appears to us, is prejudicial to his minority status,\" reads the letter.\n\nNeither Biel nor Urquhart, two arrestees who had their NTOs lifted, understand why Abdelhamid is being treated any differently. Unlike Abdelhamid, Urquhart doesn't spend much time on Grounds.\n\n\"It wasn't super high urgency for me to get back on campus,\" Urquhart, who is a local freelance journalist who says he was covering not participating in the protest when he was arrested, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAbdelhamid has been \"incredibly nice\" in all the interactions she's had with him, said Biel, who is an administrative coordinator in the school's Department of Pharmacology. As a UVa employee, she said she's done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo's reasoning.\n\n\"I'm suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,\" said Biel. \"Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.\"\n\nBiel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The \"dragnet\" deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville's Black community and its police department.\n\nWith the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo's decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Mustafa does not want to sue UVa. It's been a decade since he first got here, and all he has wanted to do is contribute to the health and well-being of UVa and the greater Charlottesville community,\" Orians said. \"UVa has left him in a position where he's run out of options except to sue to have his rights respected so he can fulfill his dream to be a health care provider in this community.\"\n\nJason Armesto (717)

That total arrest number includes some who say they were never part of the protest but were in the area of the encampment when state police arrived. UVa issued all 27 who were arrested \"no trespass\" orders, or NTOs, preventing them from legally returning to Grounds. Most of those orders have since been lifted or modified.\n\nMustafa Abdelhamid's has not.\n\nAbdelhamid, who has now filed suit against the university, claims he was not participating in the protest but completing a delivery order near the encampment. And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race.\n\nAbdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities.\n\nBut despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid's order, citing \"continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being\" of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination.\n\nBefore receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is something I'm looking forward to because it's going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I'm interested in,\" Abdelhamid told The Daily Progress.\n\nBut due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation.\n\nAfter learning of Abdelhamid's circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session.\n\n\"I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,\" Coughlin told The Daily Progress. \"My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn't act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.\"\n\nHer repeated requests were denied.\n\nOn Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded.\n\nIt had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program.\n\nHis graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted.\n\nWhen the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC's Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school.\n\nAny person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo.\n\n\"I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,\" Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email.\n\nAbdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4.\n\n\"I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say he's required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo's sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid's appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was \"actively participating\" in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,\" Longo wrote.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\"Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn't wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,\" UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. \"When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.\"\n\nOrians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process. Orians said that, unlike Abdelhamid, other individuals who appealed their NTOs did not include any information about their involvement in the protest, and their NTOs were modified anyway.\n\n\"Candor did not matter in those cases,\" Orians said.\n\nShe also noted that NTOs include a list of boxes that the university police can check off. One of those boxes: the individual demonstrated \"conduct that threatens\" the safety of the UVa community. For Abdelhamid, that box was never checked, indicating university police did not consider him to be a threat.\n\nTwo other arrestees, Cierra Biel and Evan Urquhart, shared their appeal letters with The Daily Progress. Neither letter included an explanation for why they were at the protest, despite the requirement that they offer a \"complete and candid explanation for the conduct that precipitate[d] the Trespass Warning.\"\n\nBoth Biel and Urquhart said they'd been advised by attorneys to withhold that information.\n\nBiel went so far as to write Longo that the university's response against protesting students was an \"overreaction\" as well as \"unjust and unwarranted.\"\n\nBoth Biel's and Urquhart's NTOs were lifted.\n\nLongo wrote them that NTOs are meant to \"mitigate a threat to health and safety.\" He concluded that any risk from Biel or Urquhart had been \"sufficiently mitigated.\"\n\nHe did not reach the same conclusion with Abdelhamid.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt's a conclusion with which the U.S. government disagrees.\n\nAbdelhamid first arrived in the U.S. on a visa that required he return to his home country every six months. He did so until one trip home in the fall of 2015 when he was detained by his home government's authorities.\n\nThey found it suspicious that he was traveling to and from the U.S. every six months. They believed he was a spy. And they found out that during the 2011 Arab Spring, Abdelhamid had been a part of the protests, where he had provided medical assistance to injured protesters. During the revolution, his home government is alleged to have committed many human rights abuses and murdered hundreds of demonstrators.\n\n\"There would be two million people in one square, and police were just shooting at us,\" Abdelhamid recalled.\n\nHe was detained and brutally tortured for more than a week, deprived of sunlight and subjected to torture sessions three to five times per day. It is difficult for Abdelhamid to talk about, and he became choked up when recalling the traumatic period in an interview with The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities only released him under the condition that he be strictly supervised and told him that if he ever returned to the U.S. he would be killed.\n\n\"They made it very clear,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe took the risk anyway, fleeing his home country in 2015.\n\nUpon arriving back at UVa, he told a professor what had happened. He did not understand the complex U.S. immigration system but was terrified of returning home. He wanted to know if he could change his visa so that he would not be required to fly back home every six months, which he feared would effectively be a death sentence.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Abdelhamid was ordered to go to the UVa Police Department where he was questioned by an agent with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. He was released after the interview.\n\nAfter not receiving a response on how to change his visa status, and fearful about returning home, Abdelhamid overstayed his visa. The day after he passed the six-month mark without returning to his home country, he was in the emergency room with his now ex-wife. She was having a miscarriage.\n\nWhile in the ER, Abdelhamid received a call from the same ICE agent who had questioned him previously. She demanded to meet with him immediately. A UVa police officer met Abdelhamid in the ER, forcing him to leave his wife behind. He was escorted from the building, taken to the ICE officer and detained.\n\nSoon after, he was in immigration court for removal proceedings, a hearing where a judge determines whether an individual may remain in the U.S.\n\n\"I stood in front of the immigration judge and told him my situation and why I cannot go back home,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe also got in touch with a nonprofit group that recommended he apply for political asylum. Abdelhamid was released on bond and was granted asylum in October of 2023, after being thoroughly vetted by U.S. law enforcement. The vetting was especially thorough because he had previously been on the \"removal docket\"; asylum seekers who have been involved in removal proceedings are subjected to heavier scrutiny than those who have not.\n\n\"The asylum process is extremely extensive in terms of credibility standards you have to meet to qualify for asylum and the background checks you have to meet with the Department of Homeland Security,\" Karla McKanders, director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities investigate if asylum seekers have any criminal record in the U.S. or abroad; even loose connections with anyone associated with a terrorist organization will result in a denial. And an applicant must also get a green light from an immigration judge.\n\n\"Even if you meet all the criteria, it's in the judge's discretion to deny asylum,\" McKanders said.\n\nAbdelhamid's yearslong ordeal with immigration authorities effectively prevented him from doing a medical residency in the U.S.; priority is given to prospective residents who are within three years of graduating medical school, and it had been eight years since Abdelhamid had graduated from his home university.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, he chose to enroll in the PVCC nursing program.\n\n\"He wanted to do a medical residency to get his full MD here in the United States. And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,\" Orians said. \"So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.\"\n\nMultiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid's NTO be lifted.\n\nUVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid's. UVa also has not released who has and hasn't had their NTOs modified after the events of May 4.\n\nWith his future at stake, people in the UVa community are making regular efforts to have the university reconsider its decision.\n\nOn May 20, the UVa chapter of the American Association of University Professors penned a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan. It asked that the NTO be dropped, or at least modified so Abdelhamid can pursue his education.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the denial of Mr. Abdelhamid's NTO appeal grossly infringes on his student rights,\" reads the letter, \"and unjustly impairs his ability to pursue his education.\"\n\nIt also floats the same possibility that people familiar with Abdelhamid's case have considered: that his appeal was denied because he is Arab.\n\n\"This extremely punitive state of affairs, selectively applied to him, as it appears to us, is prejudicial to his minority status,\" reads the letter.\n\nNeither Biel nor Urquhart, two arrestees who had their NTOs lifted, understand why Abdelhamid is being treated any differently. Unlike Abdelhamid, Urquhart doesn't spend much time on Grounds.\n\n\"It wasn't super high urgency for me to get back on campus,\" Urquhart, who is a local freelance journalist who says he was covering not participating in the protest when he was arrested, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAbdelhamid has been \"incredibly nice\" in all the interactions she's had with him, said Biel, who is an administrative coordinator in the school's Department of Pharmacology. As a UVa employee, she said she's done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo's reasoning.\n\n\"I'm suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,\" said Biel. \"Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.\"\n\nBiel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The \"dragnet\" deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville's Black community and its police department.\n\nWith the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo's decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Mustafa does not want to sue UVa. It's been a decade since he first got here, and all he has wanted to do is contribute to the health and well-being of UVa and the greater Charlottesville community,\" Orians said. \"UVa has left him in a position where he's run out of options except to sue to have his rights respected so he can fulfill his dream to be a health care provider in this community.\"\n\nJason Armesto (717) 599-8470\n\njarmesto@dailyprogress.com\n\n@rmest0 on X\n\nTags Lee-national Asylum Seeker University Of Virginia U.s.

And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race.\n\nAbdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Charlottesville Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities.\n\nBut despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid's order, citing \"continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being\" of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination.\n\nBefore receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is something I'm looking forward to because it's going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I'm interested in,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nBut due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation.\n\nAfter learning of Abdelhamid's circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session.\n\n\"I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,\" Coughlin told The Daily Progress. \"My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn't act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.\"\n\nHer repeated requests were denied.\n\nOn Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded.\n\nIt had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program.\n\nHis graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted.\n\nWhen the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC's Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school.\n\nAny person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo.\n\n\"I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,\" Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email.\n\nAbdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4.\n\n\"I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say he's required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo's sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid's appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was \"actively participating\" in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,\" Longo wrote.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\"Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn't wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,\" UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. \"When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.\"\n\nOrians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process. Orians said that, unlike Abdelhamid, other individuals who appealed their NTOs did not include any information about their involvement in the protest, and their NTOs were modified anyway.\n\n\"Candor did not matter in those cases,\" Orians said.\n\nShe also noted that NTOs include a list of boxes that the university police can check off. One of those boxes: the individual demonstrated \"conduct that threatens\" the safety of the UVa community. For Abdelhamid, that box was never checked, indicating university police did not consider him to be a threat.\n\nTwo other arrestees, Cierra Biel and Evan Urquhart, shared their appeal letters with The Daily Progress. Neither letter included an explanation for why they were at the protest, despite the requirement that they offer a \"complete and candid explanation for the conduct that precipitate[d] the Trespass Warning.\"\n\nBoth Biel and Urquhart said they'd been advised by attorneys to withhold that information.\n\nBiel went so far as to write Longo that the university's response against protesting students was an \"overreaction\" as well as \"unjust and unwarranted.\"\n\nBoth Biel's and Urquhart's NTOs were lifted.\n\nLongo wrote them that NTOs are meant to \"mitigate a threat to health and safety.\" He concluded that any risk from Biel or Urquhart had been \"sufficiently mitigated.\"\n\nHe did not reach the same conclusion with Abdelhamid.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt's a conclusion with which the U.S. government disagrees.\n\nAbdelhamid first arrived in the U.S. on a visa that required he return to his home country every six months. He did so until one trip home in the fall of 2015 when he was detained by his home government's authorities.\n\nThey found it suspicious that he was traveling to and from the U.S. every six months. They believed he was a spy. And they found out that during the 2011 Arab Spring, Abdelhamid had been a part of the protests, where he had provided medical assistance to injured protesters. During the revolution, his home government is alleged to have committed many human rights abuses and murdered hundreds of demonstrators.\n\n\"There would be two million people in one square, and police were just shooting at us,\" Abdelhamid recalled.\n\nHe was detained and brutally tortured for more than a week, deprived of sunlight and subjected to torture sessions three to five times per day. It is difficult for Abdelhamid to talk about, and he became choked up when recalling the traumatic period in an interview with The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities only released him under the condition that he be strictly supervised and told him that if he ever returned to the U.S. he would be killed.\n\n\"They made it very clear,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe took the risk anyway, fleeing his home country in 2015.\n\nUpon arriving back at UVa, he told a professor what had happened. He did not understand the complex U.S. immigration system but was terrified of returning home. He wanted to know if he could change his visa so that he would not be required to fly back home every six months, which he feared would effectively be a death sentence.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Abdelhamid was ordered to go to the UVa Police Department where he was questioned by an agent with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. He was released after the interview.\n\nAfter not receiving a response on how to change his visa status, and fearful about returning home, Abdelhamid overstayed his visa. The day after he passed the six-month mark without returning to his home country, he was in the emergency room with his now ex-wife. She was having a miscarriage.\n\nWhile in the ER, Abdelhamid received a call from the same ICE agent who had questioned him previously. She demanded to meet with him immediately. A UVa police officer met Abdelhamid in the ER, forcing him to leave his wife behind. He was escorted from the building, taken to the ICE officer and detained.\n\nSoon after, he was in immigration court for removal proceedings, a hearing where a judge determines whether an individual may remain in the U.S.\n\n\"I stood in front of the immigration judge and told him my situation and why I cannot go back home,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe also got in touch with a nonprofit group that recommended he apply for political asylum. Abdelhamid was released on bond and was granted asylum in October of 2023, after being thoroughly vetted by U.S. law enforcement. The vetting was especially thorough because he had previously been on the \"removal docket\"; asylum seekers who have been involved in removal proceedings are subjected to heavier scrutiny than those who have not.\n\n\"The asylum process is extremely extensive in terms of credibility standards you have to meet to qualify for asylum and the background checks you have to meet with the Department of Homeland Security,\" Karla McKanders, director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities investigate if asylum seekers have any criminal record in the U.S. or abroad; even loose connections with anyone associated with a terrorist organization will result in a denial. And an applicant must also get a green light from an immigration judge.\n\n\"Even if you meet all the criteria, it's in the judge's discretion to deny asylum,\" McKanders said.\n\nAbdelhamid's yearslong ordeal with immigration authorities effectively prevented him from doing a medical residency in the U.S.; priority is given to prospective residents who are within three years of graduating medical school, and it had been eight years since Abdelhamid had graduated from his home university.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, he chose to enroll in the PVCC nursing program.\n\n\"He wanted to do a medical residency to get his full MD here in the United States. And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,\" Orians said. \"So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.\"\n\nMultiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid's NTO be lifted.\n\nUVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid's. UVa also has not released who has and hasn't had their NTOs modified after the events of May 4.\n\nWith his future at stake, people in the UVa community are making regular efforts to have the university reconsider its decision.\n\nOn May 20, the UVa chapter of the American Association of University Professors penned a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan. It asked that the NTO be dropped, or at least modified so Abdelhamid can pursue his education.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the denial of Mr. Abdelhamid's NTO appeal grossly infringes on his student rights,\" reads the letter, \"and unjustly impairs his ability to pursue his education.\"\n\nIt also floats the same possibility that people familiar with Abdelhamid's case have considered: that his appeal was denied because he is Arab.\n\n\"This extremely punitive state of affairs, selectively applied to him, as it appears to us, is prejudicial to his minority status,\" reads the letter.\n\nNeither Biel nor Urquhart, two arrestees who had their NTOs lifted, understand why Abdelhamid is being treated any differently. Unlike Abdelhamid, Urquhart doesn't spend much time on Grounds.\n\n\"It wasn't super high urgency for me to get back on campus,\" Urquhart, who is a local freelance journalist who says he was covering not participating in the protest when he was arrested, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAbdelhamid has been \"incredibly nice\" in all the interactions she's had with him, said Biel, who is an administrative coordinator in the school's Department of Pharmacology. As a UVa employee, she said she's done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo's reasoning.\n\n\"I'm suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,\" said Biel. \"Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.\"\n\nBiel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The \"dragnet\" deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville's Black community and its police department.\n\nWith the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo's decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Mustafa does not want to sue UVa. It's been a decade since he first got here, and all he has wanted to do is contribute to the health and well-being of UVa and the greater Charlottesville community,\" Orians said. \"UVa has left him in a position where he's run out of options except to sue to have his rights respected so he can fulfill his dream to be a health care provider in this community.\"\n\nJason Armesto (717) 599-8470\n\njarmesto@dailyprogress.com\n\n@rmest0 on X\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Lee-national University Of Virginia Asylum Seeker U.s.

And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race.\n\nAbdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Charlottesville Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities.\n\nBut despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid's order, citing \"continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being\" of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination.\n\nBefore receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is something I'm looking forward to because it's going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I'm interested in,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nBut due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation.\n\nAfter learning of Abdelhamid's circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session.\n\n\"I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,\" Coughlin told The Daily Progress. \"My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn't act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.\"\n\nHer repeated requests were denied.\n\nOn Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded.\n\nIt had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program.\n\nHis graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted.\n\nWhen the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC's Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school.\n\nAny person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo.\n\n\"I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,\" Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email.\n\nAbdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4.\n\n\"I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say he's required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo's sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid's appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was \"actively participating\" in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,\" Longo wrote.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\"Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn't wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,\" UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. \"When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.\"\n\nOrians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process. Orians said that, unlike Abdelhamid, other individuals who appealed their NTOs did not include any information about their involvement in the protest, and their NTOs were modified anyway.\n\n\"Candor did not matter in those cases,\" Orians said.\n\nShe also noted that NTOs include a list of boxes that the university police can check off. One of those boxes: the individual demonstrated \"conduct that threatens\" the safety of the UVa community. For Abdelhamid, that box was never checked, indicating university police did not consider him to be a threat.\n\nTwo other arrestees, Cierra Biel and Evan Urquhart, shared their appeal letters with The Daily Progress. Neither letter included an explanation for why they were at the protest, despite the requirement that they offer a \"complete and candid explanation for the conduct that precipitate[d] the Trespass Warning.\"\n\nBoth Biel and Urquhart said they'd been advised by attorneys to withhold that information.\n\nBiel went so far as to write Longo that the university's response against protesting students was an \"overreaction\" as well as \"unjust and unwarranted.\"\n\nBoth Biel's and Urquhart's NTOs were lifted.\n\nLongo wrote them that NTOs are meant to \"mitigate a threat to health and safety.\" He concluded that any risk from Biel or Urquhart had been \"sufficiently mitigated.\"\n\nHe did not reach the same conclusion with Abdelhamid.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt's a conclusion with which the U.S. government disagrees.\n\nAbdelhamid first arrived in the U.S. on a visa that required he return to his home country every six months. He did so until one trip home in the fall of 2015 when he was detained by his home government's authorities.\n\nThey found it suspicious that he was traveling to and from the U.S. every six months. They believed he was a spy. And they found out that during the 2011 Arab Spring, Abdelhamid had been a part of the protests, where he had provided medical assistance to injured protesters. During the revolution, his home government is alleged to have committed many human rights abuses and murdered hundreds of demonstrators.\n\n\"There would be two million people in one square, and police were just shooting at us,\" Abdelhamid recalled.\n\nHe was detained and brutally tortured for more than a week, deprived of sunlight and subjected to torture sessions three to five times per day. It is difficult for Abdelhamid to talk about, and he became choked up when recalling the traumatic period in an interview with The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities only released him under the condition that he be strictly supervised and told him that if he ever returned to the U.S. he would be killed.\n\n\"They made it very clear,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe took the risk anyway, fleeing his home country in 2015.\n\nUpon arriving back at UVa, he told a professor what had happened. He did not understand the complex U.S. immigration system but was terrified of returning home. He wanted to know if he could change his visa so that he would not be required to fly back home every six months, which he feared would effectively be a death sentence.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Abdelhamid was ordered to go to the UVa Police Department where he was questioned by an agent with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. He was released after the interview.\n\nAfter not receiving a response on how to change his visa status, and fearful about returning home, Abdelhamid overstayed his visa. The day after he passed the six-month mark without returning to his home country, he was in the emergency room with his now ex-wife. She was having a miscarriage.\n\nWhile in the ER, Abdelhamid received a call from the same ICE agent who had questioned him previously. She demanded to meet with him immediately. A UVa police officer met Abdelhamid in the ER, forcing him to leave his wife behind. He was escorted from the building, taken to the ICE officer and detained.\n\nSoon after, he was in immigration court for removal proceedings, a hearing where a judge determines whether an individual may remain in the U.S.\n\n\"I stood in front of the immigration judge and told him my situation and why I cannot go back home,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe also got in touch with a nonprofit group that recommended he apply for political asylum. Abdelhamid was released on bond and was granted asylum in October of 2023, after being thoroughly vetted by U.S. law enforcement. The vetting was especially thorough because he had previously been on the \"removal docket\"; asylum seekers who have been involved in removal proceedings are subjected to heavier scrutiny than those who have not.\n\n\"The asylum process is extremely extensive in terms of credibility standards you have to meet to qualify for asylum and the background checks you have to meet with the Department of Homeland Security,\" Karla McKanders, director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities investigate if asylum seekers have any criminal record in the U.S. or abroad; even loose connections with anyone associated with a terrorist organization will result in a denial. And an applicant must also get a green light from an immigration judge.\n\n\"Even if you meet all the criteria, it's in the judge's discretion to deny asylum,\" McKanders said.\n\nAbdelhamid's yearslong ordeal with immigration authorities effectively prevented him from doing a medical residency in the U.S.; priority is given to prospective residents who are within three years of graduating medical school, and it had been eight years since Abdelhamid had graduated from his home university.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, he chose to enroll in the PVCC nursing program.\n\n\"He wanted to do a medical residency to get his full MD here in the United States. And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,\" Orians said. \"So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.\"\n\nMultiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid's NTO be lifted.\n\nUVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid's. UVa also has not released who has and hasn't had their NTOs modified after the events of May 4.\n\nWith his future at stake, people in the UVa community are making regular efforts to have the university reconsider its decision.\n\nOn May 20, the UVa chapter of the American Association of University Professors penned a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan. It asked that the NTO be dropped, or at least modified so Abdelhamid can pursue his education.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the denial of Mr. Abdelhamid's NTO appeal grossly infringes on his student rights,\" reads the letter, \"and unjustly impairs his ability to pursue his education.\"\n\nIt also floats the same possibility that people familiar with Abdelhamid's case have considered: that his appeal was denied because he is Arab.\n\n\"This extremely punitive state of affairs, selectively applied to him, as it appears to us, is prejudicial to his minority status,\" reads the letter.\n\nNeither Biel nor Urquhart, two arrestees who had their NTOs lifted, understand why Abdelhamid is being treated any differently. Unlike Abdelhamid, Urquhart doesn't spend much time on Grounds.\n\n\"It wasn't super high urgency for me to get back on campus,\" Urquhart, who is a local freelance journalist who says he was covering not participating in the protest when he was arrested, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAbdelhamid has been \"incredibly nice\" in all the interactions she's had with him, said Biel, who is an administrative coordinator in the school's Department of Pharmacology. As a UVa employee, she said she's done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo's reasoning.\n\n\"I'm suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,\" said Biel. \"Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.\"\n\nBiel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The \"dragnet\" deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville's Black community and its police department.\n\nWith the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo's decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Mustafa does not want to sue UVa. It's been a decade since he first got here, and all he has wanted to do is contribute to the health and well-being of UVa and the greater Charlottesville community,\" Orians said. \"UVa has left him in a position where he's run out of options except to sue to have his rights respected so he can fulfill his dream to be a health care provider in this community.\"\n\nJason Armesto (717) 599-8470\n\njarmesto@dailyprogress.com\n\n@rmest0 on X\n\nTags Lee-national University Of Virginia Asylum Seeker U.s.

Nevertheless, his life could be forever changed by it.\n\nA nursing student arrested during a May 4 anti-war protest at the University of Virginia is still being denied access to Grounds, a prohibition that has already cost him a job and could result in him failing his academic program.\n\nLocal Education\n\nWhat we know about how UVa's narrative differs from eyewitness accounts of May 4\n\nJason Armesto\n\nA total of 27 people were arrested when Virginia State Police broke up an encampment of protesters opposed to Israel's monthslong war with Palestinian terror group Hamas, which has killed tens of thousands of people since Hamas launched a surprise attack on the country on Oct. 7. That total arrest number includes some who say they were never part of the protest but were in the area of the encampment when state police arrived. UVa issued all 27 who were arrested \"no trespass\" orders, or NTOs, preventing them from legally returning to Grounds. Most of those orders have since been lifted or modified.\n\nMustafa Abdelhamid's has not.\n\nAbdelhamid, who has now filed suit against the university, claims he was not participating in the protest but completing a delivery order at the encampment. And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race.\n\nAbdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities.\n\nBut despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid's order, citing \"continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being\" of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination.\n\nCrime\n\nCharges dropped against several arrested at UVa protest\n\nJason Armesto\n\nBefore receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is something I'm looking forward to because it's going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I'm interested in,\" Abdelhamid told The Daily Progress.\n\nBut due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation.\n\nAfter learning of Abdelhamid's circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session.\n\n\"I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,\" Coughlin told The Daily Progress. \"My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn't act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.\"\n\nHer repeated requests were denied.\n\nOn Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded.\n\nIt had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program.\n\nHis graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted.\n\nWhen the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC's Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school.\n\nCrime\n\nWho were the mysterious 'men in black' at the UVa encampment?\n\nJason Armesto\n\nAny person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo.\n\n\"I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,\" Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email.\n\nAbdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4.\n\n\"I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say he's required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo's sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid's appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was \"actively participating\" in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,\" Longo wrote.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\"Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn't wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,\" UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. \"When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.\"\n\nOrians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process. Orians said that, unlike Abdelhamid, other individuals who appealed their NTOs did not include any information about their involvement in the protest, and their NTOs were modified anyway.\n\n\"Candor did not matter in those cases,\" Orians said.\n\nShe also noted that NTOs include a list of boxes that the university police can check off. One of those boxes: the individual demonstrated \"conduct that threatens\" the safety of the UVa community. For Abdelhamid, that box was never checked, indicating university police did not consider him to be a threat.\n\nTwo other arrestees, Cierra Biel and Evan Urquhart, shared their appeal letters with The Daily Progress. Neither letter included an explanation for why they were at the protest, despite the requirement that they offer a \"complete and candid explanation for the conduct that precipitate[d] the Trespass Warning.\"\n\nBoth Biel and Urquhart said they'd been advised by attorneys to withhold that information.\n\nBiel went so far as to write Longo that the university's response against protesting students was an \"overreaction\" as well as \"unjust and unwarranted.\"\n\nBoth Biel's and Urquhart's NTOs were lifted.\n\nLongo wrote them that NTOs are meant to \"mitigate a threat to health and safety.\" He concluded that any risk from Biel or Urquhart had been \"sufficiently mitigated.\"\n\nHe did not reach the same conclusion with Abdelhamid.\n\nIt's a conclusion with which the U.S. government disagrees.\n\nAbdelhamid first arrived in the U.S. on a visa that required he return to his home country every six months. He did so until one trip home in the fall of 2015 when he was detained by his home government's authorities.\n\nThey found it suspicious that he was traveling to and from the U.S. every six months. They believed he was a spy. And they found out that during the 2011 Arab Spring, Abdelhamid had been a part of the protests, where he had provided medical assistance to injured protesters. During the revolution, his home government is alleged to have committed many human rights abuses and murdered hundreds of demonstrators.\n\n\"There would be two million people in one square, and police were just shooting at us,\" Abdelhamid recalled.\n\nHe was detained and brutally tortured for more than a week, deprived of sunlight and subjected to torture sessions three to five times per day. It is difficult for Abdelhamid to talk about, and he became choked up when recalling the traumatic period in an interview with The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities only released him under the condition that he be strictly supervised and told him that if he ever returned to the U.S. he would be killed.\n\n\"They made it very clear,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe took the risk anyway, fleeing his home country in 2015.\n\nUpon arriving back at UVa, he told a professor what had happened. He did not understand the complex U.S. immigration system but was terrified of returning home. He wanted to know if he could change his visa so that he would not be required to fly back home every six months, which he feared would effectively be a death sentence.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Abdelhamid was ordered to go to the UVa Police Department where he was questioned by an agent with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. He was released after the interview.\n\nLocal Education\n\nUVa graduates walk out on President Jim Ryan's opening address\n\nJason Armesto\n\nAfter not receiving a response on how to change his visa status, and fearful about returning home, Abdelhamid overstayed his visa. The day after he passed the six-month mark without returning to his home country, he was in the emergency room with his now ex-wife. She was having a miscarriage.\n\nWhile in the ER, Abdelhamid received a call from the same ICE agent who had questioned him previously. She demanded to meet with him immediately. A UVa police officer met Abdelhamid in the ER, forcing him to leave his wife behind. He was escorted from the building, taken to the ICE officer and detained.\n\nSoon after, he was in immigration court for removal proceedings, a hearing where a judge determines whether an individual may remain in the U.S.\n\n\"I stood in front of the immigration judge and told him my situation and why I cannot go back home,\" Abdelhamid said.\n\nHe also got in touch with a nonprofit group that recommended he apply for political asylum. Abdelhamid was released on bond and was granted asylum in October of 2023, after being thoroughly vetted by U.S. law enforcement. The vetting was especially thorough because he had previously been on the \"removal docket\"; asylum seekers who have been involved in removal proceedings are subjected to heavier scrutiny than those who have not.\n\n\"The asylum process is extremely extensive in terms of credibility standards you have to meet to qualify for asylum and the background checks you have to meet with the Department of Homeland Security,\" Karla McKanders, director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAuthorities investigate if asylum seekers have any criminal record in the U.S. or abroad; even loose connections with anyone associated with a terrorist organization will result in a denial. And an applicant must also get a green light from an immigration judge.\n\n\"Even if you meet all the criteria, it's in the judge's discretion to deny asylum,\" McKanders said.\n\nAbdelhamid's yearslong ordeal with immigration authorities effectively prevented him from doing a medical residency in the U.S.; priority is given to prospective residents who are within three years of graduating medical school, and it had been eight years since Abdelhamid had graduated from his home university.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, he chose to enroll in the PVCC nursing program.\n\n\"He wanted to do a medical residency to get his full MD here in the United States. And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,\" Orians said. \"So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.\"\n\nMultiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid's NTO be lifted.\n\nUVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid's. UVa also has not released who has and hasn't had their NTOs modified after the events of May 4.\n\nLocal News\n\n'I was meant to be here': Longo steps down after 15 years\n\nBY DEAN SEAL\n\n15 min to read\n\nWith his future at stake, people in the UVa community are making regular efforts to have the university reconsider its decision.\n\nOn May 20, the UVa chapter of the American Association of University Professors penned a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan. It asked that the NTO be dropped, or at least modified so Abdelhamid can pursue his education.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the denial of Mr. Abdelhamid's NTO appeal grossly infringes on his student rights,\" reads the letter, \"and unjustly impairs his ability to pursue his education.\"\n\nIt also floats the same possibility that people familiar with Abdelhamid's case have considered: that his appeal was denied because he is Arab.\n\n\"This extremely punitive state of affairs, selectively applied to him, as it appears to us, is prejudicial to his minority status,\" reads the letter.\n\nNeither Biel nor Urquhart, two arrestees who had their NTOs lifted, understand why Abdelhamid is being treated any differently. Unlike Abdelhamid, Urquhart doesn't spend much time on Grounds.\n\n\"It wasn't super high urgency for me to get back on campus,\" Urquhart, who is a local freelance journalist who says he was covering not participating in the protest when he was arrested, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAbdelhamid has been \"incredibly nice\" in all the interactions she's had with him, said Biel, who is an administrative coordinator in the school's Department of Pharmacology. As a UVa employee, she said she's done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo's reasoning.\n\n\"I'm suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,\" said Biel. \"Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.\"\n\nBiel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The \"dragnet\" deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville's Black community and its police department.\n\nCrime\n\nJewish Israeli student sues UVa, claims school fosters 'virulent antisemitism'\n\nEmily Hemphill , Jason Armesto\n\nWith the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo's decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Mustafa does not want to sue UVa. It's been a decade since he first got here, and all he has wanted to do is contribute to the health and well-being of UVa and the greater Charlottesville community,\" Orians said. \"UVa has left him in a position where he's run out of options except to sue to have his rights respected so he can fulfill his dream to be a health care provider in this community.\"", "source": {"uri":

And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race.\n\nAbdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities.\n\nBut despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid's order, citing \"continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being\" of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination.\n\nBefore receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is something I'm looking forward to because it's going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I'm interested in,\" Abdelhamid told The Daily Progress.\n\nBut due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation.\n\nAfter learning of Abdelhamid's circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session.\n\n\"I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,\" Coughlin told The Daily Progress. \"My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn't act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.\"\n\nHer repeated requests were denied.\n\nOn Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded.\n\nIt had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program.\n\nHis graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted.\n\nWhen the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC's Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school.\n\nAny person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo.\n\n\"I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,\" Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email.\n\nAbdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4.\n\n\"I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say he's required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo's sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid's appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was \"actively participating\" in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,\" Longo wrote.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\"Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn't wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,\" UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. \"When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.\"\n\nOrians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process.

And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,\" Orians said. \"So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.\"\n\nMultiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid's NTO be lifted.\n\nUVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid's. UVa also has not released who has and hasn't had their NTOs modified after the events of May 4.\n\nWith his future at stake, people in the UVa community are making regular efforts to have the university reconsider its decision.\n\nOn May 20, the UVa chapter of the American Association of University Professors penned a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan. It asked that the NTO be dropped, or at least modified so Abdelhamid can pursue his education.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the denial of Mr. Abdelhamid's NTO appeal grossly infringes on his student rights,\" reads the letter, \"and unjustly impairs his ability to pursue his education.\"\n\nIt also floats the same possibility that people familiar with Abdelhamid's case have considered: that his appeal was denied because he is Arab.\n\n\"This extremely punitive state of affairs, selectively applied to him, as it appears to us, is prejudicial to his minority status,\" reads the letter.\n\nNeither Biel nor Urquhart, two arrestees who had their NTOs lifted, understand why Abdelhamid is being treated any differently. Unlike Abdelhamid, Urquhart doesn't spend much time on Grounds.\n\n\"It wasn't super high urgency for me to get back on campus,\" Urquhart, who is a local freelance journalist who says he was covering not participating in the protest when he was arrested, told The Daily Progress.\n\nAbdelhamid has been \"incredibly nice\" in all the interactions she's had with him, said Biel, who is an administrative coordinator in the school's Department of Pharmacology. As a UVa employee, she said she's done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo's reasoning.\n\n\"I'm suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,\" said Biel. \"Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.\"\n\nBiel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The \"dragnet\" deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville's Black community and its police department.\n\nWith the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo's decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Mustafa does not want to sue UVa. It's been a decade since he first got here, and all he has wanted to do is contribute to the health and well-being of UVa and the greater Charlottesville community,\" Orians said. \"UVa has left him in a position where he's run out of options except to sue to have his rights respected so he can fulfill his dream to be a health care provider in this community.\"\n\nJason Armesto (717) 599-8470\n\njarmesto@dailyprogress.com\n\n@rmest0 on X\n\nTags Lee-national Asylum Seeker University Of Virginia U.s.

Bierlich, co-author on the study and an assistant professor at OSU's Marine Mammal Institute in Newport. \"And whales are considered ecosystem sentinels, so if the whale population isn't doing well, that might say a lot about the environment itself.\"\n\nThe study, published in Global Change Biology, looked at the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG), a small subset of about 200 gray whales within the larger Eastern North Pacific (ENP) population of around 14,500. This subgroup stays closer to shore along the Oregon coast, feeding in shallower, warmer waters than the Arctic seas where the bulk of the gray whale population spends most of the year.\n\nRecent studies from OSU have shown that whales in this subgroup are smaller and in overall worse body condition than their ENP counterparts. The current study reveals that they've been getting smaller in recent decades.\n\nThe Marine Mammal Institute's Geospatial Ecology of Marine Megafauna (GEMM) Lab has been studying this subgroup of gray whales since 2016, including flying drones over the whales to measure their size. Using images from 2016-2022 of 130 individual whales with known or estimated age, researchers determined that a full-grown gray whale born in 2020 is expected to reach an adult body length that is 1.65 meters (about 5 feet, 5 inches) shorter than a gray whale born prior to 2000. For PCFG gray whales that grow to be 38-41 feet long at full maturity, that accounts for a loss of more than 13% of their total length.\n\nIf the same trend were to happen in humans, that would be like the height of the average American woman shrinking from 5 feet, 4 inches to 4 feet, 8 inches tall over the course of 20 years.\n\n\"In general, size is critical for animals,\" said Enrico Pirotta, lead author on the study and a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. \"It affects their behavior, their physiology, their life history, and it has cascading effects for the animals and for the community they're a part of.\"\n\nFor adult gray whales, one of the biggest concerns is reproductive success.\n\n\"With them being smaller, there are questions of how effectively these PCFG gray whales can store and allocate energy toward growing and maintaining their health. Importantly, are they able to put enough energy toward reproduction and keep the population growing?\" Bierlich said.\n\nScarring on PCFG whales from boat strikes and fishing gear entanglement also makes the team concerned that smaller body size with lower energy reserves may make the whales less resilient to injuries.\n\nThe study also examined the patterns of the ocean environment that likely regulate food availability for these gray whales off the Pacific coast by tracking cycles of \"upwelling\" and \"relaxation\" in the ocean. Upwelling sweeps nutrients from deeper to shallower regions, while relaxation periods then allow those nutrients to remain in shallower areas where light allows for growth of plankton and other tiny organisms, including the prey of gray whales.\n\n\"Without a balance between upwelling and relaxation, the ecosystem may not be able to produce enough prey to support the large size of these gray whales,\" said co-author Leigh Torres, associate professor and director of the GEMM Lab at OSU.\n\nThe data show that whale size declined concurrently with changes in the balance between upwelling and relaxation, Pirotta said.\n\n\"We haven't looked specifically at how climate change is affecting these patterns, but in general we know that climate change is affecting the oceanography of the Northeast Pacific through changes in wind patterns and water temperature,\" he said. \"And these factors and others affect the dynamics of upwelling and relaxation in the area.\"\n\nNow that they know the PCFG gray whales' body size is declining, researchers say they have a lot of new questions about downstream consequences of that decline and the factors that could be contributing to it.\n\n\"We're heading into our ninth field season studying this PCFG subgroup,\" Bierlich said. \"This is a powerful dataset that allows us to detect changes in body condition each year, so now we're examining the environmental drivers of those changes.\"\n\nReference: Pirotta E, Bierlich KC, New L, et al.

Bierlich, an assistant professor at OSU's Marine Mammal Institute and co-author of the study, noted the potential implications.\n\n\"This could be an early warning sign that the abundance of this population is starting to decline, or is not healthy,\" Bierlich said.\n\n\"Whales are considered ecosystem sentinels, so if the whale population isn't doing well, that might say a lot about the environment itself.\"\n\nThe study, published in the journal Global Change Biology, focused on the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG), a smaller group of about 200 gray whales within the larger Eastern North Pacific (ENP) population, which numbers around 14,500.\n\nUnlike most gray whales that spend much of the year in the Arctic, the PCFG whales stay closer to shore along the Oregon coast, feeding in shallower and warmer waters.\n\nRecent studies from OSU have shown that the PCFG whales are not only smaller but also in worse overall condition compared to their ENP counterparts.\n\nThe current study confirms that these whales have been getting smaller over the past few decades.\n\nResearchers at OSU's Marine Mammal Institute's Geospatial Ecology of Marine Megafauna (GEMM) Lab have been studying the PCFG whales since 2016.\n\nUsing drones to measure their size, they analyzed images from 2016-2022 of 130 individual whales. They found that a gray whale born in 2020 is expected to reach an adult length 1.65 meters (about 5 feet, 5 inches) shorter than one born before 2000.\n\nFor PCFG gray whales, which typically grow to be 38-41 feet long, this represents a loss of over 13% of their total length.\n\nEnrico Pirotta, the lead author of the study and a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, explained the significance of this size reduction. \"In general, size is critical for animals,\" Pirotta said.\n\n\"It affects their behavior, physiology, and life history, and has cascading effects for the animals and the community they're part of.\"\n\nSmaller whale calves may struggle to survive when they become independent, and smaller adults may have difficulties reproducing successfully.\n\nBierlich pointed out that smaller body size and lower energy reserves could make these whales less resilient to injuries from boat strikes and fishing gear entanglement.\n\nThe study also examined how ocean conditions affect food availability for gray whales. Researchers tracked cycles of \"upwelling\" and \"relaxation\" in the ocean, which move nutrients from deeper waters to the surface, supporting the growth of plankton and other tiny organisms that gray whales eat.\n\nA balance between upwelling and relaxation is crucial for producing enough prey to support the large size of gray whales.\n\nChanges in this balance have coincided with the decline in whale size, Pirotta said. While the study didn't specifically look at how climate change affects these patterns, it's known that climate change is altering wind patterns and water temperatures in the Northeast Pacific, which could impact upwelling and relaxation cycles.\n\nWith the PCFG gray whales shrinking, researchers are now investigating the environmental factors driving these changes. \"We're heading into our ninth field season studying this PCFG subgroup,\" Bierlich said. \"This is a powerful dataset that allows us to detect changes in body condition each year, so now we're examining the environmental drivers of those changes.\"\n\nThe study's co-authors include Lisa Hildebrand, Clara Bird, and Alejandro Aj\u00f3 from OSU, and Leslie New from Ursinus College in Pennsylvania.

Bierlich, co-author on the study and an assistant professor at OSU's Marine Mammal Institute in Newport. \"Whales are considered ecosystem sentinels, so if the whale population isn't doing well, that might say a lot about the environment itself.\"\n\nThe study, published in Global Change Biology, looked at the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG), a small subset of about 200 gray whales within the larger Eastern North Pacific (ENP) population of around 14,500. This subgroup stays closer to shore along the Oregon coast, feeding in shallower, warmer waters than the Arctic seas where the bulk of the gray whale population spends most of the year.\n\nRecent studies from OSU have shown that whales in this subgroup are smaller and in overall worse body condition than their ENP counterparts. The current study reveals that they've been getting smaller in recent decades.\n\nThe Marine Mammal Institute's Geospatial Ecology of Maine Megafauna (GEMM) Lab has been studying this subgroup of gray whales since 2016, including flying drones over the whales to measure their size. Using images from 2016-2022 of 130 individual whales with known or estimated age, researchers determined that a full-grown gray whale born in 2020 is expected to reach an adult body length that is 1.65 meters (5ft 5in) shorter than a gray whale born prior to 2000. For PCFG gray whales that grow to be 38-41 feet long at full maturity, that accounts for a loss of more than 13% of their total length.\n\nIf the same trend were to happen in humans, that would be like the height of the average American woman shrinking from 5ft 4in to 4ft 8in over the course of 20 years.\n\n\"In general, size is critical for animals,\" said Dr Enrico Pirotta, lead author on the study and a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. \"It affects their behavior, their physiology, their life history, and it has cascading effects for the animals and for the community they're a part of.\"\n\nWhale calves that are smaller at weaning age may be unable to cope with the uncertainty that comes with being newly independent, which can affect survival rates, Dr Pirotta said.\n\nFor adult gray whales, one of the biggest concerns is reproductive success.\n\n\"With them being smaller, there are questions of how effectively these PCFG gray whales can store and allocate energy toward growing and maintaining their health. Importantly, are they able to put enough energy toward reproduction and keep the population growing?\" Dr Bierlich said.\n\nScarring on PCFG whales from boat strikes and fishing gear entanglement also makes the team concerned that smaller body size with lower energy reserves may make the whales less resilient to injuries.\n\nThe study also examined the patterns of the ocean environment that likely regulate food availability for these gray whales off the Pacific coast by tracking cycles of \"upwelling\" and \"relaxation\" in the ocean. Upwelling sweeps nutrients from deeper to shallower regions, while relaxation periods then allow those nutrients to remain in shallower areas where light allows for growth of plankton and other tiny organisms, including the prey of gray whales.\n\n\"Without a balance between upwelling and relaxation, the ecosystem may not be able to produce enough prey to support the large size of these gray whales,\" said co-author Dr Leigh Torres, associate professor and director of the GEMM Lab at OSU.\n\n\"The data show that whale size declined concurrently with changes in the balance between upwelling and relaxation,\" Dr Pirotta said.\n\n\"We haven't looked specifically at how climate change is affecting these patterns, but in general we know that climate change is affecting the oceanography of the Northeast Pacific through changes in wind patterns and water temperature,\" he said. \"And these factors and others affect the dynamics of upwelling and relaxation in the area.\"\n\nNow that they know the PCFG gray whales' body size is declining, researchers say they have a lot of new questions about downstream consequences of that decline and the factors that could be contributing to it.\n\n\"We're heading into our ninth field season studying this PCFG subgroup,\" Dr Bierlich said. \"This is a powerful dataset that allows us to detect changes in body condition each year, so now we're examining the environmental drivers of those changes.\"\n\nOther co-authors on the paper were Lisa Hildebrand, Clara Bird and Alejandro Aj\u00f3 at OSU and Leslie New at Ursinus College in Pennsylvania.\n\nCategory Research\n\n/Public Release.

The sightings included 93 of sei whales, and that is one of the highest concentrations of the rare whale during a single flight, the agency said.\n\nOther highlights included two orcas - an uncommon sight off New England - one of which was toting a tuna in its mouth, NOAA said. There were also endangered North Atlantic right whales as well as humpback, fin, minke and sperm whales, the agency said.\n\nThe sightings do not necessarily represent 161 individual whales, because observers could be sighting the same animal more than once, said Teri Frady, the chief of research communications for the NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Center. However, the observers clearly reported \"a lot of whales,\" Frady said.\n\n\"It is not unusual that there are a lot of whales in the area this time of year. But since we do not survey every day, or in the same areas every time we fly, catching such a large aggregation with such a variety of species on one of our flights is the exception rather than the rule,\" Frady said.\n\nObservers logged three sightings of the North Atlantic right whale, which has been the subject of new proposed fishing and shipping regulations in an attempt to protect it from extinction. There are less than 360 of the whales left on Earth, scientists have said.\n\nThe large whale group appeared in an area that is \"increasingly important as year-round core habitat for North Atlantic right whales and other large whale species,\" said Gib Brogan, campaign director with conservation group Oceana.

While hordes of crabs and spiders might be invading New York, something slightly different is happening to the whale population on the other side of the country. Scientists studying gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) have found that they seem to be shrinking. Over in the North Atlantic, right whales have already been seen to be shrinking too.\n\nThe Eastern North Pacific (ENP) population of gray whales is thought to be around 14,500 individuals; a small subset of this group is called the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG) and consists of around 212 whales that forage in shallow coastal waters between California and Vancouver Island.\n\nUsing aerial images and data from previous years, the team set about comparing the body size of whales born in different years. The team measured 130 individual gray whales over the seven-year study period. They found that a whale born in 2020 was estimated to reach an average maximum length 1.65 meters (5.4 feet) shorter than any animal born in the 1980s. For a PCFG gray whale that grows to be 11.6-12.5 meters long when fully grown (38-41 feet), that is a loss of more than 13 percent of their total length. The results suggest this decline started around the year 2000.\n\n\"This could be an early warning sign that the abundance of this population is starting to decline, or is not healthy,\" said K.C. Bierlich, co-author on the study and an assistant professor at Oregon State University's Marine Mammal Institute in Newport, in a statement.\n\nThe team thinks this decrease in body size will have consequences for the individuals in terms of behavior and ecology. Gray whales rely on energy reserves throughout the winter months - a smaller body size will limit the extent of these reserves and could impact their survival and reproduction.\n\n\"And whales are considered ecosystem sentinels, so if the whale population isn't doing well, that might say a lot about the environment itself,\" continued Bierlich.\n\nThe decline in body length was especially pronounced in the females, which used to be typically larger than the male whales, but in the study were found to be the same size or even smaller.\n\n\"With them being smaller, there are questions of how effectively these PCFG gray whales can store and allocate energy toward growing and maintaining their health. Importantly, are they able to put enough energy toward reproduction and keep the population growing?\" Bierlich said.\n\nThe team plans to investigate further into what could be causing the decrease in whale size. There is some suggestion that ocean conditions have changed as a response to climate change, which could be contributing; other suggestions include a decrease in habitat quality due to human activities. Two proxies of habitat quality, the mean Pacific Decadal Oscillation index and the mean ratio between upwelling intensity and the number of relaxation events, were highlighted; these are thought to be changing with climate change, which could influence foraging conditions for the gray whales and thus their shortening length.\n\nThe foraging grounds also need further investigation, write the authors, and they raise questions around why the whales would continue to use these areas if this habitat is associated with a reduction in body length.", "source": {"uri": "iflscience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFLScience"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gray whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Northwest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newport, Rhode Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newport, Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_(climate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy (climate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_decadal_oscillation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific decadal oscillation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foraging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upwelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Habitat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Orgone_Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Orgone Energy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Plus-Size", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Plus-Size", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/74643/aImg/76825/gray-whale-meta.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647105", "eventUri": "eng-9647105", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Bierlich, co-author on the study and an assistant professor at OSU's Marine Mammal Institute in Newport. \"And whales are considered ecosystem sentinels, so if the whale population isn't doing well, that might say a lot about the environment itself.\"\n\nThe study, published in Global Change Biology, looked at the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG), a small subset of about 200 gray whales within the larger Eastern North Pacific (ENP) population of around 14,500. This subgroup stays closer to shore along the Oregon coast, feeding in shallower, warmer waters than the Arctic seas where the bulk of the gray whale population spends most of the year.\n\nRecent studies from OSU have shown that whales in this subgroup are smaller and in overall worse body condition than their ENP counterparts. The current study reveals that they've been getting smaller in recent decades.\n\nThe Marine Mammal Institute's Geospatial Ecology of Marine Megafauna (GEMM) Lab has been studying this subgroup of gray whales since 2016, including flying drones over the whales to measure their size. Using images from 2016-2022 of 130 individual whales with known or estimated age, researchers determined that a full-grown gray whale born in 2020 is expected to reach an adult body length that is 1.65 meters (about 5 feet, 5 inches) shorter than a gray whale born prior to 2000. For PCFG gray whales that grow to be 38-41 feet long at full maturity, that accounts for a loss of more than 13% of their total length.\n\nIf the same trend were to happen in humans, that would be like the height of the average American woman shrinking from 5 feet, 4 inches to 4 feet, 8 inches tall over the course of 20 years.\n\n\"In general, size is critical for animals,\" said Enrico Pirotta, lead author on the study and a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. \"It affects their behavior, their physiology, their life history, and it has cascading effects for the animals and for the community they're a part of.\"\n\nWhale calves that are smaller at weaning age may be unable to cope with the uncertainty that comes with being newly independent, which can affect survival rates, Pirotta said.\n\nFor adult gray whales, one of the biggest concerns is reproductive success.\n\n\"With them being smaller, there are questions of how effectively these PCFG gray whales can store and allocate energy toward growing and maintaining their health. Importantly, are they able to put enough energy toward reproduction and keep the population growing?\" Bierlich said.\n\nScarring on PCFG whales from boat strikes and fishing gear entanglement also makes the team concerned that smaller body size with lower energy reserves may make the whales less resilient to injuries.\n\nThe study also examined the patterns of the ocean environment that likely regulate food availability for these gray whales off the Pacific coast by tracking cycles of \"upwelling\" and \"relaxation\" in the ocean. Upwelling sweeps nutrients from deeper to shallower regions, while relaxation periods then allow those nutrients to remain in shallower areas where light allows for growth of plankton and other tiny organisms, including the prey of gray whales.\n\n\"Without a balance between upwelling and relaxation, the ecosystem may not be able to produce enough prey to support the large size of these gray whales,\" said co-author Leigh Torres, associate professor and director of the GEMM Lab at OSU.\n\nThe data show that whale size declined concurrently with changes in the balance between upwelling and relaxation, Pirotta said.\n\n\"We haven't looked specifically at how climate change is affecting these patterns, but in general we know that climate change is affecting the oceanography of the Northeast Pacific through changes in wind patterns and water temperature,\" he said. \"And these factors and others affect the dynamics of upwelling and relaxation in the area.\"\n\nNow that they know the PCFG gray whales' body size is declining, researchers say they have a lot of new questions about downstream consequences of that decline and the factors that could be contributing to it.\n\n\"We're heading into our ninth field season studying this PCFG subgroup,\" Bierlich said. \"This is a powerful dataset that allows us to detect changes in body condition each year, so now we're examining the environmental drivers of those changes.\"\n\nThe other co-authors on the paper were Lisa Hildebrand, Clara Bird and Alejandro Aj\u00f3 at OSU and Leslie New at Ursinus College in

Scientists say a large number of whales is visiting the region, and the group includes an unusually high number of an endangered species. NOAA via Associated Press\n\nA large number of whales visiting the waters off New England included an uncommon sighting of an orca eating a tuna and an unusually large group of an endangered species of whale, scientists said.\n\nA research flight made 161 sightings of seven different species of whale on May 25 south of Martha's Vineyard and southeast of Nantucket, officials with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday. The sightings included 93 of sei whales, and that is one of the highest concentrations of the rare whale during a single flight, the agency said.\n\nOther highlights included two orcas - an uncommon sight off New England - one of which was toting the unlucky tuna in its mouth, NOAA said. There were also endangered North Atlantic right whales as well as humpback, fin, minke and sperm whales, the agency said.\n\nThe sightings do not necessarily represent 161 individual whales, because observers could be sighting the same animal more than once, said Teri Frady, the chief of research communications for the NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Center. However, the observers clearly reported \"a lot of whales,\" Frady said.\n\n\"It is not unusual that there are a lot of whales in the area this time of year. But since we do not survey every day, or in the same areas every time we fly, catching such a large aggregation with such a variety of species on one of our flights is the exception rather than the rule,\" Frady said.\n\nRelated\n\nDead humpback whale tangled in fishing gear pulled from Casco Bay\n\nObservers logged three sightings of the North Atlantic right whale, which has been the subject of new proposed fishing and shipping regulations in an attempt to protect it from extinction. There are less than 360 of the whales left on Earth, scientists have said.\n\nThe large whale group appeared in an area that is \"increasingly important as year-round core habitat for North Atlantic right whales and other large whale species,\" said Gib Brogan, campaign director with conservation group Oceana. The whales are \"swimming in harms way\" until the U.S. finalizes strict rules to protect them from collisions with large ships and entanglement in commercial fishing gear, he said.\n\n\"Oceana is concerned about the protection of these whales from vessel strikes and entanglements, the two leading causes of death for large whales in the U.S. Atlantic,\" Brogan said.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nRelated Headlines\n\nHumpback whale found in Casco Bay likely died from drowning linked to tangled fishing gear Dead humpback whale tangled in fishing gear pulled from Casco Bay A fast-warming Gulf of Maine is rising faster than ever\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nSuccess.

However, the Marine Mammal Institute's Geospatial Ecology of Marine Megafauna collected photos via drones of 130 individual whales with known or estimated age. Researchers found that a full-grown whale born in 2020 is expected to reach an adult body length of about 5 feet, 5 inches shorter than a gray whale born before 2000. This accounts for more than a 13% loss in their total length.\n\nTo put that into perspective, this would be the equivalent to the average height of a woman going from 5'4'' to 4'8'' in the span of just 20 years.\n\nThere are about 200 gray whales that reside in the shallow waters of Oregon's coastline. They belong to a larger North Pacific gray whale population of around 14,500.\n\nStudies from Oregon State reveal that whales belonging to the Pacific Coast Feeding Group are smaller and in overall worse body condition than gray whales inhabiting deeper waters of the Eastern Northwest.\n\n\"In general, size is critical for animals,\" Enrico Pirotta, lead author of the study and a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, told Oregon State's newsroom. \"It affects their behavior, their physiology, their life history, and it has cascading effects for the animals and for the community they're a part of.\"\n\nSmaller gray whale sizes will have a negative impact on reproductive success.\n\nWith whales being smaller, there are questions about how effectively these Pacific Coast Feeding Group gray whales can store and allocate energy toward growing and maintaining their health.\n\n\"Are they able to put enough energy toward reproduction and keep the population growing?\", KC Bierlich, co-author of the study, said.\n\nWith the gray whales' shrunken size, researchers are led to question their ability to recover from injuries.\n\nResearchers are also concerned about what the whales' diminished size may reveal about the ocean's ecosystem. The study tracked the Pacific coast's cycles of upwelling and relaxation which regulate food availability. Upwelling sweeps nutrients from deeper to shallower regions, whereas relaxation periods will keep those nutrients in shallower areas where light allows for the growth of plankton, a food source for gray whales. Data show that whale size declined concurrently with changes in the balance between upwelling and relaxation.\n\nWhile it's not clear to researchers if climate change is affecting these patterns, researchers say it is impacting wind patterns and water temperature of the Northeast Pacific.\n\nShrunken sizes have also been recorded in the North Atlantic within right whale populations. A 2021 study found that 5-year-old and 10-year-old whales were about the size of 2-year-old whales.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nJoshua Stewart, a quantitative conservation ecologist with the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, told the New York Times that he attributes the shrunken size to the thousands of fisherman traps that are along the route of the whales migratory patterns, causing some to get stuck.\n\n\"What we think is going on here is that dragging these big trailing heaps of gear is creating all this extra drag, which takes energy to pull around, and that's energy that they would probably otherwise be devoting to growth,\" Stewart told the outlet.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Bierlich, co-author on the study and an assistant professor at OSU's Marine Mammal Institute in Newport. \"And whales are considered ecosystem sentinels, so if the whale population isn't doing well, that might say a lot about the environment itself.\"\n\nThe study, published in Global Change Biology, looked at the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG), a small subset of about 200 gray whales within the larger Eastern North Pacific (ENP) population of around 14,500. This subgroup stays closer to shore along the Oregon coast, feeding in shallower, warmer waters than the Arctic seas where the bulk of the gray whale population spends most of the year.\n\nRecent studies from OSU have shown that whales in this subgroup are smaller and in overall worse body condition than their ENP counterparts. The current study reveals that they've been getting smaller in recent decades.\n\nThe Marine Mammal Institute's Geospatial Ecology of Marine Megafauna (GEMM) Lab has been studying this subgroup of gray whales since 2016, including flying drones over the whales to measure their size. Using images from 2016-2022 of 130 individual whales with known or estimated age, researchers determined that a full-grown gray whale born in 2020 is expected to reach an adult body length that is 1.65 meters (about 5 feet, 5 inches) shorter than a gray whale born prior to 2000. For PCFG gray whales that grow to be 38-41 feet long at full maturity, that accounts for a loss of more than 13% of their total length.\n\nIf the same trend were to happen in humans, that would be like the height of the average American woman shrinking from 5 feet, 4 inches to 4 feet, 8 inches tall over the course of 20 years.\n\n\"In general, size is critical for animals,\" said Enrico Pirotta, lead author on the study and a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. \"It affects their behavior, their physiology, their life history, and it has cascading effects for the animals and for the community they're a part of.\"\n\nWhale calves that are smaller at weaning age may be unable to cope with the uncertainty that comes with being newly independent, which can affect survival rates, Pirotta said.\n\nFor adult gray whales, one of the biggest concerns is reproductive success.\n\n\"With them being smaller, there are questions of how effectively these PCFG gray whales can store and allocate energy toward growing and maintaining their health. Importantly, are they able to put enough energy toward reproduction and keep the population growing?\" Bierlich said.\n\nScarring on PCFG whales from boat strikes and fishing gear entanglement also makes the team concerned that smaller body size with lower energy reserves may make the whales less resilient to injuries.\n\nThe study also examined the patterns of the ocean environment that likely regulate food availability for these gray whales off the Pacific coast by tracking cycles of \"upwelling\" and \"relaxation\" in the ocean. Upwelling sweeps nutrients from deeper to shallower regions, while relaxation periods then allow those nutrients to remain in shallower areas where light allows for growth of plankton and other tiny organisms, including the prey of gray whales.\n\n\"Without a balance between upwelling and relaxation, the ecosystem may not be able to produce enough prey to support the large size of these gray whales,\" said co-author Leigh Torres, associate professor and director of the GEMM Lab at OSU.\n\nThe data show that whale size declined concurrently with changes in the balance between upwelling and relaxation, Pirotta said.\n\n\"We haven't looked specifically at how climate change is affecting these patterns, but in general we know that climate change is affecting the oceanography of the Northeast Pacific through changes in wind patterns and water temperature,\" he said. \"And these factors and others affect the dynamics of upwelling and relaxation in the area.\"\n\nNow that they know the PCFG gray whales' body size is declining, researchers say they have a lot of new questions about downstream consequences of that decline and the factors that could be contributing to it.\n\n\"We're heading into our ninth field season studying this PCFG subgroup,\" Bierlich said. \"This is a powerful dataset that allows us to detect changes in body condition each year, so now we're examining the environmental drivers of those changes.\"\n\nThe other co-authors on the paper were Lisa Hildebrand, Clara Bird and Alejandro Aj\u00f3 at OSU and Leslie New at Ursinus College in Pennsylvania.\n\n/Public Release.

Among them was \"Magic,\" a 42-year-old female who has given birth to seven calves.\n\nAlso in May, aerial survey observers spotted 25 endangered sei whales feeding in the same area. The animals are typically seen in the spring when they feed on zooplankton.\n\nAccording to researchers at New England Aquarium, winter and spring is when several species of endangered whales travel hundreds of miles to summer feeding grounds in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. However, a large number are unaccounted for in Canadian waters during the summer.\n\n\"While right whales may have left Cape Cod Bay, these sightings serve as an important reminder that not all right whales migrate north in the summertime,\" said Katherine McKenna, an assistant research scientist in the Anderson Cabot Center who was aboard a recent aerial survey flight.\n\n\"In fact, the three feeding right whales we spotted in May have never been documented in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where about 40 percent of the species goes to feed each summer.\"\n\nThe aquarium's aerial survey team has conducted 40 flights since December 2023, documenting 74 North Atlantic right whales along the way.

Bierlich, co-author on the study and an assistant professor at OSU's Marine Mammal Institute in Newport. \"And whales are considered ecosystem sentinels, so if the whale population isn't doing well, that might say a lot about the environment itself.\"\n\nThe study, published in Global Change Biology, looked at the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG), a small subset of about 200 gray whales within the larger Eastern North Pacific (ENP) population of around 14,500. This subgroup stays closer to shore along the Oregon coast, feeding in shallower, warmer waters than the Arctic seas where the bulk of the gray whale population spends most of the year.\n\nRecent studies from OSU have shown that whales in this subgroup are smaller and in overall worse body condition than their ENP counterparts. The current study reveals that they've been getting smaller in recent decades.\n\nThe Marine Mammal Institute's Geospatial Ecology of Marine Megafauna (GEMM) Lab has been studying this subgroup of gray whales since 2016, including flying drones over the whales to measure their size. Using images from 2016-2022 of 130 individual whales with known or estimated age, researchers determined that a full-grown gray whale born in 2020 is expected to reach an adult body length that is 1.65 meters (about 5 feet, 5 inches) shorter than a gray whale born prior to 2000. For PCFG gray whales that grow to be 38-41 feet long at full maturity, that accounts for a loss of more than 13% of their total length.\n\nIf the same trend were to happen in humans, that would be like the height of the average American woman shrinking from 5 feet, 4 inches to 4 feet, 8 inches tall over the course of 20 years.\n\n\"In general, size is critical for animals,\" said Enrico Pirotta, lead author on the study and a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. \"It affects their behavior, their physiology, their life history, and it has cascading effects for the animals and for the community they're a part of.\"\n\nWhale calves that are smaller at weaning age may be unable to cope with the uncertainty that comes with being newly independent, which can affect survival rates, Pirotta said.\n\nFor adult gray whales, one of the biggest concerns is reproductive success.\n\n\"With them being smaller, there are questions of how effectively these PCFG gray whales can store and allocate energy toward growing and maintaining their health. Importantly, are they able to put enough energy toward reproduction and keep the population growing?\" Bierlich said.\n\nScarring on PCFG whales from boat strikes and fishing gear entanglement also makes the team concerned that smaller body size with lower energy reserves may make the whales less resilient to injuries.\n\nThe study also examined the patterns of the ocean environment that likely regulate food availability for these gray whales off the Pacific coast by tracking cycles of \"upwelling\" and \"relaxation\" in the ocean. Upwelling sweeps nutrients from deeper to shallower regions, while relaxation periods then allow those nutrients to remain in shallower areas where light allows for growth of plankton and other tiny organisms, including the prey of gray whales.\n\n\"Without a balance between upwelling and relaxation, the ecosystem may not be able to produce enough prey to support the large size of these gray whales,\" said co-author Leigh Torres, associate professor and director of the GEMM Lab at OSU.\n\nThe data show that whale size declined concurrently with changes in the balance between upwelling and relaxation, Pirotta said.\n\n\"We haven't looked specifically at how climate change is affecting these patterns, but in general we know that climate change is affecting the oceanography of the Northeast Pacific through changes in wind patterns and water temperature,\" he said. \"And these factors and others affect the dynamics of upwelling and relaxation in the area.\"\n\nNow that they know the PCFG gray whales' body size is declining, researchers say they have a lot of new questions about downstream consequences of that decline and the factors that could be contributing to it.\n\n\"We're heading into our ninth field season studying this PCFG subgroup,\" Bierlich said. \"This is a powerful dataset that allows us to detect changes in body condition each year, so now we're examining the environmental drivers of those changes.\"\n\nThe other co-authors on the paper were Lisa Hildebrand, Clara Bird and Alejandro Aj\u00f3 at OSU and Leslie New at Ursinus College in

These are followed by a period, which allows for the growth of plankton and the tiny crustaceans which grey whales eat.\n\n\"We haven't looked specifically at how climate change is affecting these patterns, but in general we know that climate change is affecting the oceanography of the Northeast Pacific through changes in wind patterns and water temperature,\" says co-author Leigh Torres, a marine ecologist and director of the Geospatial Ecology of Marine Megafauna Laboratory at OSU.\n\n\"And these factors and others affect the dynamics of upwelling and relaxation in the area.\"", "source": {"uri": "cosmosmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cosmos Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gray whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human impact on the environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_St_Andrews", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of St Andrews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arctic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plankton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megafauna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Megafauna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upwelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oceanography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biological life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crustacean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weaning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Ecology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Ecology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cosmosmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/7861BA6E-C3D6-452C-9BC9-470220BB5D1E_1_105_c-1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647105", "eventUri": "eng-9647105", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Whale watching groups up and down the Southern California coast have reported extraordinary sightings\n\nBlue whales were swimming off San Diego's coastline earlier this year and closer to shore, an atypical pattern that has allowed marine researchers to study the world's largest animal up close and has given whale watchers some extraordinary viewing experiences.\n\nA pod of blue whales was exceptionally close to the Scripps Pier in La Jolla on May 30 and Scripps Institution of Oceanography's Michaela Alksne knew this was her chance to test a new marine research tool that they hope will allow scientists to collect and study whale DNA.\n\n\"Having the blue whales really, really close to where our whole research facility has enabled us to do this awesome calibration study,\" said Alksne, a PhD candidate with Scripps's Acoustic Ecology Lab.\n\nWith clear, plastic buckets in tow, Alksne and her colleagues took a small boat as close as legally possible to these marine mammals and scooped up the rippling water left behind by their \"flukeprints.\" They took the samples back to their research lab where they used a filter to separate out larger cells and froze them. In a few weeks, they hope what's left behind is samples of blue whale DNA, proving the collection method worked.\n\n\"A current research question among the marine mammal community is, 'Can we leverage that environmental DNA, as we call it, to actually detect the whales without having to biopsy them? Without having to go on a ship with binoculars and see them or monitor their sounds?'\" Alksne said. \"Can we just scoop up a water sample and say, 'Oh, there was X amount of blue whales in this region or there's X amount of blue whale genetic material in this area.'\"\n\nIf the method sounds familiar, it may be because other labs across the globe are testing to see if eDNA is a feasible research method. Cal State Long Beach's Shark Lab recently tested the technology when monitoring Del Mar beach after a great white shark attack.\n\nIf proven successful, the technology could provide researchers with a more cost-effective, non-invasive way to monitor marine species and help their conservation.\n\nBlue whales are endangered and only about 3,000-5,000 migrate off the Pacific Coast, traveling north from Mexico from about June to early October foraging for food after their mating season.\n\nThis year, blue whales -- and lots of them -- were spotted off San Diego's coast in early May. Whale watching groups up and down the Southern California coast have reported frequent sightings.\n\nSan Diego Whale Watch said their first sighting of the season was on April 21 and regular sightings started around May 6. In some instances, the sightseeing group says, guests were able to witness up to 10 blue whales per tour.\n\nJessica Rodriguez, education manager of Davy's Licker Whale Watching, noted the same for their tour groups off the coast of Newport Beach.\n\n\"Not often do we see 15-plus blue whales within the two-mile radius of Newport Harbor. Everywhere you look, there's spouts. And it's almost like the end of a fireworks show, like you don't know which direction to look,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nTypically, in an El Nino season such as this year's, blue whale sightings would be lower due to warmer waters, which produce less of a food source for the cetacean. But one reason blue whales may be more visible this year is an increase in phytoplankton, similar to the ones that create bioluminescence in our waters.\n\n\"We think, at least the running hypothesis is, that all of those red tides have caused secondary blooms of zooplankton including the prey of blue whales being krill, and that's what's brought them to our shores,\" Alksne said. \"The phytoplankton that are blooming in the red tide... we believe that they're prey of krill.\"\n\nThe blue whale, despite its 90-foot length and up to 150-ton weight, is not easy to spot. The creature comes up for air only every about 8 minutes and does not breach like other species. Instead, the sign of a blue whale in the area is typically its blow, which can reach up to 30-feet into the air, and its fluke as it dives back down for food.\n\n\"Although it is not unusual to see them in the summertime here in Southern California, if you're looking globally, it is a very unique experience to be able to see blue whales in the wild,\" Rodriguez said. \"Only 1% of the human population will ever be in the presence of blue whales.\"\n\nFor those who want to take advantage of the potential increase in blue whales off our coast, do so sooner rather than later. Rodriguez said that it's not predictable exactly when and where you'll see blue whales during their migration season. Once the food source is gone, so are the whales.\n\n\"So, that experience of having them so close to the coastline over the last two weeks could be fleeting.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsandiego.com",

While extensive work was done in both New York and New Jersey to successfully bring back populations of species like the bald eagle, efforts has been more challenging in the ocean.\n\nThe North Atlantic right whale has been listed as an endangered species since 1970, and while their population began to rebound in the early 2000's, an \"unusual mortality event\" began in 2017, dealing a further blow to the ocean mammal.\n\nThough the whales can live for 70 years or longer, low birthrates, in addition to negative human interactions, including boat strikes and fishing gear entanglements, have kept the population from rebounding. Currently, there are only 360 documented right whales in the Atlantic Ocean, which makes NOAA's recent discovery all the more exciting.\n\nNOAA reported seeing an estimated 50 right whales feeding roughly 100 miles of the coast of New York, the largest gathering of the species to have been spotted all year. The reason for the concentrated gathering, scientists believe, was to feed in a nutrient-rich \"hotspot\". All the evidence they needed was copious amounts of excrement.\n\n\"The team thinks the whales were feeding because they saw lots of whale poop\", NOAA reported in a Facebook post, complete with the one of the world's most famous emojis. Here's how to identify one of the Atlantic Ocean's most precious creatures.\n\nRight whales, which were hunted heavily in the 1800s, can grow up to 50 feet long and weigh up to 140,000 pounds.

With emphasis, he explained \"I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.\" And it didn't \u00ad -- since we know it as the creature that sank the whaleship Essex in the real-life tragedy that was the inspiration for Moby Dick.\n\nIt is not surprising that this mammal became famous and it isn't just for its literary distinction. Sperm whales claim many superlatives that put them at the top of a few lists.\n\nStart with size. Sperm whales are livin' large \u00ad -- the largest of the toothed whales (some baleen whales grow larger), with the males being up to three times as massive as the females of the species. Females weigh in at about 15 tons, while males can be up to 45 tons.\n\nAn alternative name, cachalot, refers not to the numbers harvested, but is translated as \"big head\" or \"big teeth,\" as is the etymology of the latter part of its scientific name Physeter macrocephalus. The common name, \"sperm,\" comes from spermaceti, the compound in its head that made this animal so valued for oil, lubricants, and candles the spermaceti could make. Look to the Dr. Daniel Fisher House in Edgartown for the history of this profitable enterprise.\n\nThat size, of course, leads to grander titles. In that big head, sperm whales have quite a large brain. In fact, it is the largest brain on earth. At 18 pounds, it is five times heavier than the human brain.\n\nWhile they may not have hearts of gold, sperm whales do have a heavy heart, which can be 250 pounds. This whale's teeth are also large, more than two pounds each. Interestingly, sperm whales do not chew their prey; rather they crush and grind their favorite food squid, of which they consume up to three per cent of their body weight a day.\n\nThe consumed squid goes through the longest intestinal system in the world (over 900 feet), and will reach the whale's four-part stomach. The beaks of the squid are difficult to digest, collecting in the stomach, sometimes in the thousands.\n\nThese beaks are an irritation that is not wholly digestible. Much like the formation of a pearl in an oyster, these chitinous material are managed by the secretion of a waxy substance known as ambergris to mitigate the discomfort and assist in their breakdown. The ambergris will eventually be expelled via the animals' mouth or anus and can be found floating or on beaches. It is a prized and valuable material used in the perfumery trade.\n\nMore bragging rights go to the sperm whale when it comes to its diving abilities, even if it is not the top dog. Sperm whales are the third deepest divers of the sea, after only elephant seals and beaked whales. While normal dives range to 3,000 feet, exceptional records show that up to 10,000 feet is possible.\n\nThese impressive dives do take their toll, however, as necropsies have shown osteonecrosis or bone damage and other responses that resemble decompression sickness in humans. Sperm whales have adaptations that help, including a flexible rib cage that allows for collapse (rather than snapping) under pressure and specialized blood for conserving oxygen.\n\nSperm whales can also slow their metabolism to increase their time under water until they can surface and breath air through their blowholes. Remember, whales are mammals and can't breathe under water.\n\nLast week, a dead sperm whale was observed at Norton Point. Though it was in a stage of decay, it was clear from those who observed it, they were gazing upon a once great and powerful beast. In life, as in death \u00ad -- and in our imaginations -- it can always hold its gigantic head high.", "source": {"uri": "vineyardgazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Vineyard Gazette - Martha's Vineyard News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sperm whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermaceti", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spermaceti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_(whaleship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Essex (whaleship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Herman Melville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moby-Dick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baleen whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothed_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toothed whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tooth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Squid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Binomial nomenclature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambergris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambergris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Candle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubricant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lubricant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Scuba_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Scuba Diving", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Multi-Issue", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Multi-Issue", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Orgone_Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Orgone Energy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://vineyardgazette.com/sites/default/files/article-assets/main-photos/2024/suzan_bellincampi_dead_sperm_whale.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647105", "eventUri": "eng-9647105", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

During relaxation periods, these nutrients remain in the shallower zones, where light enables plankton and other small species that whales feed on to grow.\n\nClimate change is known to be an important factor affecting the dynamics of this delicate balance, through changes in wind patterns and water temperature.\n\nA smaller stature may not only hinder whales' ability to thrive, but also increase their vulnerability to threats such as collisions with boats and entanglement in fishing gear, which can be deadly.", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@digitaljournal.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gray whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_success", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive success"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_web", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food web"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arctic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_St_Andrews", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of St Andrews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fishing net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plankton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upwelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biological life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weaning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nutrient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science", "label": "dmoz/Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Quaternary_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Quaternary Studies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Plus-Size", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Plus-Size", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.digitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/4174f53dcda172a13398fd1557a735a69ec0c129.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647105", "eventUri": "eng-9647105", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

In addition, NOAA Fisheries will maintain adaptive management strategies to ensure the protection of endangered Western North Pacific gray whales and the Pacific Coast Feeding Group of Eastern North Pacific gray whales.\n\nEarlier this year, NOAA Fisheries closed the Unusual Mortality Event for the Eastern North Pacific gray whale population, which included 690 gray whale strandings from December 17, 2018 to November 9, 2023, with peak strandings from December 2018 to December 2020.

The Tribe requested that NOAA Fisheries authorize a Tribal hunt in the coastal portion of the Tribe's usual and accustomed fishing area for ceremonial and subsistence purposes, in addition to authorizing the making and sale of handicrafts created from the harvested whales.\n\nOn April 5, 2019, NOAA Fisheries published a proposed rule to issue a waiver under the MMPA and proposed regulations governing the hunting of Eastern North Pacific gray whales by the Makah Tribe for a 10-year period. At this time, the agency also published a related notice of hearing before an administrative law judge to consider the waiver and proposed regulations. In November 2019, a public hearing led by an administrative law judge took place in Seattle, Washington.\n\nOn September 23, 2021, the judge's recommended decision was transmitted to NOAA Fisheries along with the hearing transcript and other required documentation. These documents -- and public comments on them -- informed the agency's final decision on the Makah Tribe's waiver request.\n\nMore information about the Makah Tribe's request for a limited waiver of the Marine Mammal Protection Act moratorium on take of gray whales -- including a flowchart -- is available on the NOAA Fisheries' website as well as a historical chronology leading up to this milestone.", "source": {"uri": "noaa.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "NOS Data Explorer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makah", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Makah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Whaling_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Whaling Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Marine_Fisheries_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Marine Fisheries Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gray whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsistence_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Subsistence economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Mammal_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine Mammal Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_stranding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cetacean stranding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moratorium_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moratorium (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/landscape_width_1275/public/2024-06/PHOTO-Makah-Tribe-hunted-whales-in-hand-carved-canoes-Neah-Bay-Olympic-Peninsula-1900-Museum-of-History-and-Industry-Negative-Number-88-33-122.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647105", "eventUri": "eng-9647105", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-12-", "dateEnd": "2020-12-", "textStart": 2213, "textEnd": 2243}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-12-17", "textStart": 2148, "textEnd": 2165}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-02-14", "textStart": 2431, "textEnd": 2448}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-05", "textStart": 2897, "textEnd": 2910}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-11-", "textStart": 3266, "textEnd": 3279}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

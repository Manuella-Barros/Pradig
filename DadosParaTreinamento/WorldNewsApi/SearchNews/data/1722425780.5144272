However, she was down to gush over her new castmate, Racquel Chevremont, who was announced as the latest addition to \u201cRHONY\u201d Season 15 this week. \u201cI actually feel more grounded with her on the cast because I feel like she has a healthy mindset but also likes to have fun,\u201d the Mezcalum co-founder raved while chatting about the art curator, model and proud member of the queer community. \u201cShe\u2019s just been really great. She\u2019s lived such an interesting life. She has an incredible career,\u201d Lichy continued. \u201cShe\u2019s amazing.\u201d The current \u201cRHONY\u201d crew \u2014 who are in the throes of filming \u2014 includes Chevremont, 53, plus returning reboot stars Lichy, Jenna Lyons, Brynn Whitfield, Ubah Hassan, Jessel Taank and Sai De Silva, as well as series newcomer Rebecca Minkoff. Chevremont told GLAAD on Thursday that she was thrilled to add more queer representation to the reality show, following in the footsteps of Lyons \u2014 the first openly gay woman to star on \u201cNew York City.\u201d \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think [Bravo] would be interested in me in the end because they already had a queer woman,\u201d said the Bravo rookie. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if they were going to want two queer women on a franchise that has historically been about married heterosexual women. I think it was a bold decision and honestly a more authentic representation of NYC.\u201d For more Page Six reality TV updates\u2026 Listen to our \u201cVirtual Reali-Tea\u201d podcast Shop our exclusive merch Lichy, for her part, told Page Six on Thursday that she is not only thrilled to uplift Chevremont, but the entire LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and beyond. \u201cI\u2019m an ally,\u201d she asserted, noting that she chose to partner with DJ Eliad Cohen \u2014 revered for his advocacy and work in gay nightlife \u2014 for the event, where he spun tracks as guests sipped on mezcal cocktails made with her and husband Abe Lichy\u2019s own alcohol brand. \u201cWe love each other so much.

Now, she has lost over half her body weight and can\u2019t believe the transformation of her mental and physical health. Tina\u2019s decision to lose weight was prompted by her mum, who also struggled with her size.

However, she heard her mum\u2019s words in her head and knew that she needed to change her life before it was too late. \u201cMum\u2019s health deteriorated because she was overweight,\u201d she said. \u201cWatching my mother struggling and then passing away, it kind of encouraged me. I always heard her words.\u201d Tina was considering a gastric band before she saw an advertisement for the 1:1 Diet \u2013 a weight loss regime that involves starting off with cutting calories via a controlled plan with the help of a diet consultant, before learning how to calorie count and portion your food to continue and sustain your weight loss. Tina had tried a number of diet plans before, but found them too restrictive. \u201cI\u2019d give myself two weeks with diets and I\u2019d give up,\u201d she said. \u201cI got depressed. I also think you need a person behind you to motivate you. \u201cCarol and Tracey from 1:1 are fantastic. I have to give credit where credit is due. \u201cWithout them behind me, I don\u2019t think I would have come this far and that\u2019s the truth.\u201d Despite a difficult start, Tina found the 1:1 Diet easier to stick to thanks to the ongoing support from her diet consultants, Carol and Tracy. \u201cThe first week, week-and-a-half, I did struggle,\u201d admitted Tina. \u201cBut then I saw that I was nine-and-a-half pounds down on my first week, and the second week I had over a stone gone. \u201cThe first step is always the hardest, but when you see those results, it\u2019s an amazing feeling and it encourages you to carry on. \u201cIt was all about learning what to eat \u2013 the quality and the quantity of the food. Weighing out my food works for me, and you can still love the food and lose weight as you go. \u201cThis is the only diet that has worked for me.\u201d She is now 15 stone down, and she can\u2019t believe the difference in herself. Tina had struggled with low self-esteem for years, but putting the work in to improve her health has made all the difference with how she feels about herself. \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing, I feel amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my house, I didn\u2019t have mirrors because I hated myself. The names I called myself when I was heavy \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t even say them because they were terrible. Even passing a shop window, I wouldn\u2019t look at my reflection. \u201cBut now I\u2019m feeling amazing and my confidence is sky high. I look at myself now in my clothes. It\u2019s brilliant to do things that I would have never done \u2013 water aerobics, personal training, yoga.\u201d Now on the other side of her weight loss, Tina advises anyone embarking on a health or fitness journey to do it for themselves and no-one else. \u201cI was always looking after people \u2013 my mum, my dad, my husband, my kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI totally neglected myself. \u201cTo go on a diet, you have to be kind to yourself and learn to love yourself. Believe in yourself, and always remember on your hardest days why you started this.\u201d For more information on Tina\u2019s weight loss regime, you can check out the 1:1 Diet on their website one2onediet.com.

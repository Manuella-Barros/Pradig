From my first visit, I felt a deep connection to its people and everything that makes them so special. When I considered acquiring Anchor Brewing Company, I learned the story of this amazing brand - America's oldest craft beer - is deeply rooted in this great place and the two are forever connected.\"\n\nUlukaya's post was accompanied by a video, in which he described meeting with four former Anchor Brewing employees and discussing the history of the brewery, the \"uniqueness of Steam Beer,\" and how Anchor was \"embedded in San Francisco's fabric.\"\n\n\"It might be old, it might be given up on, but it is the grand jewel,\" Ulukaya said in the video.\n\n\"When I told them that I'd like to be part of bringing this company, Anchor beer, this dream, back to life, they couldn't be more excited and I couldn't be more honored,\" he continued. \"It's the essence of San Francisco, It's the essence of this country, that we can always bring it back stronger, better than ever before. I think the best time of San Francisco is yet to come. I can't wait to get back to work on my part with Anchor Brewing. Let's do this.\"\n\nSam Singer, who served as the spokesperson for the Sapporo-owned Anchor brand during the closure and sale process, said in a statement shared with Brewbound: \"This is a great day for San Francisco. Anchor is deeply pleased that Hamdi Ulukaya has purchased the Anchor Brewing Company. His commitment to the brewery and its history in San Francisco will be important to future generations of San Franciscans and Californians.\"\n\nSapporo announced it would cease operations at Anchor and liquidate the business in July. Workers were given 60 day's notice, and packaging and distribution of remaining beer continued through the end of July. At the time, Sapporo said it had repeatedly tried to sell the business for at least a year, but those efforts fell short.\n\nHilco Corporate Finance took over the bidding process, and considered offers for all of Anchor's assets - including intellectual property, real estate and brewing equipment - both individually and as a group of assets.\n\nMany expressed intent to buy the business, including Anchor SF Cooperative, a group of former Anchor workers, who launched a WeFunder campaign to support their bid. News of the winning bid was expected by the end of January, with multiple bids under review at the time, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. However, news of the winning bid was not made public until now.\n\nUlukaya is the latest person to resurrect the Anchor brand, which was established in 1896. Fritz Maytag famously revived Anchor in 1965, and established Anchor Steam Beer as an iconic craft brand.\n\nUlukaya is also the majority owner of La Colombe Coffee Roasters, purchasing a majority stake from a private equity firm in 2015, according to the San Francisco Standard. Chobani went on to acquire La Colombe for $900 million in December, making Keurig Dr Pepper an equity stakeholder in Chobani, thanks to a previous minority investment in La Colombe.\n\nAnchor produced 15,000 barrels of beer in 2023, before operations shut down, according to the Brewers Association's New Brewer Magazine.", "source": {"uri": "brewbound.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brewbound"},

After looking further into the historic brewery, Ulukaya learned of its importance to San Francisco and found similarities between the brewery's journey and Chobani's. (Established in upstate New York in 2005, the Greek yogurt company got its start in a factory that was also on the brink of closure.)\n\n\"I realized how Anchor is really aligned with the city's history,\" he told the newspaper in an interview on Thursday night. \"I thought, 'Wow, what if? What if we can bring it back?' And that excited me because I've been part of bringing back a factory back in upstate New York and building a brand.\"\n\nWhile the price of the deal was not disclosed, the acquisition includes all of the brewery's assets including all its recipes, the Potrero Hill brewing facility, and the brewing equipment in all warehouses, which is allegedly still in good shape. Ulukaya's plans for the brewery include modernizing Potrero Hill to get the iconic beer flowing once more throughout the Bay Area as soon as possible. Ulukaya disclosed that all he's waiting for now is \"permission from the city and alignment with the community and the people who worked there a long time.\"\n\nThe city appears to be on board with the new ownership, with mayor Landon Breed calling the purchase not just an investment in the brewery, but in San Francisco itself.\n\n\"It's a recognition of what makes our city truly special -- our history, our institutions, and our people. Anchor Brewing has always been a beloved part of San Francisco and thanks to Hamdi Ulukaya, it will be a part of San Francisco for years to come.\" she told the Chronicle. \"I'm grateful for his commitment to being a part of the future of our city and for keeping the tradition of Anchor Steam beer being brewed right here where it belongs.\"\n\nUlukaya shared that he has met with four previously long-term Anchor employees and communicated his desire to rehire as many former employees as possible, though he remains unsure if the previously formed union will be recognized. Once the brewery is made operational, Ulukaya plans to focus on distributing Anchor brews throughout the Bay Area first before, hopefully, opening plans to national markets.\n\nIt remains unclear exactly which specific Anchor beers will return, though Anchor Steam and the brewery's beloved Christmas Ale are certain to make a comeback -- perhaps sooner rather than later.\n\n\"Let's get back to work. Let's bring it back to life,\" Ulukaya told the Chronicle. \"I don't want to sit around. Wouldn't it be amazing to get it going in time to make the Christmas ale this year? That would be awesome.\"\n\nAs for brews like the West Coast IPA, the Tropical Hazy IPA, Liberty Ale, and California Lager, Ulukaya will discuss with employees which are worth bringing back. \"It's a competitive landscape -- a lot of beers out there. But who cares? From the other perspective you have the people behind it, the history, the recipe, the name, and the tradition aligned with this magical San Francisco,\" he said. \"There is no value you can put into that.\"\n\n\"I admit, I didn't expect it to end this way. When I first broke the news of Anchor's closure last July, I argued that there was an opportunity for a 'benevolent' Bay Area billionaire to descend from on high and deus ex machina the original steam beer brewery out of its Sapporo USA-induced defunction, scooping up some public goodwill in the process. After some initial chatter (including more than one self-identified family-office manager emailing yours truly inquiring after the financial particulars of the firm), no serious suitors with that kind of cash emerged. I've been following up on leads about Anchor's liquidation since before the auction even officially began late last year, and when none of them panned out, I figured the iconic brewery was headed for the scrap heap, both figuratively and literally.\n\nThe good news: that didn't happen! A whole-enchilada sale was always the most attractive one from a cultural perspective (if not a business one) and that's exactly what Hamdi Ulukaya appears to have pulled off here. Keeping the physical brewery coupled to its intellectual property is a more dignified outcome for San Francisco's (and American brewing's) \"grand jewel,\" as the foodstuff mogul called it in a video posted to social media this morning. It also sets Anchor up for a smoother restart -- as far as I know, all the equipment is still in place on Potrero Hill, and former workers know their way around the plant like the back of their hands, so the runway should be short if Ulukaya intends to rehire 'em. Watch closely to see if that happens.\n\n'We're excited to hear that Mr. Ulukaya wants to bring back as many workers as possible,' Patrick Machel, a former production worker, tells me by phone. 'The people who have made Anchor for decades stand ready to return to work and start making the beer the city loves.' He estimates that if Ulukaya is willing (and able) to rehire 'a majority' of the former staff, Anchor could be churning out beer a month later thanks to all the institutional knowledge of the place. The billionaire has not yet contacted the Anchor SF Cooperative, the worker-led effort to acquire Anchor that mothballed its bid earlier this year, and his comments to the Chronicle about Anchor Union, an International Longshore and Warehouse Local 6 affiliate that has represented workers at the plant since 2019, were brief and noncommittal.\n\nWhether Ulukaya does right by Anchor's former workers is an open question whose answer is a potential fly in the ointment, especially given San Francisco's left-leaning politics and the country's historically high pro-labor sentiment these days. Another potential bummer ahead: the billionaire has no experience in the brewing industry, and told the Chronicle he was keen to expand Anchor's distribution footprint. That's a tough row to hoe for a regional brewery that has a lot of work to do to recapture its home market, particularly with all those headwinds we keep talking about.\n\nI'll try not to be too cynical before Anchor's Ulukaya chapter gets underway in earnest, though. Today, Steam Beer's future is more secure than it has been for nearly a year, and that's something to celebrate.\" -- Dave Infante, VinePair columnist, podcast host, and contributing editor",

But a month late, the Chronicle reports that Ulukaya is the new owner of Anchor Brewing's assets, and he sounds eager to get the Potrero Hill brewery back open once more. \"Wouldn't it be amazing to get it going in time to make the Christmas ale this year? That would be awesome,\" Ulukaya tells the paper.\n\nThis sounds like great news for the group of former Anchor Brewing Company employees who had formed a collective that had considered putting in a bid of their own for the assets. They ultimately decided not to submit a bid, and they put out a statement in March saying that they were open to \"partnering in some manner with the successful bidder.\" And now Ulukaya says he's looking to bring back the company's longtime employees.\n\nThis also means that Ulukaya's bid beat out one that we had heard was put in by an investor group that included Pete's Wicked Ale CFO Jim Collins and former Anchor owner Fritz Maytag.\n\nFascinatingly, Ulukaya has no real connections to San Francisco and had never heard of Anchor Steam Beer until last August, when he read an article about the brewery's closure in Forbes.\n\n\"I realized how Anchor is really aligned with the city's history. And I thought, 'Wow, what if? What if we can bring it back?'\" Ulukaya says in an interview with the Chronicle. \"And that excited me because I've been part of bringing back a factory back in upstate New York and building a brand.\"\n\nHe's referring to the story that he's shared in a TED Talk and elsewhere about growing up in rural Turkey, coming to the US, and eventually buying a failing yogurt plant in upstate New York in 2005 and launching the highly successful Chobani brand.\n\nUlukaya speaks in fairly abstract and emotional terms when he describes his business acumen, talking of his \"anti-CEO playbook,\" and putting people before profits. He was inspired, he said, to revive this yogurt factory in New York in part of a familial connection to yogurt-making, but also out of a desire to give life back to the town it was in, and to its workers.\n\n\"It remind[s] me [of] a feeling that I used to remember when a kid would drown in [the] Euphrates River from our hometown,\" he said in a TED interview. \"You will have this sadness cloud over the town for months and months. You feel like the whole place is dead. You know, it's cemetery. And I had the same feeling in there when that plant was closed, when I was buying it at the time, is that this is the end of us, this is finished, this is over.\"\n\nSpeaking about the Anchor brand, and his interest in the beer business, Ulukaya seems to have appreciated something about the brand itself -- and he says he's actually no big beer connoisseur himself.\n\n\"It's a competitive landscape -- a lot of beers out there,\" he tells the Chronicle. \"But who cares? From the other perspective you have the people behind it, the history, the recipe, the name and the tradition aligned with this magical San Francisco. There is no value you can put into that.\"\n\nIt's not yet clear whether the Anchor Public Taps taproom will return in the space next door to the brewery, or whether Ulukaya has bigger plans for brewpubs and the like. Ulukaya says those things will come in time, and he's just now talking to the former employees.\n\nAs he said in that interview, \"Making plans has never been my thing... Now I'm making those kind of plans because I have kids. I think adaptations of the reality has been my thing, and that is coming back to the nomadic lifestyle. You know, if you're in a Kurdish tribe and nomadic Kurdish tribe, you leave, you go to a place and you say, 'This is a good place for us to stay.'\"\n\nAll in all, this is great news for the city and for lovers of Anchor beers. There was a possibility in this whole bankruptcy process that the brand and recipes might be sold to one entity, and the historic brewery building could have been sold to another for redevelopment, which would have been especially sad.\n\nNow, maybe later this year, you'll be able to tour the place again and see the copper stills, and taste some fresh steam beer once more.", "source": {"uri": "sfist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SFist -

The old label will return", "body": "After its abrupt closure last July shocked city beer fanatics -- and led to a run on the dwindling supply of the brewery's products -- the historic San Francisco Anchor Brewing finally has a new buyer and a real chance at revival. Billionaire entrepreneur **Hamdi Ulukaya**, the Turkish-born CEO and founder of **Chobani**, the country's largest producer of Greek yogurt, has purchased the brewery and its 2.17-acre Potrero Hill home.\n\nUlukaya's personal investment firm, **Shepherd Futures**, is working with local developer **Presidio Bay Ventures** to help restart the brewery operations, restoring its traditional branding and repositioning the company again as a national player in the beverage space. Ulukaya has only been to San Francisco a handful of times but after learning the country's oldest craft brewer was closing through an article -- he sent the article to a colleague and asked them to find out more. That initial exploration led to a visit to Anchor Brewing's San Francisco facilities, where he met with an employee who had worked at the company for 25 years. Soon enough, he was convinced.\n\nOver Anchor's 127-year history, it has had a string of owners ranging from German immigrants to appliance heir **Fritz Maytag** to international beverage brands. Anchor's last owner prior to its closure was Japanese-based **Sapporo Breweries**, which purchased the company for $85 million in 2017. Sapporo shuttered the brand in 2023, blaming flagging sales and after a much-maligned label redesign and rebranding. Ulukaya, made sure to note he was no big fan of the brand's new direction and intends to restore the brand's beloved historic branding and imagery.\n\nThe property includes Anchor's main brewing facility at 501 De Haro St. and a taproom across Mariposa Street at 495 De Haro St., totaling around 110,000 square feet. Land-use sources have also raised the potential for rezoning of adjacent undeveloped land into a residential property. John Jensen, a longtime commercial real estate broker with **Colliers** who has worked in Potrero Hill for decades, said the Anchor Brewing facility is a jewel within the neighborhood that could help spark a renewed vibrancy.\n\nUlukaya was selected as the buyer at the end of a complex months-long auction process, which divided the company's real estate holdings, brewing equipment, brand, and intellectual property, including the iconic steam beer Anchor helped pioneer. Each of these assets was for sale individually or as a whole. Among those in the running to purchase the brewery were a group of former Anchor employees called the Anchor SF Cooperative and Potrero Hill resident and venture investor **Mike Walsh**. The purchase price for Anchor was not disclosed, but brokerage firm **CBRE** previously listed the real estate assets for $40 million. The company's intellectual property was seeing bids of up to nearly $10 million, according to a source close to the process.\n\nAnchor fans feared that the piecemeal process could diminish the 127-year-old brewing company. Ulukaya said the sellers were attracted by his offer to keep all parts of the company intact. \"Anchor Brewing has always been a beloved part of San Francisco and thanks to Hamdi Ulukaya, it will be a part of San Francisco for years to come,\" Mayor **London Breed** said in a statement. Ulukaya said he's embarking on a listening tour to ask community members what they would like to see. While there is no exact timeline for the relaunch, he plans on moving quickly.\n\nUlukaya was born into a Kurdish dairy farming family in eastern Turkey and immigrated to the United States at the age of 22, where he started his journey into entrepreneurship. In line with his own immigrant story, Ulukaya has been particularly outspoken in his support for refugees and has created a nonprofit meant to link refugees to jobs at major companies. Chobani was born after Ulukaya purchased a shuttering yogurt factory in New York previously operated by Kraft Foods. After hiring four of the laid-off workers, Ulukaya reformatted the facility to create strained yogurt similar to the type he grew up with in Turkey. The company, which has expanded into categories like oat milk, yogurt drinks, and creamers, has surpassed $2 billion in sales. Ulukaya himself is worth some $2.4 billion, according to the **Forbes** Real-Time Net Worth index.\n\nUlukaya said he sees a parallel between the humble beginnings of Chobani and his hopes for revitalizing Anchor Brewing. He recently spent two hours with the four employees who have been with the company for decades keeping the legacy of the historic brand alive. \"I wish someone could listen to the passion and love and mixed with the emotion that comes out of it,\" Ulukaya said. \"I'm addicted to restarting something.\" Ulukaya noted he's not particularly prone to invest in other food and beverage brands outside of Chobani. In 2015, he became the majority owner of **La Colombe Coffee Roasters**, purchasing his stake from a private equity he feared would dilute what he loved about the company and its products. Chobani later outright acquired the brand in 2023 for $900 million.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Or do you value it for how much money it makes?\"\n\nThe mogul said that the goal is to get the brewery running again as soon as possible.\n\nRight now he told the publication that he is waiting to get permission from the city as well as speak with people who have worked there for a long time.\n\n\"Let's get back to work.

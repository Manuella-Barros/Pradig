The new system will come into effect from July 1. Till now the contributions received by the Trustee Bank were invested on the next day (T + 1). That is, the contribution received today is invested tomorrow. The PFRDA Point of Presence (POP) has advised the nodal offices and the NPS Trust for eNPS to follow these new deadlines to ensure immediate benefits to the customers.

This will give the benefit of same day NVA to the NPS account holder, which will help in increasing his money. Investments made in mutual funds till 3 pm get the benefit of same day NVA. On the day the market falls, people usually want to invest for more units. With the implementation of same day settlement in NPS, this investment option will also become attractive.

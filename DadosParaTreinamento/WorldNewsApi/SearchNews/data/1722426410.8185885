This follows the departure last month of Martha Chizuma after the expiry of her contract. Currently, ACB\u2019s Deputy Director General Hillary Chilomba is acting as Director General. Ministry of Justice has said it has started the process of identifying a new chief for the bureau. Spokesperson for the ministry, Frank Namangale, said the new Director General shall be appointed within the specified period. \u201cThe Ministry of Justice is required by law to advertise the position, and appoint a selection panel to shortlist and interview the candidates. \u201cThe Minister of Justice, Titus Mvalo, already instructed the Solicitor General and Secretary for Justice to advertise the position because by law, an acting Director General for the Anti-Corruption Bureau can only act up to a maximum period of six months. So processes are underway,\u201d Namangale said. Section 6 (A) of the Corrupt Practices Act of 2019 reads: \u201cIn the event of a vacancy in the office of the Director, the minister shall advertise the position in the Gazette and at least two newspapers of widest circulation in Malawi. \u201cUpon receipt of the applications, the minister shall empanel a selection team of not more than seven people comprising representatives of the public sector, the private sector, faith organizations, traditional leadership, civil society organizations and the media.\u201d The Act further states that the selection panel shall carry out the shortlisting and interviews in order to pick a minimum of two and a maximum of three candidates for the position and the minister shall send the list to the President for the appointment of one of the candidates as Director. After the shortlisted candidates have undergone the necessary security clearance and vetting, the President shall make the appointment, subject to section 6(2) and this has to be done from the names on the list recommended by the minister. ACB Principal Public Relations Officer Egrita Ndala assured that the operations of the bureau have not been affected with the departure of Chizuma. She said the law allows the acting controlling officer to perform all duties that could be performed by the Director General. Executive Director for Centre for Social Accountability and Transparency Willy Kambwandira said speed of essence in the hiring process. \u201cWe demand a speedy and transparent recruitment process of the DG at ACB. We all know that there are certain decisions that an acting controlling officer would not make, and this places ACB at a vulnerable position. \u201cThe Ministry of Justice knew that the ex-DG was not renewing her contract or they were not renewing her contract, and necessary steps should have been taken way back to avoid creating vacuum,\u201d Kambwandira said. Human Rights Defenders Coalition (HRDC) chairperson Gift Trapence also emphasized the need for urgency and credibility of the process of appointing the new Director General. \u201cHRDC commends Ministry of Justice commitment to comply with time frame in the recruitment of the ACB director. It is our expectation that the recruitment process will be credible,\u201d Trapence said.", "summary": "By Cathy Maulidi: Government has up to six months to hire new Director General for the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB).

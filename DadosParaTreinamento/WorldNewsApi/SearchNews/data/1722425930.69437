Federal prosecutors said on Friday that Hoau-Yan Wang, 67, fabricated data included in grant applications to the National Institutes of Health on behalf of himself and a publicly-listed Austin, Texas-based pharmaceutical company for which he was a consultant.

Prosecutors did not name the company, but it fits the description of Cassava Sciences , which lists Wang as a consultant. Cassava was not accused of wrongdoing. In 2021, two physicians unaffiliated with Cassava alleged the research underpinning its Alzheimer's drug, called simufilam, was based on manipulated and misrepresented data.

A spokesperson for CUNY said the university \"has and will continue to cooperate to the fullest degree\" with the investigation. A NIH spokesperson said the institute takes research misconduct very seriously. Cassava said in a statement that Wang worked on the drug's \"early development\" but \"had no involvement in the company's phase 3 trials of simufilam.\" A phase 3 trial refers to a late-stage, large-scale test. The company said on May 10New Tab, opens new tab that over 735 patients had participated in simufilam's phase 3 trial.

Cassava shares surged from $7 in January 2021 to above $135 in July 2021 on investor hopes the company was on the verge of a breakthrough in treating Alzheimer's, a common form of dementia. The stock plunged after its research results were questioned. Shares were down more than 40% at $11 on Friday afternoon. Wang could face decades in prison if convicted on all four counts of fraud and false statements he faces, though any sentence would ultimately be determined by a judge. A federal grand jury sitting in Greenbelt, Maryland, indicted him on Thursday, court records showed.

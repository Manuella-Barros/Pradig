(Scripps News)\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center is warning residents of central and western Oklahoma and southern Kansas of severe weather that could produce long-track tornadoes and softball-size hail on Monday.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center is forecasting a high risk of severe weather in the region. Oklahoma City is among the cities facing the highest risk. Tulsa and Wichita also face a significant threat of tornadoes.\n\nA high risk of severe weather is a level 5 on the Storm Prediction Center's 0-5 scale. Monday is the first time in over a year the Storm Prediction Center has issued a high risk warning for severe weather. The last time was March 31, 2023, when over 100 tornadoes were reported throughout the Mississippi River Valley.\n\n\"Numerous severe thunderstorms are expected to develop and move eastward Monday afternoon through Monday night across parts of the southern/central Plains. Multiple intense, long-track tornadoes, very large to giant hail, and severe/damaging winds all appear likely,\" the National Weather Service said early Monday.\n\nForecasters expressed some uncertainty early Monday morning about the forecast despite saying that the conditions were favorable for a \"high-end\" tornado environment. However, by the middle of Monday morning, forecasters gained more confidence in the projection for numerous and intense tornadoes.\n\nParts of Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa and Arkansas could also experience severe weather on Monday evening.\n\nTornado Alley has become more active in recent weeks. The National Weather Service said there were 38 tornadoes reported in Oklahoma in April, far above the average of 13 the state typically has. May is generally the busiest month for tornadoes in the state. Oklahoma has averaged 34 tornadoes every May from 1998 to 2022.\n\nKansas also saw a jolt in severe weather activity in April. The state had 53 tornado reports, which is much higher than the 12 it averages in April. Kansas averages 37 tornadoes every May.

An 'extreme' risk of severe weather, including tornadoes, has been issued by AccuWeather, which is rare and reserved for the most dangerous events.\n\nThis threat of dangerous weather will kick off another multi-day episode of severe storms that will expand east to also include parts of the Midwest, East, and South through the rest of the week. After that, a change in the weather pattern will bring a much-needed break in the stormy weather for the nation's heartland.\n\nFollowing a relative lull in severe weather over the weekend, the same storm that brought heavy rain, mountain snow and gusty winds to the West will emerge in the Plains on Monday. It will be this system, combined with a warm and humid air mass, that will spark the potentially tornadic thunderstorms to start the week, say AccuWeather meteorologists.\n\n\"Thunderstorms are expected to fire quickly on Monday afternoon from west-central Kansas north into Nebraska,\" said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Tyler Roys. \"Here, the biggest threat will initially be from large hail.\"\n\nWith twisting winds expected in the atmosphere, there is also an elevated risk for supercells and tornadoes, which can begin later in the afternoon on Monday. A supercell is a thunderstorm that rotates and often drops twisters.\n\n\"Supercells are expected to fire by the mid- to late-afternoon hours from western Oklahoma into western Kansas before moving east into the night,\" added Roys. \"Not only will these storms likely contain a few tornadoes, but also giant, damaging hailstones.\"\n\nBecause of the tremendous risk for severe weather in the central Plains, AccuWeather meteorologists have hoisted a 'high' risk for severe thunderstorms last Friday for Monday. The 'extreme' risk was issued early Monday morning and is situated across south-central Kansas and north-central Oklahoma. It is in this area where the threat of devastating, long-track tornadoes is greatest.\n\nThis region has been no stranger to severe weather as of late, with more than 100 confirmed tornadoes, some deadly, and over 1,000 incidents of severe weather reported since April 25. That tally is sure to grow in the coming days.\n\n\"We are probably looking at dozens of tornadoes being produced during the severe weather outbreak from Monday to Tuesday,\" AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said.\n\nBy Tuesday and Tuesday night, while the severe weather and tornado threat will shift largely out of the central Plains, it will impact millions more from Arkansas to Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and western Pennsylvania, including in the metropolitan areas of Chicago, Indianapolis and St. Louis.\n\n\"The Tuesday morning commute is likely to be a slow one as a line of thunderstorms roars through areas from St. Louis to Fort Smith, Arkansas,\" said Roys. \"Chicagoland should also get in on these potentially strong storms later in the morning.\"\n\nThere are some questions about how primed the atmosphere will be for storms later in the day, farther south and east on Tuesday, thus leading to lower risk categories for severe weather. Despite that, thunderstorms are still expected to develop again later in the day after some daytime heating provides fuel for the atmosphere.\n\n\"Areas from southeastern Illinois, Indiana and Ohio south through Kentucky are at greatest risk for storms from Tuesday afternoon into the night,\" noted Roys.\n\nThe risk for severe thunderstorms will not abate after Tuesday. AccuWeather meteorologists say that dozens more states will be threatened by storms during the mid- and late-week periods. New injections of atmospheric energy will be responsible for maintaining this threat through at least Friday, extending all the way to the East Coast.\n\n\"A more potent day of severe weather is anticipated on Wednesday as an area of low pressure develops across the eastern Plains into Missouri,\" said Roys. \"Widespread severe thunderstorm activity, including the risk of flash flooding, damaging winds, hail and tornadoes, can occur from northeastern Texas to the Ohio Valley.\"\n\nIncluded in the risk area on Wednesday will be many of the same areas that were under at least 'some' risk for severe weather on Tuesday. Additionally, AccuWeather meteorologists have increased the risk for severe weather on Wednesday to 'high' across southern Illinois, southern Indiana, western Kentucky, southeastern Missouri and far northwestern Tennessee.\n\nBy Thursday, the storm responsible for the severe weather will begin to move more briskly off to the east, expanding the risk for strong storms and even a few tornadoes into more of the South and mid-Atlantic, including the cities of Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte and Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile the possibility of damaging winds, hail and tornadoes will catch the eye of many, so should the risk for flooding.\n\n\"Heavy rain can again fall from thunderstorms come Thursday between Interstates 20 and 10 in eastern Texas,\" added Roys. \"This area does not need any more rain after the tremendous amount that fell earlier in the month.\"\n\nBy the end of the workweek on Friday, gusty storms are expected to arrive in the Southeast, including as far south as resort areas in central Florida. While the risk for tornadoes appears lower here compared to areas farther north, the storms can still pack hail and damaging wind gusts over 55 mph.\n\nBy the time this week comes to an end, it will have been over two weeks since the recent rash of severe weather and violent tornadoes kicked off in the Plains. With little in the way of breaks in between weather systems over that timeframe, those cleaning up from the storms will be happy to know a much-needed break in storminess is in the forecast, say AccuWeather meteorologists.\n\nDrier air expanding across the Plains beginning on Friday, but especially during the upcoming weekend dates of May 11 and 12, will lead to a much quieter weather pattern across the region. This is especially great news because Mother's Day falls on May 12.\n\nEven after those dates, early in the following week, conditions should remain quieter than earlier in May because the amount of energy in the atmosphere appears displaced from the region and weaker than is required for severe weather outbreaks.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

Temperatures will be in the mid-70s, a few degrees above average for this time of year in Kansas City. Humidity is also expected to be lower, and winds will be breezy.\n\nHowever, a cold front will head toward the region, bringing a chance of showers and thunderstorms.\n\nThe storms are expected to fire up along and ahead of a cold front over central Nebraska Friday evening. The weather service said a line or broken line of showers and thunderstorms are expected to move into northwest Missouri and northeast Kansas around 3 or 4 a.m. Saturday.\n\n\"A strong storm or two are possible capable of producing hail to the size of quarters or gusty winds to 60 mph,\" the weather service said.\n\nThe storms are expected to weaken as they move to the east in the morning, the weather service said. They are expected to exit the region by noon. Up to an additional inch of rain is likely across eastern Kansas and northwest Missouri, which could cause the water levels of area rivers and streams to rise higher.\n\nThe timing of the cold front will influence Saturday's temperatures, ranging from the mid-60s over northwest Missouri to the mid-70s in mid-Missouri. In Kansas City, temperatures are expected to be around 70 degrees.\n\nCooler weather is expected Sunday, with temperatures likely in the upper 60s.\n\nShowers and perhaps a thunderstorm or two will be possible in the afternoon, primarily south of Interstate 70, the weather service said.\n\nPowerful storms expected next week\n\nThe weather service is monitoring the chance for severe storms on Monday and urges people to watch for updates through the weekend.\n\nShowers and thunderstorms will be likely in the evening and overnight. The storms may be strong to severe. Moderate rainfall will be possible, leading to more flash and river flooding.\n\nThe weather service's Storm Prediction Center said a severe weather outbreak could happen.

An extreme risk of severe weather, including tornadoes, has been issued by AccuWeather, which is rare and reserved for the most dangerous events.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe extreme classification implies the risk of multiple strong, long-track tornadoes.\n\nThis threat of dangerous weather will kick off another multiday episode of severe storms that will expand east to also include parts of the Midwest, East, and South through the rest of the week. After that, a change in the weather pattern will bring a much-needed break in the stormy weather for the nation's heartland.\n\nA tornado near Interstate 80 in Lincoln, Nebraska, on April 26, 2024. (Nebraska Department of Transportation) Advertisement\n\nFollowing a relative lull in severe weather over the weekend, the same storm that brought heavy rain, mountain snow and gusty winds to the West will emerge in the Plains on Monday. It will be this system, combined with a warm and humid air mass, that will spark the potentially tornadic thunderstorms to start the week, say AccuWeather meteorologists.\n\n\"Thunderstorms are expected to fire quickly on Monday afternoon from west-central Kansas north into Nebraska,\" said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Tyler Roys. \"Here, the biggest threat will initially be from large hail.\"\n\nWith twisting winds expected in the atmosphere, there is also an elevated risk for supercells and tornadoes, which can begin later in the afternoon on Monday. A supercell is a thunderstorm that rotates and often drops twisters.\n\n\"Supercells are expected to fire by the mid- to late-afternoon hours from western Oklahoma into western Kansas before moving east into the night,\" added Roys. \"Not only will these storms likely contain a few tornadoes, but also giant, damaging hailstones.\"\n\nBecause of the tremendous risk for severe weather in the central Plains, AccuWeather meteorologists hoisted a 'high' risk for severe thunderstorms last Friday for Monday. The 'extreme' risk was issued early Monday morning and is situated across south-central Kansas and north-central Oklahoma. It is in this area where the threat of devastating, long-track tornadoes is greatest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDerby and the metropolitan area of Wichita, Kan., as well as Enid, Stillwater, and the metropolitan area of Oklahoma City, Okla., are included in this higher risk area, but Kansas City, Omaha, Neb., and Springfield, Mo., are also among the cities at risk for feisty storms. Everyone should have a way to receive warnings, especially after dark, such as by using the notifications feature on the AccuWeather App.\n\nMonday's extreme risk is the first issued by AccuWeather since April 4, 2023. In addition to April 4, the only other extreme risk in 2023 was a few days earlier on March 31.\n\nThis region has been no stranger to severe weather as of late, with more than 100 confirmed tornadoes, some deadly, and over 1,000 incidents of severe weather reported since April 25. That tally is sure to grow in the coming days.\n\n\"We are probably looking at dozens of tornadoes being produced during the severe weather outbreak from Monday to Tuesday,\" AccuWeather chief on-air meteorologist Bernie Rayno said.\n\nBy Tuesday and Tuesday night, while the severe weather and tornado threat will shift largely out of the central Plains, it will impact millions more from Arkansas to Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and western Pennsylvania, including in the metropolitan areas of Chicago, Indianapolis and St. Louis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Tuesday morning commute is likely to be a slow one as a line of thunderstorms roars through areas from St. Louis to Fort Smith, Arkansas,\" said Roys. \"Chicagoland should also get in on these potentially strong storms later in the morning.\"\n\nThere are some questions about how primed the atmosphere will be for storms later in the day, farther south and east on Tuesday, thus leading to lower risk categories for severe weather. Despite that, thunderstorms are still expected to develop again later in the day after some daytime heating provides fuel for the atmosphere.\n\n\"Areas from southeastern Illinois, Indiana and Ohio south through Kentucky are at greatest risk for storms from Tuesday afternoon into the night,\" noted Roys.\n\nThe risk for severe thunderstorms will not abate after Tuesday. AccuWeather meteorologists say that dozens more states will be threatened by storms during the mid- and late-week periods. New injections of atmospheric energy will be responsible for maintaining this threat through at least Friday, extending all the way to the East Coast.\n\n\"A more potent day of severe weather is anticipated on Wednesday as an area of low pressure develops across the eastern Plains into Missouri,\" said Roys. \"Widespread severe thunderstorm activity, including the risk of flash flooding, damaging winds, hail and tornadoes, can occur from northeastern Texas to the Ohio Valley.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncluded in the risk area on Wednesday will be many of the same areas that were under at least 'some' risk for severe weather on Tuesday. Additionally, AccuWeather meteorologists have increased the risk for severe weather on Wednesday to 'high' across southern Illinois, southern Indiana, western Kentucky, southeastern Missouri and far northwestern Tennessee.\n\nBy Thursday, the storm responsible for the severe weather will begin to move more briskly off to the east, expanding the risk for strong storms and even a few tornadoes into more of the South and mid-Atlantic, including the cities of Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte and Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile the possibility of damaging winds, hail and tornadoes will catch the eye of many, so should the risk for flooding.\n\n\"Heavy rain can again fall from thunderstorms come Thursday between Interstates 20 and 10 in eastern Texas,\" added Roys. \"This area does not need any more rain after the tremendous amount that fell earlier in the month.\"\n\nBy the end of the workweek on Friday, gusty storms are expected to arrive in the Southeast, including as far south as resort areas in central Florida. While the risk for tornadoes appears lower here compared to areas farther north, the storms can still pack hail and damaging wind gusts over 55 mph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time this week comes to an end, it will have been over two weeks since the recent rash of severe weather and violent tornadoes kicked off in the Plains. With little in the way of breaks in between weather systems over that timeframe, those cleaning up from the storms will be happy to know a much-needed break in storminess is in the forecast, say AccuWeather meteorologists.\n\nDrier air expanding across the Plains beginning on Friday, but especially during the upcoming weekend dates of May 11 and 12, will lead to a much quieter weather pattern across the region. This is especially great news because Mother's Day falls on May 12.\n\nEven after those dates, early in the following week, conditions should remain quieter than earlier in May because the amount of energy in the atmosphere appears displaced from the region and weaker than is required for severe weather outbreaks.\n\nRead More Floods cause state of emergency in southern Brazil Bad weather prompts

Destructive tornadoes, damaging straight-line winds and large hail are probable over parts of Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska on Monday before the severe weather threat shifts east as the week wears on.\n\nThe National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center has already highlighted the region as having a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather Monday from southern Oklahoma to southern Nebraska. Oklahoma City; Tulsa; Wichita; Topeka, Kan.; and Lincoln, Neb., are included in this zone. A Level 2 risk covers Kansas City and Omaha.\n\n\"Strong tornadoes, very large to giant hail, and damaging winds all appear possible,\" the Storm Prediction Center wrote.\n\nBy Tuesday, at least some risk for severe storms will expand east from Des Moines to Chicago and south to Little Rock. An elevated risk area has been drawn for Wednesday too, and includes Waco, Tex.; Dallas; Little Rock; Nashville; Columbus; Indianapolis; Cincinnati; Louisville and St. Louis. It affects nearly 40 million people.\n\nAs it stands, 225 preliminary reports of tornadoes have been received over the past week and a half. A whopping 300 twisters were logged across the continental United States in April, the second most on record. Even Alaska had a brief tornado on April 19.\n\nThe weather pattern shows no signs of slowing any time soon. May is the historical peak of tornado season, and this one promises to get off to an extra-busy start.\n\nIt's too early to say whether Monday will produce a tornado outbreak per se, but the Storm Prediction Center is already describing the possibility of a \"severe-weather outbreak\" in its online discussions. That's a telltale sign that the potential exists for a serious severe weather event.\n\nThere are a number of ingredients that could come together to incite many dangerous storms:\n\n- A strong high-altitude disturbance. Basically a pocket of cold air, low pressure and spin aloft, this upper-air disturbance will be the impetus for storms. It will slip over the Rockies on Monday morning before approaching the central and northern Plains on Monday evening. Storms will break out as its influence arrives. This same disturbance is energizing a significant storm in California this weekend.\n\n- A well-defined dry line and very warm, humid air ahead of it. Storms like to form on boundaries where air masses clash. Beneath our high-altitude disturbance will be a pronounced dry line, or the border between warm, moisture-rich Gulf of Mexico air to the east and bone-dry air from the Desert Southwest. That sultry air mass (which could set records in the South) will be replete with instability, or storm fuel. As the disturbance moves overhead, storms will erupt on the dry line, which will be positioned somewhere near or just west of Interstate 35, a north-south highway, in central Oklahoma and Kansas, and reach up into eastern Nebraska.\n\n- Wind shear. Wind shear, or a change of wind speed/direction with height, will be present. Southerly or south-southeasterly winds at the surface will contrast against strong southwesterly jet stream winds aloft. Storms that grow tall enough to blossom through multiple layers of atmosphere will feel those changing winds and rotate. That will increase the risk of strong tornadoes.\n\nThe areas of greatest risk, and the specific timing of storms, remain uncertain. That said, this is one of the more pronounced signals for a classic large-scale Great Plains severe weather outbreak in recent years. (Many of the tornado events in recent days have been more localized. This episode will probably be more geographically expansive.)\n\nAs the cold front (and dry line) associated with this system pushes east into the midweek, more storms are likely. On Tuesday, parts of the Corn Belt, Midwest and even Ozarks are at play. By Wednesday, an enormous zone from northeast Texas, including Dallas, all the way to the northern Ohio Valley could be affected.\n\nIt's far too early to offer any specific forecasts, but the same overarching upper-air disturbance will be moving east into a very warm and humid air mass. That's a recipe ripe for storms.\n\nHow widespread and violent thunderstorms will be - and the hazards they'll produce - is impossible to predict more than two to three days out. While ingredients will be present for severe weather, how they'll combine is unclear at this point.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [],

A Level 2 of 5 threat exists for Louisville and Nashville in Kentucky, Memphis and Little Rock in Arkansas, along with Cincinnati and Indianapolis. The main threat will be damaging winds but the potential for tornadoes and hail exists.\n\nFor portions of Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois, strong thunderstorms may already be ongoing Tuesday morning. The timing focus of the severe storms for all other areas will begin during the afternoon and continue through the evening hours.\n\nWednesday's severe potential is over a very similar area, including from northeastern Texas through western Ohio. Daytime heating and humid conditions will help fuel the severe threat during the afternoon and allow storms to continue through evening and overnight.

Both Tuesday and Wednesday are 9 First Warning Weather Alert Days due to the threat of severe weather including tornadoes.\n\nThere will be multiple rounds and times to watch for with these severe weather events. So let's break down the elements.\n\nTUESDAY\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has all of the Tri-State within a Slight Risk (level 2 out of 5) for severe weather on Tuesday, and they just upgraded areas to the north to an Enhanced Risk.\n\nThis risk includes all severe weather elements, however tornadoes and large hail look to be the primary concerns on Tuesday. The areas inside the Enhanced Risk are within the region with a higher probability of strong tornadoes. In addition to that, the entire Tri-State, including Cincinnati, will be in an increase risk for very large hail. The risk includes a great probability that we could see hail of 2 inches in diameter or larger. For perspective, an average hen egg is around 2 inches. Damaging wind gusts of 60 mph will be possible as well, but that looks to be the lesser of the three weather impacts on Tuesday.\n\nTIMING:\n\nTuesday's event will bring a few rounds of severe weather and the first one will have a major role on whether we see an increased threat later in the day. The first round of storms is likely to push in for the midday with impact between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. This wave won't pack the punch that the later evening provides, but it will bring a threat for damaging winds, hail, and a few spin-up tornadoes. This comes in the form of a squall line, which will move west to east. The issue here, is whether it zaps the energy for later into the evening. This line will also add some humidity and moisture to the atmosphere, which could play a role later on in the evening.\n\nThe evening event is the one that brings the most concern on Tuesday. This is when the threat for larger hail and stronger tornadoes will be present. As storms form, they will become supercells, which pose the greater risk for dangerous weather. This window for storms opens up as early as 6 p.m. and will increase until around 9 p.m. However, the threat won't end until closer to midnight into Wednesday morning.\n\nThis round of storms could also bring some heavy rainfall which may lead to localized flooding. Street flooding and flask flooding will be possible as stronger storms develop. Rainfall totals within some of the stronger storms could be between 1 to 2 inches.\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\nWednesday will be the day with the biggest severe threat of two here in the Tri-State. However, most of this will occur after sundown Wednesday evening into the overnight early Thursday morning.\n\nThe SPC already has placed the entire Tri-State in an \"Enhanced Risk\" for severe weather Wednesday, which is threat level 3 out of 5. This threat includes all forms of severe weather, including tornadoes, very large hail, and damaging winds. Their wording even says that \"some of the tornadoes may be strong.\"\n\nTIMING:\n\nWednesday's storms will be late in the afternoon and overnight into Thursday. The timing for this event is what makes this alarming. Most of the severe weather threat will occur after nightfall while many people are asleep. This is why it is important to always have multiple ways to get your severe weather warnings. Make sure that you charge all of your devices over the next two days. The latest computer model trends have storms as early as 3 p.m., but the bulk of the storms moving into the Tri-State after 7 p.m. Wednesday evening and pushing through midnight into the early morning hours of Thursday.\n\nThere will be some tweaks and changes to this forecast as we get closer to the event itself, so make sure to bookmark this page to keep checking for the latest updates as we get closer.", "source": {"uri": "wcpo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCPO"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_spinner@wcpo.com", "name": "Brandon Spinner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Prediction_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Storm Prediction Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Severe weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Warning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Warning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squall_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squall line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer simulation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bc24e18/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3528x1852+0+26/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F85%2F28%2F04b08cb0457c89749c4863feb823%2Fscreen-shot-2022-05-01-at-11.06.01%20AM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538106", "eventUri": "eng-9538106", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Cities include Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, Holland, Flint, Jackson, and Battle Creek.\n\nCommunities closer to the Michigan-Ohio border are listed in the \"slight\" risk category, the second highest on a scale of five categories.\n\nThe rest of the state is still expected to see stormy weather, but not reaching severe status. This could change with updates models on Tuesday.\n\nThe areas in \"marginal\" territory are also listed with a 2% chance for an isolated tornado. Areas closer to the Michigan-Ohio border have an increased risk.\n\nLarge hail and damaging winds are also possible with any severe storms.\n\n---> Track weather updates and radar here\n\nHere's what to expect in Southeast Michigan\n\n4Warn Weather's Ashlee Baracy reports: We will begin with sunshine on Tuesday. Then, clouds will build in during the afternoon ahead of showers and possible thunderstorms in the evening.\n\nGenerally, cities southwest of a line from Flint to Detroit will be at a marginal risk (level 1 of 5) for severe thunderstorms Tuesday. A warm front will lift through the region, creating instability that may lead to severe storms.\n\nShowers may reach us around 6 p.m., though more widespread rain and potential storms are expected at 7 p.m.\n\nThe severe storms could bring damaging wind, large hail, flooding, and an isolated weak tornado. We're not guaranteed to see each or all of these threats, but the ingredients will be there for a low-end chance for seeing any of those threats.\n\n---> More: Severe storms possible this week in Metro Detroit: What to know\n\nExplaining severe weather risk levels\n\nMarginal, Slight, Enhanced, Moderate, and High risks represent progressively larger threats for organized severe storm episodes. Here's a breakdown:\n\nThunderstorms (light green) - General or non-severe thunderstorms - Delineates, to the right of a line, where a 10% or greater probability of thunderstorms is forecast during the valid period.\n\n1-Marginal (dark green) - Marginal risk - An area of severe storms of either limited organization and longevity, or very low coverage and marginal intensity.\n\n2-Slight (yellow) - Slight risk - An area of organized severe storms, which is not widespread in coverage with varying levels of intensity.\n\n3-Enhanced (orange) - Enhanced risk - An area of greater (relative to Slight risk) severe storm coverage with varying levels of intensity.\n\n4-Moderate (red) - Moderate risk - An area where widespread severe weather with several tornadoes and/or numerous severe thunderstorms is likely, some of which should be intense. This risk is usually reserved for days with several supercells producing intense tornadoes and/or very large hail, or an intense squall line with widespread damaging winds.\n\n5-High (magenta) - High risk - An area where a severe weather outbreak is expected from either numerous intense and long-tracked tornadoes or a long-lived derecho-producing thunderstorm complex that produces hurricane-force wind gusts and widespread damage. This risk is reserved for when high confidence exists in widespread coverage of severe weather with embedded instances of extreme severe (i.e., violent tornadoes or very damaging convective wind

That was the last EF-4 tornado in the U.S. until the late-April tornado outbreak that produced a deadly EF-4 tornado in Marietta, Oklahoma.\n\nThis is now the first High Risk in Oklahoma since May 20, 2019, and the first High Risk in Kansas since May 18, 2017.\n\nThe SPC said numerous severe thunderstorms are expected to develop and move eastward from Monday afternoon through Monday night across parts of the southern and central Plains. Multiple intense, long-track tornadoes - especially in southern Kansas and Oklahoma - very large to giant hail between 2 and 4 inches and damaging wind gusts as high as 80 mph are all expected.\n\n\"We could see some large storms developing,\" FOX Weather Meteorologist Craig Herrera said. \"We've got lots of moist air in place, daytime heating and plenty of instability. And, of course, the wind shear could be favorable for some of these major storms to develop.\"\n\nThe SPC has also highlighted those same areas as being at risk of tornadoes Monday, with some of those expected to become strong (EF-2 or higher).\n\nThere is also the risk of potentially long-track tornadoes, too.\n\nThere is no hard definition of a long-track tornado, but many forecasters believe it's a tornado that's on the ground for 15-20 miles or more.\n\n\"So, Oklahoma City up to Wichita, these communities, even across the state, need to be on high alert, knowing where that safe place is, where the shelter is and getting there quickly,\" FOX Weather Meteorologist Jane Minar said. \"Having those conversations with your family this afternoon is very important.\"\n\nThe SPC said \"very large to giant hail\" is also likely on Monday. According to the National Weather Service, giant hail is larger than 2.75 inches in diameter, which is baseball-sized or larger.\n\nDamaging wind gusts of 60 mph or higher are also likely across the region, but areas under the greatest risk of severe weather on Monday could see winds gust into the range of a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nPeople living in areas where severe weather is likely Monday and into the middle of the week should prepare now to stay safe, including downloading the free FOX Weather app.\n\nThe multiday severe weather threat will shift east on Tuesday and Wednesday, putting tens of millions of people at risk of seeing strong to severe thunderstorms.\n\nThe SPC placed more than 20 million people from the mid-South to the Ohio Valley in a Level 2 out of 5 risk on Tuesday, including major cities such as Indianapolis in Indiana, as well as Nashville in Tennessee.\n\nAccording to the SPC, a line of thunderstorms is expected Tuesday morning over portions of the Midwest and mid-Mississippi Valley in association with the storms expected to slam the Plains on Monday.\n\nThat line of storms early Tuesday is expected to weaken some during the morning hours but could still bring high wind gusts to those areas.\n\nAs the day continues, scattered strong to severe thunderstorms will push off into the Ohio Valley during the afternoon hours.\n\nThe main threats from those storms will be hail and damaging wind gusts, according to the SPC.\n\nThe severe weather threat will ramp up again on Wednesday, with the SPC placing more than 21 million people from Texas to Ohio in a Level 3 out of 5 risk of severe weather.\n\nThis includes the cities of Indianapolis, Memphis in Tennessee, St. Louis in Missouri and Cincinnati in Ohio.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com",

Today is the most widespread, significant risk for strong tornadoes in the Southern Plains in the last 5 years.\"\n\nThunderstorms are most likely to begin in Wichita and the surrounding areas between 4 p.m. and 11 p.m., according to the National Weather Service. Portions of the state west of Salina, Hutchinson and Harper could see storms as early as 2 p.m., and they're expected in a swath east of Topeka, Emporia and Coffeyville between 8 p.m. and 2 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nAs part of its Monday 8:49 a.m. update, the weather service announced that all of Harper, Sumner and Cowley counties and parts of Kingman, Sedgwick, Butler, Barber, Elk and Chautauqua counties now have the highest ranking for severe storm risk.\n\nForecasters are warning of 70-80 mph winds, baseball to softball sized hail and the \"greatest potential for a few strong & long track tornadoes\" in those areas and also stretching down into Oklahoma.\n\nThe southern portions of Sedgwick and Butler counties, including Wichita, are among the areas that could see the worst storms.\n\n\"An outbreak of severe thunderstorms continues to favor southern Kansas this afternoon and evening,\" the NWS said Monday morning.\n\nAccuWeather is predicting the greatest threat along the Interstate 35 corridor from Wichita to Oklahoma City, including a \"growing concern\" for dangerous night-time tornadoes.\n\n\"This extreme risk for severe storms lasts well into the night as it evolves into a line of thunderstorms with embedded tornadoes. The line of storms will blast east across Kansas and Oklahoma toward Kansas City and Springfield, Missouri tonight,\" Porter said.\n\n\"Nocturnal tornadoes are extremely dangerous. Tornadoes can be nearly impossible to see in the dark, especially if they're wrapped in rain. Navigating through tornado damage in the dark is also extremely dangerous for storm survivors and first responders. Everyone in this area needs to keep their cell phone charged, notifications turned on, and volume turned up, so they do not sleep through a tornado warning.\"\n\nCounties in south-central Kansas surrounding the high-risk area, including Reno and Harvey counties, could also see 70-80 mph winds, golfball to baseball sized hail and the possibility of \"a few strong tornadoes,\" the NWS said.\n\nAreas of western, northern and eastern Kansas, including Hays, Salina and Topeka, could see winds up to 70 mph and up to two-inch hail. Tornadoes are also possible, the weather service says.\n\nThe last time AccuWeather issues an \"extreme risk\" for storms was more than a year ago, on April 4, 2023, when nearly two dozens tornadoes torn through Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin, Iowa and Arkansas.\n\nOriginal story: A large swath of Kansas is expected to see dangerous thunderstorms Monday and Wichita is forecast to fall into an area where the most severe weather could occur.\n\nThat area -- which includes Wichita near the top northeast corner, most of Pratt County in the northwest and south into Oklahoma -- has a higher chance than other parts of the state for seeing \"a few strong long track tornadoes,\" winds up to 80 mph and up to softball-size hail, the National Weather Service in Wichita said just after 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nWichita is most likely to see thunderstorms from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. Monday.\n\n\"The greatest potential for higher-end severe weather could shift further south into Oklahoma,\" the NWS in Wichita said. \"There is also potential for higher-end severe weather to expand further east across the southern Flint Hills of SE KS.\"\n\nMuch of central and eastern Kansas are the area that could also see tornadoes, up to two-inch diameter hails and winds up to 70 mph.", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Destructive tornadoes, damaging straight-line winds and large hail are probable over parts of Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska on Monday before the severe weather threat shifts east as the week wears on.\n\nThe National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center has already highlighted the region as having a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather Monday from southern Oklahoma to southern Nebraska. Oklahoma City; Tulsa; Wichita; Topeka, Kansas; and Lincoln, Nebraska, are included in this zone. A Level 2 risk covers Kansas City and Omaha.\n\n\"Strong tornadoes, very large to giant hail, and damaging winds all appear possible,\" the Storm Prediction Center wrote.\n\nBy Tuesday, at least some risk for severe storms will expand east from Des Moines to Chicago and south to Little Rock. An elevated risk area has been drawn for Wednesday too, and includes Waco, Texas; Dallas; Little Rock; Nashville; Columbus; Indianapolis; Cincinnati; Louisville and St. Louis. It affects nearly 40 million people.\n\nAs it stands, 225 preliminary reports of tornadoes have been received over the past week and a half. A whopping 300 twisters were logged across the continental United States in April, the second most on record. Even Alaska had a brief tornado on April 19.\n\nThe weather pattern shows no signs of slowing any time soon. May is the historical peak of tornado season, and this one promises to get off to an extra-busy start.\n\nAnticipated outbreak\n\nIt's too early to say whether Monday will produce a tornado outbreak per se, but the Storm Prediction Center is already describing the possibility of a \"severe-weather outbreak\" in its online discussions. That's a telltale sign that the potential exists for a serious severe weather event.\n\nThere are a number of ingredients that could come together to incite many dangerous storms:\n\n- A strong high-altitude disturbance. Basically a pocket of cold air, low pressure and spin aloft, this upper-air disturbance will be the impetus for storms. It will slip over the Rockies on Monday morning before approaching the central and northern Plains on Monday evening. Storms will break out as its influence arrives. This same disturbance is energizing a significant storm in California this weekend.\n\n- A well-defined dry line and very warm, humid air ahead of it. Storms like to form on boundaries where air masses clash. Beneath our high-altitude disturbance will be a pronounced dry line, or the border between warm, moisture-rich Gulf of Mexico air to the east and bone-dry air from the Desert Southwest. That sultry air mass (which could set records in the South) will be replete with instability, or storm fuel. As the disturbance moves overhead, storms will erupt on the dry line, which will be positioned somewhere near or just west of Interstate 35, a north-south highway, in central Oklahoma and Kansas, and reach up into eastern Nebraska.\n\n- Wind shear. Wind shear, or a change of wind speed/direction with height, will be present. Southerly or south-southeasterly winds at the surface will contrast against strong southwesterly jet stream winds aloft. Storms that grow tall enough to blossom through multiple layers of atmosphere will feel those changing winds and rotate. That will increase the risk of strong tornadoes.\n\nThe areas of greatest risk, and the specific timing of storms, remain uncertain. That said, this is one of the more pronounced signals for a classic large-scale Great Plains severe weather outbreak in recent years. (Many of the tornado events in recent days have been more localized. This episode will probably be more geographically expansive.)\n\nMore storms coming\n\nAs the cold front (and dry line) associated with this system pushes east into the midweek, more storms are likely. On Tuesday, parts of the Corn Belt, Midwest and even Ozarks are at play. By Wednesday, an enormous zone from northeast Texas, including Dallas, all the way to the northern Ohio Valley could be affected.\n\nIt's far too early to offer any specific forecasts, but the same overarching upper-air disturbance will be moving east into a very warm and humid air mass. That's a recipe ripe for storms.\n\nHow widespread and violent thunderstorms will be - and the hazards they'll produce - is impossible to predict more than two to three days out. While ingredients will be present for severe weather, how they'll combine is unclear at this point.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"},

Such warnings are reserved only for the most serious severe weather days.\n\nThe forecast comes a week after a tornado outbreak killed four people in Oklahoma.\n\nWhat is a 'high risk'?\n\nA high risk is the highest-tier hazardous weather forecast that the Storm Prediction Center issues.\n\nThis forecast is the first \"high risk\" since two were issued on March 31, 2023, said Matthew Elliott, warning coordination meteorologist for the center.\n\n\"We typically average only one or two a year,\" Elliott said.\n\nA 'significant' outbreak\n\n\"We're really expecting this to be a significant outbreak of severe weather,\" Elliott said, \"with some long track, intense tornadoes certainly possible.\"\n\nHigh winds over portions of Colorado and the High Plains Monday morning are also related to the strong and strengthening low-pressure system expected to spawn tornadoes and hail later in the day.\n\n\"It's very similar to what's helping create the moisture across the Southern Plains that will lead to the severe weather this afternoon and evening,\" Elliott said. \"That's why we see this potential for large hail, tornadoes and damaging winds.\"\n\nPreparations underway\n\nAhead of the storms, McConnell Air Force Base, near Wichita, Kansas, is relocating aircraft to remove them from harm's way, CNN reported.\n\nAlso, schools across the danger zone were altering their schedules before the storms hit. Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts began canceling all after-school and evening activities, the Associated Press reported.\n\nContributing: Josh Dulaney, the

These supercells could also produce 'giant' hail as large as 10 cm in diameter, or about the size of a softball.\n\nHeading into the evening hours, forecasters expect thunderstorms to quickly merge into one or more powerful squall lines that track east through the overnight hours late Monday into early Tuesday.\n\nThe biggest threat in these squall lines would be widespread damaging wind gusts of 120+ km/h, as well as a continued risk for embedded tornadoes.\n\nA renewed threat for severe weather will push east into the Midwest and Ohio Valley on Tuesday. Damaging wind gusts would be the greatest threat with these storms.\n\nTravellers passing through Dallas, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, Omaha, or St. Louis will likely encounter flight delays and cancellations as a result of this severe weather.\n\nDrivers are urged to use extreme caution and closely monitor local watches and warnings.

There is also a watch for Chautauqua County in Kansas until 11:00 p.m.\n\nWhat is the weather outlook for this week in Oklahoma?\n\nSevere weather threats are expected for part of Northeastern OK with this storm system by later Monday afternoon, continuing into the evening, and possibly for a few overnight hours before shifting away from the region. All modes of severe weather will be possible.\n\nAnother moderately strong disturbance arrives Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning with additional severe weather threats along and southeast of I-44 starting Wednesday morning and continuing through the afternoon.\n\nAfter the front moves across the area Wednesday morning to afternoon, we're expecting a break for a few days with cooler and drier air arriving across the state.\n\nA surface ridge of high pressure will settle near the northern OK vicinity Thursday into Friday bringing sunshine, light winds, and below normal, yet pleasant weather.\n\nA disturbance may be near the state for part of the weekend that could bring a few showers yet with cooler weather remaining. We'll have more on this scenario Tuesday.\n\nWhat are the chances for severe weather in Oklahoma on Monday, May 6?\n\nA powerful upper-level system will be near the region Monday. Strong southeast surface winds from 15 to 30 mph will continue bringing ample low-level moisture into the state with afternoon highs reaching the upper 70s to lower 80s across the eastern third of the state.\n\nA dry line will be positioned across far western OK with increasing instability along and east of this feature by this afternoon and evening.\n\nA weak mid-level cap is expected to suppress any surface-based thunderstorm activity this morning to midday, but a few areas of scattered storms will be possible this afternoon across eastern OK, including a low-threat of severe storms.\n\nBy 3pm to 5pm, discrete supercell storms will attempt to develop along and east of the dry line across west central to northwestern OK. As strong upper-level winds arrive over the region, deep layer and speed shear will increase allowing storms to rapidly become severe. These discrete storms will have the greater potential for producing very large hail and possibly a strong, long track tornado.\n\nLater in the evening, storms will be more likely to congeal into at least one or possibly a few line segments and move eastward transitioning to a damaging wind threat with some embedded tornadic activity.\n\nDue to recent heavy rainfall, flooding is possible in a few locations. Streams and creeks will also rise again over the next few days.\n\nWe're encouraging you to remain aware of your weather surroundings tonight as this system nears your area.

Expert weighs in", "body": "In the past week, weather authorities across the U.S. reported more than 100 tornadoes across the central and southern parts of the country, destroying dozens of homes and buildings from Oklahoma to Nebraska and Iowa.\n\nIn Oklahoma, where a tornado touched down in the middle of the night, severe thunderstorms and high winds resulted in the deaths of at least four people and injured more than 300 others.\n\nAs Colorado and many parts of the U.S. enter the severe weather season, CU Boulder Today spoke with Andrew Winters, assistant professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, about how tornadoes develop, how climate change may exacerbate severe weather, and how to better prepare for these events.\n\nTornadoes are rapidly spinning columns of air associated with severe thunderstorms. Typically, these tornadoes develop in areas of strong \"wind shear,\" which is where the wind's direction and speed change rapidly moving upward in the atmosphere. Those areas of wind shear get ingested into thunderstorms, where they can facilitate rotation within a thunderstorm and eventually spawn columns of air to the ground, forming what we call tornadoes.\n\nThe U.S. is one of the most favorable environments in the world for the formation of tornadoes. They're also common in South America and regions in Europe, but the unique geography of the U.S. creates an environment that's particularly conducive to tornadoes.\n\nThe central and the southeastern states are the regions with the greatest risk of tornadoes. One reason is that these regions have a lot of rising air. The central and southeastern U.S. is where warm, moist air masses originating from the Gulf of Mexico meet dry air that originates over the Rocky Mountains. Clashes between the two create some degree of instability in the environment, producing rapid upward air motion.\n\nTypically, the tornado season begins around March in the southeastern United States, and the area most likely to experience severe weather will migrate westward towards the central and southern plains. Once we get to summer months, especially June, we will begin to see various severe weather events from tornadoes to strong, damaging winds to large hail at higher latitudes in the plains like Colorado.\n\nIt is somewhat surprising that we are seeing so many tornadoes. We are currently exiting a strong El Ni\u00f1o winter, a natural climate phenomenon typically associated with a lower likelihood of severe weather and tornado activity in the Central Plains.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, the atmosphere can produce a strong subtropical air current. Any waves or fluctuation along the subtropical jet stream that makes the jet wavy can create an environment that facilitates the production of severe weather and tornadoes in the spring. This is what caused the tornadoes across the country over the last couple of weeks.\n\nIt's a little bit too early to say for sure, but if the subtropical jet stream stays relatively active, there could be a prolonged active period of tornadoes.\n\nHere in Colorado, we typically see the largest number of severe weather events in the months of May and June. We have a greater likelihood of tornadoes, extreme hail and strong, damaging wind gusts during that period. So that's something to keep an eye on in the next few weeks.\n\nThere are a lot of uncertainties about how climate change will impact storm-scale severe weather events such as tornadoes. Part of the reason is that most of our climate models don't have fine enough resolution to simulate a tornado.\n\nWhat we can do is look at, on a large scale, how those different atmospheric ingredients that must come together to develop severe weather might change in the future climate. Some research has shown that we should expect a shift in tornado activity further east from the traditional tornado alley in the central U.S. So we might see a greater likelihood of tornado activity in the Mississippi River Valley region and the southeastern U.S.\n\nWe need to raise awareness for individuals, especially those who live in places that aren't traditionally susceptible to tornadoes but may become more susceptible with changes to the atmospheric circulation.\n\nThe first thing in terms of preparation is to have multiple ways to receive severe weather warnings. That means not just relying on hearing a tornado siren as your only option, but making sure you have emergency notifications activated on your phone and you follow local meteorologists or National Weather Service accounts on social media.\n\nThink ahead of time about where you're going if a tornado happens. Sometimes with these severe weather situations, you only have a few minutes of warning time to act before that threat is on top of you. You want to go to a room in the most interior part of your house, away from windows or below ground if that's an option. If you're in a more vulnerable structure, know if there are other community shelters available.\n\nThere's a lot of emphasis right now in the weather and atmospheric science community on improving the way we communicate the potential for severe weather. People are getting their information in many different ways nowadays.\n\nTraditionally, most people would tune in to local news if they see a storm coming. Now they are getting information through their phone's alert system and social media.\n\nWe also need to make sure those communication methods are accessible to diverse audiences.

Strong, long-tracked tornadoes, massive hail, and a couple lines of significant wind damage are going to be possible.\n\nThe system causing the risk is moving out of the Rockies and into the Plains Monday morning. Over the weekend, it dumped massive amounts of snow in the California Sierra mountains -- up to over two feet in some spots -- and caused flooding in northern California as well. Some roads had to be shut down to the conditions. The low-pressure center is moving into western South Dakota this morning and the winds in the Plains are increasing quickly. Wind gusts from Colorado up through western North Dakota have already reached into the 35 mph to 50 mph range as of 8 a.m. CDT and will be increasing throughout the morning and expanding to more of the High Plains throughout the day. The storm is pushing a cold front down out of the Rockies and into the Plains where it will interact with warm and moist air that has been sourced from the Gulf of Mexico. Dew point temperatures in the 50s and 60s will aid thunderstorm development, which has already started in the Northern Plains, but will quickly develop by midday across western Kansas and Nebraska. Models have this developing as early as 10 a.m. CDT. As the day wears on, thunderstorms will explode along the cold front from South Dakota to Texas. The southern end of this will have the greatest risk of the most significant severe weather. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has thrown out its first High Risk of severe weather notification across south-central Kansas and north-central Oklahoma for Monday afternoon and evening. The SPC does not throw out High Risks very often, usually a handful of times each year. So, this is a significant severe weather outbreak event being forecast.\n\nThe initial threats will be numerous including long-tracked tornadoes, which may be strong (EF-3 or greater), and massive hail over two inches in diameter. As the evening wears on and storms progress to eastern Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, the risk shifts to more of a line of damaging winds. Labeled by meteorologists as an MCS (mesoscale convective system), this line of thunderstorms will have potential for producing some wind gusts over 75 mph. With the major threat weakening overnight as the storms progress through Iowa and Missouri, a risk of a derecho is very low. Still, widespread wind, hail, and tornado damage are forecast over the Central and Southern Plains today. Those in the immediate areas should stay weather aware, especially in Iowa and Missouri after the sun sets and folks head off to bed. Overnight severe storms can catch people off-guard and unprepared.\n\nTo find more weather conditions and your local forecast from DTN, head over to https://www.dtnpf.com/...", "source": {"uri":

The best chance for severe weather is off to our west in the central plains, however severe weather is definitely possible for Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the potential hazards. The main hazards are damaging winds and tornadoes. Significant damaging winds (70-80 mph) are possible Monday night. A few spin-up tornadoes are possible as well.\n\nBelow is a Future Track showing an idea of what Monday into Tuesday might look like. Keep in mind that the computer models usually don't do a good job with this set-up. We are gonna be in southwest flow aloft with energy coming in from the Baja California region. The energy will most likely be underdone. We could potential see a few isolated severe storms earlier in the day Monday ahead of the main energy.\n\nBeyond this severe weather event, we have to watch Wednesday for more potential severe storms.

With the severe storms that blew through North Texas over the weekend, many areas are still waterlogged with much of the region in a flood watch Sunday.\n\nA cold front will blow through the region by Tuesday morning, pushing much of the bad weather to the east, Prater said.

However, portions of Kansas and Oklahoma face a significantly higher threat.\n\nWATCH VS. WARNING: HERE ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE WEATHER TERMS THAT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE\n\nNOAA's Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has placed more than 2 million people across south-central Kansas and western and central Oklahoma in a Level 4 out of 5 risk on its 5-point severe thunderstorm risk scale.\n\nThe SPC has also highlighted those same areas as being at risk of tornadoes on Monday, with some of those expected to become strong (EF-2 or higher).\n\nThere is no hard definition of a long-track tornado, but many forecasters believe it's a tornado that's on the ground for 15-20 miles or more.\n\n\"So, Oklahoma City up to Wichita, these communities, even across the state, need to be on high alert, knowing where that safe place is, where the shelter is and getting there quickly. Having those conversations with your family this afternoon is very important.\"\n\nThe SPC said \"very large to giant hail\" is also likely on Monday. According to the National Weather Service, giant hail is larger than 2.75 inches in diameter, which is baseball-sized or larger.\n\nDamaging wind gusts of 60 mph or higher are also likely across the region, but areas under the greatest risk of severe weather on Monday could see winds gust higher than a Category 1 hurricane.", "source": {"uri": "foxweather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Weather"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_yablonski@foxweather.com", "name": "Steven Yablonski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Severe weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trough (meteorology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Prediction_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storm Prediction Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dry line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Plains_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Plains (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind shear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Fujita_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enhanced Fujita scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Oklahoma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Oklahoma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.foxweather.com/static.foxweather.com/www.foxweather.com/content/uploads/2022/05/1024/512/stovepipe-example.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538106", "eventUri": "eng-9538106", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

threatening dangerous weather including tornadoes", "body": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Storm Prediction Center has warned that parts of the central and southern Plains into the Midwest will possibly experience severe storms on Monday that could produce large hail, damaging winds and threats of tornadoes.\n\nWestern and central Oklahoma into central and eastern Kansas, including Oklahoma City and Wichita are of particular concern.\n\nStrong and long-track tornadoes are possible and could stretch out into the night, also with the potential for severe and damaging wind gusts up to 80mph and giant hail, up to four inches in diameter.\n\nThe thunderstorms are expected to grow by late Monday afternoon into a group of supercells.\n\nBy Monday night, this strong weather may become a line of thunderstorms that will sweep eastward into the Midwest.\n\nAt least 70 million people are at a \"slight risk\" or greater threat level for severe weather during the Monday to Wednesday period, Axios has reported the storm prediction centre forecasting.\n\nDangerous weather has already seriously affected neighbouring states after a third of Texas' counties have announced disaster declarations after heavy rainfall inundated communities with floodwaters.\n\nThe body of a five-year-old boy was recovered from floodwaters near Fort Worth at 7.20am on Sunday while authorities were attempting to save people in a vehicle that was stuck in rapidly moving water.\n\nThree occupants escaped from the vehicle that got stuck around 2am, but a 911 caller said they had been swept into the floodwaters while they were trying to reach safety.\n\nWhile a man and a woman were rescued, the five-year-old boy was found deceased, the Johnson County emergency management coordinator said.\n\nFort Worth has experienced severe thunderstorms over the past few days, and the National Weather Service predicted that more isolated severe storms could be possible on Monday afternoon, with very large hail and damaging winds being the central threats.\n\nFurther south in the state, at least 400 people have been rescued from homes, vehicles and even rooftops in neighbourhoods around Houston, the Associated Press reported on Sunday, after days of rain left whole communities flooded with murky water and buildings ruined.\n\nNo deaths or serious injuries had been reported in that area, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the county government's top executive, told CNN on Saturday night and added that 153 pets have also been rescued during the efforts.\n\nMoving into Monday, conditions seem to be improving in areas, after the National Weather Service in Houston expired its flood watch after being in effect for 93 hours.\n\nHowever, the service has warned that moderate to major river flooding will remain a concern for at least the next several days to over a week and is asking residents not to drive around any remaining barricades or enter into any flood waters.\n\nJudge Hidalgo declared a disaster on Thursday in the county after heavy rainpour caused serious flooding in the area.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered in areas that were slammed with the worst conditions.\n\n\"What we're going to see tonight and into the weekend will not be Hurricane Harvey, but we are going to see significant impacts,\" Hidalgo said in a statement on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amelia_neath@independent.co.uk", "name": "Amelia Neath", "type":

The last time the SPC issued a high risk was on March 25, 2021 for the southeast part of the country. Oklahoma last saw a high risk on May 20, 2019. The last time Springfield saw a high risk was 18 years ago on March 13, 2006.\n\nFor Monday's risk, the area to watch is from Oklahoma City to Wichita, Kansas, the high risk threat shows a 30% chance of a tornado developing in a 25-mile radius.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Norman posted to its Facebook page, \"Many (most?) people will NOT see any storms at all! We are only expecting a small number of storms. The thing to remember is if you see a storm near you, assume it's a dangerous storm.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service-Norman goes on to warn people this setup is not normal, \"We have not experienced a day like this in quite some time. We expect storms to become supercells quickly after they form, and they should remain supercells through the event.\"\n\nAs the storms push east, they will lose intensity. While the tornado threat does exist, in Missouri and Arkansas, we could see a few short-lived tornadoes spin up. The greatest threat for strong storms will be west of Highway 65, where strong winds up to 85 miles an hour will be possible.\n\nWe can expect storms to roll into the western part of our viewing area around midnight.

Over the weekend, it dumped massive amounts of snow in the California Sierra mountains -- up to over two feet in some spots -- and caused flooding in northern California as well. Some roads had to be shut down due to the conditions. The low-pressure center is moving into western South Dakota this morning and the winds in the Plains are increasing quickly.\n\nWind gusts from Colorado up through western North Dakota have already reached the 35-50 mph range as of 8 a.m. CDT and will be increasing throughout the morning and expanding to more of the High Plains throughout the day. The storm is pushing a cold front down out of the Rockies and into the Plains where it will interact with warm and moist air that has been sourced from the Gulf of Mexico. Dew point temperatures in the 50s and 60s will aid thunderstorm development, which has already started in the Northern Plains but will quickly develop by midday across western Kansas and Nebraska. Models have this developing as early as 10 a.m. CDT.\n\nAs the day wears on, thunderstorms will explode along the cold front from South Dakota to Texas. The southern end of this will have the greatest risk of the most significant severe weather. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has thrown out its first High Risk of severe weather notification across south-central Kansas and north-central Oklahoma for Monday afternoon and evening. The SPC does not throw out High Risks very often, usually a handful of times each year. So, this is a significant severe weather outbreak event being forecast.\n\nThe initial threats will be numerous including long-tracked tornadoes, which may be strong (EF-3 or greater) and massive hail over 2 inches in diameter. As the evening wears on and storms progress to eastern Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma, the risk shifts to more of a line of damaging winds. Labeled by meteorologists as an MCS (mesoscale convective system), this line of thunderstorms will have the potential to produce some wind gusts over 75 mph. With the major threat weakening overnight as the storms progress through Iowa and Missouri, the risk of derecho is very low. Still, widespread wind, hail, and tornado damage are forecast over the Central and Southern Plains today. Those in the immediate areas should stay weather aware, especially in Iowa and Missouri after the sun sets and folks head off to bed. Overnight severe storms can catch people off-guard and unprepared.\n\nTo find more weather conditions and your local forecast from DTN, head over to https://www.dtnpf.com/...", "source": {"uri":

Storms are forecast to continue tonight as they progress eastward and exit our forecast area early Tuesday morning. The tornado risk will increase late evening and into the overnight hours.\"\n\nTornado Risk\n\nStrong, long-lived tornadoes mean that EF2 or stronger (111+ mph) twisters are almost guaranteed to happen, and some of those could stay on the ground for a long while.\n\nAnyone living within the pink hatched area has a 30% chance of experiencing an EF2 or stronger tornado within 25 miles of their home. It's very rare for meteorologists to have that kind of confidence in a tornado or severe weather outbreak, but that just gives you an indication of how dangerous this storm system is expected to be.\n\nTexas Impact\n\nThe extreme northern tier of Texas from Wichita Falls to Denton to Texarkana, along with the eastern Texas Panhandle will need to closely monitor the weather today and tonight. Even though the highest potential for severe weather lies in Oklahoma and Kansas, forecast models are not always 100% accurate.\n\nOnce Monday passes, Texas won't have to wait long for the next hazardous weather situation. Much of north-central, east, and northeast Texas is marked for severe weather on Wednesday...\n\n...with another go-round of severe weather anticipated on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "k945.com",

There were two adults and the child inside the vehicle, according a post from Johnson County Emergency Management Coordinator Jamie Moore.\n\nJohnson County is located about 29 miles south of Fort Worth, and about 50 miles southwest of Dallas. Moore posted that crews had performed at least 16 or 17 water rescues as of Sunday.\n\nMoore said the 911 caller saw the people inside the vehicle get out and attempt to get to dry ground on foot when all three were swept into the flood waters.\n\nFirst responders arrived to the scene and began searching, and the two adults were both rescued and transported to the hospital. The boy was found dead in the water, Moore said.\n\nThe parents were released Sunday, and KHOU reported the boy was identified as Lucas Warren.

The presence of this lid can increase the potential instability of warm air below it and the cool air above it, which means expect severe weather when it finally lifts.\n\n\"The main threats for today will be large to very large hail and damaging winds. There is an attendant tornado threat, especially with the more discrete storms, but low level [changes in wind speed] magnitude is marginal to keep this a more tertiary threat,\" Fort Worth meteorologist Allison Prater writes on the NWS website. \"Overall, the severe threat for our area remains highest generally north of I-20, though Oklahoma has the greatest threat of the day.\"\n\n\u2192Snakes are crawling out of hibernation in Texas.

Then an ex-Dallas Cowboys linebacker moved in\n\nBut even before the new line of storms arrive in our area, the weather service says we could see some rain. With the severe storms that blew through North Texas over the weekend, many areas are still waterlogged with much of the region in a flood watch Sunday.\n\nA cold front will blow through the region by Tuesday morning, pushing much of the bad weather to the east, Prater said. Temperatures by the afternoon will peak in the high 80s, and even 90 degrees.\n\nWith the heat comes more chances of thunderstorms.

All severe weather threats will be possible including damaging wind, very large hail, and a few tornadoes.\n\nSPC outlook: The Storm Prediction Center indicates that parts of the ArkLaTex will have a level 3 Enhanced risk of severe weather late Wednesday and Wednesday night. Storms will quickly develop late Wednesday afternoon along a cold front over the northern half of the area. While a few tornadoes will be possible, the most widespread risk will come from damaging wind and hail. The map comparison from Futurecast below shows the risk of very large hail and strong damaging winds of 50 to 70 mph. A few tornadoes will also be possible.\n\nA hot & mainly dry Tuesday: We have seen some scattered showers and thunderstorms develop over parts of the ArkLaTex Monday afternoon. A few of these storms could be rather strong before dissipating later Monday evening after sunset. Futurecast shows this activity ending Monday evening. Clouds will cover all of the area by Tuesday morning. Tuesday is looking dry over most of the ArkLaTex as clouds in the morning gradually decrease from northwest to southeast. We will probably stay dry Tuesday night and Wednesday morning under a mostly cloudy sky. Tuesday will begin with lows in the 60s and 70s. Daytime highs will soar to the upper 80s to lower 90s.\n\nA break from the heat and humidity: The long-range outlook continues to show that we will experience perfect weather next weekend. Expect plenty of sunshine from Friday through next Monday. Highs next weekend will be in the upper 70s to lower 80s. Lows will drop into the mid to upper 50s.

That method could be a weather radio with a hand-powered crank.\n\nYou can refer to your weather radio, local news organization or official social media accounts for emergency weather information.\n\nCity officials say Oklahoma City has 182 outdoor warning sirens.\n\nWhen a tornado warning is issued, the National Weather Service will label a map with polygons showing where the storm is and where it may be going. The City then sounds the sirens in the affected areas, or sectors. This way, sirens in areas that are not affected will not activate.\n\nThe sirens are normally loud enough to be heard indoors, but their main purpose is to warn people outdoors that a severe weather threat is close by.\n\nAccording to the City of OKC:\n\nThe City's sirens are tested on Saturdays at noon, unless there is a threat of severe weather. Anyone who can normally hear a siren but does not during Saturday's test should contact the Action Center at action.center@okc.gov.\n\nSEVERE WEATHER: Tornado and Severe Weather Safety Tips in American Sign Language\n\nAccording to the City:\n\nThe City says the Storm Shelter Registry is free and voluntary service to ensure police, fire and emergency responders know where to find you. If you do not have access to the internet, call the Action Center at 405-297-2535.\n\nOfficials say to talk to your family about severe weather and to create a plan in case you're not with your loved ones when it strikes. It is important to plan communication as well as how and where you'll reconnect.\n\nYou can visit Ready.gov to use their form to help develop a Family Emergency Communication plan.\n\n\"You can't overcommunicate with your family and friends.\" the City says.\n\nCity officials also advise to create an emergency supply kit that will help you survive for a couple of days after a disaster. It is recommended to build a kit that can last you and your family for 72 hours that includes items like medicine, water, an extra cell phone battery, a weather radio, flashlight with extra batteries, first aid kit, infant formula and diapers and pet food.\n\nIt may also be a good idea to visit your child's school to learn about their tornado plan and to develop a plan for your pets, too.\n\nSEVERE WEATHER: Oklahoma City Weather Radar\n\nThe 4Warn Storm Team is tracking the storms as they move into the state.

It will dig southeast overnight, arriving on our doorstep by tomorrow afternoon. Severe weather will be possible as it collides with the warm, unstable airmass over Kansas.\n\nTonight, southwest winds will pick up, with gusts up to 30 MPH possible across Western Kansas. This direction of wind flow will help increase the amount of moisture in our atmosphere overnight. Lows will only fall into the 50s by daybreak tomorrow.\n\nFire Weather Watches and Warnings are in place for far Western Kansas tomorrow. This portion of the state will see the strongest winds and the driest air as the passing dryline will track through this region during the morning.\n\nThe amount of moisture, or dew point, will drop dramatically behind the passing dry line. A dryline separates the drier air to the west from the more moist air to the east. This will aid in our fire weather concerns for those along the Colorado state line. But ahead of the boundary, dew points will sit in the mid to upper 60s.\n\nPair this warm, moist, and unstable airmass with the piece of energy tracking into the state, and you have the perfect recipe for severe storms to form. The upper-level low will arrive in Kanas during the afternoon and act as the match that ignites our severe weather risk.\n\nA Moderate Risk for severe weather covers portions of Southcentral Kansas, including Wichita, Pratt, Medicine Lodge, and Arkansas City. This area has the greatest potential for isolated supercells to development.\n\nStorms begin to fire up in the early afternoon in Northwest Kansas. It will not take long for a line of potent storms to unzip along the passing boundary. Our atmosphere is primed, so any storm that forms has the threat of becoming severe.\n\nThe line of storms will push into Central Kansas between 3 and 5 PM. Areas from Hays, Great Bend, and Pratt will need to be weather-aware during this time, especially as many will be heading home from school or work.\n\nWichita, Salina, Hutchinson, and Arkansas City will see their storm threat increase from 5 to 7 PM. Storms in Southcentral Kansas will be more isolated than those in the northern half of the state, which poses a great threat to supercell formation.\n\nRotating supercells are the type of storm structure favored to produce tornadoes and large hail. Without the influence of nearby storms, isolated supercells do not have to fight for energy and can strengthen quickly. All hazards will be possible, including softball size hail and strong, long-tracked tornadoes.\n\nThe line of storms will become more linear during the second half of the evening. It will then pick up speed and quickly track east into Missouri.\n\nNow is the time to prepare for tomorrow's severe threat. If you have a plan in place, you can be ready to take action if you find yourself in a tornado warning. Know where your storm shelter or safe place is and have multiple ways to receive weather alerts.\n\nThe good news is that behind Monday's storms, we enter a mild weather pattern. Temperatures will be near the season norm, and dry skies will persist through the weekend.\n\nKSN Storm Track 3 Forecast from Meteorologist Lucy Doll:\n\nWichita:\n\nTonight: Mostly cloudy. 10% chance of showers.

There were two adults and the child inside the vehicle, according a post from Johnson County Emergency Management Coordinator Jamie Moore.\n\nJohnson County is located about 29 miles south of Fort Worth, and about 50 miles southwest of Dallas.

The boy was found dead in the water, Moore said.\n\nThe parents were released Sunday, and KHOU reported the boy was identified as Lucas Warren. Relatives have since set up a GoFundMe on behalf of the parents, which has raised over $23,000.\n\nAt least 224 people were rescued from homes and vehicles on Saturday, but no deaths or serious injuries were reported, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said in an interview with CNN.

The greatest threat is north of Interstate 20.\n\nIsolated storms and showers are possible Monday around Houston, but conditions should stay dry and temperatures rise before a cold front sweeps through Thursday night.\n\nThere is a small chance for storms in San Angelo, Texas, but the National Weather Service says if they do develop, it could approach severe levels with large hail and damaging winds possible.\n\n\"Significant\" severe weather is expected across portions of Plains states Monday, including Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska.

All modes of severe possible including long track strong tornadoes. Please round up the family and have a plan in case severe weather warnings are issued for your area.\" said Slater.\n\nThe severe weather threat is predicted to move into Oklahoma City around 6 p.m. to 12 a.m.\n\nAccording to the City of OKC, having a plan and communicating effectively can help protect your family and friends in a severe weather situation.\n\nWatch for weather alerts\n\nOfficials say residents should have multiple ways of receiving weather information.\n\nAt least one of those ways should be accessible without power, without batteries and without a Wi-Fi or cellular signal. That method could be a weather radio with a hand-powered crank.\n\nCity officials say Oklahoma City has 182 outdoor warning sirens.\n\nWhen a tornado warning is issued, the National Weather Service will label a map with polygons showing where the storm is and where it may be going. The City then sounds the sirens in the affected areas, or sectors. This way, sirens in areas that are not affected will not activate.\n\nThe sirens are normally loud enough to be heard indoors, but their main purpose is to warn people outdoors that a severe weather threat is close by.\n\nAccording to the City of OKC:\n\nThe City's sirens are tested on Saturdays at noon, unless there is a threat of severe weather. Anyone who can normally hear a siren but does not during Saturday's test should contact the Action Center at action.center@okc.gov.\n\nThe City says the Storm Shelter Registry is free and voluntary service to ensure police, fire and emergency responders know where to find you. If you do not have access to the internet, call the Action Center at 405-297-2535.\n\nMake a plan & build a kit\n\nOfficials say to talk to your family about severe weather and to create a plan in case you're not with your loved ones when it strikes. It is important to plan communication as well as how and where you'll reconnect.\n\nYou can visit Ready.gov to use their form to help develop a Family Emergency Communication plan.\n\n\"You can't overcommunicate with your family and friends.\" the City says.\n\nCity officials also advise to create an emergency supply kit that will help you survive for a couple of days after a disaster.

The latest forecast includes a \"marginal\" risk of severe weather in the green and a \"slight\" risk in the yellow. The most intense thunderstorms will likely occur between 4pm and 8pm, with hail and wind the primary threats.\n\nStrong winds will also be a headline, especially tonight and tomorrow in western SD. A high wind watch has been posted for the area highlighted below.\n\nThe risk of severe weather today in KELOLAND is only a small segment of a much larger outbreak today across the plains. The risk of giant hail and tornadoes is greatest in central Kansas into Oklahoma.\n\nOn the map below, you can see the timeline of the showers and thunderstorms as they develop in central and eastern KELOLAND. The number of storm segments should help limit the severe weather parameters, but locally heavy rainfall is still quite likely with the strongest storms. Meanwhile, areas of rain and snow will develop on the backside of the storms through the Black Hills.\n\nStrong winds are likely the next couple of days. You can see those very strong winds in western SD tonight and tomorrow with gusts around 60mph.\n\nHere's a closer look at the heavy rain potential. 1-2'' of rain is possible around Sioux Falls.\n\nDon't forget about the chance of accumulating snow in the Black Hills. There's still a chance this snow will stick in the higher elevations. We'll have more on that story later today.\n\nFuturecast as shown below gives the weather highlights the next few days.

Two rounds of supercell thunderstorms brought more than 140 tornadoes through the region, including a rare, EF4-rated storm in Oklahoma that saw winds in excess of 170 mph. These storms left a path of devastation, including at least four deaths, dozens of injuries and destroying homes and other structures. This outbreak brings to light some of the myths about tornadoes, the need to be weather aware and the growing importance of effective warning systems.\n\nHow Tornadoes Develop\n\nTwo key atmospheric ingredients create the right conditions for tornadoes: instability, which means warm, moist air near the ground and cooler, dry air aloft, and wind shear, which is a change in wind speed and direction with increasing height. An unstable airmass promotes the development of strong updrafts, which is how rotation begins and tornadoes are ultimately produced.\n\nAll thunderstorms have the potential to produce tornadoes, but the supercell most commonly does so. A supercell is a severe, long-lived thunderstorm that contains updrafts that rotate on a vertical axis. When conditions are favorable, tornadoes will be produced. Supercells may produce strong, violent tornadoes or several tornadoes over several hours, much like we saw this past week in the Great Plains.\n\nRedefining Tornado Alley\n\nTraditionally, Tornado Alley has been defined as an area that includes Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, parts of northern Texas, Louisiana, Iowa, Nebraska, and eastern Colorado. However, frequent and dangerous tornadoes regularly occur outside of this region, for example, several tornado events have occurred this year in Indiana, Kentucky, Florida, and Georgia, among other states.\n\nClimate change is a major factor contributing to the shift in tornado activity and the expansion of Tornado Alley. As our planet warms, certain conditions become more favorable for severe weather events, including tornadoes. For example, the persistent drought and lack of moisture over portions of the original Tornado Alley has led to changes in wind patterns, pushing tornado activity further east.\n\nWhile we are talking about Tornado Alley expanding this year, in fact, the geographic location with the most frequent tornado activity tends to change from year to year. One year, the Southeast may experience more tornadoes, while another year, the activity could be concentrated further west. Researchers continue to study the complex interactions between climate patterns, moisture availability, and atmospheric dynamics to understand these shifts better.\n\nTornadoes and Cities\n\nIt's a common perception that tornadoes don't impact large cities, but last week's tornado, which ripped through the major cities of Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska, is the latest example of this being untrue. The biggest contributing factor to this misconception is that urban areas only account for about three percent of the U.S. land surface, making the chances of a tornado's impact minimal. The density of our cities, which are home to more than 80 percent of the U.S. population makes for a higher possibility for destruction.\n\nWeather Warning Systems\n\nForecasters and storm spotters use a variety of methods to identify tornado threats. Specific thunderstorm features and structures make tornado formation more likely, and these can be seen in storm cells. The use of Doppler radar data makes it easier for forecasters to identify potential tornadic activity, which usually includes identifying a large, rotating updraft that occurs inside a storm cell.\n\nStorm spotters are also often used as another support layer to identify potential tornadic activity. Typically, non-meteorologists, these volunteers are usually local emergency managers or even citizens with a particular interest in severe weather. They are trained to recognize tornado conditions and other severe weather and report what they see to the National Weather Service.\n\nLike many of the other extreme weather events that have become more frequent and volatile, tornadoes can occur anywhere and anytime, although the probability is relatively low. It's important to pay attention to and take seriously weather forecasts and alerts as we remain in a very active pattern at least for the next few weeks.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType":

The forecast prompted McConnell Air Force Base outside of Wichita, Kansas, to relocate some of its aircraft ahead of the storm to prevent potential damage.\n\nIt's the third such relocation in a month, base spokesperson John Van Winkle told Newsweek. The other two relocations were on April 15 and April 26.\n\n\"Weather is always going to be fickle, and we aren't wanting to take that risk,\" Van Winkle said, adding that the last aircraft should be evacuated by about 1 p.m. ET. Other vehicles and aircraft equipment also will be moved into the hangars to prevent damage.\n\nVan Winkle said there are 42 aircraft on the base. Not all of them will be evacuated, as some will be stored in hangars. The base is home to KC-135R Stratotanker and KC-46A Pegasus aircraft that provide air refueling, airlift and aeromedical evacuation worldwide.\n\n\"To maintain mission capability, we relocated the aircraft to other parts of the country,\" Van Winkle said.\n\nThe incoming storm comes only a week after several large tornadoes battered Oklahoma. Severe weather will impact Oklahoma and Kansas by Monday afternoon.\n\nIt is the first high-risk severe weather outlook issued by the NWS in over a year, and the first for Oklahoma and Kansas since 2019. According to the National Weather Service, grapefruit-sized hail has a diameter of 4.5 inches. Hail the size of grapefruits can cause extensive damage and is considered rare.\n\n\"A regional outbreak of severe weather with multiple strong, long-tracked tornadoes, as well as very large hail and severe thunderstorm gusts, is expected over parts of the south-central Plains from this afternoon through evening,\" the NWS warning said.\n\nSafety measures for the high-risk area include scheduling your day so you are never more than 5 minutes from a below-ground shelter, keep cellphones charged, wear closed-toed shows to better climb over debris should a storm hit and ensure you have multiple ways of receiving warnings, not just relying on sirens.\n\nIn addition to the areas at a high-risk outlook, a moderate risk was imposed a wider region of Oklahoma and Kansas, an enhanced risk was imposed for Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Arkansas, with a slight and marginal risk expanding across much of the central U.S.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news",

Only issued by the SPC when there's high confidence in a volatile setup of severe weather for any given day somewhere in the country, high risks catch the attention of meteorologists every time.\n\nIt's the highest level of severity on a scale from 1 to 5 in daily severe weather outlooks issued by the SPC.\n\n(Further beef up your forecast with our detailed, hour-by-hour breakdown for the next 8 days - only available on our Premium Pro experience.)\n\nWhat does a \"high risk\" mean? When the nation's best severe weather forecasters issue such a high risk, they're concerned about one of the following in the area:\n\n- A tornado outbreak with numerous intense and long-track tornadoes.\n\n- A long-lived derecho-producing thunderstorm complex that includes hurricane-force wind gusts and widespread damage.\n\nDocumentation on past high-risk outlooks is most thorough for those issued this century, but there were also documented cases in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nOnly a few each year: From 2000 through 2023, the SPC issued a level 5 high-risk forecast an average of two to three days each year.\n\nThe last high-risk forecast before May 6, 2024, was on March 31, 2023.\n\nBoth 2003 and 2010 had the most in any year - six - while a few recent years didn't have a single high risk, including 2020 and 2022. From June 2014 until late January 2017, no high risks were issued, the longest stretch this century.\n\nTwo dangerous months: April and May combined to account for nearly two-thirds of all high-risk days from 2000 through 2023, with 21 and 19, respectively. These months frequently have the right volatile mix of enough warm, humid air overlaid by a still-active spring jet stream.\n\nThere have been high-risk outlooks issued in the fall and winter months, including a first-ever January high risk in 2017.\n\nOnly August and September haven't had a single high-risk outlook this century. In those months, the jet stream required to prime the atmosphere for large-scale tornado outbreaks or large-scale convective wind-damage events is usually not strong enough.\n\nThat's not to say you can't get a rash of tornadoes during a landfalling hurricane, for example, in those months, as we saw with Hurricane Ivan in 2004.\n\n(For even more granular weather data tracking in your area, view your 15-minute details forecast in our Premium Pro experience.)\n\nEither in Plains, Midwest or South: This century, all high risks have covered either parts of the Midwest (Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, Great Lakes), Plains (Dakotas to Texas) or South (Arkansas and Louisiana to Virginia and the Carolinas).\n\nHere is the breakdown of regions covered by each of the 64 high risks from 2000 through 2023 (some high risks covered multiple regions, so the total below will be higher than 64).\n\nHowever, one high risk was issued for parts of the Northeast in association with one of the most prolific derechos of recent times - the May 30-31, 1998, Great Lakes and Northeast derecho.\n\nA solid track record: We examined each of the 64 high-risk outlooks from 2000 through 2023 to determine how many of those forecasts rang true to the dire nature of the outlooks.\n\nThere are various shades of gray in assessing the accuracy of these forecasts, somewhat analogous to grading the drafts of professional sports teams years after the fact.\n\nAlmost three-quarters (47) of the high-risk forecasts were solid.\n\nOther high-risk forecasts that turned into outbreaks included the late-April 2011 Super Outbreak, but also some tougher, more out-of-season forecasts, such as the November 2013 Midwest outbreak and the February 2008 Super Tuesday outbreak.\n\nJust a few \"busts\": Only seven of these high-risk forecasts could be clearly categorized as busts, meaning the forecast didn't materialize as badly as feared - primarily from a lack of tornadoes in the high-risk zone.\n\nAs SPC forecasters explained in a discussion regarding the May 18, 2017, high risk, several factors, such as too many competing severe thunderstorms interfering with each other, can lead to a busted forecast.\n\nThe most recent example was on April 27, 2014, when a small part of Arkansas was highlighted in the afternoon, but relatively few tornadoes occurred in that zone.\n\nThe other 10 cases weren't clearly either a hit or bust.\n\nOne example was April 5, 2017, in the Southeast. The high risk issued around midday certainly seemed to capture a long-track supercell spawning tornadoes in the southern half of Georgia. However, one could argue the density of severe weather reports was higher in areas surrounding the high risk.\n\nThat case points out that while a high-risk area is typically denoted as \"particularly dangerous\" in the lexicon of meteorologists, you should still take lower-level risk areas of severe thunderstorms seriously.\n\nPreparation, not panic: \"Due to the rarity of a high risk issuance, the response it generates is tremendous,\" SPC meteorologist Evan Bentley wrote in a thread on Feb. 28, 2023.\n\n\"On the worst days we want people to take unprecedented action to protect themselves,\" Bentley added.\n\nIf your area is in a high risk of severe thunderstorms, you should pay particularly close attention to the weather situation that day or night.\n\nHave a dependable method of getting severe weather watches and warnings, whether through local media, NOAA weather radio, social media or a smartphone. Make sure your smartphone is charged and app settings, including volume, are such that you can be awakened from a sound sleep.\n\nKnow where to take shelter if a warning is issued.\n\nIf you live in a mobile home, find out if your area has a safe shelter underground, or find somewhere else ahead of time where you can take shelter.\n\nIt is more likely in areas covered by a high risk that any tornado warnings will be for confirmed, large and destructive tornadoes, rather than false alarms based on radar-indicated rotation alone.\n\nPlanning ahead for these dangerous severe weather days can save your life.\n\nMORE ON WEATHER.COM\n\n- How To Prepare For Severe Weather Like A Meteorologist\n\n- 15 Severe Safety Tips That Could Save Your Life\n\n- Where To Go If Your Home Has No Basement Or

The destructive thunderstorms could see winds up to 80 mph.\n\nAt 3 p.m. ET, storms will begin popping up from Nebraska to Kansas - from Kearney, Nebraska to Hays, Kansas.\n\nStorms will likely explode in size quickly once they are sparked and will initially \"come out of nowhere,\" so everyone needs to be on alert, especially at the onset locations.\n\nThere will likely be tornado watches issued before any storms develop. People will need to be ready for anything quickly when they are issued.\n\nA \"particularly dangerous situation\" tornado watch has been issued for parts of south-central Kansas (including Wichita), much of Oklahoma (including OKC), and into far northern Texas (including Wichita Falls) through 12 p.m. ET.\n\nBy 6 p.m. ET, storms are popping and growing quickly from Nebraska to central Oklahoma. Strong and long-track tornadoes, including giant hail up to softball size, are possible at this time.\n\nStorms will continue pushing east by 8 p.m. ET, now entering the battered the Beatrice, Nebraska area along with Wichita Kansas.\n\nMore storms may pop by 12 ET, east of Oklahoma City, an area devastated by tornadoes at the end of April. A storm line then forms from Tulsa, Oklahoma, to Joplin, Missouri, to Kansas City, Missouri, with all modes of severe weather possible.\n\nThe line continues east overnight and eventually dies out as

Those impacts include tornadoes, damaging winds, hail and heavy rain.\n\nWith the system moving off to the south and east on Thursday, the front will trigger storms for areas from New Jersey south through North Carolina and east-central Texas.\n\nWith daytime heating and low-level moist conditions in place, severe storms will begin developing late afternoon into the evening and continue during the overnight hours.\n\nBy Tuesday morning, the severe threat will be much less, but the front won't quite push through the region.\n\nThe severe potential on Tuesday depends on what happens during the day. Depending on how quickly the atmosphere destabilizes will determine if storms develop Tuesday afternoon and evening.\n\nStorms will be possible along the Ohio River Valley, including Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio. There is a lower end threat for severe weather.\n\nAnother low pressure will ride along the slow-moving cold front. This will enhance the thunderstorms and could produce a higher-end threat in the Mississippi River Valley and Ohio River Valley regions.\n\nAll severe risks are possible, including tornadoes, damaging winds, large hail and heavy rain.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

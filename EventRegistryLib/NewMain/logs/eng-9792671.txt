They were amazed to discover soil that contained willow wood, insect parts, fungi, and a poppy seed in pristine condition.\n\n\"These fossils are beautiful,\" says Paul Bierman, a scientist at the University of Vermont who co-led the new study with UVM graduate student Halley Mastro and nine other researchers, \"but, yes, we go from bad to worse,\" in what this implies about the impact of human-caused climate change on the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on August 5th, confirms that Greenland's ice melted and the island greened during a prior warm period likely within the last million years -- suggesting that the giant ice sheet is more fragile than scientists had realized until the last few years.\n\nIf the ice covering the center of the island was melted, then most of the rest of it had to be melted too. \"And probably for many thousands of years,\" Bierman said, enough time for soil to form and an ecosystem to take root.\n\n\"This new study confirms and extends that a lot of sea-level rise occurred at a time when causes of warming were not especially extreme,\" said Richard Alley, a leading climate scientist at Penn State who reviewed the new research, \"providing a warning of what damages we might cause if we continue to warm the climate.\"\n\nSea level today is rising more than an inch each decade. \"And it's getting faster and faster,\" said Bierman. It is likely to be several feet higher by the end of this century, when today's children are grandparents. And if the release of greenhouse gases -- from burning fossil fuels -- is not radically reduced, he said, the near complete melting of Greenland's ice over the next centuries to a few millennia would lead to some 23 feet of sea level rise.\n\n\"Look at Boston, New York, Miami, Mumbai or pick your coastal city around the world, and add twenty plus feet of sea level,\" said Bierman. \"It goes underwater. Don't buy a beach house.\"\n\nCore Assumptions\n\nIn 2016, Joerg Schaefer at Columbia University and colleagues tested rock from the bottom of the same 1993 ice core (called GISP2) and published a then-controversial study suggesting that the current Greenland ice sheet could be no more than 1.1 million years old; that there were extended ice-free periods during the Pleistocene (the geological period that began 2.7 million years ago); and that if the ice was melted at the GISP2 site then 90% of the rest of Greenland would be melted also. This was a major step toward overturning the longstanding story that Greenland is an implacable fortress of ice, frozen solid for millions of years.\n\nThen, in 2019, UVM's Paul Bierman and an international team reexamined another ice core, this one extracted at Camp Century near the coast of Greenland in the 1960s. They were stunned to discover twigs, seeds, and insect parts at the bottom of that core -- revealing that the ice there had melted within the last 416,000 years. In other words, the walls of the ice fortress had failed much more recently than had been previously imagined possible.\n\n\"Once we made the discovery at Camp Century, we thought, 'Hey, what's at the bottom of GISP2?'\" said Bierman, a professor in UVM's Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources and fellow in the Gund Institute for Environment. Though the ice and rock in that core had been studied extensively, \"no one's looked at the 3 inches of till to see if it's soil and if it contains plant or insect remains,\" he said. So he and his colleagues requested a sample from the bottom of the GISP2 core held at the National Science Foundation Ice Core Facility in Lakewood, Colorado.\n\nNow this new study in PNAS, with support from the U.S. National Science Foundation, provides confirmation that the 2016 \"fragile Greenland\" hypothesis is right. And it deepens the reasons for concern, showing that the island was warm enough, for long enough, that an entire tundra ecosystem, perhaps with stunted trees, established itself where today ice is two miles deep.\n\n\"We now have direct evidence that not only was the ice gone, but that plants and insects were living there,\" said Bierman. \"And that's unassailable. You don't have to rely on calculations or models.\"\n\nFrom Flowers\n\nThe initial discovery that there was intact biological material -- not just gravel and rock -- in the bottom of the ice core was made by geoscientist Andrew Christ who completed his PhD working at UVM and was a post-doctoral associate in Bierman's lab. Then Halley Mastro picked up the case and began to study the material closely.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" she said. Under the microscope, what had looked like no more than specks floating on the surface of the melted core sample, was, in fact, a window into a tundra landscape. Working with Dorothy Peteet, an expert on macrofossils at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and co-author on the new study, Mastro was able to identify spores from spikemoss, the bud scale of a young willow, the compound eye of an insect, \"and then we found Arctic poppy, just one seed of that,\" she said. \"That is a tiny flower that's really good at adapting to the cold.\"\n\nBut not that good. \"It lets us know that Greenland's ice melted and there was soil,\" said Mastro, \"because poppies don't grow on top of miles of ice.\"", "source": {"uri": "eurekalert.org", "dataType": "news",

Scientists have discovered plant and insect remains under a two-mile-deep (three km) ice core extracted from the center of the island, providing the clearest proof yet that nearly all of this vast territory was green within the past million or so years when atmospheric carbon levels were much lower than today. Agence France-Presse\n\nWASHINGTON -- In the not-too-distant past, Greenland lived up to its name.\n\nScientists have discovered plant and insect remains under a two-mile-deep (three km) ice core extracted from the center of the island, providing the clearest proof yet that nearly all of this vast territory was green within the past million years, when atmospheric carbon levels were much lower than today.\n\nTheir research, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, indicates even greater potential for global sea level rise due to human-caused climate than previously thought.\n\nREAD: Greenland already locked in to major sea level rise -- study\n\nThe ice core, named GISP2, was drilled in 1993 and although its rock and ice had been studied extensively, nobody had thought to look for fossils in the \"till,\" or the mixed sediment at the bottom.\n\nThat's because until recently the idea that Greenland was ice-free in the recent geologic past seemed too far-fetched.\n\n\"Literally, we saw the fossils within the first hour, maybe half hour, of working on it,\" lead author Paul Bierman, a professor of environmental science at the University of Vermont, told AFP.\n\nREAD: Record ice melt in Greenland: Why should we care?\n\nTo their amazement, researchers found within this three-inch-layer soil willow wood, spores from spikemoss, fungi, the compound eye of an insect, and a poppy seed -- together suggesting a vibrant tundra ecosystem.\n\nIf ice at the center of the island had melted away, it almost certainly means that it was also absent across the rest of Greenland -- spelling trouble for today's fossil-fuel supercharged climate, said Bierman.\n\nIf greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are not drastically reduced, Greenland's ice sheet could almost entirely melt over the next several centuries to a few millennia, resulting in a sea level rise of approximately 23 feet (seven meters) that would wipe away the world's coastal cities.\n\n\"Hundreds of millions of people around the world are going to lose their places to live,\" he warned.\n\nCheckmate for impenetrable ice-fortress theory\n\nThe new work builds on two important recent findings. In 2016, scientists tested bedrock from the same 1993 ice core, using radioactive dating to estimate it could be no more than 1.1 million-years-old.\n\nTheir modeling also showed that if the ice was melted at the GISP2 site, then 90 percent of the rest of Greenland would have been ice-free.\n\nBut the finding was controversial because of a longstanding theory that Greenland was an impenetrable ice fortress for the past several million years.\n\nThen in 2019, Bierman and an international team reexamined another ice core, this time extracted from the abandoned US military base, Camp Century, near the coast of Greenland in the 1960s.\n\nThey were shocked to learn it contained not just sediment but leaves and moss. More advanced dating techniques available to them helped them constrain the disappearance of that section of ice to 416,000 years ago.\n\nThe discovery of organic matter in the core from near the coast prompted Bierman to go back to the 1993 core to look for similar material -- and finding it confirmed unequivocally what scientists had previously inferred through models and calculations.\n\n\"The ice had to be gone, because otherwise there would be no plants, no insects, and no soil fungus,\" said Bierman. \"Now we know for sure that the ice was gone not just at Camp Century but at GISP2 right at the center of the ice sheet. Now we know the whole ice sheet is vulnerable to melting.\"\n\nCo-author Halley Mastro, a graduate student at the University of Vermont who studied the fossils, emphasized the need for further drilling into Greenland's ice cores to find more ancient organisms that hold important implications for our future.\n\n\"It's so obvious once you know it's there -- but if you didn't expect it to be there, and you weren't looking for these tiny little dark flecks that float a little bit differently, you would never see them,\" she told AFP.", "source": {"uri": "globalnation.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@globalnation.inquirer.net", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vermont", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Vermont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ice core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sea level rise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_Ice_Sheet_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greenland Ice Sheet Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selaginella", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Selaginella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Willow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fungus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaspore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megaspore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Histology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences_of_the_United_States_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arctic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_eye", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compound eye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geologic time scale"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleontology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleontology", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Quaternary_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Quaternary Studies", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Icebreaker_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Icebreaker Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice Climbing", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://globalnation.inquirer.net/files/2024/08/Greenland-fossils-reveal-greater-sea-level-threat-from-climate-change.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792671", "eventUri": "eng-9792671", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

The findings were shared in a new paper published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nWhen the ice sheet initially melted, there were lower levels of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere than there are today. Now with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, scientists say Greenland's ice sheet is more susceptible to melting than previously thought.\n\n\"Greenland has been around for 2.7 million years with its ice,\" said Paul Bierman, a scientist at the University of Vermont who co-led the new study. \"Now there's some evidence that this ice sheet is fragile.\"\n\nThe researchers have been studying materials from beneath the hood of the Greenland ice sheet, the largest in the Northern hemisphere, since 2014. They examined sediment from the bottom of an ice core -- dubbed GISP2 -- extracted from two miles below the surface at the center of the ice sheet nearly 30 years ago.\n\nThe 1-ounce sample of sediment was filled with clues of Greenland's past. Tiny little black specks, when put under the microscope, revealed an insect eye, an Arctic poppy seed, parts of an Arctic willow, and tiny bits of soil fungus and spike moss -- what Bierman referred to as a \"frozen ecosystem underneath the ice.\"\n\nAccording to researchers, the fossils provide \"direct confirmation\" that 90% of the ice sheet was once gone.\n\n\"Finding these fossils in the center of the ice sheet is unambiguous evidence that Greenland's ice has disappeared [in the past],\" said Bierman. \"And once you lose the center of the ice sheet, you've lost it all.\"\n\nThe findings supports what's called the \"fragile Greenland\" hypothesis: that nature, outside of human influence, has caused the ice sheet to melt at least once since it formed, Bierman said.\n\nAt 656,000 square miles, the Greenland ice sheet currently covers around 80% of the island territory. To put that into perspective, it's about three times the size of Texas.\n\nNASA, which has mapped Greenland's ice loss, says the sheet has \"rapidly declined in the last several years,\" prompting the global sea level to rise around 0.03 inches per year. Greenland's melting ice mass is now the No. 1 driver of sea level rise, according to Bierman.\n\n\"In the early years of the climate warming, it was mountain glaciers that were doing most of the melting and adding water to the ocean,\" he said. \"Now it's Greenland.\"\n\nWhile it could be a few thousand years before the entire Greenland mass melts, Bierman said, the consequences would be dire: hundreds of millions of people could lose their homes and businesses. Places we hold near and dear to their hearts would be lost.\n\n\"As I like to say when people ask me, why does it matter? I say think about your favorite beach. And then imagine your favorite beach with 25 feet of water on it,\" Bierman said.\n\nHarry and Meghan on the dangers of online harm\n\nThe \"Olympics of hula\"\n\nThe journey of rapper-turned-country singer Jelly Roll", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mary_cunningham@aol.com", "name": "Mary Cunningham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sea level rise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_ice_sheet", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenland ice sheet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ice sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth's_atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tundra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences_of_the_United_States_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sediment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaver_radicatum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Papaver radicatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salix_arctica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salix arctica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microscope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fungus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ice core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Quaternary_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Quaternary Studies", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Icebreaker_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Icebreaker Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice Climbing", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hhQ5r1krtceYeLBFWDO3NQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDM-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cbs_news_articles_189/678ad439bd97fccb21294a6cf3190d34", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792671", "eventUri": "eng-9792671", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

They were amazed to discover soil that contained willow wood, insect parts, fungi, and a poppy seed in pristine condition.\n\n\"These fossils are beautiful,\" says Paul Bierman, a scientist at the University of Vermont who co-led the new study with UVM graduate student Halley Mastro and nine other researchers, \"but, yes, we go from bad to worse,\" in what this implies about the impact of human-caused climate change on the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on August 5th, confirms that Greenland's ice melted and the island greened during a prior warm period likely within the last million years -- suggesting that the giant ice sheet is more fragile than scientists had realized until the last few years.\n\nIf the ice covering the center of the island was melted, then most of the rest of it had to be melted too. \"And probably for many thousands of years,\" Bierman said, enough time for soil to form and an ecosystem to take root.\n\n\"This new study confirms and extends that a lot of sea-level rise occurred at a time when causes of warming were not especially extreme,\" said Richard Alley, a leading climate scientist at Penn State who reviewed the new research, \"providing a warning of what damages we might cause if we continue to warm the climate.\"\n\nSea level today is rising more than an inch each decade. \"And it's getting faster and faster,\" said Bierman. It is likely to be several feet higher by the end of this century, when today's children are grandparents. And if the release of greenhouse gases -- from burning fossil fuels -- is not radically reduced, he said, the near complete melting of Greenland's ice over the next centuries to a few millennia would lead to some 23 feet of sea level rise.\n\n\"Look at Boston, New York, Miami, Mumbai or pick your coastal city around the world, and add twenty plus feet of sea level,\" said Bierman. \"It goes underwater. Don't buy a beach house.\"\n\nCore Assumptions\n\nIn 2016, Joerg Schaefer at Columbia University and colleagues tested rock from the bottom of the same 1993 ice core (called GISP2) and published a then-controversial study suggesting that the current Greenland ice sheet could be no more than 1.1 million years old; that there were extended ice-free periods during the Pleistocene (the geological period that began 2.7 million years ago); and that if the ice was melted at the GISP2 site then 90% of the rest of Greenland would be melted also. This was a major step toward overturning the longstanding story that Greenland is an implacable fortress of ice, frozen solid for millions of years.\n\nThen, in 2019, UVM's Paul Bierman and an international team reexamined another ice core, this one extracted at Camp Century near the coast of Greenland in the 1960s. They were stunned to discover twigs, seeds, and insect parts at the bottom of that core -- revealing that the ice there had melted within the last 416,000 years. In other words, the walls of the ice fortress had failed much more recently than had been previously imagined possible.\n\n\"Once we made the discovery at Camp Century, we thought, 'Hey, what's at the bottom of GISP2?'\" said Bierman, a professor in UVM's Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources and fellow in the Gund Institute for Environment. Though the ice and rock in that core had been studied extensively, \"no one's looked at the 3 inches of till to see if it's soil and if it contains plant or insect remains,\" he said. So he and his colleagues requested a sample from the bottom of the GISP2 core held at the National Science Foundation Ice Core Facility in Lakewood, Colorado.\n\nNow this new study in PNAS, with support from the U.S. National Science Foundation, provides confirmation that the 2016 \"fragile Greenland\" hypothesis is right. And it deepens the reasons for concern, showing that the island was warm enough, for long enough, that an entire tundra ecosystem, perhaps with stunted trees, established itself where today ice is two miles deep.\n\n\"We now have direct evidence that not only was the ice gone, but that plants and insects were living there,\" said Bierman. \"And that's unassailable. You don't have to rely on calculations or models.\"\n\nFrom Flowers\n\nThe initial discovery that there was intact biological material -- not just gravel and rock -- in the bottom of the ice core was made by geoscientist Andrew Christ who completed his PhD working at UVM and was a post-doctoral associate in Bierman's lab. Then Halley Mastro picked up the case and began to study the material closely.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" she said. Under the microscope, what had looked like no more than specks floating on the surface of the melted core sample, was, in fact, a window into a tundra landscape. Working with Dorothy Peteet, an expert on macrofossils at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and co-author on the new study, Mastro was able to identify spores from spikemoss, the bud scale of a young willow, the compound eye of an insect, \"and then we found Arctic poppy, just one seed of that,\" she said. \"That is a tiny flower that's really good at adapting to the cold.\"\n\nBut not that good. \"It lets us know that Greenland's ice melted and there was soil,\" said Mastro, \"because poppies don't grow on top of miles of ice.\"\n\n/Public Release.

In 2016, scientists tested bedrock from the same 1993 ice core, using radioactive dating to estimate it could be no more than 1.1 million-years-old.\n\nTheir modeling also showed that if the ice was melted at the GISP2 site, then 90 percent of the rest of Greenland would have been ice-free.\n\nBut the finding was controversial because of a longstanding theory that Greenland was an impenetrable ice fortress for the past several million years.\n\nThen in 2019, Bierman and an international team reexamined another ice core, this time extracted from the abandoned US military base, Camp Century, near the coast of Greenland in the 1960s.\n\nThey were shocked to learn it contained not just sediment but leaves and moss. More advanced dating techniques available to them helped them constrain the disappearance of that section of ice to 416,000 years ago.\n\nThe discovery of organic matter in the core from near the coast prompted Bierman to go back to the 1993 core to look for similar material -- and finding it confirmed unequivocally what scientists had previously inferred through models and calculations.\n\n\"The ice had to be gone, because otherwise there would be no plants, no insects, and no soil fungus,\" said Bierman. \"Now we know for sure that the ice was gone not just at Camp Century but at GISP2 right at the center of the ice sheet. Now we know the whole ice sheet is vulnerable to melting.\"\n\nCo-author Halley Mastro, a graduate student at the University of Vermont who studied the fossils, emphasized the need for further drilling into Greenland's ice cores to find more ancient organisms that hold important implications for our future.\n\n\"It's so obvious once you know it's there -- but if you didn't expect it to be there, and you weren't looking for these tiny little dark flecks that float a little bit differently, you would never see them,\" she told AFP.\n\nia/bgs", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "issam_ahmed@ktbs.com", "name": "Issam Ahmed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_Ice_Sheet_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenland Ice Sheet Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ice core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selaginella", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Selaginella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Willow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fungus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vermont", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Vermont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea level rise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Histology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences_of_the_United_States_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sediment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arctic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_eye", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compound eye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geologic time scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tundra"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Quaternary_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Quaternary Studies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Icebreaker_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Icebreaker Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice Climbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/ktbs.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/7a/c7a1426d-4740-5a23-a897-f6a08b124c35/66b133811ad75.image.jpg?crop=512%2C269%2C0%2C36&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792671", "eventUri": "eng-9792671", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Dark-colored spheres produced by soil fungi dominated our view.\n\nThese were unmistakably the remains of an arctic tundra ecosystem - and proof that Greenland's entire ice sheet disappeared more recently than people realize.\n\nThese tiny hints of past life came from a most unlikely place - a handful of soil that had been buried under 2 miles of ice below the summit of the Greenland ice sheet. Projections of future melting of the ice sheet are unambiguous: When the ice is gone at the summit, at least 90% of Greenland's ice will have melted.\n\nIn 1993, drillers at the summit completed the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 ice core, or GISP2, nicknamed the two-mile time machine. The seeds, twigs and spores we found came from a few inches of soil at the bottom of that core -- soil that had been tucked away dry, untouched for three decades in a windowless Colorado storage facility.\n\nOur new analysis builds on the work of others who, over the past decade, have chipped away at the belief that Greenland's ice sheet was present continuously since at least 2.6 million years ago when the Pleistocene ice ages began. In 2016, scientists measuring rare isotopes in rock from above and below the GISP2 soil sample used models to suggest that the ice had vanished at least once within the past 1.1 million years.\n\nNow, by finding well-preserved tundra remains, we have confirmed that Greenland's ice sheet had indeed melted before and exposed the land below the summit long enough for soil to form and for tundra to grow there. That tells us that the ice sheet is fragile and could melt again.\n\nA landscape with Arctic poppies and spikemosses\n\nTo the naked eye, the tiny bits of past life are unremarkable - dark flecks, floating between shiny grains of silt and sand. But, under the microscope, the story they tell is astounding. Together, the seeds, megaspores and insect parts paint a picture of a cold, dry and rocky environment that existed sometime in the past million years.\n\nAbove ground, Arctic poppies grew among the rocks. Atop each stalk of this small but tenacious herb, a single cupped flower tracked the Sun across the sky to make the most of each day's light.\n\nTiny insects buzzed above mats of diminutive rock spikemoss, creeping across the gravelly surface and bearing spores in summer.\n\nIn the rocky soil were dark spheres called sclerotia, produced by fungi that team up with plants' roots in soil to help both get the nutrients they need. Nearby, willow shrubs adapted to life in the harsh tundra with their small size and fuzzy hair covering their stems.\n\nEach of these living things left clues behind in that handful of soil - evidence that told us Greenland's ice was once replaced by a hardy tundra ecosystem.\n\nGreenland's ice is fragile\n\nOur discoveries, published on Aug. 5, 2024, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrate that Greenland's ice is vulnerable to melting at atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations lower than today. Concerns about this vulnerability have driven scientists to study the ice sheet since the 1950s.\n\nIn the 1960s, a team of engineers extracted the world's first deep ice core at Camp Century, a nuclear-powered Army base built into the ice sheet over 100 miles from the northwest Greenland coast. They studied the ice, but they had little use for the chunks of rock and soil brought up with the bottom of the core. Those were stored and then lost until 2019, when they were rediscovered in a lab freezer. Our team was among the scientists called in to analyze them.\n\nIn the Camp Century soil, we also found plant and insect remains that had been frozen beneath the ice. Using rare isotopes and luminescence techniques, we were able to date them to a period about 400,000 years ago, when temperatures were similar to today.\n\nAnother ice core, DYE-3 from south Greenland, contained DNA showing that spruce forests covered that part of the island at some point in the past million years.\n\nThe biological evidence makes a convincing case for the fragility of Greenland's ice sheet. Together, the findings from three ice cores can only mean one thing: With the possible exception of a few mountainous areas to the east, ice must have melted off the entire island in the past million years.\n\nLosing the ice sheet\n\nWhen Greenland's ice is gone, world geography changes - and that's a problem for humanity.\n\nAs the ice sheet melts, sea level will eventually rise more than 23 feet, and coastal cities will flood. Most of Miami will be underwater, and so will much of Boston, New York, Mumbai and Jakarta.\n\nToday, sea level is rising at more than an inch each decade, and in some places, several times faster. By 2100, when today's kids are grandparents, sea level around the globe is likely to be several feet higher.\n\nUsing the past to understand the future\n\nThe rapid loss of ice is changing the Arctic. Data about past ecosystems, like we have collected from under Greenland's ice, helps scientists understand how the ecology of the Arctic will change as the climate warms.\n\nWhen temperatures rise, bright white snow melts and ice shrinks, exposing dark rock and soil that soaks up heat from the Sun. The Arctic is becoming greener with every passing year, thawing underlying permafrost and releasing more carbon that will further warm the planet.\n\nHuman-caused climate change is on pace to warm the Arctic and Greenland beyond temperatures they have experienced for millions of years. To save Greenland's ice, studies show the world will need to stop greenhouse gas emissions from its energy systems and reduce carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.\n\nUnderstanding the environmental conditions that triggered the ice sheet's last disappearance, and how life on Greenland responded, will be crucial for gauging the future risks facing the ice sheet and coastal communities around the world.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_Ice_Sheet_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenland Ice Sheet Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selaginella", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Selaginella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poppy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tundra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ice sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Willow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microscope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fungus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ice core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myr", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quaternary glaciation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isotope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_ice_sheet", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenland ice sheet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Science Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arctic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Organic matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Quaternary_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Quaternary Studies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Icebreaker_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Icebreaker Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice Climbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/606731/original/file-20240713-21-vgb0s9.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C592%2C3647%2C1821&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792671", "eventUri": "eng-9792671", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

The findings were shared in a new paper published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nWhen the ice sheet initially melted, there were lower levels of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere than there are today. Now with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, scientists say Greenland's ice sheet is more susceptible to melting than previously thought.\n\n\"Greenland has been around for 2.7 million years with its ice,\" said Paul Bierman, a scientist at the University of Vermont who co-led the new study. \"Now there's some evidence that this ice sheet is fragile.\"\n\nThe researchers have been studying materials from beneath the hood of the Greenland ice sheet, the largest in the Northern hemisphere, since 2014. They examined sediment from the bottom of an ice core -- dubbed GISP2 -- extracted from two miles below the surface at the center of the ice sheet nearly 30 years ago.\n\nThe 1-ounce sample of sediment was filled with clues of Greenland's past. Tiny little black specks, when put under the microscope, revealed an insect eye, an Arctic poppy seed, parts of an Arctic willow, and tiny bits of soil fungus and spike moss -- what Bierman referred to as a \"frozen ecosystem underneath the ice.\"\n\nAccording to researchers, the fossils provide \"direct confirmation\" that 90% of the ice sheet was once gone.\n\n\"Finding these fossils in the center of the ice sheet is unambiguous evidence that Greenland's ice has disappeared [in the past],\" said Bierman. \"And once you lose the center of the ice sheet, you've lost it all.\"\n\nThe findings supports what's called the \"fragile Greenland\" hypothesis: that nature, outside of human influence, has caused the ice sheet to melt at least once since it formed, Bierman said.\n\nAt 656,000 square miles, the Greenland ice sheet currently covers around 80% of the island territory. To put that into perspective, it's about three times the size of Texas.\n\nNASA, which has mapped Greenland's ice loss, says the sheet has \"rapidly declined in the last several years,\" prompting the global sea level to rise around 0.03 inches per year. Greenland's melting ice mass is now the No. 1 driver of sea level rise, according to Bierman.\n\n\"In the early years of the climate warming, it was mountain glaciers that were doing most of the melting and adding water to the ocean,\" he said. \"Now it's Greenland.\"\n\nWhile it could be a few thousand years before the entire Greenland mass melts, Bierman said, the consequences would be dire: hundreds of millions of people could lose their homes and businesses. Places we hold near and dear to their hearts would be lost.\n\n\"As I like to say when people ask me, why does it matter? I say think about your favorite beach. And then imagine your favorite beach with 25 feet of water on it,\" Bierman said.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ice sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea level rise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth's_atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tundra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences_of_the_United_States_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_ice_sheet", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenland ice sheet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sediment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaver_radicatum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Papaver radicatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salix_arctica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salix arctica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microscope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fungus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vermont", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Vermont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ice core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Quaternary_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Quaternary Studies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Icebreaker_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Icebreaker Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice Climbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/05/aecc3c9b-2d3e-4aa0-9c8b-89dc4112a6f0/thumbnail/1200x630/2d55029ce0ec5369f7323397899e9964/bierman-greenland-rocky-landscape.jpg?v=33116e4d892fab6878b5c06299369826", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792671", "eventUri": "eng-9792671", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Graduate Research Assistant in Natural Reso\n\nAs we focused our microscope on the soil sample for the first time, bits of organic material came into view: a tiny poppy seed, the compound eye of an insect, broken willow twigs and spikemoss spores. Dark-colored spheres produced by soil fungi dominated our view.\n\nThese were unmistakably the remains of an arctic tundra ecosystem - and proof that Greenland's entire ice sheet disappeared more recently than people realize.\n\nThese tiny hints of past life came from a most unlikely place - a handful of soil that had been buried under 2 miles of ice below the summit of the Greenland ice sheet. Projections of future melting of the ice sheet are unambiguous: When the ice is gone at the summit, at least 90% of Greenland's ice will have melted.\n\nIn 1993, drillers at the summit completed the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 ice core, or GISP2, nicknamed the two-mile time machine. The seeds, twigs and spores we found came from a few inches of soil at the bottom of that core -- soil that had been tucked away dry, untouched for three decades in a windowless Colorado storage facility.\n\nOur new analysis builds on the work of others who, over the past decade, have chipped away at the belief that Greenland's ice sheet was present continuously since at least 2.6 million years ago when the Pleistocene ice ages began. In 2016, scientists measuring rare isotopes in rock from above and below the GISP2 soil sample used models to suggest that the ice had vanished at least once within the past 1.1 million years.\n\nNow, by finding well-preserved tundra remains, we have confirmed that Greenland's ice sheet had indeed melted before and exposed the land below the summit long enough for soil to form and for tundra to grow there. That tells us that the ice sheet is fragile and could melt again.\n\nTo the naked eye, the tiny bits of past life are unremarkable - dark flecks, floating between shiny grains of silt and sand. But, under the microscope, the story they tell is astounding. Together, the seeds, megaspores and insect parts paint a picture of a cold, dry and rocky environment that existed sometime in the past million years.\n\nAbove ground, Arctic poppies grew among the rocks. Atop each stalk of this small but tenacious herb, a single cupped flower tracked the Sun across the sky to make the most of each day's light.\n\nTiny insects buzzed above mats of diminutive rock spikemoss, creeping across the gravelly surface and bearing spores in summer.\n\nIn the rocky soil were dark spheres called sclerotia, produced by fungi that team up with plants' roots in soil to help both get the nutrients they need. Nearby, willow shrubs adapted to life in the harsh tundra with their small size and fuzzy hair covering their stems.\n\nEach of these living things left clues behind in that handful of soil - evidence that told us Greenland's ice was once replaced by a hardy tundra ecosystem.\n\nOur discoveries, published on Aug. 5, 2024, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrate that Greenland's ice is vulnerable to melting at atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations lower than today. Concerns about this vulnerability have driven scientists to study the ice sheet since the 1950s.\n\nIn the 1960s, a team of engineers extracted the world's first deep ice core at Camp Century, a nuclear-powered Army base built into the ice sheet over 100 miles from the northwest Greenland coast. They studied the ice, but they had little use for the chunks of rock and soil brought up with the bottom of the core. Those were stored and then lost until 2019, when they were rediscovered in a lab freezer. Our team was among the scientists called in to analyze them.\n\nIn the Camp Century soil, we also found plant and insect remains that had been frozen beneath the ice. Using rare isotopes and luminescence techniques, we were able to date them to a period about 400,000 years ago, when temperatures were similar to today.\n\nAnother ice core, DYE-3 from south Greenland, contained DNA showing that spruce forests covered that part of the island at some point in the past million years.\n\nThe biological evidence makes a convincing case for the fragility of Greenland's ice sheet. Together, the findings from three ice cores can only mean one thing: With the possible exception of a few mountainous areas to the east, ice must have melted off the entire island in the past million years.\n\nWhen Greenland's ice is gone, world geography changes - and that's a problem for humanity.\n\nAs the ice sheet melts, sea level will eventually rise more than 23 feet, and coastal cities will flood. Most of Miami will be underwater, and so will much of Boston, New York, Mumbai and Jakarta.\n\nToday, sea level is rising at more than an inch each decade, and in some places, several times faster. By 2100, when today's kids are grandparents, sea level around the globe is likely to be several feet higher.\n\nThe rapid loss of ice is changing the Arctic. Data about past ecosystems, like we have collected from under Greenland's ice, helps scientists understand how the ecology of the Arctic will change as the climate warms.\n\nWhen temperatures rise, bright white snow melts and ice shrinks, exposing dark rock and soil that soaks up heat from the Sun. The Arctic is becoming greener with every passing year, thawing underlying permafrost and releasing more carbon that will further warm the planet.\n\nHuman-caused climate change is on pace to warm the Arctic and Greenland beyond temperatures they have experienced for millions of years. To save Greenland's ice, studies show the world will need to stop greenhouse gas emissions from its energy systems and reduce carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.\n\nUnderstanding the environmental conditions that triggered the ice sheet's last disappearance, and how life on Greenland responded, will be crucial for gauging the future risks facing the ice sheet and coastal communities around the world.\n\nPaul Bierman receives funding from the US National Science Foundation and the Gund Institute for Environment.", "source": {"uri": "home.nzcity.co.nz", "dataType":

Our team was among the scientists called in to analyze them.\n\nIn the Camp Century soil, we also found plant and insect remains that had been frozen beneath the ice. Using rare isotopes and luminescence techniques, we were able to date them to a period about 400,000 years ago, when temperatures were similar to today.\n\nAnother ice core, DYE-3 from south Greenland, contained DNA showing that spruce forests covered that part of the island at some point in the past million years.\n\nThe biological evidence makes a convincing case for the fragility of Greenland's ice sheet.

Dark-colored spheres produced by soil fungi dominated our view.\n\nThese were unmistakably the remains of an arctic tundra ecosystem - and proof that Greenland's entire ice sheet disappeared more recently than people realize.\n\nThese tiny hints of past life came from a most unlikely place - a handful of soil that had been buried under 2 miles of ice below the summit of the Greenland ice sheet. Projections of future melting of the ice sheet are unambiguous: When the ice is gone at the summit, at least 90% of Greenland's ice will have melted.\n\nResults of an ice sheet model show how much of Greenland's ice sheet survives when the ice is gone from the Camp Century (white dot), GISP2 (red dot) and DYE-3 (black dot) ice coring sites. Modified from Schaefer et al., 2016, Nature\n\nIn 1993, drillers at the summit completed the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 ice core, or GISP2, nicknamed the two-mile time machine. The seeds, twigs and spores we found came from a few inches of soil at the bottom of that core -- soil that had been tucked away dry, untouched for three decades in a windowless Colorado storage facility.\n\nOur new analysis builds on the work of others who, over the past decade, have chipped away at the belief that Greenland's ice sheet was present continuously since at least 2.6 million years ago when the Pleistocene ice ages began. In 2016, scientists measuring rare isotopes in rock from above and below the GISP2 soil sample used models to suggest that the ice had vanished at least once within the past 1.1 million years.\n\nNow, by finding well-preserved tundra remains, we have confirmed that Greenland's ice sheet had indeed melted before and exposed the land below the summit long enough for soil to form and for tundra to grow there. That tells us that the ice sheet is fragile and could melt again.\n\nThe GISP2 ice drilling camp at the Greenland ice sheet summit has an average temperature today of minus 7 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 22 Celsius).

The scientists say this shows life existed in an iceless environment less than 1.1 million years ago.\n\n\"I think the picture that's coming into my mind now is that Greenland is fragile, and that during prior warm periods, it did melt,\" said Bierman, a geoscientist with UVM's Gund Institute for Environment.\n\nThat could have implications for today's warming world, where melting ice sheets are raising global sea levels.\n\nThe study also included researchers from NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the University of Washington, Williams College, Purdue University, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, and the University of New Hampshire.\n\nIt builds on Bierman's previous research. In 2019, his team published a paper showing fragments of soil containing fossils and biomolecules were found in an ice core taken close to Greenland's coast, at a location called Camp Century, where the ice is thinner. This revealed that the ice had melted within the last 400,000 years -- more recently than previously believed.\n\nBierman said that made them wonder what might be at the bottom of GISP2, a core taken from a deeper area, closer to the center of Greenland's ice sheet. UVM requested a sample held at the National Science Foundation Ice Core Facility in Colorado, and were given a 3 inch specimen from 2 miles beneath the top of the ice sheet.\n\n\"I thought, you know, maybe we'd get a chunk,\" Bierman said. \"But in fact, we got a little baggy that you could hold in the palm of your hand with 30 grams, about an ounce of brown, dry sand and silt, a little bit of gravel in there.\"\n\nThey were able to identify organic material in the sediment.\n\n\"If you imagine like on Lake Champlain ... when you see all the debris like washing up onto the shore, you can sort of imagine how it floats sort of differently than like, the dirt and stuff,\" said Halley Mastro, a research assistant at UVM. \"So that's sort of what it looks like on a very tiny scale.\"\n\nThe sample from the core contained material Mastro had never seen before. There were bits of rock spike moss, the preserved eye of an unknown insect and the seed of an Arctic poppy flower.\n\n\"So what the new findings mean right now is that not only do we have this isotopic evidence with mathematical models of the disappearance of the center of the ice sheet, but we actually have this tangible, tractable [thing],\" Bierman said. \"I mean, when you find a fossil, you can explain that to anybody, right? 'I've got a poppy seed under two miles of ice, how'd it get there?'\"\n\nFor each of these remnants of life to have existed, it meant that in the last million years, the ice had to have melted by at least 90% to allow nature to thrive.\n\nThe researchers say the sample, taken from where the ice is thickest, at the center of the sheet, expands on the \"coastal\" findings of Camp Century and gives scientists a better understanding of what has happened with Greenland's ice sheet in the past.\n\nAccording to a 2015 study, when Greenland's ice sheet melted 400,000 years ago, sea levels rose between 6 and 13 meters above what they are now.\n\nToday, Greenland holds the equivalent of between 6 and 7 meters of global sea rise in its ice. If it were all to melt, it would pose a catastrophic threat to coastal communities around the world.\n\nBut Bierman said data also shows at some point after 400,000 years ago, the ice sheet did return to the landscape.\n\n\"So this is not all doom and gloom, but it came back when atmospheric carbon dioxide was 280 or 290 parts per million, not when it was 420 [parts per million and] headed up fast,\" Bierman said, referencing the current measure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. \"So I think there's a big warning in here that, yes, Greenland's ice sheet is fragile, but we are pushing that ice sheet to melt right now, and we're pushing it really hard by warming the climate.\"\n\nHe said that should be a wake up call.\n\n\"It takes time to melt the ice sheet, but we are headed right now -- unless we get the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, we're headed for that tens of thousands of years of warmth,\" Bierman said.\n\nSea levels are currently rising over 1 inch each decade. Bierman says right now, reducing carbon emissions and working to remove existing carbon from the atmosphere is the number one priority in keeping sea levels from rising.\n\nAs for the fossil findings, Bierman and Mastro said they came as a complete surprise and can serve as a tool to paint a picture of Greenland in a different geological time, a stark portrait of a scene they're hoping to prevent.\n\n\"I think the poppy seed is sort of a good thing to sort of highlight, just because people understand what a poppy flower looks like, and can sort of get the vision much easier of the landscape,\" Mastro said. \"People know what flowers are, but rocks, moss, doesn't really bring anything to the eye. But I think they all gave us different bits of information ... and so does Arctic poppy, but knowing that together, we can sort of build this picture of this ecosystem at that time.\"", "source": {"uri": "vermontpublic.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vermont Public"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ice sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vermont", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Vermont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Century", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camp Century"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddard_Institute_for_Space_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goddard Institute for Space Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomolecule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biomolecule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Hampshire", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of New Hampshire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Williams College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea level"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ice core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Purdue University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematical model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isotope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Champlain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lake Champlain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Science Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buoyancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Quaternary_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Quaternary Studies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Icebreaker_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Icebreaker Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice Climbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/afacf19/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4232x2222+0+300/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2Fd2%2F22255257456b87fb5e1be01c1624%2Fhalley-mastro-g24-in-bierman-lab-34-of-44.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792671", "eventUri": "eng-9792671", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Don't buy a beach house.\"\n\nIn 2016, researchers tested rock from the bottom of the same 1993 ice core, called GISP2, and published a then-controversial study suggesting that the current Greenland ice sheet could be no more than 1.1 million years old.\n\nIt was a major step towards overturning the longstanding theory that Greenland is an implacable fortress of ice, frozen solid for millions of years.\n\nThen, in 2019, Prof Bierman and an international team re-examined a 1960s ice core from Greenland.\n\nThey were stunned to discover twigs, seeds, and insect parts at the bottom of that core - revealing that the ice there had melted within the last 416,000 years.\n\nIn other words, the walls of the \"ice fortress\" had failed much more recently than had been previously imagined possible.\n\nProf Bierman said: \"Once we made the discovery at Camp Century, we thought, 'Hey, what's at the bottom of GISP2?'\n\n\"Though the ice and rock in that core had been studied extensively, no one's looked at the three inches of till to see if it's soil and if it contains plant or insect remains.\"\n\nHe and his colleagues requested a sample from the bottom of the GISP2 core held at the National Science Foundation Ice Core Facility in Lakewood, Colorado.\n\nThe new study provides confirmation that the 2016 \"fragile Greenland\" hypothesis is correct.\n\nAnd it deepens the reasons for concern, showing that the island was warm enough, for long enough, that an entire tundra ecosystem, perhaps with stunted trees, established itself where today ice is two miles deep.\n\nProf Bierman said: \"We now have direct evidence that not only was the ice gone, but that plants and insects were living there.\n\n\"And that's unassailable. You don't have to rely on calculations or models.\"\n\nUnder a microscope, study co-author Halley Mastro discovered that what had looked like no more than specks floating on the surface of the melted core sample, was, in fact, a window into a tundra landscape.\n\nShe was able to identify spores from spikemoss, the bud scale of a young willow and the compound eye of an insect.\n\nUVM graduate student Ms Mastro said: \"Then we found Arctic poppy, just one seed of that.\n\n\"That is a tiny flower that's really good at adapting to the cold.\"\n\nShe added: \"It lets us know that Greenland's ice melted and there was soil, because poppies don't grow on top of miles of ice.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The fossils were found to have organic matter, indicating an ice-free period during the Pleistocene Epoch, about 400,000 years ago, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe soil samples contained fragments of willow and wood, as well as insect parts, spike moss megaspores, fungi and poppy seeds, Halley Mastro, a graduate research assistant at the University of Vermont and co-author of the paper, told ABC News.\n\nPaul Bierman, professor of natural resources and environmental science at the University of Vermont and lead author of the study, added: \"There's just no way around the fact that the ice must have been gone or otherwise you couldn't have had these plants.\"\n\nIf the Arctic can become ice-free without human interference, it certainly can do so again in the presence of anthropogenic, or human-caused, warming, Bierman said.\n\nMORE: Antarctic sea ice has reached a record low for the year, researchers say\n\nHe noted that the fossil samples were derived from a drilling expedition in 1993, extracted from 2 miles beneath the ice shelf in Northwest Greenland, about 100 miles from the ice margin.\n\nThe fossilized plants suggest temperatures at Summit, Greenland, were likely about 37 to 44 degrees Fahrenheit when the ice disappeared, Mastro said. The ice was then replaced by a tundra ecosystem about 400,000 years ago. Carbon dioxide levels at that time are estimated to have been about 280 parts per million, compared to about 420 parts per million today, Bierman said.\n\nThe vast increase in carbon dioxide levels offer an explanation for current heat trends, Bierman added.\n\n'\"The best thing we can do is to stop and is to get that carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,\" Bierman said. \"That's why we're breaking heat records. It's simply as though you've thrown a blanket over the Earth.\"\n\nMORE: Prolonged ice-free periods putting Hudson Bay polar bear population at risk of extinction: Study\n\nBierman and Mastro are part of a team of about 40 international researchers funded by the U.S. National Science foundation to look at materials from the bottom of ice cores.\n\nPast marine sediment samples did not offer complete reconstructions of the ice sheet, which is why the analysis of the Arctic fossils is even more valuable, the researchers said. Moreover, the \"remarkable preservation\" of the macrofossils suggests that the ice sheet was completely ice-free during the Pleistocene period.\n\nData from NASA's Grace satellite shows a drastic reduction in the mass of the Greenland ice sheet over the last two decades.\n\nNot only is the ice sheet more unstable than previously thought, a paper published last year in PNAS found that it is also melting faster than scientists predicted -- a combination that could quickly accelerate the disappearance of the ice sheet, Bierman said.\n\nMORE: Greenland Ice Sheet melting faster than previously thought, scientists say\n\nA 2019 paper published in Nature found that the melting of the Greenland ice sheet could expose 400 million people to flooding risk. The potential melting in Greenland will have impacts all over the world -- coastal cities like Mumbai, Cape Town, New York, Boston and Miami could disappear, Bierman said.\n\nGreenland's three largest glaciers -- Jakobshavn Isbr\u00e6, Kangerlussuaq and Helheimcould -- could lose more ice than previously predicted if emissions continue as \"business as usual,\" a 2020 study published in Nature found.

In 2016, scientists tested bedrock from the same 1993 ice core, using radioactive dating to estimate it could be no more than 1.1 million-years-old.\n\nTheir modeling also showed that if the ice was melted at the GISP2 site, then 90 percent of the rest of Greenland would have been ice-free.\n\nBut the finding was controversial because of a longstanding theory that Greenland was an impenetrable ice fortress for the past several million years.\n\nThen in 2019, Bierman and an international team reexamined another ice core, this time extracted from the abandoned US military base, Camp Century, near the coast of Greenland in the 1960s.\n\nThey were shocked to learn it contained not just sediment but leaves and moss. More advanced dating techniques available to them helped them constrain the disappearance of that section of ice to 416,000 years ago.\n\nThe discovery of organic matter in the core from near the coast prompted Bierman to go back to the 1993 core to look for similar material -- and finding it confirmed unequivocally what scientists had previously inferred through models and calculations.\n\n\"The ice had to be gone, because otherwise there would be no plants, no insects, and no soil fungus,\" said Bierman. \"Now we know for sure that the ice was gone not just at Camp Century but at GISP2 right at the center of the ice sheet. Now we know the whole ice sheet is vulnerable to melting.\"\n\nCo-author Halley Mastro, a graduate student at the University of Vermont who studied the fossils, emphasized the need for further drilling into Greenland's ice cores to find more ancient organisms that hold important implications for our future.\n\n\"It's so obvious once you know it's there -- but if you didn't expect it to be there, and you weren't looking for these tiny little dark flecks that float a little bit differently, you would never see them,\" she told AFP.", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@digitaljournal.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ice core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sea level rise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_Ice_Sheet_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenland Ice Sheet Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences_of_the_United_States_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sediment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermersooq", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sermersooq"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sermersooq"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulusuk", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kulusuk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kulusuk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greenland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_eye", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compound eye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geologic time scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tundra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ice sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fungus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedrock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bedrock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vermont", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Vermont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spore"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Quaternary_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Quaternary Studies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Icebreaker_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Icebreaker Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice Climbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.digitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/566ac528ffc438e754739c8f79c2ab1db3af08a3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792671", "eventUri": "eng-9792671", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

A new study provides the first direct evidence that the center -- not just the edges -- of Greenland's ice sheet melted away in the recent geological past and the now-ice-covered island was then home to a green, tundra landscape.\n\nA team of scientists re-examined a few inches of sediment from the bottom of a two-mile-deep ice core extracted at the very center of Greenland in 1993 -- and held for 30 years in a Colorado storage facility. They were amazed to discover soil that contained willow wood, insect parts, fungi, and a poppy seed in pristine condition.\n\n\"These fossils are beautiful,\" says Paul Bierman, a scientist at the University of Vermont who co-led the new study with UVM graduate student Halley Mastro and nine other researchers, \"but, yes, we go from bad to worse,\" in what this implies about the impact of human-caused climate change on the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on August 5th, confirms that Greenland's ice melted and the island greened during a prior warm period likely within the last million years -- suggesting that the giant ice sheet is more fragile than scientists had realized until the last few years.\n\nIf the ice covering the center of the island was melted, then most of the rest of it had to be melted too. \"And probably for many thousands of years,\" Bierman said, enough time for soil to form and an ecosystem to take root.\n\n\"This new study confirms and extends that a lot of sea-level rise occurred at a time when causes of warming were not especially extreme,\" said Richard Alley, a leading climate scientist at Penn State who reviewed the new research, \"providing a warning of what damages we might cause if we continue to warm the climate.\"\n\nSea level today is rising more than an inch each decade. \"And it's getting faster and faster,\" said Bierman.\n\nIt is likely to be several feet higher by the end of this century, when today's children are grandparents. And if the release of greenhouse gases -- from burning fossil fuels -- is not radically reduced, he said, the near complete melting of Greenland's ice over the next centuries to a few millennia would lead to some 23 feet of sea level rise.\n\n\"Look at Boston, New York, Miami, Mumbai or pick your coastal city around the world, and add 20 plus feet of sea level,\" said Bierman. \"It goes underwater. Don't buy a beach house.\"\n\nIn 2016, Joerg Schaefer at Columbia University and colleagues tested rock from the bottom of the same 1993 ice core (called GISP2) and published a then-controversial study suggesting that the current Greenland ice sheet could be no more than 1.1 million years old; that there were extended ice-free periods during the Pleistocene (the geological period that began 2.7 million years ago); and that if the ice was melted at the GISP2 site then 90% of the rest of Greenland would be melted also. This was a major step toward overturning the longstanding story that Greenland is an implacable fortress of ice, frozen solid for millions of years.\n\nThen, in 2019, UVM's Paul Bierman and an international team reexamined another ice core, this one extracted at Camp Century near the coast of Greenland in the 1960s. They were stunned to discover twigs, seeds, and insect parts at the bottom of that core -- revealing that the ice there had melted within the last 416,000 years. In other words, the walls of the ice fortress had failed much more recently than had been previously imagined possible.\n\n\"Once we made the discovery at Camp Century, we thought, 'Hey, what's at the bottom of GISP2?'\" said Bierman, a professor in UVM's Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources and fellow in the Gund Institute for Environment.\n\nThough the ice and rock in that core had been studied extensively, \"no one's looked at the 3 inches of till to see if it's soil and if it contains plant or insect remains,\" he said. So he and his colleagues requested a sample from the bottom of the GISP2 core held at the National Science Foundation Ice Core Facility in Lakewood, Colorado.\n\nNow this new study in PNAS provides confirmation that the 2016 \"fragile Greenland\" hypothesis is right. And it deepens the reasons for concern, showing that the island was warm enough, for long enough, that an entire tundra ecosystem, perhaps with stunted trees, established itself where today ice is two miles deep.\n\n\"We now have direct evidence that not only was the ice gone, but that plants and insects were living there,\" said Bierman. \"And that's unassailable. You don't have to rely on calculations or models.\"\n\nThe initial discovery that there was intact biological material -- not just gravel and rock -- in the bottom of the ice core was made by geoscientist Andrew Christ who completed his Ph.D. working at UVM and was a post-doctoral associate in Bierman's lab. Then Halley Mastro picked up the case and began to study the material closely.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" she said. Under the microscope, what had looked like no more than specks floating on the surface of the melted core sample, was, in fact, a window into a tundra landscape.\n\nWorking with Dorothy Peteet, an expert on macrofossils at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and co-author on the new study, Mastro was able to identify spores from spikemoss, the bud scale of a young willow, the compound eye of an insect, \"and then we found Arctic poppy, just one seed of that,\" she said. \"That is a tiny flower that's really good at adapting to the cold.\"\n\nBut not that good. \"It lets us know that Greenland's ice melted and there was soil,\" said Mastro, \"because poppies don't grow on top of miles of ice.\"", "source": {"uri": "phys.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Phys.org"}, "authors":

You don't have to rely on calculations or models.\"\n\nSimilar evidence came from a 2016 study showing a \"cosmic ray burn\" in Greenland rocks that are also now covered with two miles of ice, \"from a time within the last million years or so, when temperatures were not much higher than now,\" said Richard Alley, a Pennsylvania State University geoscientist who was not involved in the new study.\n\n\"The new paper confirms and extends that information, showing that the ice was gone long enough to establish a tundra ecosystem recognizably similar to cold modern ecosystems,\" he said. The record doesn't show the exact temperature or how fast the ice melted, but the new study \"confirms that a lot of sea-level rise occurred at a time when causes of warming were not especially extreme, providing a warning of what damages we might cause if we continue to warm the climate.\"\n\nCo-author Halley Mastro, a paleoclimate researcher at the University of Vermont, spent long hours studying the biological remnants under a microscope, and said the finding was not a total surprise. Previous studies from the same core sample of gas bubbles in ice layers above the sediments had elevated levels of organic compounds like nitrogen that couldn't be explained with atmospheric variations, leaving ground-level organic material as the likely source.\n\nLike Bierman, Mastro thinks the organic sediments date back to an interglacial period about 400,000 years ago, when carbon dioxide levels were probably much lower than today, but summertime temperatures were higher and ocean currents quite different than now. Comparable samples taken under thinner ice, at Camp Century in northwest Greenland, were stored in a way that enabled more accurate dating.\n\nGreenland Meltdown Already Intensifies Climate Extremes\n\nResearch published in January 2024 showed that scientists had previously been underestimating Greenland's rate of ice loss by about 20 percent, and other recent studies show new threats, like huge areas of accumulating slush, as well as an increase in extreme rainfall and a newly documented web of micro-cracks on the ice sheet that could also speed melting.\n\nAlong with raising the level of oceans, water flowing into the North Atlantic from Greenland's melting ice and other parts of the Arctic is also contributing to extreme weather in Europe, according to a March 2024 study. And that same influx of icy water is probably also disrupting the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current (AMOC), which carries heat from the equator toward the Arctic. A failure or significant weakening of the AMOC would have disastrous climate consequences, especially in Europe, including the potential collapse of agriculture in northern Europe.\n\nBierman said global warming is eating away at the ice sheet edges, but also melting it from the top, with worrisome feedback loops. At the periphery, when the ice melts, it exposes darker rocks and ground that heat up and accelerate the melting of the edges. And as the elevation of the top of the ice sheet drops, it warmer layers of the atmosphere also speed melting.\n\nAs the ice sheet summit lowers, eventually snow will stop accumulating, and \"that's the end of the ice,\" he said. \"I think that's the real fear, why we should be frightened.\"\n\nIn 2023, scientists showed conclusively that the 2000-2010 period was the warmest decade on record in at least 1,000 years on the surface of the ice at the summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet.\n\nJoseph MacGregor, a research scientist with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, who was not involved in the new study, said scientists had already suspected that the ice sheet melted during one of the interglacial periods in recent geological history.\n\nThe new study bolsters the case that \"Greenland's landscape could look very different in a few generations if anthropogenic warming continues its present path,\" he said.\n\n\"The common and still relatively popular perspective is that the Greenland ice is more stable than parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet,\" he said. \"That may still be true, but Bierman's study helps build the case that the Greenland Ice Sheet is still quite sensitive to warming.\"\n\nBierman said none of the Greenland changes should be a surprise to anybody who's been watching and listening to science during the past few decades, \"but the rapidity at which it's caught up to us is a bit surprising.\"", "source": {"uri": "insideclimatenews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "InsideClimate News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

While that practice is gone, Madison barman Mike McDonald creates craft ice you'll find at many local bars, and now in a retail bag you can take home.\n\nAt one point in history, clear ice was bountiful in Madison, harvested straight out of our lakes, including Mendota, Monona and Wingra. (Remember the opening scene from \"Frozen?\" Yeah, kind of like that.) Covered in sawdust in giant icehouses, that Madison ice was then shipped out in railcars to Chicago and the rest of the nation in the late 19th century to fill refrigerator iceboxes. But by 1930, ice harvesting was outlawed in Wisconsin as lake health became a concern.\n\nNow, consumable ice with that see-through quality (which is produced by directional freezing that happens naturally in lakes) is a little more difficult to come by. At the same time, it has become more and more customary for today's cocktails to be poured over a big block or sphere of ice. That's where local bar manager and bar consultant Mike McDonald saw a gap in the market within the bar and restaurant industry in Madison.\n\n\"If they wanted it, they were making it at home,\" he says about the time-consuming process of creating crystal-clear ice in certain shapes. \"Or if they really wanted to pay for it, they were shipping it from Chicago.\"\n\nThe State Line Distillery bar manager and part-time bar consultant decided to launch a side gig, Wisco Ice Co. He creates cocktail ice (not out of the lakes) for more than 20 bars and restaurants in Madison and Milwaukee, and he now offers a 12-cube ice bag, available at four local retailers, plus one in Milwaukee.\n\nWhen Mike McDonald's product is put into use, it melts away slowly -- but disappears instantly.\n\nNo, that's not some bar riddle, it's a description of McDonald's crystal-clear ice. His handcrafted ice cubes are so clear that once they're submerged in a rocks or Tom Collins glass, you can see straight through to the bar top the drink is sitting on. When it's served in State Line's Distinguished Patron cocktail -- one of three signature State Line drinks his ice appears in right now -- the meringue garnish looks like it's magically floating.\n\nHis \"elevated and sophisticated\" product (meant for cocktails like Old Fashioneds) isn't just for aesthetics.\n\n\"If you have a bunch of hotel ice in that same Old Fashioned, it's going to dilute so fast, it's not going to be cold for very long and it's not going to taste the same,\" McDonald says.\n\nThat 2-by-2-inch ice cube is still there, of course. And actually, it'll be there a lot longer than the average ice cube, which is one of his selling points. His ice cubes, prisms and spheres (one-per-drink sized), are created using the directional freezing process, so there aren't any air pockets for liquid to touch. The decreased surface area slows the melting process.\n\n\"It's going to stay colder for longer, and the integrity of that drink will last over the course of your consumption of it,\" McDonald says. \"You can actually sit and enjoy it at a more leisurely pace.\"\n\nDirectional freezing is the key to getting that glass-like appearance. Freezing ice from one particular angle in an insulated container forces air pockets and minerals to push to the top or bottom, leaving a section of ice that's free from cloudiness.\n\n\"There's always a very similar conversation at the bar about people's trials and tribulations of trying to make crystal-clear ice at home,\" McDonald says. \"It's usually the same thing, 'Oh I got these molds, boiled it, used distilled water.' There are kits you can buy at home now.\"\n\nMcDonald started making ice out of square Igloo coolers, breaking down the frozen pieces by hand with a saw. Once he decided to ramp up production, he invested in a few more tools, including a Clinebell machine and a bandsaw that he operates out of a back room at State Line.\n\nRight now, McDonald is making as many as 800 pieces of ice a week. His modest workspace includes a hoist to pull the big blocks out of the Clinebell machine, a chainsaw lubricated with mineral oil to make initial cuts before ice chunks move to the bandsaw, and conductive molds to shape the spheres and sometimes custom stamps. State Line goes through at least 100 of his cubes and spheres per week, and McDonald is delivering other batches to bar, restaurant and retail clients. Besides having a few contracted workers helping with production and delivery, McDonald is a one-man team.\n\nAfter spending three and a half years in Milwaukee at Bittercube, McDonald made the move to Madison to help open the now-closed Field Table, which opened in 2016. He then helped open State Line Distillery in 2017 and was eventually brought on full time to run the bar program. As a bar consultant, McDonald has also helped open Good Co. at Pioneer Pointe in Verona, The Ready Set in Oregon and Whiskey Run Distilling Co. in New Glarus.\n\nIce-making is purely a side gig for McDonald right now, but demand for craft ice keeps growing. It's a much different operation from the ice harvesting that was happening in Madison more than 100 years ago.\n\nOne of the largest Madison companies in the heyday of ice harvesting was Conklin & Sons, which operated a large icehouse near James Madison Park. That company sold most if its ice locally, ending up in many refrigerator iceboxes (before the widespread availability of electricity).\n\nRising demand for chilled drinks and meat spurred the growth of the ice harvesting industry in Wisconsin back then. WisContext cited a 1901 Wisconsin State Journal article that \"estimated 100,000 tons of ice would be harvest from Madison's three lakes that upcoming winter.\" But just a few years later in 1908, the city's domestic market of ice harvesting on Lakes Mendota and Monona was shut down due to health concerns, because raw sewage and waste continued to pollute our waters. In 1911, the state Legislature outlawed ice harvesting on Lake Monona while cleaner harvesting continued on Lake Wingra through the 1920s. Madison's last remaining large icehouse was demolished in 1932 in the present-day location of Wingra Boats.\n\nWhile McDonald isn't exactly like the icemen of the 1900s -- shivering on frozen-over lakes while holding pike poles to slide giant blocks of ice into sawdust-covered icehouses -- he does relate to the more rudimentary ice cutting process. He remembers the last Madison Cocktail Week, right around the time he started making craft ice, when he was cutting every cube by hand with handsaws, picks and hammers. \"I've since gained some efficiency, that's for sure,\" he says. \"And lessons, of course -- always.\"\n\nAs McDonald continues his work as a bar manager and consultant, his ultimate goal is to create the highest quality cocktails possible. His drink philosophy remains simple: \"I want them to be balanced and I want all the ingredients to make sense in what I'm experiencing,\" he says. \"Ice is a part of that.\"\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY MADISON MAGAZINE.

The fossils were found to have organic matter, indicating an ice-free period during the Pleistocene Epoch, about 400,000 years ago, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe soil samples contained fragments of willow and wood, as well as insect parts, spike moss megaspores, fungi and poppy seeds, Halley Mastro, a graduate research assistant at the University of Vermont and co-author of the paper, told ABC News.\n\nPaul Bierman, professor of natural resources and environmental science at the University of Vermont and lead author of the study, added: \"There's just no way around the fact that the ice must have been gone or otherwise you couldn't have had these plants.\"\n\nIf the Arctic can become ice-free without human interference, it certainly can do so again in the presence of anthropogenic, or human-caused, warming, Bierman said.\n\nHe noted that the fossil samples were derived from a drilling expedition in 1993, extracted from 2 miles beneath the ice shelf in Northwest Greenland, about 100 miles from the ice margin.\n\nThe fossilized plants suggest temperatures at Summit, Greenland, were likely about 37 to 44 degrees Fahrenheit when the ice disappeared, Mastro said. The ice was then replaced by a tundra ecosystem about 400,000 years ago. Carbon dioxide levels at that time are estimated to have been about 280 parts per million, compared to about 420 parts per million today, Bierman said.\n\nThe vast increase in carbon dioxide levels offer an explanation for current heat trends, Bierman added.\n\n'\"The best thing we can do is to stop and is to get that carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,\" Bierman said. \"That's why we're breaking heat records. It's simply as though you've thrown a blanket over the Earth.\"\n\nBierman and Mastro are part of a team of about 40 international researchers funded by the U.S. National Science foundation to look at materials from the bottom of ice cores.\n\nPast marine sediment samples did not offer complete reconstructions of the ice sheet, which is why the analysis of the Arctic fossils is even more valuable, the researchers said. Moreover, the \"remarkable preservation\" of the macrofossils suggests that the ice sheet was completely ice-free during the Pleistocene period.\n\nData from NASA's Grace satellite shows a drastic reduction in the mass of the Greenland ice sheet over the last two decades.\n\nNot only is the ice sheet more unstable than previously thought, a paper published last year in PNAS found that it is also melting faster than scientists predicted -- a combination that could quickly accelerate the disappearance of the ice sheet, Bierman said.\n\nA 2019 paper published in Nature found that the melting of the Greenland ice sheet could expose 400 million people to flooding risk. The potential melting in Greenland will have impacts all over the world -- coastal cities like Mumbai, Cape Town, New York, Boston and Miami could disappear, Bierman said.\n\nGreenland's three largest glaciers -- Jakobshavn Isbr\u00e6, Kangerlussuaq and Helheimcould -- could lose more ice than previously predicted if emissions continue as \"business as usual,\" a 2020 study published in Nature found. These glaciers make up about 12% of the entire ice sheet and hold enough ice to raise sea levels by about 4.3 feet.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"},

Vice President Kamala Harris has been spotted at restaurants in Washington, D.C., and her preferences of ordering ice along with white wine have been noted by servers. Martha Stewart once defended the cold move to Stephen Colbert, justifying plopping a cold block of ice into servings of white wine or ros\u00e9, and even taking to Instagram to demonstrate the ease of adding ice to glasses of chardonnay. To ice or not to ice is a contested move, and connoisseurs around the world have advocated for both approaches.\n\nCertain pseudo-sommeliers may frown upon adding chunks of ice to wine, particularly if you're at an occasion where a blend needs to be fully appreciated and savored. Though many oenophiles assert that ice has no place near a wine glass, others reason that there are plenty of instances in which you may, indeed, want to drop an ice cube or two into your glass. Whether you find yourself with a glass of white that isn't quite as chilled as you'd like it to be or if you simply want to delay the effects of alcohol until later in the day, the inclusion of ice into your glass is a matter of personal preference.\n\nAcross Europe, ice is dropped into wine to make cocktails and spritzes, and it is certainly not frowned upon. Start by adding a single cube to a crisp white or fruity red, and unless you like the taste of tannins, keep ice cubes away from richer, oaky wines. Should you want to chill a glass of a luscious red or sweet wine without putting your vintage label at risk of dilution, you can reach for a whiskey stone, instead.\n\nAt social events, you may not have the luxury of time to ask for a bottle of wine to be chilled before you begin sipping. Dropping an ice cube into a wine glass is a convenient and easy move to adjust temperature. Though the addition will dilute a blend, the move can be a strategic one and serve as a kind of self-preservation so that effects of alcohol aren't as likely to come on strong midway through a fancy brunch with the in-laws or at a table of politicians. Like Harris, you can ask for a cup of ice to discreetly add to your drink as you deem necessary.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michelle_welsch@yahoo.com", "name": "Michelle Welsch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chardonnay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chardonnay"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Colbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Colbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martha Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ros\u00e9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ros\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wine glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oenophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oenophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessert_wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dessert wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tannin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whisky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cocktail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Food_and_Wine", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Food and Wine", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Alcoholic_Beverages", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Alcoholic Beverages", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Ice Climbing", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BcdKQbfsm6dlhCj2zYONXg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/tasting_table_543/69bb85f815cf6e0b8dc79ebf6ffe3ca1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792671", "eventUri": "eng-9792671", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

It found that the melting of local ice due to global warming enables thicker ice from Greenland to flow into the corridor's choke points, reducing the length of time when ships can move through the passage.\n\n\"First-year ice, that's retreating. But it means the thick ice -- multiyear ice -- is then more able to flow down into those areas,\" lead author Alison Cook, a researcher at the Scottish Association for Marine Science and the University of Ottawa, said in an interview.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nThat thicker ice poses hazards for ships, such as damage or sinking if there's a collision.\n\nThe results contradict the common view that the Northwest Passage, the Arctic Ocean waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific, is an increasingly practical option for commercial shipping. It even surprised Cook.\n\n\"I certainly was assuming the season length was becoming longer everywhere, and it just wasn't,\" she said.\n\nCook and her colleagues looked at historical ice charts of the Northwest Passage and converted those into season lengths. The seasons indicate the number of weeks where medium ice-strength ships can traverse the passage without taking extra safety precautions.\n\nFour regions saw significant changes. In three, the shipping season was shortened by 50 to 70 percent between 2007 and 2021. In one -- the eastern Lancaster Sound -- the season length grew by 15 percent.\n\nShipping seasons typically run between 15 and 25 weeks, though it fluctuates heavily between years and regions.\n\nChanging ice has discouraged at least one passenger cruise line from sailing the passage.\n\nScenic Luxury Cruises and Tours crossed the Northwest Passage in 2022, but \"because of the sensitive environment and ever-changing ice conditions and weather conditions of the Arctic, they redeployed their sailings after that season,\" said Michelle Abril, vice president of Coyne PR and a spokesperson for Scenic. \"They are not currently sailing there or have itineraries set through Q1 2027 to visit that region.\"\n\nDespite the shrinking seasons, crossings have -- on average -- increased over the past decade, according to data provided to POLITICO's E&E News by the Canadian Coast Guard.\n\n\"Over the coming years, the Canadian Coast Guard anticipates an increase in arctic traffic, due to increased tourism, commercial shipping, and adventuring opportunities,\" the Coast Guard said in a statement.\n\nWhile the trends show voyages rising and season lengths decreasing, there are a couple of explanations for that apparent contradiction.\n\nThe first is demand. Shipping companies are eyeing alternatives to the narrow and congested Panama Canal. And adventure tourists are eager to trek into the Arctic.\n\nThen, there's the location of multiyear ice. The three regions where the study found shorter shipping seasons are along the northern route of the Northwest Passage. The southern route remains mostly unaffected by the thicker ice coming down from Greenland.\n\n\"The southern route of the Northwest Passage, that's where there is an increase in ships going through,\" Cook explained. \"People have their eye on the northern parts of the Northwest Passage. It's shorter. People would want to go that way more than the southern, but they still haven't really because of the presence of ice.\"\n\nThe Danish maritime logistics company Royal Wagenborg, which ships through the Northwest Passage, declined a request for comment citing \"confidential information.\"\n\nStephen Howell, one of Cook's co-authors and a research scientist for the Climate Research Division at the Environment and Climate Change Canada government department, said the thicker ice from farther north will continue to flow down and endanger ships along the northern route for decades to come.\n\n\"Ten years, 20 years -- as long as that ice is still there, the risk is going to be still there,\" Howell said in an interview.\n\nYet even the thicker ice will eventually melt because of rising temperatures, said Julienne Stroeve, a scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\n\"I would imagine if we don't drastically reduce GHG emissions, after 2050 there will not be a lot of ice to enter into the [Canadian Arctic Archipelago] from the Arctic Ocean and thus the [Northwest Passage] will mostly be ice-free in summer,\" Stroeve said.", "source": {"uri": "scientificamerican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scientific American"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Passage", "type":

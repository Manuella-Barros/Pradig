She would do it in such a way where she would hit something and she would say, 'Doesn't count for me,'\" Zulema Pastenes said.\n\nShe said this concept of things not counting because Lori and Chad Daybell were already righteous and exalted was brought up frequently -- including when she asked Chad and Lori Daybell why they were acting like they were in a physical relationship right after Charles Vallow, Lori Daybell's husband, was killed and while Chad Daybell was still married to Tammy Daybell.\n\nPastenes, who was a close friend of Lori Daybell before marrying the woman's brother, Alex Cox, about two weeks before he died, explained the light and dark scale of rating people, as well as other fringe religious beliefs she was taught by the couple. Previous witnesses have testified that Chad Daybell would label people light and dark, based on how much he believed a person had been taken over by evil.\n\nChad Daybell is on trial for first-degree murder in the deaths of Lori Daybell's children -- 7-year-old Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan -- and his former wife, Tammy Daybell. He is also charged with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder of each of the victims, grand theft and two counts of insurance fraud.\n\nClick here for complete coverage of the Chad Daybell trial\n\nDefense attorney John Prior has asked multiple witnesses during the trial about the \"seven gatherers,\" and each has said they are not familiar with the group. But Pastenes was able to offer an explanation when asked by prosecutor Lindsey Blake. Pastenes said it was a group of seven women, including herself and Lori Daybell, and they would get together to \"share information.\" They also had a shared email and would do \"castings\" together, sometimes virtually by Zoom.\n\n\"Castings,\" according to previous testimony, meant prayers for an evil spirit to leave someone. One woman testified that if a casting was successful, either the person would die or a new spirit would enter their body.\n\nPastenes said the group would go to Lori Daybell for answers to their religious questions, most of which would come through Chad Daybell.\n\nPastenes also told the court she received multiple religious \"blessings\" from Chad Daybell, and they were different than what she was used to. During such blessings, he told her how special she was.\n\n\"It was almost as if Chad was looking into the future for me. ... There was a lot of praise during the blessing,\" she said about the first one she received.\n\nShe said the teachings from Chad and Lori Daybell evolved. She talked about diagrams for the teachings written on pages of her journal and on a receipt from a lunch with Lori Daybell. Pastenes said she was \"somehow\" open to Chad Daybell's teaching -- that a demon could occupy a body shortly before someone's death, moving a person's original spirit into limbo.\n\nThe first person this happened with, she testified, was Lori Daybell's then-husband Charles Vallow. She said they performed multiple \"castings\" on Vallow that were successful and the demon left, according to Chad Daybell. But then he told the group that a third demon had taken over Charles Vallow's body, which was a more powerful demon and they were not able to cast that demon out.\n\nShe testified about going over to Lori Daybell's home the day after Cox shot and killed Charles Vallow. She was told that Lori Daybell and her husband had been arguing over his phone when Tylee brought a bat in, and Charles Vallow took the bat and hit Cox on the back of the head before Cox pulled out a gun and shot him.\n\nPastenes testified that Lori Daybell did not seem sad about the death, but \"quiet, perhaps a little somber.\" She said Cox seemed \"normal,\" and when she asked him if he was OK, Cox asked her why. She said to him, \"Because you shot somebody.\" She said her husband responded: \"He was a zombie.\"\n\nShe said Cox told her that if he ever became a zombie, to \"just shoot me in the face.\" Pastenes said Cox \"100% believed\" what Chad Daybell was teaching.\n\nShe said Chad Daybell taught that a person's spirit would start at a \"1\" rating on the light and dark scale before coming to the world, and when they came to the world for the first time, they would have a \"2\" rating. Pastenes said she was told her \"4.2 rating\" meant she had come to the earth before and had been \"exalted.\"\n\nPastenes said, initially, Chad Daybell said Cox was a \"first creation,\" meaning this was his first time in the world, so he had a lower light rating, around a 2. But later \"they found out Alex ... had been exalted in other worlds before\" and his \"spiritual standing had changed.\"\n\nPastenes was told a casting caused Tammy Daybell's death\n\nPrinted sheets of paper with ratings from Chad Daybell's computer were shown to the jury showing family members both Chad and Lori Daybell.\n\n\"All of Chad's family was light, and it seems like so many of Lori's family was dark,\" Pastenes said.\n\nShe said Chad Daybell told them he had access to the \"book of life\" and could read about anyone's past, present or future.\n\nEventually, Pastenes said Tammy Daybell was rated as \"dark.\" She said she was told that Tammy Daybell had been \"possessed by a demon and ... that she had also become a zombie.\"\n\nShe said she participated in a casting for Tammy Daybell on October 9, 2019, and later realized that was the day a man confronted Tammy Daybell in her driveway and pointed a gun at her.\n\nAfter the casting that night, which was unsuccessful, she said Lori Daybell was on the phone with someone and was \"extremely angry\" and \"irate\" and was calling the person names, and said, \"Idiot can't do anything by himself.\"\n\n\"I had never seen her that upset, ... scary angry,\" Pastenes said.\n\nTammy Daybell died shortly thereafter, and Pastenes said Lori Daybell told her that Chad Daybell had received \"new information\" from angels that taught them how to make a casting successful. She was told that Tammy Daybell died because they had used this new method to successfully cast out the evil spirit.\n\nShe said they understood that if a casting was successful, the body would die.\n\nPastenes testified that in August 2019, Chad Daybell told her JJ was going to die young and \"that he was probably going to die soon and that he was going to come right back to Earth as Colby (Ryan)'s son.\" Ryan is the older son of Lori Daybell.\n\nBefore Lori Daybell moved with her children to Rexburg, she indicated to Pastenes that Tylee was possessed by a dark spirit. Pastenes visited Rexburg and stayed in Cox's home in mid-September 2019 and asked Lori Daybell where Tylee was.\n\n\"She said, 'Um well, she had to be free,' meaning Tylee had to be free. And when I went to ask her to explain what that meant ... she put her hand against my face and said, 'Don't ask,'\" Pastenes testified.\n\nShe said she never received another explanation for where Tylee was. During the same trip, Pastenes said she was told JJ was \"being attacked by dark spirits,\" but that the spirits could not get to him and, instead, got to his dog. She said Melanie Gibb -- who at the time was Lori Daybell's best friend -- visited Rexburg shortly after her and told Pastenes that JJ had become a zombie.\n\nInvestigators believe Tylee and JJ were both killed in September 2019, and JJ was killed the weekend that Gibb visited Rexburg.\n\nPastenes said Chad and Lori Daybell were not around when she became engaged to Cox on Nov. 7, 2019, and she did not know where they were. She said she later received photos of them getting married in Hawaii around that time.\n\nShe said when she saw them on a layover in Arizona after their wedding, and drove them to the airport, they were \"acting like newlyweds\" and could not keep their hands away from each other. She said they were giggly and happy.\n\n\"I asked if they were in Hawaii, where was JJ at? And she told me that she had given JJ to Kay (Woodcock) to take care of him,\" Pastenes testified.\n\nShortly after their wedding, Pastenes testified that Cox stopped hearing from Chad and Lori Daybell and they did not answer his texts or calls. She said Cox told her, \"Can you believe that they're being such jerks ... after I helped them? Now, they don't even want to talk to me.\"\n\nPastenes testified that on Dec. 7, 2019, Cox felt fine in the morning but was sick by the evening. On Dec. 11, 2019, he received a call from Chad and Lori Daybell saying that Tammy Daybell's body was going to be exhumed.\n\nShe said this seemed strange so she asked Cox if he was tied to what happened to Tammy Daybell. She said he told her he was not, but she noticed a marked change in his demeanor after the phone call.\n\n\"I think I'm going to be their fall guy,\" Pastenes said her then-husband told her.\n\nShe said she was frustrated because he would not give her any clarification for that comment. Eventually, Pastenes said he told her \"Zulema, either I am a man of God or I am not.\"\n\nCox died one day later -- on Dec. 12, 2019 -- of what police determined to be natural causes.", "source": {"uri": "ksltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSLTV.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Tylee_Ryan_and_J._J._Vallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murders of Tylee Ryan and J.

He told them their choices \"might not make sense to the telestial world,\" referring to Earth, according to Pawlowski, but will \"make perfect sense\" in heaven, and also said angels were singing praises for their efforts.\n\nThe couple encouraged Melani and Ian Pawlowski to leave their home in Rexburg to avoid police.\n\n\"They're going to see you as the target since you're the only one that they really can find at this moment,\" Chad Daybell told Melani Pawlowski, urging her to move \"for your own sake, for your own sanity.\"\n\nMelani Pawlowski also testified about their religious beliefs and said she would look to Chad Daybell for answers, which would often come through her aunt.\n\n\"Chad was said to have a gift to spiritually discern,\" Powlowski testified. \"He could see light and dark -- or if a person had good intentions.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Tylee_Ryan_and_J._J._Vallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murders of Tylee Ryan and J.

It was one of the examples she gave explaining the influence he held over their fringe religious group.\n\n\"Chad was said to have a gift to spiritually discern,\" Powlowski said. \"He could see light and dark -- or if a person had good intentions.\"\n\nClick here for complete coverage of the Chad Daybell trial\n\nShe said she believes that it was Chad Daybell who eventually labeled both 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow as \"dark\" before their deaths.\n\nPawlowski said she met Chad Daybell in November 2018, about a year before he married her aunt. She said she would get advice from him through Lori Daybell and eventually became so close to the couple that she began referring to them as \"Mom and Dad.\"\n\nAt one point, she said Chad Daybell told her that her ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux, was tracking her car. When she later found out that was true, \"It validated a lot of the things he was saying, for me at least,\" she testified.\n\nPawlowski spoke about \"castings,\" which she said was an idea that was \"constantly changing\" as Chad and Lori Daybell added their own changes to information that initially came from a podcast by Julie Rowe, an author whose books were published through Chad Daybell's publishing company.\n\nLater, Pawlowski said she learned from Lori Daybell that some people were considered \"zombies,\" but she assumed the idea came from Chad Daybell.\n\n\"There was some type of darkness that you couldn't cast out. ... That person would pass away because the darkness was too much ... it overtook them,\" Pawlowski said, describing what she recalls being told about zombies.\n\nPawlowski said she traveled to Rexburg to visit Lori Daybell for one of the last weeks of September 2019 and did not see JJ or Tylee there. She testified that Lori Daybell told her Tylee was with a friend from BYU-Idaho, where she claimed her daughter was attending school, and JJ was with a nanny.\n\n\"I got a few different answers,\" Pawlowski said.\n\nShe said she received similar answers about where JJ and Tylee were when she traveled with Lori Daybell in October 2019 to both Missouri and Hawaii. She said Lori Daybell made phone calls during the trip, but she did not hear JJ or Tylee's voices in the background of those phone calls as Lori Daybell would speak on the phone with headphones.\n\nPawlowski said while they were in Hawaii, they learned that Chad Daybell's wife, Tammy Daybell, had died.\n\n\"(Lori Daybell) from what I could tell, seemed in a state of shock -- just surprised,\" she testified.\n\nShe said Lori Daybell traveled back to Idaho pretty quickly while she stayed behind in Hawaii. Later, she said she learned from Lori Daybell that Alex Cox, Pawlowski's uncle, was supposed to go on the trip to Hawaii but stayed in Idaho because \"Chad had something that he needed help with.\"\n\nAuthorities originally thought Tammy Daybell died from natural causes, but after her body was exhumed, an autopsy determined her death was the result of a homicide. Chad Daybell is charged with her murder.\n\nIan Pawlowski, Melani Pawlowski's husband, testified that he met Chad and Lori Daybell in November 2019, ahead of his wedding at the end of the month. He said he became concerned after hearing more about his wife's unusual religious beliefs on the night of the wedding.\n\nIan Pawlowski said a \"remote\" blessing he received from Chad and Lori Daybell seemed \"unorthodox,\" and he talked to his wife about that, but the weight and implications of it all didn't hit until later when Melanie Pawlowski shared her concerns about Tylee and JJ.\n\nHe said because of concerns for his two children and his ex-wife, he spoke with officers and began recording conversations for them that were played for jurors on Monday. One of the calls from December 2019 included Chad and Lori Daybell urging Melani and Ian Pawlowski to leave their home in Rexburg and go somewhere else.\n\nIan Pawlowski said Chad and Lori Daybell would call them and then \"disappear for a few days or a week at a time.\" He and his wife did not know where they were. He said they would speak about their dislike of police, and that Chad Daybell told Melani Pawlowski the police were tapping her phone.\n\nChad Daybell told the Pawlowskis he was worried that police \"are still watching you.\" In the call, Melani Pawlowski countered, saying police probably were watching, but she and her family were just doing their thing. Chad Daybell told her she needed to get out of the conflict.\n\n\"They're going to see you as the target since you're the only one that they really can find at this moment,\" Chad Daybell told her, urging her to move \"for your own sake, for your own sanity.\"\n\nOne of the people on the phone identified certain police officers in Rexburg who were \"the bad ones.\"\n\nDuring the phone call, they also talked about Melanie Gibb's decision to talk to police and confess that she lied to them about having JJ in her care; Lori Daybell said they could not trust her anymore.\n\nSome people in the conversation said Gibb was throwing all of them \"out of the bus,\" but Lori Daybell said she was not concerned because the police would not believe Gibb after she admitted to lying to them.\n\n\"It's bad for her in every way,\" Lori Daybell said. \"I don't see it going anywhere bad for any of us.\"\n\nMultiple blessings given remotely by Chad Daybell were played for the jurors. Ian Pawlowski said those blessings were typical.\n\nChad Daybell said in the blessings Ian and Melani Pawlowski will be used by the Lord, the Lord is pleased with them and they will be an example to \"thousands, even millions.\"\n\nChad Daybell told them in a blessing that their choices \"might not make sense to the telestial world,\" referring to Earth, according to Pawlowski, but will \"make perfect sense\" in heaven, and angels are singing praises for their efforts.\n\nIan Pawlowski said he understood that Chad and Lori Daybell intended to \"cleanse the earth\" of those who are possessed, or those who are dark.\n\nIn a call right after Alex Cox died, which was also played during the trial, Lori Daybell said she probably would not be coming to Arizona for a potential funeral for Cox, and she did not want anything from his house. She and Melani Pawlowski were laughing in the call, although Ian Pawlowski said his wife was upset.\n\nMelani Pawlowski says during the call that she doesn't want her former husband to know about Cox's death because she wants him to remain afraid of Alex Cox. Lori Daybell jokes that Cox will be \"handling the police from now on.\"\n\nLori Daybell then tells her niece Cox's mission was to protect them and he set it up so they both had a husband to protect them before he left.\n\nDuring this call, a blessing came from Lori Daybell as well. She tells Melani and Ian Pawlowski she is grateful they are \"powerful warriors on our team.\" She continues, \"That team has been dwindling. Of all the people that we trusted that we can count on you to be valiant faithful warriors.\"\n\nLater she says, \"You will both have the opportunity to love so many children and help so many children in this lifetime.\"\n\nPrior to the Pawlowskis' testimonies, FBI agent Steve Daniels, who testified Friday, continued his testimony about finding the bodies of JJ and Tylee behind Chad Daybell's home in Salem, Idaho.\n\nAttorneys brought physical evidence found at the scene to the courtroom on Friday, including a chain and a charm believed to have been Tylee's, as well as a shovel and a pick. On Monday, Daniels spoke specifically about the FBI's process for finding JJ's body. He said the ground nearby has taller grasses, but the existence of \"empty spots\" helped them choose where to dig.\n\nHe said they went layer by layer, and the jury was shown pictures of the stones or cement blocks they found that he said were \"precise.\" Daniels also said someone had taken time to cut tree roots in order to bury JJ in that location, near a tree.\n\nDaniels testified they found black plastic, and he took his hands to scrape dirt from around it. \"It just felt like this was a human head or skull that was inside that black plastic,\" he said.\n\nHe said they took a razor blade and cut through the layer of black plastic and then a layer of white plastic underneath, saw hair, and determined it was JJ's burial site. After locating JJ's body, he said investigators used a backhoe to search the area further because they had not yet located Tylee's body.\n\nChad Daybell is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of JJ and Tylee and his former wife, Tammy Daybell, in late 2019. He is also charged with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder of each of the victims, grand theft and two counts of insurance fraud.", "source": {"uri": "ksltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSLTV.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Tylee_Ryan_and_J._J._Vallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murders of Tylee Ryan and J.

He worked for the Rexburg Police Department, and gave testimony about phone data and information. Also on Friday, FBI Agent Steve Daniels took the stand as well.

He said the photos showed duct tape around his ankles, taping his hands and arms together, and covering his mouth.\n\nWhile the photos of JJ were shown, multiple jurors were crying and wiping their eyes.\n\nBruises were shown on JJ's right arm, and there were \"scratch-like abrasions\" on his neck. Warren said these show he could have been trying to get the bag off of his head.\n\nChad Daybell was also watching the images of JJ on the screen and occasionally shook his head back and forth.\n\nTylee's body was delivered in multiple bags, and Warren described photos of each bag. A brown paper bag contained multiple smaller brown paper bags with primarily charred bones and some pieces of flesh, he said.\n\nWarren testified there were multiple organs and bones he was able to identify, despite them being broken and charred, including her heart and lungs.\n\nWarren said he was able to obtain a sample to conduct a toxicology test on 16-year-old Tylee's remains, and they found she had levels of ibuprofen and caffeine in her system but nothing in the report that would explain her death.\n\nHe said FBI agents provided a deeper analysis of her bones and they discovered \"sharp force markings\" on them.\n\nHe said Tuesday that JJ had no evidence of natural diseases, and he did not believe any medical issues contributed to Tylee's death. Tylee's death was determined to be a \"homicide by unspecified means,\" and her body was dismembered and set on fire. Her autopsy took about a week.\n\nTara Martinez, a forensic scientist who responds to crime scenes, testified about analyzing the black plastic that was wrapped around JJ's body on Wednesday. She said she found a couple of latent prints -- also called hidden prints because they're usually not visible to the naked eye -- and matched them to Alex Cox, Lori Vallow Daybell's brother.\n\n\"I was not able to identify anyone else,\" Martinez said.\n\nTiming issues in reports of Charles Vallow's death\n\nChandler (Arizona) police detective Ariel Werther testified Wednesday about researching cellphone records from the day Charles Vallow, Lori Daybell's then-husband, was shot and killed by Cox. He said he searched for things that could verify pieces of the story they had been given by Lori Daybell and Cox, who claimed he fired the gun in self-defense.\n\nWerther said they analyzed Chad Daybell's phone records as well, although he was in Idaho at the time of the shooting death.\n\nHe said investigators wanted to verify information such as Lori Daybell's reports that directly after her husband was killed, she went to a Burger King, a drug store to pick up flip-flops and to JJ's school.\n\nWerther said detectives \"pretty quickly noticed\" there was a timing issue.\n\nHe testified 911 was called at 8:36 a.m. on July 11, 2019, and Lori Daybell returned to the home at 8:48 a.m. He said most 911 calls are made \"fairly quickly\" after a shooting and said Lori Daybell told investigators she was at the home when her husband was shot and killed. That was before she drove to the multiple errands, but she was back at the house 12 minutes after 911 was called.\n\nWerther said cellphone records placed Charles Vallow's phone -- which Lori Daybell claimed she had in her car while driving JJ to school -- at a Burger King close to Lori Daybell's home about 7:55 that morning. He said video at the Burger King shows Lori Daybell driving through the drive-thru at 7:54 a.m.\n\nWerther said Charles Vallow's phone was near one Walgreens at 8:08 a.m. and then at another Walgreens at 8:16 a.m. Footage shows Lori Daybell purchasing sandals, as she had reported saying they left the home too quickly to grab shoes. At 8:32 a.m., the phone was located at JJ's school, and it arrived back at Lori Daybell's home at the same time she arrived.\n\nBased on his investigation, Werther said it's likely that Charles Vallow's phone arrived at Lori Daybell's home about 7:32 a.m. and left about 7:50 a.m. in the possession of Lori Daybell.\n\nWerther said if Lori Daybell left after Charles Vallow was killed, \"then there's at least a 45-minute delay between that event and 911 being called.\" He said the other possibility is that Lori Daybell was not at her home when her husband was shot as she claimed.\n\nHe said Lori and Chad Daybell communicated with each other throughout that day, starting in the 6 a.m. hour, but the information in their texts or calls is unavailable.\n\nChad Daybell is on trial for first-degree murder in the deaths of Lori Daybell's children, JJ and Tylee, and the death of his former wife, Tammy Daybell, in late 2019. He is also charged with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder of each of the victims, grand theft and two counts of insurance fraud.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Tylee_Ryan_and_J._J._Vallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murders of Tylee Ryan and J.

Over several hours on the witness stand in Idaho, Ms. Pawlowski described the cult-like beliefs of Vallow and her fifth husband, 'doomsday prophet' Chad Daybell, which, prosecutors say, increasingly dominated Lori and Chad's beliefs leading up to the murders of Lori's two young children and Chad's first wife.\n\nIt's the latest in a weeks-long trial for Chad, who is accused of being behind a string of murders underscored by his Doomsday beliefs and an unquenchable thirst for \"sex, money, and power,\" as prosecutors put it, in a case where he could face the death penalty if convicted.\n\nLori is already serving a double life sentence after she was found guilty last year for murdering two of her three children -- Tylee Ryan, 16, and JJ Vallow, 7, who was adopted - and conspiring to kill Chad's late first wife, Tammy Daybell, 49. Lori is also facing another murder trial, in Arizona, for the murder of her estranged fourth husband, Charles Vallow.\n\nChad is also facing an insurance fraud charge for supposedly cashing in on Tammy's life insurance policy when she died just weeks before he ran off to Hawaii to marry Lori.\n\n(When Tammy died in October of 2019, Chad claimed she had died peacefully in her sleep after a long illness. Prosecutors now say she was suffocated to death, possibly by Lori's loyal brother, Alex Cox.)\n\nProsecutors in Idaho and Arizona say Chad and Lori, who met in 2018, murdered or plotted to murder her children, their spouses and other family members so they could be together and also collect on life insurance policies and Social Security benefits of their victims.\n\nOn Monday -- the 17th day of Chad's trial -- Lori's niece, Ms. Pawlowski, said that she at one point looked up to Lori as a mother figure, and she also developed a close relationship with Chad, even calling him \"Dad.\" Melani was a member of a close circle, led by Chad, which focused on Chad's heretical beliefs, for which he had been excommunicated from the Latter Day Saints church.\n\n\"Chad was said to have a gift to spiritually discern and he could see light and dark or if a person had good intentions,\" she said, adding that he had a pendant or pendulum that could give him answers to things he wanted to know. She also participated in castings, she said, which she described as raising one's right hand to cast our demons or dark spirits.\n\nThe couple's disturbing cases have gained worldwide notoriety, in part, because of their religious extremism. They first got national attention in September, 2019 when JJ's grandparent Kay and Larry Woodcock, reported him missing, and Lori and Chad were found vacationing in Hawaii, now married, without a care in the world.\n\nOver the ensuing months, media coverage detailed how Chad and Lori divided people into \"light\" and \"dark\" categories and believed that some of their family members had become possessed by zombies. Chad himself authored books about the end of the world and the second-coming of Jesus Christ.\n\nIt took ten months, during which Lori was arrested in Hawaii and extradited back to Idaho, where she sat in jail refusing to reveal the kids' whereabouts, before the bodies of JJ and Tylee, daughter of Lori and her late third husband, Joe Ryan, were found in a pet cemetery and pond in Chad's backyard.\n\nMelani said that Lori and Chad taught her that \"you could cast out at any time for anybody if you felt like you're being inflicted with some type of dark spirit or a bad feeling,\" she said.\n\nShe said that the couple's teachings about \"casting\" were always changing but originated from a podcast from Julie Rowe, a clairvoyant and doomsday prophetess who would later claim that Chad forcibly kissed her and rubbed up lewdly against her during an \"energy healing session\".\n\nMelani said she would ask Chad about who was \"dark and light\" and that she later learned that people who were possessed were \"zombies.\"\n\nShe testified that she was also taught that \"there was some type of darkness that you couldn't cast out and so the Lord in his due time would have to take, that person would pass away because this darkness was too much.\"\n\nSome of these \"dark\" individuals doomed to die, prosecutors allege, were the murder victims. Chad believed Tammy was possessed by a spirit named \"Viola\", and Lori told her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, that he was possed by a spirit named \"Ned Schneider\". Texts between Chad and Lori played at Lori's trial showed they believed Tylee and JJ were \"dark\" and possessed by zombies.\n\nMs. Pawlowski said that Lori and Chad told her not to speak with law enforcement, describing police as \"corrupt\" and that they\"couldn't be trusted.\" She said they told her that several law enforcement officers were \"dark.\"\n\nLast week, the jury saw evidence reportedly so graphic that it was blocked from the trial's livestream. Some of the graphic evidence were photos of Tammy Daybell's body, which was exhumed after being buried from two months.\n\nLast week the jury also heard explosive testimony from family members, including Chad's mother, Sheila Daybell and his sister-in-law, Heather Daybell.\n\nSheila testified on Thursday that she had never even heard of Lori before meeting Lori and Chad at a restaurant in 2019, when she noticed they were wearing rings and found out they were married. She described the news as \"shocking.\"\n\nHeather, who is married to Chad's brother Matt Daybell, described feeling \"uneasy\" and \"concerned\" about Chad and his \"end-of-days\" visions. She testified that she was uncomfortable about the prospect of Chad moving near their family, and said Chad began discussing disturbing visions including an earthquake that he thought would come in 2015 and cause destruction across Utah.\n\nSome people say it was these religious beliefs that led to multiple murders allegedly committed on the couple's behalf, but prosecutors are currently trying to convince the jury it was ultimately a \"desire for sex, money, and power\" that was to blame.\n\nLori will eventually face another trial in Arizona for two counts of conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the deaths of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and the attempted murder of Brandon Boudreaux, the ex-husband of Lori's niece, Melani Pawlowski, who subscribed to Lori and Chad's extreme religious circles but has since turned on Lori after remarrying.\n\nLori's brother, Alex Cox. shot and killed Charles in 2019, claiming it was self defense. Prosecutors now say Lori orchestrated the murder. Prosecutors also say that Alex, on Lori's orders, shot at Brandon while he was driving, narrowly missing him, during a time when Brandon was in an ugly custody dispute with Melani.\n\nAs prosecutors push for Chad's conviction, Tylee and JJ's loved ones tried to honor the children's memories with a celebration of life in East Idaho earlier this month.\n\n\"Until the day we meet again, I'm going to do what I have to do in this world to get to heaven,\" Todd Trahan shared during the service via call. \"Tell everyone that is there with you hi and that I love them.\"\n\nTodd, JJ's biological father, is currently in prison. JJ, who would eventually be diagnosed with autism, was adopted by Lori and Charles, JJ's biological uncle, in 2013, less than a year after his birth because both of his biological parents, Todd and Charles' niece, Mandy Leger, suffered from substance abuse disorders and JJ was born addicted to drugs.\n\n\"JJ was amazing, and Tylee was his protector,\" Larry shared at the event.\n\nTylee's cousin, Zac Cox, showed exactly how close Tylee and JJ were via a heart-wrenching letter read at the memorial.\n\n\"Tylee was the best big sister she could be to JJ and he was always number one on her list of priorities,\" the letter read. \"She loved JJ more than anything.\n\nSo far, we've heard a variety of testimony. Worthy of note, was that of Lori's oldest son, Colby Ryan, the son of Lori and her second husband, William Lagiola. Colby said the last time he saw his late adopted brother and half-sister was on August 30, 2019, outside his place of employment. Tylee and JJ's remains were discovered on June 9, 2020.\n\nColby didn't know he was saying goodbye for the last time during that meet up. But he did say that Lori called him earlier that day to tell him she was moving away with JJ and Tylee. Colby said Tylee was crying and Lori did not say where they were going (Rexburg, Idaho) when he met them outside to say goodbye.\n\nColby also testified about his stepfather Charles' death on July 11, 2019, saying that Lori told him Charles had died of a heart attack. But when he came over after work and hugged a crying Tylee, he saw Alex sitting on the couch with a bandaged head. When he asked about the injury, Alex explained that he had shot Charles in self-defense after Charles had hit him. Colby then asked his mother about her lie, but she allegedly responded in an \"unrattled\" and \"calm\" way. Believing she was influenced by Chad, Colby said Lori never did say why she told the lie.\n\n\"I thought it was crazy because I was freaking out and she seemed to not care,\" Colby said in court. \"There was a lot of lying in a lot of places.\"\n\nAlex, an amateur standup comedian, died on December 12, 2019 of \"natural causes\" which were later determined to be blood clots in the lungs. If he hadn't passed away, it is likely Alex would have faced a similar fate as his sister since prosecutors think he may have carried out all of Lori and Chad's killings.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abigail_seaberg@nysun.com", "name": "Abigail Seaberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Tylee_Ryan_and_J._J._Vallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murders of Tylee Ryan and J.

These photos were shown to the jury but not to members of the public in the courtroom.\n\nWarren said 7-year-old JJ was suffocated by duct tape and bags that had been placed on his head. He said the photos showed duct tape around his ankles, taping his hands and arms together, and covering his mouth.\n\nWhile the photos of JJ were shown, multiple jurors were crying and wiping their eyes.\n\nClick here for complete coverage of the Chad Daybell trial\n\nBruises were shown on JJ's right arm, and there were \"scratch-like abrasions\" on his neck. Warren said these show he could have been trying to get the bag off of his head.\n\nChad Daybell was also watching the images of JJ on the screen and occasionally shook his head back and forth.\n\nTylee's body was delivered in multiple bags, and Warren described photos of each bag. A brown paper bag contained multiple smaller brown paper bags with primarily charred bones and some pieces of flesh, he said.\n\nWarren testified there were multiple organs and bones he was able to identify, despite them being broken and charred, including her heart and lungs.\n\nWidow describes fringe religious teachings from Chad and Lori Daybell surrounding 3 deaths\n\nWarren said he was able to obtain a sample to conduct a toxicology test on 16-year-old Tylee's remains, and they found she had levels of ibuprofen and caffeine in her system but nothing in the report that would explain her death.\n\nHe said FBI agents provided a deeper analysis of her bones and they discovered \"sharp force markings\" on them.\n\nHe said Tuesday that JJ had no evidence of natural diseases, and he did not believe any medical issues contributed to Tylee's death. Tylee's death was determined to be a \"homicide by unspecified means,\" and her body was dismembered and set on fire. Her autopsy took about a week.\n\nTara Martinez, a forensic scientist who responds to crime scenes, testified about analyzing the black plastic that was wrapped around JJ's body on Wednesday. She said she found a couple of latent prints -- also called hidden prints because they're usually not visible to the naked eye -- and matched them to Alex Cox, Lori Vallow Daybell's brother.\n\n\"I was not able to identify anyone else,\" Martinez said.\n\nChandler (Arizona) police detective Ariel Werther testified Wednesday about researching cellphone records from the day Charles Vallow, Lori Daybell's then-husband, was shot and killed by Cox. He said he searched for things that could verify pieces of the story they had been given by Lori Daybell and Cox, who claimed he fired the gun in self-defense.\n\nWerther said they analyzed Chad Daybell's phone records as well, although he was in Idaho at the time of the shooting death.\n\nHe said investigators wanted to verify information such as Lori Daybell's reports that directly after her husband was killed, she went to a Burger King, a drug store to pick up flip-flops and to JJ's school.\n\nWerther said detectives \"pretty quickly noticed\" there was a timing issue.\n\nHe testified 911 was called at 8:36 a.m. on July 11, 2019, and Lori Daybell returned to the home at 8:48 a.m. He said most 911 calls are made \"fairly quickly\" after a shooting and said Lori Daybell told investigators she was at the home when her husband was shot and killed. That was before she drove to the multiple errands, but she was back at the house 12 minutes after 911 was called.\n\nWerther said cellphone records placed Charles Vallow's phone -- which Lori Daybell claimed she had in her car while driving JJ to school -- at a Burger King close to Lori Daybell's home about 7:55 that morning. He said video at the Burger King shows Lori Daybell driving through the drive-thru at 7:54 a.m.\n\nWerther said Charles Vallow's phone was near one Walgreens at 8:08 a.m. and then at another Walgreens at 8:16 a.m. Footage shows Lori Daybell purchasing sandals, as she had reported saying they left the home too quickly to grab shoes. At 8:32 a.m. the phone was located at JJ's school, and it arrived back at Lori Daybell's home at the same time she arrived.\n\nBased on his investigation, Werther said it's likely that Charles Vallow's phone arrived at Lori Daybell's home about 7:32 a.m. and left about 7:50 a.m. in the possession of Lori Daybell.\n\nWerther said if Lori Daybell left after Charles Vallow was killed, \"then there's at least a 45-minute delay between that event and 911 being called.\" He said the other possibility is that Lori Daybell was not at her home when her husband was shot as she claimed.\n\nHe said Lori and Chad Daybell communicated with each other throughout that day, starting in the 6 a.m. hour, but the information in their texts or calls is unavailable.\n\nChad Daybell is on trial for first-degree murder in the deaths of Lori Daybell's children, JJ and Tylee, and the death of his former wife, Tammy Daybell, in late 2019. He is also charged with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder of each of the victims, grand theft and two counts of insurance fraud.", "source": {"uri": "ksltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSLTV.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Tylee_Ryan_and_J._J._Vallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murders of Tylee Ryan and J.

The next day, officers came back with search warrants, finding Chad and Lori Daybell in their vehicle.\n\nNesbitt testified about items they found, including a debit card belonging to Tylee, an iPad with \"JJ\" written on it, 17 copies of Charles Vallow's death certificate, some birth certificates and $10,500 in cash. He said they also found two laptops in a backpack, four credit cards belonging to Chad Daybell and other documents.\n\nThis was about two months after police had begun searching for the two missing children. Their remains were later found in Chad Daybell's backyard in Salem, Idaho.\n\nBenjamin Dean, an FBI intelligence analyst, said he was tasked with reviewing about 600 to 800 tips sent by the public in March 2020 after a public request was made for information from anyone who had been to Yellowstone National Park around Sept. 8, 2019 -- the day Tylee was last seen. He said some were just texts, but many had attached photos and videos.\n\nDean also reviewed electronic devices seized from Chad Daybell's home in January 2020, including his deceased wife Tammy Daybell's phone.\n\nHe said one specific text was \"longer and more detailed\" than any of the other messages between Tammy and Chad Daybell, and said Chad Daybell described his actions \"with some amount of care.\"\n\n\"This message was the only one that was on this device in which Chad wrote to Tammy such a lengthy and detailed explanation of his day's events,\" Dean said.\n\nThe text said: \"I've had an interesting morning! I felt I should burn all of the limb debris by the fire pit before it got too soaked by the coming storm. While I did so, I spotted a big raccoon along the fence. I hurried and got my gun, and he was still walking along. I got close enough that one shot did the trick. He is now in our pet cemetery. Fun times!\"\n\nA second text said: \"Gonna shower now and then go write for a while at BYU. Love you.\" Tammy Daybell's response a few hours later was: \"Good for you.\"\n\nHe said the date of the message caught his attention, since it was one day after the day he knew Tylee and JJ had been at Yellowstone with their family.\n\nTylee's body was ultimately found in the pet cemetery, as other witnesses have testified during the trial.\n\nKatherine Dace, a forensic biologist with the Idaho State Police, testified about her findings after evaluating items found on Chad Daybell's property, along with the children's bodies.\n\nThis included human remains found on tools that were carried into the courtroom, and Dace showed the jury where on the tools the remains -- ashes and blood -- were found. She said human remains on a shovel matched Tylee's DNA, and remains on a pick ax had a partial DNA profile that also matched Tylee.\n\nTape and plastic wrapped around JJ's body tested positive for blood, and she said decomposition fluid often has blood. A hair found near JJ, she said, was very likely Lori Daybell's hair.\n\nDace said she tested 18 tools, and nine of those tested positive for blood. But she said the tools did not have enough blood to conduct further DNA testing.\n\nShe said they did not test the handles of the shovels for trace DNA from the people who might have been using them because that was not requested and is typically not done unless the ownership of the tools is disputed. She said likely Chad Daybell's DNA would be found there, but she would expect any of his family's DNA to be on the tools \"through noncriminal means.\"\n\nThree women who worked with Tammy Daybell testified at the end of the day on Thursday, each saying she was healthy right up until the day before her death.\n\nJanet Andersen said Tammy Daybell was friendly, and was friends with everyone. \"She was the Energizer bunny ... she just never quit,\" Andersen said. \"She just wasn't ever sick. She never had a cough or a sniffle or a limp or anything that I noticed.\"\n\nTammy Gee, a kindergarten teacher at the elementary school where Tammy Daybell worked as a librarian, said she spoke to her the day before she died and did not see any health issues. She said she was \"shocked\" when she heard about the death.\n\nPamela Peebles said Tammy Daybell knew each child at the school by name and was a good friend and co-worker. She also testified she was shocked when she heard about Tammy Daybell's death and said the woman had recently told her she felt like she was \"in the best health of her life.\"", "source": {"uri": "ksltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSLTV.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Tylee_Ryan_and_J._J._Vallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murders of Tylee Ryan and J.

In both, mothers had a view of their children that was seen as somehow demonic.\n\nLori Vallow Daybell and Ruby Franke are two moms who were both members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nRELATED: Lori Vallow Daybell sentenced to life in prison for murder of two children, husband's late wife\n\n\"They went from being ordinary to having extreme views and then doing horrendous criminal acts,\" USU Professor of Religious Studies and History, Patrick Mason, said.\n\nPublic Defender and Content Creator Natalie Wittingham-Burrell has a YouTube channel.\n\nRELATED: Ruby Franke, Jodi Hildebrandt receive consecutive prison terms for aggravated child abuse\n\nShe said a major similarity she noticed between both women was their belief that \"children have the ability to be overtaken by demons because of activity in past life, or just the behavior in children is somehow seen as demonic.\"\n\nIn Franke's journal, she wrote, \"I will not feed a demon.\" She referred to her children as \"sinful\" and \"manipulative.\"\n\nFranke told her husband in a recorded jailhouse phone call, \"Adults have a really hard time understanding that children can be full of evil and what that takes to fight it.\"\n\nWhile testifying in court, Vallow Daybell's former friend Melanie Gibb told jurors Vallow Daybell would refer to some people as being \"possessed\" or as \"zombies.\"\n\nShe testified that Vallow Daybell told her people who were light: had signed contracts with \"the Savior\" -- and people who were dark: had signed contracts with \"Satan.\"\n\nWittingham-Burrell felt both women talked about the need to \"get rid of this evil.\"\n\n\"They each developed this way of removing the demons from the children,\" Wittingham-Burrell said. \"With Daybell, it was these seances, where they would do this type of spirit work to remove the spirits from the children; it was not hands-on. With Franke, it was physical trials to remove the demons from the children, essentially torture of the children to remove these perceived demons from them.\"\n\nProfessor Mason said this is not part of the LDS faith. \"In both these cases, we also saw them importing ideas from other places,\" he said.\n\nDuring all this, Wittingham-Burrell felt both women isolated their children from the communities they were in.\n\nVallow Daybell and Chad Daybell moved her children to Rexburg, Idaho. When investigators interviewed Ruby Franke's husband, Kevin Franke, he said he was kicked out. Franke and her youngest children were also staying at Hildebrandt's house in Ivins, Utah.\n\nInvestigators asked Kevin Franke, \"You haven't seen any of your kids in over a year, you said?\"\n\n\"That's correct,\" Kevin Franke responded.\n\nWittingham-Burrell said the argument can be made that a lot of commonalities between Franke and Vallow Daybell seem to be found in a book called, \"Visions of Glory.\"\n\nThe cover of the book says, \"A man's astonishing account of the last days.\"\n\n\"They believe they must prepare for the end of the world. That there will only be a limited amount of people who will survive the apocalypse essentially,\" Wittingham-Burrell said. \"Chad Daybell said Rexburg, Idaho will be the place where people should go to survive the end of the world . . . With Ruby Franke and Jodi Hildebrandt, in Ruby Franke's writing, she talks about the urgency with which Hildebrandt says they need to get away from the rest of the world, with what is to come . . . There's mention of moving out-of-state. They move away and they isolate, and then the most vulnerable amongst them get harmed.\"\n\nLicensed psychologist and content creator Patrice Berry covered cases on social media that involve children and/or trauma.\n\n\"I think they heard a message that then was weaponized against children,\" she said. \"There are a lot of power-and-control dynamics . . . They seem to think they have this calling that is unique. In both cases, in my opinion, their own needs, their own desires, kind of clouded their judgement, and they turned on their children . . . What they believed God was telling them, might have been what they wanted.\"\n\nBerry also noted the physical characteristics that Vallow Daybell and Ruby Franke might have benefitted from.\n\n\"In both of their cases, they were also traditionally beautiful,\" Berry said. \"You can't judge somebody based on what they look like. Somebody can look great, and they can be engaging in harmful behaviors.\"", "source": {"uri": "kfdm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KFDM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Tylee_Ryan_and_J._J._Vallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murders of Tylee Ryan and J.

We are sharing an updated version version today given the testimony of Zulema Pastenes in Chad Daybell's murder trial. You can read more about her testimony here.\n\nBOISE -- The day after Alex Cox and Zulema Pastenes were married in Las Vegas, he offered to give her a massage.\n\nIt was Saturday, Nov. 30, 2019 in the middle of the day. Cox, a massage therapist, had never given Pastenes a massage and said they needed to go to Walmart first to buy a large plastic drop cloth commonly used for painting projects.\n\nThey purchased the item, returned to their room and he spread the cloth over the bed. Pastenes remembers lying down and quickly falling asleep.\n\n\"I was really, really (relaxed) - like when you're trying to wake up and can't,\" Pastenes recalled. \"I was thinking, 'Why am I so relaxed and can't wake up?' I was in and out and could hear him talking and I was like, 'Who is he talking to?'\"\n\nPastenes said it sounded like Cox was chatting with somebody on the phone in the bathroom. When she was finally able to wake herself up, she asked her new husband who he had been talking to.\n\n\"He's like, 'Nobody. I was talking to myself,'\" Pastenes said.\n\nShe took a bath and then suggested to Cox that they should watch a movie together. He was doing something on his phone and acted \"super quiet.\"\n\n\"Alex is usually joking and he would find a way to turn things into a joke. He was always making you laugh but he said nothing for the rest of the evening,\" Pastenes said. \"I asked if he was ok and he said, 'I'm just tired.' The fact he was quiet and said nothing - that's so not Alex. Alex is not quiet.\"\n\nPastenes explained the unusual events of that day to detectives from the Rexburg Police Department and Fremont County Sheriff's Office who met with her for two hours this past April in Arizona. The interview, which you can watch in its entirety at the end of this story, was videotaped and part of several recordings, documents, videos and other files released in Oct. 2021 from the Chandler Police Department.\n\nRELATED | Arizona police release gigabytes of never before seen videos in Daybell investigation\n\nThe department has been investigating the death of Charles Vallow, Lori Vallow Daybell's fourth husband who was shot and killed by Cox in July 2019. Lori married Chad Daybell four months later, weeks after Chad's wife, Tammy Daybell, died in her sleep.\n\nLori's two children, Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow and Tylee Ryan, were found buried on Chad's property in June 2020. Chad is currently on trial in Ada County on multiple charges in connection to JJ, Tylee and Tammy's deaths. Lori was found guilty in May 2023 and is serving three life sentences without the possibility of parole. Police reports suggest Cox was involved in the deaths of JJ, Tylee and Tammy. Lori has also been indicted in Arizona for conspiracy to commit murder in Charles's death.\n\nRELATED | Messages reveal romantic relationship between Chad and Lori Daybell before Tammy Daybell's death\n\nThe detectives met with Pastenes and her attorney Garrett Smith to follow up on earlier statements she had made to them in regards to Chad, Lori and Cox.\n\n\"At the time (of the massage), I had no question about it,\" she told them. \"There was not enough oil for a drop cloth (and) now I'm like, 'Why would you necessitate a whole drop cloth all over the bed to give me a massage?' That doesn't make any sense to me at all ... Maybe I'm just a little too crazy because of all the stuff that's happened, but in the back of my mind I keep thinking that who was on the phone was Chad and Lori and that was supposed to be my last day.\"\n\nPastenes doesn't remember eating or drinking anything unusual that afternoon and said it was the only time Cox ever gave her a massage.\n\nLess than two weeks later, on Dec. 12, 2019, her husband died of natural causes, according to a medical examiner. An autopsy report indicates Cox had blood clots wedged into the arteries of his lungs. He was 51.\n\n\"Like one or two days before he passed, he said to me, 'Zulema, if anything happens to me, I want you to know that there is money in a bag in the closet and it's for you. It's not much but it's for you,'\" Pastenes told police in the video released this week. \"I said, 'Don't say things like that Alex. Why would you say something like that?' He said, 'Just in case.'\"\n\nPastenes explained there was a black duffle bag in the closet. Inside was a plastic Ziploc bag holding five to seven thousand dollars and next to it was headphones, a phone and a gun in a case. The phone was seized by police but Pastenes told detectives she still has the duffle bag and everything else in it.\n\nThe day before Cox died, Pastenes said Lori and Chad called her husband to tell him Tammy Daybell's body was being exhumed from the Springville Evergreen Cemetery in Utah.\n\n\"The way they were talking - they weren't really saying anything like they were worried or anything like that,\" Pastenes said. \"I (had) a feeling that this was really weird ... I knew if I asked Lori and Chad about it, they probably wouldn't say anything. But I thought if they had done anything, Alex would probably tell me.\"\n\nPastenes told police that months earlier, Chad had said Tammy was going to die in a car accident on a trip to Utah. Tammy visited her family in Springville by herself in early October 2019, but made it home safely to Rexburg.\n\n\"Chad said she did pass away but she was taken over by an evil spirit. In the back of my mind, here I am thinking they said the same thing about Charles and then Charles ended up being shot,\" Pastenes said.\n\nTwo weeks after the Utah trip, Tammy died in her sleep. Tammy and Chad's five children said last month they were told by investigators their mother died of asphyxiation.\n\nAfter Cox got off the phone with Chad and Lori, Pastenes asked if he had anything to do with Tammy's death.\n\n\"He goes, 'No.' That's it. Nothing else. I was waiting for him to say something else. So I'm like, 'Ok...Are you going to say anything else?' (He replied) 'No,'\" Pastenes said.\n\nShe explained to investigators that Cox \"seemed so sure\" of his answer that she didn't think he was involved. She stood up and began walking away when he said something that made her stop.\n\n\"He said, 'I think I am being their fall guy.' I asked him, 'Fall guy for what? What is it they are trying to pin on you? What did they do?' He didn't want to say anything,\" Pastenes said. A few minutes later, Cox looked at her and said, \"Either I am a man of God or I am not.\"\n\nThe next day, Cox was dead.\n\nPastenes told detectives she doesn't know if Alex made changes to life insurance policies before he died \"but Lori would.\"\n\nPastenes shared with detectives that she, Cox, Chad, Lori and others closely associated with them would often use code words in conversation. \"Pretty bird\" was the phrase used when it was not safe to talk and \"not happy Bob\" was the code for when things were ok.\n\nShe said after Chad and Lori got married, they would not say where they were \"for her protection\" and Pastenes assumed they were in Utah when they were actually living in Hawaii. They constantly told her she was special and needed to be cared for above anyone else. Before she and Cox were engaged, Chad and Lori strongly encouraged the relationship. Chad gave her a spiritual blessing telling her to marry Cox so her \"mission could be fulfilled.\"\n\nPastenes told investigators she loved Cox and they spent hours on the phone discussing scriptures. Cox \"doted\" over Pastenes and she believes the two were truly in love.\n\n\"I don't know if someone could actually fake it that well. If I didn't love somebody, I don't know if I could be that doting over that person. I couldn't fake it. Maybe he could and if he could fake it, he was a really good faker,\" she said.\n\nPastenes has spent a lot of time thinking about the events of the past two years. She told detectives that if she had moved to Idaho, like Chad and Lori pressured her to do, she isn't sure if she would be alive today.\n\n\"I now (see) that they had a real nefarious plan to do something to me or Alex or that we were the final piece to move to Rexburg and by the grace of God, I didn't move there,\" she said. \"I dodged a bullet by not moving to Rexburg. Now more than ever I think ... Was Alex being true? Was he lying? Was he being told what to do? Did he really have a relationship with me (or) was he just following what Chad and Lori were telling him? ... I ask myself whether these people are insane or they're just led by evil.\"", "source": {"uri": "eastidahonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Idaho News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nate_eaton@eastidahonews.com", "name": "Nate Eaton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Tylee_Ryan_and_J._J._Vallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murders of Tylee Ryan and J.

The first flights to Jerez will take off from BHX in summer 2025. The picturesque region in southern Spain is best-known for its wines, horses and flamenco dancing, but it's also home to pretty plazas, gorgeous old buildings, tapas bars, seafood restaurants and authentic Spanish charm. Jerez is often overlooked by tourists in favour of the country's more popular holiday hotspots, but there's plenty to do in this unspoiled corner of Andalusia. The city is also quite affordable to visit, with cost of living database Numbeo listing domestic draught beer in Jerez at just \u00a31.90 and a meal at an inexpensive restaurant at just over \u00a310.

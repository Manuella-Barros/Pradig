Amid the holiday festivities at sister Kim Kardashian's opulent estate, the 44-year-old reality star and POOSH founder proudly flaunted her avant-garde fashion choices per DAILY MAIL. This came shortly after welcoming a baby boy named Rocky into the world with her husband, Travis Barker. In contrast to the pantsless trend that has been making waves, Kardashian confidently embraced a sultry look that omitted traditional pants. Despite giving birth seven weeks prior, she exuded energy and vitality at the star-studded holiday soiree. While opting for a floor-length black fur coat, her sisters didn't shy away from the glamour that has become synonymous with their style. Kylie Jenner, always a trendsetter, donned a golden sparkling custom Dolce & Gabbana gown that perfectly complemented her evolving fashion sensibilities. Meanwhile, mom Kris Jenner stole the spotlight in a golden halter gown featuring a black skirt and matching opera gloves. Kim Kardashian, the evening hostess, went all out by transforming her lavish California mansion into a winter wonderland with artificial snow. In line with the festive atmosphere, Kim and her sisters embraced their own interpretations of holiday couture. Notably, the Kardashian-Jenner clan's holiday celebration unfolded just weeks after Kardashian gave birth to her fourth child. Despite the recent addition to her family, the new mum didn't let the demands of motherhood hinder her from making a glamorous appearance at the family event. Earlier in the week, Kardashian shared a significant milestone with her followers by documenting her 'first day at the gym' since welcoming baby Rocky. She took to Instagram stories sharing that it's no competition to get back in shape as it's a steady process as she promoted a healthy and balanced approach to postpartum recovery. Recently Kardashian shared glimpses of her son Reign Disick's extravagant 9th birthday celebration on her Instagram Stories. The birthday bash kicked off with Kourtney strolling past the towering Christmas tree inside her home, setting the festive mood. She expressed birthday wishes to her son, Reign, with a video set to Michael Bubl\u00e9\u2019s Holly Jolly Christmas. Stepping into the outdoor scene, the camera panned to reveal a lavish table adorned with meticulously wrapped gifts and a conspicuous Neiman Marcus bag. Kourtney's chic knee-high black boots took center stage as she presented the birthday treasures. Interestingly, it became evident that Reign played a significant role in orchestrating his celebration\u2014an aspect emphasized by Kourtney in her Instagram captions. The outdoor merriment peaked as children gleefully bounced on three massive bouncy castles, with one cleverly designed in the shape of the Millennium Falcon, paying homage to the beloved Star Wars film series.", "summary": "<img alt=\"When Kourtney Kardashian Donned a &#39;NO Pants Look&#39; For Family Christmas Eve, Weeks After Giving Birth\" src=\"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/665419/uploads/080860d0-a3bc-11ee-979f-3949a3b17bb4_800_420.jpeg\" />\n                Kourtney Kardashian made the appearance after welcoming a baby boy named Rocky into the world with her husband, Travis Barker.", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/kourtney-kardashian-stuns-in-a-no-pants-look-for-family-christmas-eve-weeks-after-giving-birth-665419", "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/665419/uploads/080860d0-a3bc-11ee-979f-3949a3b17bb4_1200_630.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:11:41", "author": "INQUISITR,Tavishi", "authors": ["INQUISITR", "Tavishi"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.829}

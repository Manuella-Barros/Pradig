(Photo by Xavier Laine/Getty Images) Getty Images The American businessman John Textor has shown an interest in buying Everton Football Club, commenting, \"Everyone should want to buy Everton right now.\u201d Textor, who made his name in digital industries including virtual reality studios and the streaming platform, Fubo TV, already has numerous interests in soccer, acquired since he became a co-owner of Crystal Palace in 2021. The nickname of the English club based in South London, the Eagles, may have influenced the name of the multi-club soccer ownership group Eagle Football Holdings, of which Textor is the founder and chairman. The group also owns stakes in other soccer clubs including Brazilian Serie A side Botafogo of Rio de Janeiro and French Ligue 1 club Olympique Lyonnais. Textor recently revealed that he may be looking to sell his stake in Palace and buy an English club outright, which is when Everton\u2019s name came up. \u201cYes [I\u2019ve had conversations around buying Everton], with the existing constituents \u2013 different groups, different lenders, different equity holders,\u201d Textor told the New York Times via the Athletic. \u201cI\u2019m watching it, but 777 still has a contract. There are people that are close to the club, who care a lot about it, who are also investing.\u201d MORE FOR YOU Apple Brings Back iPhone 14 Pro For First Time\u2014At Lower Price, Refurbished Trump Trial Prosecutor Ends Closing Argument After Nearly 5 Hours\u2014Jury Instructions Set For Wednesday Trump Lashes Out At Robert De Niro After Actor Calls Him A Tyrant Outside Courthouse Everton\u2019s potential sale to the troubled investment company 777 Partners has been dragging on for some time but is set to end at the end of May, and at this point, it seems almost certain it will not end with 777 buying the club. This will leave Everton owner Farhad Moshiri free to entertain offers from other parties, of which it appears Textor would be one but for his involvement with Crystal Palace. Though Textor\u2019s shares in Palace are up for sale, the overlap of the time it takes for those to be sold and the Everton owner once again being open to offers could be an obstacle to any offer at this moment in time, as rules prohibit ownership of two clubs in the same league at the same time. That has not prevented Textor from speaking about how much of an opportunity he believes buying a club like Everton would represent, and stating his intent to the point where Everton may be interested in working something out. \u201cEverton represents the best of English football: the struggles, the glory, the want,\u201d Textor added. \u201cI love that it\u2019s out of London. Everybody should want to buy Everton right now. That kind of club is what I\u2019m referring to. \u201cHow great would it be to take one of these great English clubs back to sort of glory? \u201cI suspect the problem with Everton is it won\u2019t be available by the time we would be ready for it. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to rush the situation at Palace, no matter how good another opportunity looks.\u201d Textor is protecting the value of his investment in Palace by not rushing a sale, but at the same time appears to be courting Everton. Everton is currently valued by Forbes at $744 million, but any buyer would have to take into account the club\u2019s significant debts on top of the cost of buying the club. Textor has already been through the process of buying a share of a club in English football, so it is likely there wouldn\u2019t be the same issues as Everton have experienced with its prolonged dealings with 777. At the same time, this is an obstacle, as Textor\u2019s shares in Crystal Palace means he would be unable to bid for Everton once the period of exclusivity for 777 to deal with Moshiri ends this month. If nothing else, Textor may have alerted other investors to Everton\u2019s availability and potential desirability. As is often the case at Everton in recent years, there is still a lack of clarity as to what the future of the club looks like, but 777 Partners being out of the picture would at least allow the club to move forward, and an endorsement from Textor could be seen as a positive as it seeks to attract potential buyers.

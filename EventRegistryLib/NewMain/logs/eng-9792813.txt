There\u00b4s been guys on, but I\u00b4ve made that important pitch, and I\u00b4m just happy about that.\"\n\nFesta emphasized the importance of staying in command through the second and third times through the batting order.\n\n\"Another really good outing from him in a packed stadium, in a place with a lot of emotion. He was able to slow it down really good,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"Came out really sharp. He missed a bunch of bats today. He had a lot of different things working, and then towards the end of the outing, he held it together really well.\"\n\nMinnesota Twins starting pitcher David Festa throws against the Chicago Cubs during the first inning of a baseball game, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, in Chicago.

Ryan Jeffers grounded into a run-scoring double play in the ninth.\n\nMatt Wallner followed Lewis\u00b4 fly in the third with a drive that center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong lost in the twilight. Right fielder Mike Tauchman couldn\u00b4t react quickly enough and the ball fell on the warning track. Trevor Larnach tried to score from first base on what was scored a double, but Crow-Armstrong threw to shortstop Dansby Swanson, whose one-hop relay to catcher Miguel Amaya was in time for the tag.\n\nTRAINER\u00b4S ROOM\n\nTwins: LHP Steven Okert was placed on the bereavement list on Monday and RHP Josh Winder was recalled from Triple-A St. Paul.\n\nCubs: RF Seiya Suzuki sat out with neck soreness but is expected by manager Craig Counsell to return to the lineup Tuesday. Cody Bellinger has been Chicago\u00b4s DH since returning from a fractured left middle finger last week, but Counsell said that he\u00b4s still been struggling when he tries to \"make throws with intent.\" Bellinger will not play in the field during the Cubs\u00b4 series against the Twins. ... RHP Adbert Alzolay is scheduled to undergo right forearm surgery on Tuesday.\n\nTwins RHP Pablo L\u00f3pez (10-7, 4.65) starts Tuesday seeking his third consecutive winning decision.

His OPS stands at 1.056 through 33 games, which is the second-highest mark for anyone with at least 40 at-bats (Aaron Judge is at 1.157).\n\nMiguel Amaya went 2-for-4 and swatted his fourth home run of the season on Sunday night, helping to power the Cubs to a 6-2 victory over the visiting Cardinals.

He then greeted Ryan Fernandez in the sixth inning with a 390-foot (97.7-mph EV) solo shot that extended the Cubs' lead to 6-2.

Hendricks is allowing hitters to bat almost .300 off him on the season, and over .300 at Wrigley Field. Minnesota is top-10 in batting average, and top-5 in slugging percentage, so they put good wood on the ball. Along with that, the Twins have hit 133 home runs this season. Hendricks has allowed one home run for every five innings pitched, so the Twins have a chance to hit a couple out of Wrigley. If Minnesota can stay locked in on offense, and hit for some power, they will win this game.\n\nThe Cubs have a tendency to not score. They are scoring under four runs per game since the All-Star break, which is not a recipe for success. In fact, the Cubs are 9-43 when they score less than four runs this season. Festa has put together two good starts in a row, and he should be able to have a third against this Cubs offense. With the Twins bullpen, and the Cubs failure to score at times, Minnesota should be able to come away with the victory.\n\nWhy The Cubs Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Cubs, as mentioned, are not a good team if they do not score at least four runs. The good news is they are facing a very hittable pitcher. Festa has been struggling since being called up, and Chicago needs to take advantage of that. The Cubs are coming off a pretty good weekend series against the Cardinals, so the hope for them is to carry that into this one. With Festa's tendency to give up some hits, the Cubs should be able to do a little bit a damage.\n\nHendricks needs to be at his best. Take away his start against the Kansas City Royals, and he actually pitched well in August. Not counting his Royals start, Hendricks threw 19 innings, and had a 3.79 ERA. He was able to flush the Royals start with a good outing against the Reds, so there is some reason to believe he is starting to be a little bit better.\n\nFinal Twins-Cubs Prediction & Pick\n\nThe weird thing about the Cubs season is not that they are much better at home, but they are one of the best teams in interleague matchups. The Cubs are 17-9 in interleague matchups this season, and I think they will add another win Monday night. Considering the pitching matchup, I think the Cubs come away with the win.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_zunkel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Cameron Zunkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Hendricks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Hendricks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wrigley Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Twins-vs-Cubs-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792813", "eventUri": "eng-9792813", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

After scuffling along to a division title thanks to a terrible AL Central, the 2024 Twins sit 4\u00bd games behind the apparently unbeatable Cleveland Guardians despite having the sixth-best record in all of baseball. The Guardians are bound to regress to the mean soon, but the Twins are doing everything they can to close the gap in the meantime.\n\nIt's been a season of inconsistencies, both on a team and individual level. The Twins started 7-13 but have the best record in the majors since then. They rattled off an MLB-best 12-game winning streak and then immediately lost their next seven games. Individually, Carlos Correa, Byron Buxton, Jose Miranda, and Matt Wallner all had an OPS below .750 through May, with Wallner even being optioned to Triple-A thanks to an unseemly 52 percent strikeout rate. Since June 1, all four players have an OPS well above .900.\n\nOf course, we can't talk about hitting without mentioning the young phenom Royce Lewis. He seemingly can't stay on the field for more than a few weeks at a time, but he has been one of the best hitters in baseball when healthy. He has 13 home runs in just 33 games this season, putting him on a Judge-esque pace of 65 homers over a full 162. We keep joking at TT that he can't possibly keep hitting this well, and then he hits another homer almost as soon as we put that in writing.\n\nCorrea will miss this series with plantar fasciitis, but the lineup is still strong without him, featuring only two regulars with a wRC+ below league average. One of them is Correa's replacement, MLB Pipeline's 13th-ranked prospect Brooks Lee in his first MLB action, and the other is Christian Vazquez who splits catching duties 50/50 with Ryan Jeffers. And we haven't even talked about All-Star (and the love of my life) Willi Castro yet. I can only assume that Castro's breakout comes thanks to my La La Land-inspired answer in our pre-season roundtable, but he has been unavailable for comment.\n\nI'm going long so let's quickly get to the pitching. The Twins are lined up to deploy David Festa, Pablo Lopez, and Joe Ryan in this series. Festa is a rookie who is a fringe Top 100 prospect depending on your preferred prospect ranking system. The former 13th-rounder goes slider heavy and has an incredibly hittable 97 mile per hour fastball, but the slider movement and quirky release are enough to keep hitters off-balance. Don't trust what Lopez's ERA tells you, he is still a true ace atop this staff. He's struggled with the long ball this year, but his sweeper and four-seamer still rank among the best pitches in all of baseball. He's the same pitcher that threw seven shutout innings in Houston in last year's ALDS, just with some worse home run luck.\n\nJoe Ryan is currently lined up to pitch on Wednesday, but I would be fairly shocked if he starts that game. He's been the Twins' best starter this season, but they have a four-game set with the first-place Guardians that looms large this weekend. If they bump his start back a day, they can get their four best starters (Ryan, Lopez, Bailey Ober, Simeon Woods Richardson) in line for that ultra-important series. If the Twins go that route, the new starter would likely be long-relief man (and former Uber Driver/playoff starter) Randy Dobnak. Dobnak was a heavy sinker pitcher when he last got extended Big League time in 2021, but finger injuries in the following two seasons left him unable to grip the pitch. He reinvented himself as a slider/changeup pitcher who was second in Triple-A in strikeouts prior to being recalled last week. Quite the change for a pitcher who had a career 5.7 K/9 before this season.\n\nRelatedly, I would expect Rocco Baldelli to work in an extra off-day for the oft-injured Buxton and Lewis ahead of their most important regular season series in two years. It will be fun to see the Twins at Wrigley for the first time since 2021, but I think most fans are understandably looking ahead to the Guardians this weekend. Hopefully the players aren't doing the same.\n\nTonight's series opener will be the Cubs' 41st against the Twins, their most vs. any American League team other than the White Sox, whom they have faced 144 times. Their third most are 37, against the Royals, then 34 vs. the Tigers.\n\n..........\n\nThis series is the first of five straight series in which the Cubs will play 14 consecutive games against AL clubs: three vs. the Twins, two at the White Sox, three at Cleveland, then three each at home vs. the Blue Jays and Tigers.\n\nThey have played 15 in a row twice, in 2008 and 2010.\n\nIn the first year, they played three each at Toronto and Tampa, three each at home vs. the White Sox and Orioles, and three against the Sox on the South Side.\n\nIn the second, they played three-game series at home vs. the White Sox, Athletics and Angeles, then at Seattle and on the South Side.\n\nThe Cubs were supposed to play 15 straight in 2009, as well, but a game at home vs. the Sox was rained out and a postponed game at Atlanta was made up on a scheduled off day, resulting in separate streaks of eight and six vs. AL teams.\n\nTheir longest such streak since 2010 was 12 games, in 2012. They played 11 straight last year.\n\nNOTE: At posting time, the Cubs have not officially listed a starter for Tuesday or Wednesday. Sh\u014dta Imanaga and Javier Assad would be coming up, in that order, if the Cubs stay on rotation. As always, we await developments.\n\nWednesday: 1:20 p.m. CT, Marquee Sports Network, MLB Network (outside the Cubs ant Twins market territories)\n\nAs noted above, the Cubs should give the Twins a more competitive series than the White Sox did over the weekend. Since the All-Star break the Cubs are 8-8, the Twins 8-6.\n\nThe Cubs lost two of three at Target Field last year and were blown out twice; that was during last year's May downturn. The Cubs are a better team than that now, and I think they will take two of three.\n\nThe Cubs have Thursday off, then travel to the South Side to take on the White Sox in a two-game series. The games are Friday and Saturday evening.", "source": {"uri": "bleedcubbieblue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleed Cubbie Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "al_yellon@bleedcubbieblue.com", "name":

Hendricks is sporting a 7.61 ERA as a starter while allowing opposing hitters to tee him up for a .372 wOBA.\n\nAdd Hendricks' sporting negative pitch values on his three most frequent offerings, per FanGraphs, and the veteran righty's ballooned numbers line up. His hard-hit rate, barrel percentage, launch angle, and exit velocity are also all up compared to last year's marks.\n\nOf course, the Minnesota Twins are also raking against right-handed hurlers with a fourth-ranked .329 wOBA, and they've put 37 runs on the board during their active four-game winning streak.\n\nMinny starter David Festa is also inexperienced and inconsistent. He's making just his fourth start in the bigs, and while his 3.87 xFIP is promising, he's still allowed 15 earned runs across just 19 1/3 innings. His 4.06 ERA and 1.37 WHIP with Triple-A St. Paul aren't confidence-inducing marks, either.\n\nOne reason we're landing this decreased total is because the wind is forecasted to be blowing in at Wrigley Field on Monday night. Still, both offenses are coming in hot, and neither starting pitcher has been sharp.\n\nTwins vs Cubs same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nDespite the noted Festa shortcomings, he has racked up 19 strikeouts across 14 1/3 innings over his past three appearances for a high-end 11.93 K/9 and 30.6 K%. His pitch values also check out, and as noted, Festa probably has good fortune ahead.\n\nTurning to Michael Bucsh, the Chicago rookie is coming off an excellent three-game series against the St. Louis Cardinals and has been solid against right-handed pitchers this season. Busch went 4-for-11 with two runs, two homers, and four RBI against the Cards over the weekend, and he sports a .350 wOBA and .202 ISO against righties for the campaign.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nTwins vs Cubs trend\n\nThe total has gone Over in four of the past five Chicago games and three of the last four Minnesota contests.

The win is Minnesota's fifth straight.\n\nThe Twins are now just 3.5 games back of the Cleveland Guardians for first place in the AL Central.\n\nFesta sent the Cubs (55-60) down in order through two innings and set a career high in strikeouts after recording his eighth of the day in the fourth inning. He ran into a little trouble in the fifth inning, surrendering a two-out double to Pete Crow-Amstrong before walking Miguel Amaya to put the tying run on. But Festa struck out Ian Happ to get out of the inning and end his day on a highlight.\n\nThe Twins bullpen picked up where Festa left off as Caleb Thielbar, Jorge Alcala, Jhoan Duran and Griffin Jax combined to toss four scoreless innings to secure the collective shutout.\n\nFesta improved to 2-2 on the season with the victory.\n\nFesta left the game after five innings with the Twins (63-48) holding a two-run advantage. They got the first run across in the third inning when Willi Castro was walked and Trevor Larnach singled to advance him to third before Royce Lewis brought Castro home with a sacrifice fly to center field.\n\nManny Margot hit a 376-foot solo homer in the fifth inning to put the Twins up 2-0. That homer was off Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks -- who gave up five hits and two runs while fanning five across six innings in the loss -- and was Margot's first home run off a right-handed pitcher all season.\n\nIt was a good day overall for Margot, who finished his night 2 for 3 overall with the homer and a single.\n\nThe Twins added an insurance run in the ninth inning when Matt Wallner led off with a double and Max Kepler advanced him to third with a single. Ryan Jeffers then grounded into a 6-4-3 double play, but Wallner was able to score from third to make it a three-run Twins advantage.\n\nThielbar got the nod in the sixth inning and sent the Cubs down in order. Alcala also pitched a 1-2-3 seventh inning, needing just nine pitches to do so. Duran surrendered a double to Happ in the eighth inning but delivered another scoreless frame. Jax gave up a one-out single to Cody Bellinger but struck out Mike Tauchman and got Nico Hoerner to ground out to pick up his eighth save of the year.\n\nThe Twins and Cubs meet for the second of their three-game series at 7:05 p.m. on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrigley Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_Jax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Griffin Jax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Larnach", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Larnach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royce_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royce Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Thielbar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Thielbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Happ", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ian Happ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Jeffers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Jeffers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Hoerner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Hoerner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tauchman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tauchman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kepler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Kepler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Hendricks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Hendricks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._A._Happ", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Yes, before the All-Star Break.\n\nBut now, it's back to the real world. The Twins have beat up on bad teams this year, and while taking care of business is a must for any team with postseason dreams, things are about to get a lot tougher.

It was the best start of his brief big league career, after all.\n\nFesta, in his fifth major league outing, struck out nine across five scoreless innings. He paved the path for the Twins to earn a 3-0 victory over the Chicago Cubs, extending the club's winning streak to five games.\n\nFour Twins relievers - Caleb Thielbar, Jorge Alcala, Jhoan Duran and Griffin Jax - permitted two hits over four innings to secure the Twins' sixth shutout victory of the season.\n\nOne of the challenges for Festa through his first four career starts was pitching well after his first time through a lineup. Entering Monday, opposing hitters had a .410 on-base plus slugging percentage when they faced the Twins' top-rated pitching prospect for the first time and a 1.350 OPS when they saw him again.\n\nAfter giving up a leadoff single in the third inning, Festa walked Happ with two outs in the third inning when the Cubs lineup flipped over. Then he stranded two runners by striking out Michael Busch, an Inver Grove Heights native.\n\nFesta maintained a laser focus during his outing. He forgot the count when Mike Tauchman whiffed on a change-up with two outs in the fourth inning, taking several steps toward the dugout before realizing it was only the second strike of the at-bat. He appeared to ask home-plate umpire Tony Randazzo, \"Where was the first pitch?\"\n\nIt didn't shake Festa. After another change-up was fouled, Festa struck out Tauchman on a called third strike with an elevated slider. Six of his nine strikeouts came on sliders.\n\nWith two outs in the fifth inning, Pete Crow-Armstrong lined a double down the right-field line. After starting Miguel Amaya, the No. 9 batter in the Cubs lineup, with a 2-0 count, Twins pitching coach Pete Maki walked out of the dugout for a mound visit. Festa, focused on his next pitch, stepped onto the pitching rubber and looked toward home plate, unaware Maki was already past the first-base line.\n\nAmaya drew a walk, but Festa struck out Happ with three swings and misses to end the fifth inning and his outing. Festa allowed two hits and two walks against the 19 batters he faced as he worked on the edges of the strike zone and rarely left any pitches over the middle.\n\nManuel Margot hit a leadoff homer in the fifth inning against Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks. It was Margot's first homer against a right-handed pitcher this year, connecting on a change-up on the outside corner.\n\nThe Twins took a one-run lead in the third inning after Willi Castro drew a one-out walk and Trevor Larnach followed with a single to center. With runners on the corners and one out, Royce Lewis hit a sacrifice fly to center field.\n\nLarnach cost the Twins a chance to add an extra run. Matt Wallner skied a fly ball to the warning track in right-center field, and Cubs outfielders Crow-Armstrong and Mike Tauchman apparently lost the ball in the lights. The ball dropped for a hit, but Larnach wasn't running with two outs, barely around second base when it landed in the outfield.\n\nOnce Larnach started running it was too late. He received a wave from third-base coach Tommy Watkins, but he was thrown out at the plate by several steps, even when the initial throw from Crow-Armstrong went toward second base.\n\nIn the top of the ninth inning, the Twins added an insurance run after Matt Wallner and Max Kepler opened with back-to-back hits. Wallner, who hit two doubles, scored on a double play.", "source": {"uri": "thestate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The State"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bobby_nightengale@thestate.com", "name": "Bobby Nightengale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_Jax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Griffin Jax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Thielbar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Thielbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._A._Happ", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

His only real mistake was a two-seamer up and out over the plate to Manuel Margot in the fifth inning, resulting in a solo homer.\n\nBut the Cubs lost to the Twins 3-0 because they had just six baserunners the whole game (four hits, two walks), only three of whom got past first base. This, against a pitcher who had made four previous MLB appearances (three starts) and hadn't thrown anywhere near this well in any of them. Twins bullpen? Nope, Cubs hitters didn't do much against them, either. The Cubs were just 0-for-4 with RISP, but... that's largely because they only had three runners in scoring position all night. They also struck out 14 times, which sounds like a lot, but this is the seventh time the Cubs have struck out at least 14 times this year. Michael Busch \"led\" the way with four of them.\n\nThat's the story of the game, and it's been the story of much of this season. It was the 11th time the Cubs have been shut out this year. Only four teams have been shut out more often in 2024, one of which, as you might guess, is the White Sox (MLB-leading 13 times). The Cubs have scored one or no runs 21 times (18 percent of their games this year). They've managed to win two of those games by 1-0 scores. So, yay?\n\nThe lack of offense means that the only videos I can show you in this recap are defensive highlights.\n\nThe first of them didn't start out that way. With a run already in for the Twins in the top of the third and a runner on second, Matt Wallner hit a ball toward right-center field.\n\nOh no, Mike Tauchman and Pete Crow-Armstrong! [VIDEO]\n\nIt looked like Tauchman lost the ball in the lights and PCA didn't realize it at first. But PCA picked up the ball and relayed to Dansby Swanson, who threw Trevor Larnach out at the plate.\n\nSo that's good! It kept the game at 1-0.\n\nMargot hit the aforementioned homer in the fifth to make it 2-0.\n\nJorge L\u00f3pez threw a scoreless seventh. He's a guy I'd like to see the Cubs keep around next year. L\u00f3pez turns 32 next February and won't be expensive, and has been effective out of the pen since the Cubs picked him up after the Mets released him. He has closing experience, too.\n\nNate Pearson threw a scoreless eighth, but the Twins picked up a third run in the ninth after a pair of hits put runners on first and third. Pearson got Ryan Jeffers to hit into a double play, but a run scored.\n\nThat meant Cody Bellinger's single in the ninth didn't bring the tying run to the plate, and the next two hitters were routine outs to end the game.\n\nAs you can see, this one was very changeup- and curveball-heavy. Hendricks threw 64 strikes in 93 pitches. Personally, I think he's still got something left and if he can throw this way the rest of the year, that's at the very least a good ending to a rough season for him.\n\nHere's what Craig Counsell had to say about this loss [VIDEO].\n\nFor those of you claiming the Cubs are basically a .500 club, before this game they had done that over an extended period of time:\n\nThey'll have to win tonight to even up those numbers again.\n\nThe Cubs will try to even up this series Tuesday evening at Wrigley Field. Sh\u014dta Imanaga will start for the Cubs and Pablo L\u00f3pez will go for Minnesota.

But rookie right-hander David Festa blanked the Cubs for five innings.\n\n\"That was huge,\" Hendricks said of getting through the fifth. \"That's one thing we tried to make adjustments on now, is coming in between innings - every inning we're really locked in on it, but especially now, coming in the fourth, fifth, sixth, really looking at what we've thrown these guys, what they're trying to do against me and really going in with a good plan there.\"\n\nWalking Willi Castro with one out in the third came back to bite Hendricks. Two batters later, Castro scored on a sacrifice fly by Royce Lewis for the Twins' first run.\n\nThen what might have been a costly misplay in the outfield, as a ball in the lights fell between center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong and right fielder Mike Tauchman turned into a nice play at the plate to get the Cubs out of the inning.\n\nHendricks also yielded a leadoff home run to Manuel Margot in the fifth that gave the Twins a 2-0 lead.\n\nFesta, meanwhile, turned in his first scoreless outing in five major-league starts. The Cubs managed only two hits against him, and he struck out a career-high nine.\n\n\"We chased more than we normally chase - down specifically,\" manager Craig Counsell said. \"That's something I think this offense is good at; it's something we generally don't do. But Festa's off-speed pitches gave us some problems.\"\n\nThe Cubs didn't fare much better against the Twins' bullpen, either, adding only two hits and five strikeouts to their total.\n\nCody Bellinger isn't expected to play in the field in the series, Counsell revealed before the game. Bellinger, who still is recovering from a fractured left middle finger, has been back in the lineup since Wednesday but has served exclusively as the designated hitter.\n\n''He's still struggling throwing,'' Counsell said. ''And that tells you he's still feeling it hitting. So when he tries to make throws with intent, it's not very enjoyable. .\u2009.\u2009.

Against the Twins, he went 1-for-4 with a line-drive single.\n\nWhen he does return to the field, Bellinger is expected to shuffle among the three outfield spots and first base to give the regulars in those spots a day off or an opportunity to DH.\n\nLeft fielder Ian Happ returned to the lineup after missing the game Sunday against the Cardinals with a sore shoulder suffered when he collided with the outfield wall while chasing a triple Saturday by Tommy Pham.\n\nCounsell said he had been considering giving right fielder Seiya Suzuki the day off Sunday until it was clear Happ needed the rest. Suzuki has been dealing with stiffness in his neck, Counsell said, and was out of the lineup Monday.\n\n''I anticipate him being back in there [Tuesday],'' Counsell said.", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Hendricks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Hendricks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tauchman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tauchman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Margot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Margot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiya_Suzuki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seiya Suzuki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Pham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Pham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._A._Happ", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

MLB-level competition at Wrigley Field on Monday evening.\n\nNot to worry, David Festa and the Twins pitching staff came to play.\n\nThe Twins got a runner into scoring position quickly, with Trevor Larnach singling with one out and stealing second with two down, but Matt Wallner struck out to end the inning. The Twins made it two runners in scoring position in two innings with a two-out double from Carlos Santana in the second, but Manuel Margot popped out to end the inning.\n\nIn the third, the Twins finally broke through -- although poor baserunning kept them from scoring at least one more run. Willi Castro walked with one out, and Larnach rolled a single into center field, sending Castro to third base. Then, Royce Lewis poked a sacrifice fly into center to score the game's first run.\n\nBut then things got weird. Matt Wallner hit a towering fly ball into right-center that both center-fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong and right-fielder Mike Tauchman lost, with a diving Tauchman deflecting it with a last-second diving attempt. With two outs, Larnach should have scored relatively easily from first base. However, he apparently didn't realize there were two outs, as he slowed down both before and after getting to second base and was ultimately thrown out by a couple of feet at home plate. If he'd been running on contact with two outs, there probably wouldn't have even been a play on him.\n\nThe Cubs, on the other hand, didn't have a baserunner until the third inning. Festa struck out four of the first six batters he faced before Dansby Swanson led off the bottom of the third frame with a hit. Chicago had runners on first and second with two outs before Festa spiked a slider to Minnesota native Michael Busch to strike him out and get out of the jam.\n\nThe Twins went down in order in the fourth and Festa did the same to the Cubs in the bottom of the inning, racking up another two strikeouts. Then, Manuel Margot led off the top of the fifth with a solo home run, doubling the Twins' lead.\n\nIn the bottom of the fifth, Festa got the first two outs once again before running into a bit of trouble. Crow-Armstrong doubled into the right field corner and No. 9 batter Miguel Amaya walked, putting the go-ahead run at the plate as Festa's pitch count climbed. But he struck out Ian Happ to end the threat on his 82nd pitch of the night, stranding two runners and preserving the Twins' 2-0 lead.\n\nIn the sixth, Caleb Thielbar struck out the side on 15 pitches, shocking everyone. It was his fourth consecutive scoreless outing, and it goes without saying that this version of Thielbar would make a big difference down the stretch this season.\n\nThe Twins only had one more baserunner between the sixth and eighth innings but plated their third and final run in the top of the ninth. Wallner laced a double into right-center and advanced to third on a sharp single by Kepler. With runners on the corners, Ryan Jeffers banged into a 6-4-3 double play, but Wallner scored to give the Twins an insurance run.\n\nIn the meantime, the bullpen was in the process of completely shutting down the Cubs. Jorge Alcala pitched a clean seventh inning, and Jhoan Duran was solid in the eighth, allowing a two-out double but striking out Busch to end the inning. In the ninth, Griffin Jax came in and easily nailed down the save, allowing just a single baserunner.", "source": {"uri": "twinkietown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twinkie Town"}, "authors":

In the wild-card race, the Cubs are 6 games out of the final spot. As if being six games out of the final wild-card spot was not already a daunting task, the fact remains that the Cubs have seven teams ahead of them.\n\nWhile Cubs fans are born with the motto of \"I didn't hear no bell\", the reason why fans can't hear the bell is because it was rung in June. Anyone sticking around, hoping for a postseason berth in 2024, fell asleep during battle and woke up without the realization it was over.\n\nFrom a pure standings standpoint, it's clear that the Cubs won't be making the postseason but let's dive even further. Entering play on Monday, FanGraphs has the Cubs at a 7.5% chance of reaching the postseason--3.8% chance of winning the division and 3.6% chance of clinching a wild-card spot. No, the Cubs have not mathematically been eliminated yet but hey, neither have the Chicago White Sox yet.\n\nBut, let's have a real conversation about the importance of being a serious fans.\n\nSerious fans realize that there is no magical run that is going to happen where the Cubs make the postseason in 2024. All that false hope is doing is giving Hoyer ammunition to lie to us once again. When the Cubs season was falling off the rails during the months of May and June, Hoyer was so quick to fallback on the turnaround that the 2023 had with their run during the second-half of the season. What Hoyer casually leaves out when talking about the 2023 team is that they missed the postseason. Serious fans are aware of that omission from Hoyer.\n\nWhile there are plenty of reasons that the final two months of the season are important, the idea of it being due to a postseason run has Hoyer prepared to puff out his chest even more when talking about his failures.", "source": {"uri": "cubbiescrib.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cubbies Crib"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jed_Hoyer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jed Hoyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6000,h_3375,x_0,y_400/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/9/01j4hrhnrhzqa6afy7m3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792813", "eventUri": "eng-9792813", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Yet even after he walked the Chicago Cubs' ninth hitter four pitches later, Baldelli stuck with Festa.\n\nThe Twins rookie starting pitcher rewarded his manager and the team, ending his outing with a career-best ninth strikeout.\n\nBuoyed by the prospect's outstanding start, five pitchers combined on a four-hitter as the Twins topped the Cubs 3-0 in front of 35,382 at Wrigley Field. Allowing two hits and walking two in five scoreless innings, Festa helped the Twins, winners of five straight, move within 3 1/2 games of Cleveland, the closest they've been to first place since May 17.\n\n\"(Festa) was able to slow it down really good,\" Baldelli said. \"He came out really sharp. He missed a bunch of bats. He had a lot of different things working. Toward the end of the outing, he held it together really well. I couldn't be more pleased with what we got out of him.\"\n\nAs a function of their inability to land a starter at the deadline, this world, where a young pitcher could be lights out only to be removed without hesitation, is one the Twins must live in for their final 51 games.\n\nWhether it's Festa, Simeon Woods Richardson or hot prospect Zebby Matthews, the Twins look to be dependent on contributions from two young starting pitchers the rest of the way.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of young guys that are going to have to play a role for us,\" Twins president of baseball operations Derek Falvey said after Tuesday's trade deadline. \"These guys are going to be part of our future. They're part of our present and future.\"\n\nThe Twins believe in Festa's talent, listed as the No. 87 MLB prospect, and fellow rookie Woods Richardson. The evidence supplied by Woods Richardson since he joined the rotation in late April is plentiful. There's also Matthews, who has 109 strikeouts and only six walks this season, helping him rise from High-A Cedar Rapids to Triple-A St. Paul this season.\n\nBut they're not there yet.\n\nThough he's struggled to go deep in his last two starts, the stability provided by Woods Richardson is hard to dispute. The team is 53-35 since he joined the rotation on April 25 and is 13-6 when he pitches this season.\n\nMeanwhile, Festa's fastball is lively and his changeup and slider can be good pitches if they're working as they did Monday.\n\n\"We chased more than we normally chase, down specifically,\" Chicago manager Craig Counsell said. \"It's something we generally don't do. But Festa's off-speed pitches gave us some problems.\"\n\nBut he wouldn't take the mound until the start of the sixth.\n\nThrowing a changeup backed by a 96 mph fastball, Festa got ahead of Happ 0-2 in the count. He tried to entice Happ with a changeup and a slider, but the veteran wouldn't bite and evened the count. Still, Festa went back to his changeup one more time and generated his eighth swing-and-miss of the night with the pitch, stranding the pair of runners.\n\nMaking his exit toward the visiting dugout, Festa yelled to himself and strutted off the field.\n\n\"(The changeup is) getting better and better every outing,\" Festa said. \"I thought it was really good. I felt like I was throwing it for first-pitch strikes, and then at two strikes, getting that chase over the white. I was really happy with how it was. ... There was a little emotion in a very competitive spot.\"\n\nPerhaps the moment will gain Festa, making only his fifth big league appearance, a little more faith in a big spot down the stretch.\n\nBut Maki and Baldelli gave him the opportunity Monday to pitch through a spot he's struggled in thus far in his career.\n\nThrough his first four appearances, Festa had no trouble successfully navigating his way through the opposing lineup the first time. Entering Monday, when the Cubs went 1-for-9 with five strikeouts, opponents combined to hit .121/.194/.212 against Festa the first time through the order in 36 plate appearances.\n\nThe difficulty for Festa lies in his second time through the order. Coming in, opponents were hitting .441/.472/.912 in 36 plate appearances against Festa. On Monday, they went 1-for-7 with two walks and three strikeouts.\n\nBut Festa showed his manager and pitching coach enough the second time through to merit one more batter.\n\n\"There are a lot of things that could change those scenarios real quick,\" Baldelli said. \"The stuff still looked good. The strike-throwing was probably not as sharp as the outing went on, but did he still have the stuff to go out there and miss a bat? ... We thought he did and he looked good.\"\n\nFesta looked good in part because used his changeup more frequently. Working with three consistent pitches kept Chicago hitters guessing.\n\nWhereas in his previous outings, Festa threw the changeup only 22 percent of the time, he ramped it up to 37 percent against the Cubs. Overall, Festa finished with 14 swings-and-misses in 82 pitches, a career high.\n\n\"When he was coming up, you hear about the swing-and-miss,\" Jeffers said. \"We haven't really seen it to the point where it had been in the minors until tonight. He was commanding his off-speed pitches behind in the count, and then in leverage counts, he was able to expand them a little bit more. I think that's more of what we want to see from him. He can miss a lot of bats, and that's what he did.\"\n\nHe didn't have anyone on the bench to make the move anyway, but Baldelli wasn't going to pull Trevor Larnach after his mental base-running mistake in the third inning. Running on Matt Wallner's two-out double to right, a ball that should have been caught but dropped in, Larnach inexplicably stopped after passing second base.\n\nHe'd forgotten how many outs there were. Trying to race home, Larnach instead was easily thrown out for the final out of the inning.\n\nWhat initially appeared on TV broadcasts as a lack of hustle turned out to be a blunder that may have prevented the Twins from pulling away. Without Byron Buxton, Jose Miranda or Brooks Lee available, Baldelli instead told Larnach to forget the play and stay engaged in the game.\n\n\"Sometimes that stuff can stay with guys throughout games because he knows what he did,\" Baldelli said. \"It wasn't a good baseball play, it was a mental error. Instead of him thinking the whole game that he let the team down in some way, I told him, 'This is the last time you're going to think about that play.' ... When we have a legitimate issue with effort, then I have a serious issue with the player. That's not effort. Although it looks really bad, that was a mental error that cost us, but that was not an effort (play).\"\n\nBefore the game, Baldelli noted the rookie Lee was dealing with a sore right shoulder, which kept him out of the lineup a second game in a row. Baldelli downplayed the significance of the soreness before Lee took the field and participated in infield and batting practice. ... Carlos Correa will likely participate in a minor-league rehab assignment before returning to the big-league lineup.

We want to keep him feeling this way, and this is the way to do it.\"\n\nChicago is also expected to have a hot-hitting outfielder return on Tuesday. Right fielder Seiya Suzuki posted a 1.020 OPS over a 21-game stretch before neck stiffness sidelined him on Monday.\n\nIf he plays, Suzuki will join a lineup looking to rebound against Minnesota right-hander Pablo Lopez (10-7, 4.65 ERA), who has delivered three straight quality starts.\n\nLopez last pitched on Wednesday, when he limited the New York Mets to two runs over six innings in Minnesota's 8-3 road win.\n\nThe seventh-year veteran is 1-2 with a 2.66 ERA in four career starts against the Cubs, all coming with the Miami Marlins from 2019-22.\n\nDansby Swanson has faced Lopez more than any other Chicago hitter, though the Cubs' shortstop is just 3-for-22 (.136) against him with a home run and eight strikeouts.\n\n--Field Level Media\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters

It's hard to say. In any case, there is movement -- three players who everyone here knows have leveled up, the team is playing well and only need to play .600-something ball for the rest of the season to have a shot at October.\n\nThey started the stretch drive a little later than in 2023 -- that may cost them. This group isn't good enough to turn it on only when it counts but that's how they seem to operate. I suspect they're just passing gas in a wind tunnel but hey! Stranger things have happened. Let's be positive until the math rules it out.\n\nIn this series, the Cubs will be facing the Minnesota Twins, a pretty good club. David Festa (1-2, 6.98) represented the Twins and Kyle Hendricks (3-9, 6.86) was on the hill for the North Siders in their home park, venerable Wrigley Field.\n\nBoth starters threw zeroes until the top of the third, when a Royce Lewis sacrifice fly opened the scoring. Manuel Margot lined one deep to left for their second tally in the top of the fifth.\n\nThat was more than enough. The offense took a nap. Kyle's good effort was wasted.\n\nPlease be reminded that Cub Tracks and Bleed Cubbie Blue do not necessarily endorse the content of articles, podcasts, or videos that are linked to in this series.

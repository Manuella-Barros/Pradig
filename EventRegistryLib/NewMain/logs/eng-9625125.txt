Mike Collins of Georgia wrote on the social platform X, formerly Twitter, after a Manhattan jury found Trump guilty.\n\nInfluential conservative activist Charlie Kirk urged Republican prosecutors to get \"creative\" in bringing charges: \"Indict the left, or lose America,\" he said on X.\n\nIn a podcast interview, Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., said, \"We have to fight fire with fire.\"\n\nAnd the former president on Tuesday suggested he might try to retaliate against Hillary Clinton, his 2016 opponent, if he returns to the White House.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be terrible to throw the president's wife and the former secretary of state, think of it, the former secretary of state, but the president's wife, into jail? Wouldn't that be a terrible thing? But they want to do it,\" Trump said in an interview on Newsmax. \"It's a terrible, terrible path that they're leading us to. And it's very possible that it's going to have to happen to them.\"\n\nThe calls to weaponize the judicial system against Democrats are a degree more intense than some other suggestions for retaliation that Republicans have made since the guilty verdict, such as calls to investigate the prosecutors in the Manhattan case or for voters to give their own verdict by sending Trump back to the White House in November.\n\nThey represent a show of loyalty to Trump, who has spent months calling the cases against him a form of partisan \"election interference\" and referring to President Joe Biden's administration as \"evil\" and \"corrupt.\" They also signal a growing feeling among some Republicans that the felony conviction of a former president for falsifying business records to illegally influence an election crossed a boundary in judicial norms.\n\n\"What just happened today is a line we can't uncross,\" conservative talk show host Megyn Kelly said after Trump was found guilty. \"And these Democrats will rue the day they decided to use 'lawfare' to stop a presidential candidate. I'm not talking about violence. I'm talking about tit-for-tat.\"\n\nIn a post on X, Republican House candidate Brandon Gill of Texas lamented what he viewed as \"raw power\" rather than an \"equally applied legal system\" in the charges being brought against Trump: \"Might makes right,\" he said. \"Republicans must wake up to the new reality and respond accordingly.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe outcry comes as Trump and other Republicans have claimed, without evidence, that Biden and his administration were pulling the strings behind the New York trial. The case was led by a state-level prosecutor, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nBiden addressed Trump's attacks on the judicial system during a fundraiser Monday night in Connecticut, calling them \"dangerous for American democracy,\" and noted that the former president was convicted in a state case rather than a federal one. Attorney General Merrick Garland criticized the idea that the federal government was involved as a conspiracy theory during an appearance Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, calling it an attack on the judicial process.\n\n\"We do not control the Manhattan district attorney,\" Garland said Tuesday. \"The Manhattan district attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes his own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.\"\n\nRepublicans have pointed to real elements of the case to argue it was politically driven. For one, Bragg, a Democrat, campaigned for office in 2021 in part on his qualifications to take over the office's investigation into Trump. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, donated $15 to Biden in 2020 and has a daughter who works in Democratic politics, though he has said neither affected his ability to be impartial. And prosecutor Matthew Colangelo joined Bragg's office after serving in the Biden administration's Department of Justice.\n\nTrump also has criticized Bragg for bringing the case in 2023, when his alleged crime was connected to a campaign seven years earlier. Bragg has defended his timing, saying he brings cases \"when they're ready.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats condemned Republican calls to use the justice system to target Democrats as \"reckless\" and potentially dangerous to democracy. They said in interviews that such a reaction was uncalled for since Trump had a fair trial by jury and has the right to appeal.\n\n\"A jury of 12 people unanimously found that beyond a reasonable doubt he committed 34 crimes,\" said Democrat North Carolina Rep. Deborah Ross, the vice-ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. \"That is entirely different than coming up with specious charges and having members of Congress dictate who should be sued in frivolous ways.\"\n\nMaryland Rep. Glenn Ivey, another Democrat on the committee, said there's a history of Republicans prosecuting Democrats and vice versa, but he feels \"relatively confident that these cases will continue to be resolved by jurors who come to the jury box taking their job seriously and trying to follow the evidence and the law.\"\n\nAs Trump awaits his sentencing next month, prominent Democrats also are facing high-profile prosecutions. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez is currently on trial on federal bribery charges in New York, while Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife were indicted last month on conspiracy and bribery charges.\n\nHunter Biden, the president's son, is on trial this week on federal gun charges. And on Wednesday, House Republicans issued criminal referrals against him and his uncle, James Biden. They accused the president's family members of making false statements to Congress as part of a year-long impeachment inquiry. So far, GOP lawmakers have failed to uncover evidence directly implicating President Joe Biden in any wrongdoing.\n\nTrump has given different signals in the past on whether he believes prosecuting political enemies is appropriate.\n\nIn a campaign video last August, he called on Republican attorneys general and district attorneys to \"closely\" watch the trials against him: \"It's an eye for an eye, or it's fight fire with fire.\" But in a town hall in February, he responded to concerns that his second term would be focused on settling old scores by saying, \"My revenge will be a success.\"\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes

I'm talking about tit-for-tat.\"\n\nIn a post on X, Republican House candidate Brandon Gill of Texas lamented what he viewed as \"raw power\" rather than an \"equally applied legal system\" in the charges being brought against Trump: \"Might makes right,\" he said. \"Republicans must wake up to the new reality and respond accordingly.\"\n\nThe outcry comes as Trump and other Republicans have claimed, without evidence, that Biden and his administration were pulling the strings behind the New York trial. The case was led by a state-level prosecutor, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nBiden addressed Trump's attacks on the judicial system during a fundraiser Monday night in Connecticut, calling them \"dangerous for American democracy,\" and noted that the former president was convicted in a state case rather than a federal one. Attorney General Merrick Garland criticized the idea that the federal government was involved as a conspiracy theory during an appearance Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, calling it an attack on the judicial process.\n\n\"We do not control the Manhattan district attorney,\" Garland said Tuesday. \"The Manhattan District Attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes its own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.\"\n\nRepublicans have pointed to real elements of the case to argue it was politically driven. For one, Bragg, a Democrat, campaigned for office in 2021 in part on his qualifications to take over the office's investigation into Trump. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, donated $15 to Biden in 2020 and has a daughter who works in Democratic politics, though he has said neither affected his ability to be impartial. And prosecutor Matthew Colangelo joined Bragg's office after serving in the Biden administration's Department of Justice.\n\nTrump also has criticized Bragg for bringing the case in 2023, when his alleged crime was connected to a campaign seven years earlier. Bragg has defended his timing, saying he brings cases \"when they're ready.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats condemned Republican calls to use the justice system to target Democrats as \"reckless\" and potentially dangerous to democracy. They said in interviews that such a reaction was uncalled for since Trump had a fair trial by jury and has the right to appeal.\n\n\"A jury of 12 people unanimously found that beyond a reasonable doubt he committed 34 crimes,\" said Democrat North Carolina Rep. Deborah Ross, the vice-ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. \"That is entirely different than coming up with specious charges and having members of Congress dictate who should be sued in frivolous ways.\"\n\nMaryland Rep. Glenn Ivey, another Democrat on the committee, said there's a history of Republicans prosecuting Democrats and vice versa, but he feels \"relatively confident that these cases will continue to be resolved by jurors who come to the jury box taking their job seriously and trying to follow the evidence and the law.\"\n\nAs Trump awaits his sentencing next month, prominent Democrats also are facing high-profile prosecutions. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez is currently on trial on federal bribery charges in New York, while Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife were indicted last month on conspiracy and bribery charges.\n\nOpening statements began Tuesday in a federal case against President Biden's son Hunter, who was charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction.\n\nTrump has given different signals in the past on whether he believes prosecuting political enemies is appropriate.\n\nIn a campaign video last August, he called on Republican attorneys general and district attorneys to \"closely\" watch the trials against him: \"It's an eye for an eye, or it's fight fire with fire.\" But in a town hall in February, he responded to concerns that his second term would be focused on settling old scores by saying, \"My revenge will be a success.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he would seek revenge on the morning show \"Fox & Friends\" on Sunday, Trump struggled to answer, calling it \"a really tough question\" because \"these are bad people.\" He said when he was president, he could have locked up former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton but declined to do so.\n\n\"Then this happened to me,\" he said, \"and so I may feel differently about it.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Christine Fernando in Chicago contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

trials against him: \"It's an eye for an eye, or it's fight fire with fire.\" But in a town hall in February, he responded to concerns that his second term would be focused on settling old scores by saying, \"My revenge will be a success.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he would seek revenge on the morning show \"Fox & Friends\" on Sunday, Trump struggled to answer, calling it \"a really tough question\"

Mike Collins of Georgia wrote on the social platform X, formerly Twitter, after a Manhattan jury found Trump guilty.\n\nInfluential conservative activist Charlie Kirk urged Republican prosecutors to get \"creative\" in bringing charges: \"Indict the left, or lose America,\" he said on X.\n\nIn a podcast interview, Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., said, \"We have to fight fire with fire.\"\n\nThe calls to weaponize the judicial system against Democrats are a degree more intense than some other suggestions for retaliation that Republicans have made since the guilty verdict, such as calls to investigate the prosecutors in the Manhattan case or for voters to give their own verdict by sending Trump back to the White House in November.\n\nThey represent a show of loyalty to Trump, who has spent months calling the cases against him a form of partisan \"election interference\" and referring to President Joe Biden's administration as \"evil\" and \"corrupt.\" They also signal a growing feeling among some Republicans that the felony conviction of a former president for falsifying business records to illegally influence an election crossed a boundary in judicial norms.\n\n\"What just happened today is a line we can't uncross,\" conservative talk show host Megyn Kelly said after Trump was found guilty. \"And these Democrats will rue the day they decided to use 'lawfare' to stop a presidential candidate. I'm not talking about violence. I'm talking about tit-for-tat.\"\n\nIn a post on X, Republican House candidate Brandon Gill of Texas lamented what he viewed as \"raw power\" rather than an \"equally applied legal system\" in the charges being brought against Trump: \"Might makes right,\" he said. \"Republicans must wake up to the new reality and respond accordingly.\"\n\nThe outcry comes as Trump and other Republicans have claimed, without evidence, that Biden and his administration were pulling the strings behind the New York trial. The case was led by a state-level prosecutor, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nBiden addressed Trump's attacks on the judicial system during a fundraiser Monday night in Connecticut, calling them \"dangerous for American democracy,\" and noted that the former president was convicted in a state case rather than a federal one. Attorney General Merrick Garland criticized the idea that the federal government was involved as a conspiracy theory during an appearance Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, calling it an attack on the judicial process.\n\n\"We do not control the Manhattan district attorney,\" Garland said Tuesday. \"The Manhattan District Attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes its own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.\"\n\nRepublicans have pointed to real elements of the case to argue it was politically driven. For one, Bragg, a Democrat, campaigned for office in 2021 in part on his qualifications to take over the office's investigation into Trump. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, donated $15 to Biden in 2020 and has a daughter who works in Democratic politics, though he has said neither affected his ability to be impartial. And prosecutor Matthew Colangelo joined Bragg's office after serving in the Biden administration's Department of Justice.\n\nTrump also has criticized Bragg for bringing the case in 2023, when his alleged crime was connected to a campaign seven years earlier. Bragg has defended his timing, saying he brings cases \"when they're ready.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats condemned Republican calls to use the justice system to target Democrats as \"reckless\" and potentially dangerous to democracy. They said in interviews that such a reaction was uncalled for since Trump had a fair trial by jury and has the right to appeal.\n\n\"A jury of 12 people unanimously found that beyond a reasonable doubt he committed 34 crimes,\" said Democrat North Carolina Rep. Deborah Ross, the vice-ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. \"That is entirely different than coming up with specious charges and having members of Congress dictate who should be sued in frivolous ways.\"\n\nMaryland Rep. Glenn Ivey, another Democrat on the committee, said there's a history of Republicans prosecuting Democrats and vice versa, but he feels \"relatively confident that these cases will continue to be resolved by jurors who come to the jury box taking their job seriously and trying to follow the evidence and the law.\"\n\nAs Trump awaits his sentencing next month, prominent Democrats also are facing high-profile prosecutions. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez is currently on trial on federal bribery charges in New York, while Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife were indicted last month on conspiracy and bribery charges.\n\nOpening statements began Tuesday in a federal case against President Biden's son Hunter, who was charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction.\n\nTrump has given different signals in the past on whether he believes prosecuting political enemies is appropriate.\n\nIn a campaign video last August, he called on Republican attorneys general and district attorneys to \"closely\" watch the trials against him: \"It's an eye for an eye, or it's fight fire with fire.\" But in a town hall in February, he responded to concerns that his second term would be focused on settling old scores by saying, \"My revenge will be a success.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he would seek revenge on the morning show \"Fox & Friends\" on Sunday, Trump struggled to answer, calling it \"a really tough question\" because \"these are bad people.\" He said when he was president, he could have locked up former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton but declined to do so.\n\n\"Then this happened to me,\" he said, \"and so I may feel differently about it.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Christine Fernando in Chicago contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Mike Collins of Georgia wrote on the social platform X, formerly Twitter, after a Manhattan jury found Trump guilty.\n\nInfluential conservative activist Charlie Kirk urged Republican prosecutors to get \"creative\" in bringing charges: \"Indict the left, or lose America,\" he said on X.\n\nIn a podcast interview, Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., said, \"We have to fight fire with fire.\"\n\nThe calls to weaponize the judicial system against Democrats are a degree more intense than some other suggestions for retaliation that Republicans have made since the guilty verdict, such as calls to investigate the prosecutors in the Manhattan case or for voters to give their own verdict by sending Trump back to the White House in November.\n\nThey represent a show of loyalty to Trump, who has spent months calling the cases against him a form of partisan \"election interference\" and referring to President Joe Biden's administration as \"evil\" and \"corrupt.\" They also signal a growing feeling among some Republicans that the felony conviction of a former president for falsifying business records to illegally influence an election crossed a boundary in judicial norms.\n\n\"What just happened today is a line we can't uncross,\" conservative talk show host Megyn Kelly said after Trump was found guilty. \"And these Democrats will rue the day they decided to use 'lawfare' to stop a presidential candidate. I'm not talking about violence. I'm talking about tit-for-tat.\"\n\nIn a post on X, Republican House candidate Brandon Gill of Texas lamented what he viewed as \"raw power\" rather than an \"equally applied legal system\" in the charges being brought against Trump: \"Might makes right,\" he said. \"Republicans must wake up to the new reality and respond accordingly.\"\n\nThe outcry comes as Trump and other Republicans have claimed, without evidence, that Biden and his administration were pulling the strings behind the New York trial. The case was led by a state-level prosecutor, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nBiden addressed Trump's attacks on the judicial system during a fundraiser Monday night in Connecticut, calling them \"dangerous for American democracy,\" and noted that the former president was convicted in a state case rather than a federal one. Attorney General Merrick Garland criticized the idea that the federal government was involved as a conspiracy theory during an appearance Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, calling it an attack on the judicial process.\n\n\"We do not control the Manhattan district attorney,\" Garland said Tuesday. \"The Manhattan District Attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes its own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.\"\n\nRepublicans have pointed to real elements of the case to argue it was politically driven. For one, Bragg, a Democrat, campaigned for office in 2021 in part on his qualifications to take over the office's investigation into Trump. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, donated $15 to Biden in 2020 and has a daughter who works in Democratic politics, though he has said neither affected his ability to be impartial. And prosecutor Matthew Colangelo joined Bragg's office after serving in the Biden administration's Department of Justice.\n\nTrump also has criticized Bragg for bringing the case in 2023, when his alleged crime was connected to a campaign seven years earlier. Bragg has defended his timing, saying he brings cases \"when they're ready.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats condemned Republican calls to use the justice system to target Democrats as \"reckless\" and potentially dangerous to democracy. They said in interviews that such a reaction was uncalled for since Trump had a fair trial by jury and has the right to appeal.\n\n\"A jury of 12 people unanimously found that beyond a reasonable doubt he committed 34 crimes,\" said Democrat North Carolina Rep. Deborah Ross, the vice-ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. \"That is entirely different than coming up with specious charges and having members of Congress dictate who should be sued in frivolous ways.\"\n\nMaryland Rep. Glenn Ivey, another Democrat on the committee, said there's a history of Republicans prosecuting Democrats and vice versa, but he feels \"relatively confident that these cases will continue to be resolved by jurors who come to the jury box taking their job seriously and trying to follow the evidence and the law.\"\n\nAs Trump awaits his sentencing next month, prominent Democrats also are facing high-profile prosecutions. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez is currently on trial on federal bribery charges in New York, while Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife were indicted last month on conspiracy and bribery charges.\n\nOpening statements began Tuesday in a federal case against President Biden's son Hunter, who was charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction.\n\nTrump has given different signals in the past on whether he believes prosecuting political enemies is appropriate.\n\nIn a campaign video last August, he called on Republican attorneys general and district attorneys to \"closely\" watch the trials against him: \"It's an eye for an eye, or it's fight fire with fire.\" But in a town hall in February, he responded to concerns that his second term would be focused on settling old scores by saying, \"My revenge will be a success.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he would seek revenge on the morning show \"Fox & Friends\" on Sunday, Trump struggled to answer, calling it \"a really tough question\" because \"these are bad people.\" He said when he was president, he could have locked up former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton but declined to do so.\n\n\"Then this happened to me,\" he said, \"and so I may feel differently about it.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Mike Collins of Georgia wrote on the social platform X, formerly Twitter, after a Manhattan jury found Trump guilty.\n\nInfluential conservative activist Charlie Kirk urged Republican prosecutors to get \"creative\" in bringing charges: \"Indict the left, or lose America,\" he said on X.\n\nIn a podcast interview, Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., said, \"We have to fight fire with fire.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Wouldn't that be a terrible thing? But they want to do it,\" Trump said in an interview on Newsmax. \"It's a terrible, terrible path that they're leading us to. And it's very possible that it's going to have to happen to them.\"\n\nThe calls to weaponize the judicial system against Democrats are a degree more intense than some other suggestions for retaliation that Republicans have made since the guilty verdict, such as calls to investigate the prosecutors in the Manhattan case or for voters to give their own verdict by sending Trump back to the White House in November.\n\nThey represent a show of loyalty to Trump, who has spent months calling the cases against him a form of partisan \"election interference\" and referring to President Joe Biden's administration as \"evil\" and \"corrupt.\" They also signal a growing feeling among some Republicans that the felony conviction of a former president for falsifying business records to illegally influence an election crossed a boundary in judicial norms.\n\n\"What just happened today is a line we can't uncross,\" conservative talk show host Megyn Kelly said after Trump was found guilty. \"And these Democrats will rue the day they decided to use 'lawfare' to stop a presidential candidate. I'm not talking about violence. I'm talking about tit-for-tat.\"\n\nIn a post on X, Republican House candidate Brandon Gill of Texas lamented what he viewed as \"raw power\" rather than an \"equally applied legal system\" in the charges being brought against Trump: \"Might makes right,\" he said. \"Republicans must wake up to the new reality and respond accordingly.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe outcry comes as Trump and other Republicans have claimed, without evidence, that Biden and his administration were pulling the strings behind the New York trial. The case was led by a state-level prosecutor, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nHush money conviction pays off for Trump campaign\n\nCNN's Alayna Treene looks at how the hush money conviction is paying off for Trump's campaign.\n\nBiden addressed Trump's attacks on the judicial system during a fundraiser Monday night in Connecticut, calling them \"dangerous for American democracy,\" and noted that the former president was convicted in a state case rather than a federal one. Attorney General Merrick Garland criticized the idea that the federal government was involved as a conspiracy theory during an appearance Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, calling it an attack on the judicial process.\n\n\"We do not control the Manhattan district attorney,\" Garland said Tuesday. \"The Manhattan district attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes his own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.\"\n\nRepublicans have pointed to real elements of the case to argue it was politically driven. For one, Bragg, a Democrat, campaigned for office in 2021 in part on his qualifications to take over the office's investigation into Trump. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, donated $15 to Biden in 2020 and has a daughter who works in Democratic politics, though he has said neither affected his ability to be impartial. And prosecutor Matthew Colangelo joined Bragg's office after serving in the Biden administration's Department of Justice.\n\nTrump also has criticized Bragg for bringing the case in 2023, when his alleged crime was connected to a campaign seven years earlier. Bragg has defended his timing, saying he brings cases \"when they're ready.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats condemned Republican calls to use the justice system to target Democrats as \"reckless\" and potentially dangerous to democracy. They said in interviews that such a reaction was uncalled for since Trump had a fair trial by jury and has the right to appeal.\n\n\"A jury of 12 people unanimously found that beyond a reasonable doubt he committed 34 crimes,\" said Democrat North Carolina Rep. Deborah Ross, the vice-ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. \"That is entirely different than coming up with specious charges and having members of Congress dictate who should be sued in frivolous ways.\"\n\nMaryland Rep. Glenn Ivey, another Democrat on the committee, said there's a history of Republicans prosecuting Democrats and vice versa, but he feels \"relatively confident that these cases will continue to be resolved by jurors who come to the jury box taking their job seriously and trying to follow the evidence and the law.\"\n\nAs Trump awaits his sentencing next month, prominent Democrats also are facing high-profile prosecutions. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez is currently on trial on federal bribery charges in New York, while Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife were indicted last month on conspiracy and bribery charges.\n\nHunter Biden, the president's son, is on trial this week on federal gun charges. And on Wednesday, House Republicans issued criminal referrals against him and his uncle, James Biden. They accused the president's family members of making false statements to Congress as part of a year-long impeachment inquiry. So far, GOP lawmakers have failed to uncover evidence directly implicating President Joe Biden in any wrongdoing.\n\nTrump has given different signals in the past on whether he believes prosecuting political enemies is appropriate.\n\nIn a campaign video last August, he called on Republican attorneys general and district attorneys to \"closely\" watch the trials against him: \"It's an eye for an eye, or it's fight fire with fire.\" But in a town hall in February, he responded to concerns that his second term would be focused on settling old scores by saying, \"My revenge will be a success.\"\n\n8 political cartoons judge Donald Trump's criminal conviction Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

Mike Collins of Georgia wrote on the social platform X, formerly Twitter, after a Manhattan jury found Trump guilty.\n\nInfluential conservative activist Charlie Kirk urged Republican prosecutors to get \"creative\" in bringing charges: \"Indict the left, or lose America,\" he said on X.\n\nIn a podcast interview, Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., said, \"We have to fight fire with fire.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Wouldn't that be a terrible thing? But they want to do it,\" Trump said in an interview on Newsmax. \"It's a terrible, terrible path that they're leading us to. And it's very possible that it's going to have to happen to them.\"\n\nThe calls to weaponize the judicial system against Democrats are a degree more intense than some other suggestions for retaliation that Republicans have made since the guilty verdict, such as calls to investigate the prosecutors in the Manhattan case or for voters to give their own verdict by sending Trump back to the White House in November.\n\nThey represent a show of loyalty to Trump, who has spent months calling the cases against him a form of partisan \"election interference\" and referring to President Joe Biden's administration as \"evil\" and \"corrupt.\" They also signal a growing feeling among some Republicans that the felony conviction of a former president for falsifying business records to illegally influence an election crossed a boundary in judicial norms.\n\n\"What just happened today is a line we can't uncross,\" conservative talk show host Megyn Kelly said after Trump was found guilty. \"And these Democrats will rue the day they decided to use 'lawfare' to stop a presidential candidate. I'm not talking about violence. I'm talking about tit-for-tat.\"\n\nIn a post on X, Republican House candidate Brandon Gill of Texas lamented what he viewed as \"raw power\" rather than an \"equally applied legal system\" in the charges being brought against Trump: \"Might makes right,\" he said. \"Republicans must wake up to the new reality and respond accordingly.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe outcry comes as Trump and other Republicans have claimed, without evidence, that Biden and his administration were pulling the strings behind the New York trial. The case was led by a state-level prosecutor, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nHush money conviction pays off for Trump campaign\n\nCNN's Alayna Treene looks at how the hush money conviction is paying off for Trump's campaign.\n\nBiden addressed Trump's attacks on the judicial system during a fundraiser Monday night in Connecticut, calling them \"dangerous for American democracy,\" and noted that the former president was convicted in a state case rather than a federal one. Attorney General Merrick Garland criticized the idea that the federal government was involved as a conspiracy theory during an appearance Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, calling it an attack on the judicial process.\n\n\"We do not control the Manhattan district attorney,\" Garland said Tuesday. \"The Manhattan district attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes his own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.\"\n\nRepublicans have pointed to real elements of the case to argue it was politically driven. For one, Bragg, a Democrat, campaigned for office in 2021 in part on his qualifications to take over the office's investigation into Trump. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, donated $15 to Biden in 2020 and has a daughter who works in Democratic politics, though he has said neither affected his ability to be impartial. And prosecutor Matthew Colangelo joined Bragg's office after serving in the Biden administration's Department of Justice.\n\nTrump also has criticized Bragg for bringing the case in 2023, when his alleged crime was connected to a campaign seven years earlier. Bragg has defended his timing, saying he brings cases \"when they're ready.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats condemned Republican calls to use the justice system to target Democrats as \"reckless\" and potentially dangerous to democracy. They said in interviews that such a reaction was uncalled for since Trump had a fair trial by jury and has the right to appeal.\n\n\"A jury of 12 people unanimously found that beyond a reasonable doubt he committed 34 crimes,\" said Democrat North Carolina Rep. Deborah Ross, the vice-ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. \"That is entirely different than coming up with specious charges and having members of Congress dictate who should be sued in frivolous ways.\"\n\nMaryland Rep. Glenn Ivey, another Democrat on the committee, said there's a history of Republicans prosecuting Democrats and vice versa, but he feels \"relatively confident that these cases will continue to be resolved by jurors who come to the jury box taking their job seriously and trying to follow the evidence and the law.\"\n\nAs Trump awaits his sentencing next month, prominent Democrats also are facing high-profile prosecutions. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez is currently on trial on federal bribery charges in New York, while Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife were indicted last month on conspiracy and bribery charges.\n\nHunter Biden, the president's son, is on trial this week on federal gun charges. And on Wednesday, House Republicans issued criminal referrals against him and his uncle, James Biden. They accused the president's family members of making false statements to Congress as part of a year-long impeachment inquiry. So far, GOP lawmakers have failed to uncover evidence directly implicating President Joe Biden in any wrongdoing.\n\nTrump has given different signals in the past on whether he believes prosecuting political enemies is appropriate.\n\nIn a campaign video last August, he called on Republican attorneys general and district attorneys to \"closely\" watch the trials against him: \"It's an eye for an eye, or it's fight fire with fire.\" But in a town hall in February, he responded to concerns that his second term would be focused on settling old scores by saying, \"My revenge will be a success.\"\n\n8 political cartoons judge Donald Trump's criminal conviction 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "journalstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "JournalStar.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@journalstar.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "j_scott_applewhite@journalstar.com", "name": "J.

And prosecutor Matthew Colangelo joined Bragg's office after serving in the Biden administration's Department of Justice.\n\nTrump also has criticized Bragg for bringing the case in 2023, when his alleged crime was connected to a campaign seven years earlier. Bragg has defended his timing, saying he brings cases \"when they're ready.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats condemned Republican calls to use the justice system to target Democrats as \"reckless\" and potentially dangerous to democracy.

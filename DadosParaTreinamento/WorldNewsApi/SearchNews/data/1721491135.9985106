Martinez-Hernandez, 23, illegally crossed into the US in February 2023. He was arrested in Tulsa, Okla., on Friday after police matched his DNA to the gruesome crime scene. \u201cANOTHER one of Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s Illegal Immigrant Criminals was just charged with raping and murdering ANOTHER innocent American woman!\u201d Trump, 78, raged on Truth Social. The presumptive Republican nominee for president likened Morin\u2019s slaying to the February murder of 22-year-old Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, whose alleged killer also entered the US illegally. \u201cRachel Morin was on a run in Maryland, just like Laken Riley was in Georgia, when she was brutally killed by an illegal monster who was wanted for murder in El Salvador and fled to the USA because he knew Crooked Joe would let him in,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cNow Rachel Morin\u2019s 5 young children will grow up without their mother because Crooked Joe refuses to shut down the border.\u201d Authorities said Martinez-Hernandez has ties to Salvadoran street gangs and a violent history. He\u2019s wanted for the assault of a mother and young girl in Los Angeles and a murder in El Salvador, according to officials. Trump railed against his 2024 opponent over his administration\u2019s plan to offer work permits and deportation protections to illegal immigrants who marry American citizens later this week \u2014 provided they\u2019ve lived in the US for at least 10 years. \u201cAs a matter of fact, this week, Biden is preparing to give MASS AMNESTY to hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens!\u201d he said. \u201cThis is unsustainable and can\u2019t be allowed to continue!\u201d Trump vowed to \u201cSHUT DOWN THE BORDER and start deporting millions of Biden\u2019s Illegal Criminals\u201d on day one of his administration if elected. \u201cWe will once again put AMERICANS First and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!\u201d he added. \u201cTo Rachel Morin\u2019s family and especially her 5 children, May God be with you!\u201d The Post has reached out to the Biden campaign for comment.", "summary": "The 37-year-old mother of five was killed on a Bel Air, Md., hiking trail on Aug. 5, 2023, by migrant Victor Martinez-Hernandez, according to police.\u00a0", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/17/us-news/trump-blames-biden-for-rachel-morins-murder-joe-refuses-to-shut-down-the-border/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/COMP-2157122278-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/m0W5LvNh-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:12:30", "author": "Victor Nava", "authors": ["Victor Nava"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.181}

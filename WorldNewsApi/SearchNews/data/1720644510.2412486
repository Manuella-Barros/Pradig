{"id": 231205986, "title": "Anatomy of golden glory: How Ireland&#039;s 4x400m relay heroes made history in Rome\u00a0", "text": "Before the race, everyone knew the Dutch, the odds-on favourites, would be Ireland\u2019s biggest rivals in the battle for gold, given they edged the Irish to silver at the World Relays last month by just eight hundredths of a second. To beat them, Ireland knew they had to get the baton to Mawdsley with a decent lead on Dutch anchor Femke Bol, who time and again has produced remarkable comebacks when placed in that position. But while Bol was the trump card for the Netherlands, Rhasidat Adeleke was that for those in green, and it was one the Irish would play earlier in the race. When the Dubliner took the baton from Chris O\u2019Donnell, she was in fourth, and she ripped through the opening 100 metres of her leg in a remarkable 11.10 seconds. She covered the next 100 metres in 11.23 seconds, a 22.33-second first 200m that carried her to front \u2013 just about. But she had company, unwanted company, with Lieke Klaver of the Netherlands utilising her vast speed to battle Adeleke as they entered the final turn. They had done this same thing at the World Relays, and the pair went to war again, fighting for the lead, damn near emptying the tank to get it. Adeleke won the battle, swooping to the front on the final turn, but in the end it took a substantial toll on both. Adeleke tied up down the home straight, inevitably, her second 200m covered in 27.20. But by drawing Klaver into that fight, she had taken her into a state of deep, dark distress, and Klaver was wading through treacle up the home straight, her last 200m covered in just 28.37, her last 100m in a painful, pedestrian 15.36. Suddenly, that left the Dutch a whopping 1.2 seconds adrift of the Irish at halfway, a gap that narrowed to exactly one second ahead of the final leg following a remarkable 44.90-second split from Thomas Barr, the quickest of the Waterford athlete\u2019s life, right when his country needed it most. Now, Bol might gobble up a one-second gap on most international 400m athletes, but not on Mawdsley, who, for all of the breakthroughs she\u2019s made individually over the past year, continually rises to a new level when she\u2019s running with a baton. In truth, Mawdsley had little to fear from the two athletes sandwiching her on that final leg \u2013 Belgium\u2019s Charlie Carvell out front and Italy\u2019s Alice Mangione just behind. The real threat, she knew, was 10 metres back in fourth. But Bol made little inroads over the opening half, and while she ran down the Belgians to take bronze in the end, her 49.21 split was not nearly enough to threaten Mawdsley, who clocked the second fastest female split of the entire race with a remarkable 49.40. The moments after the finish were lost in delirium, the quartet running to the Irish fans clustered near the finish, getting swallowed up in a sea of smiles and hugs, their exhaustion melting away amid the elation. The judgment from Sharlene \u2026The crackle in Greg\u2019s voice\u2026. The Irish fans at the finish line\u2026..That was pure magic and a moment that will never be forgotten ?One for Reeling in the Years to bookmark ?#IrishAthletics #EuropeanChampions #Roma24 pic.twitter.com/gXf5e0vQUg\u2014 Athletics Ireland (@irishathletics) June 7, 2024 They did something only Sonia O\u2019Sullivan achieved in the 90-year history of this event, winning gold, producing one of the finest team performances in Irish athletics history. Maybe the best of all. Their time, 3:09.92, was just one second shy of the world record, bringing them home ahead of Italy (3:10.69) with the Netherlands third in 3:10.73. That has only ever been bettered five times in a mixed relay. Four of those times were run to win world or Olympic titles. The fifth was to win a world silver medal. That\u2019s the standard the Irish have reached now, and they\u2019re front and centre in the conversation for an Olympic medal in Paris in eight weeks\u2019 time. This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone who\u2019s followed their trajectory in recent years, specifically the steady but relentless rise of Adeleke and Mawdsley to world-class levels. Both of them will line up for tomorrow\u2019s 400m semi-finals knowing a place in Monday\u2019s final is almost assured, barring disaster. Both hold realistic medal claims, with Poland\u2019s Natalia Kaczmarek the big threat in the race for gold. Of course, every relay is a team event in the true sense, and while O\u2019Donnell turned in a fine opening leg, and Barr a truly astonishing third leg, in essence, the story of this gold was that one Irishwoman made the race, and then another won it. By doing what she did on that second leg, and putting Klaver to the sword, Adeleke died a relative death up the home straight, but she knew her chief rival would die an even bigger one. As such, Adeleke perfectly teed up Mawdsley to deliver the glittering gold. And Mawdsley, who at times in the past has got things wrong on the big stage, was foot-perfect on the final leg. It was a cool, clinical display of giant-killing to take down the Dutch and the rest of Europe, and at 5:35pm local time today, the four will be rewarded by stepping up on top of the podium, watching that tricolour rise, as Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann blares out alongside Rome\u2019s Stadio Olimpico. Athletics is a cruel, lonely sport, and every one of them has undoubtedly shed tears on the journey to this point. But soon they\u2019ll flow for a very different reason.", "summary": "Adeleke dragging the Dutch into deep waters. Mawdsley foot-perfect in the finale.

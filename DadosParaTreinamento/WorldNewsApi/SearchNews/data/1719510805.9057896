{"id": 223687254, "title": "More seniors are using homeless shelters. Here's why, according to experts", "text": "One of the country\u2019s homeless shelters has seen an uptick in the number of people through its doors, including more adults over 50. The Mustard Seed, which has facilities in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan, reported 8 per cent of individuals seeking shelter are older than 65. \u201cWe\u2019ve had individuals who are up to the age of 80,\u201d said Samantha Lowe, the Director of Shelter Operations with the Mustard Seed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had individuals palliate or seek staying in the shelter at the end of their life.\u201d According to a study, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, that analyzed homelessness across the country, more older people in shelters is a national issue. The report classified seniors as people over 50 because of documented physical and mental decline at that age. The main author of the report, Dr. Jillian Alston, says people who experience homelessness age faster than those who are housed. \u201cThis is due to a number of things like difficulty navigating health care, preventative health care and other things required for maintaining our well-being and health,\u201d said Dr. Alston. The study found the people making up the growing 50 plus demographic aren\u2019t just those who\u2019ve experience chronic homelessness for years and years but also those who are finding themselves in the situation for the first time later on in life. Several factors are contributing to the concerning trend, including the country\u2019s housing crisis and high inflation rates. High rent, mental health access \u201cAnd then either they\u2019ve experienced a health emergency or they\u2019ve experienced a sudden increase in rent and they are unable to afford both food, shelter and medication,\u201d said Lowe. The older demographic is also facing other complications that come with aging, including transitioning out of the workforce and being on a fixed income. Then there are health factors such as mobility issues and dementia. \u201cI do see a number of individuals where it\u2019s actually been their dementia that has led to difficulty with maintaining their housing such as you know not paying bills and getting evicted,\u201d said Dr. Alston. Cognitive issues such as dementia can also lead to challenges when it comes to care in the shelters. \u201cWe can try to get them to appointments. We can try to get them into housing,\u201d said Lowe. \u201cWe can try to figure out pathways out of the shelter. But that cognitive impairment is a huge barrier in and of itself. Shelters aren't built for seniors This sentiment is underscored by another finding in the study that most shelters across the country are not designed to help an older demographic with their physical and mental needs. Dr. Alston says a collaboration between health and long-term care and other social services is needed to address the issue. \u201cHaving cross-sectoral efforts to just really harmonize health care housing shelters to improve the lives of older adults who are experiencing homelessness,\u201d she said. Dr. Alston says Scarborough Village Residents is an example of one shelter in Canada that is designed to accommodate the health-care needs of clients over 50. \u201cThere is embedded health care supports, embedded hearing clinic, embedded physiotherapy and nursing for giving medications on site.\u201d The Mustard Seed in Edmonton has partnered up with other agencies to offer health care services. \u201cBut we\u2019re not able to provide that in all of our shelters because there isn\u2019t either funding or an organization available to do so,\u201d said Lowe. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex population in that we do need to serve and we\u2019re looking to expand a lot of the services that we have so we can target that specific population.\u201d", "summary": "One of the country\u2019s homeless shelters has seen an uptick in the number of people through its doors, including more older adults over 50.", "url": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/more-seniors-are-using-homeless-shelters-here-s-why-according-to-experts-1.6900004", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/5/24/homeless-seniors-1-6900035-1716583207538.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:57:41", "author": "Kathy Le", "authors": ["Kathy Le"], "language": "en", "source_country": "CA", "sentiment": 0.135}

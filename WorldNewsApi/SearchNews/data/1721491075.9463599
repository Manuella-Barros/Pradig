{"id": 237080494, "title": "White House slams 'cheapfake' clips portraying Biden 'freezing'", "text": "\"This was widely fact-checked... including by conservative media,\" she said at a media briefing, adding \"if you run that tape a little bit longer than you'd see ... what was happening\". Earlier in the week NBC also debunked the claim, posting footage caught by its own cameras from another angle online which showed Biden interacting with the parachutists just a few feet away. Another widely-shared clip was a close-up shot of Biden standing still as world leaders danced close to him during a concert at the White House - which opponents said showed a state of confusion. \"The president stood there listening to the music, and he didn't dance. Excuse me. I did not know not dancing was (...) a health issue,\" Jean-Pierre said of the video. And on the weekend, the New York Post again shared a video appearing to show Biden getting lost on stage during a fundraising event in California, before being pointed to an exit by former president Barack Obama. Andrew Bates, another White House spokesman, said on X that Biden was instead waiting on the stage to appreciate the applause from his supporters. Eric Schultz, a senior Obama adviser, posted a link to the Post article on X, writing: \"This did not happen.\" Biden's main rival in the November election, Republican Donald Trump, has made Biden's advancing age one of his main campaign rallying points, trying to position himself as an energetic alternative - despite being, at 78, just three years younger. Whoever wins the vote will set a new age record. Biden is already the oldest man to hold the office and would continue to be so, while if Trump wins, he would become the oldest ever at an inauguration.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/white-house-joe-biden-cheapfake-clips-freezing-4417471", "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--xrn8SbdI--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/c8e16dbfa2c435e40db933ba6c6569d48e352cdc.jpg?itok=", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:29:00", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": 0.105}

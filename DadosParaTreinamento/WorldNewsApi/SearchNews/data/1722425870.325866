{"id": 243230154, "title": "Nigel Lythgoe Dismissed From Sexual Assault Lawsuit by &#8216;All American Girl&#8217; Contestants", "text": "A California judge has dismissed Nigel Lythgoe as a defendant in the sexual assault lawsuit by two All American Girl contestants. At a Friday afternoon hearing, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Shirley K. Watkins ruled that the two Jane Doe plaintiffs who brought a joint lawsuit in January do not qualify for revival of their claims under the law cited in their complaint. The two plaintiffs \u2014 women who competed on the reality game show executive produced by Lythgoe \u2014 alleged that Lythgoe forcibly groped and kissed them in 2003. The women filed their lawsuit under The Sexual Abuse and Cover Up Accountability Act, a California statute that reopened the window for plaintiffs to file otherwise time-barred claims of sexual abuse involving corporate entities who helped conceal the abuse. The judge said the subdivision of the law cited by the Doe plaintiffs to revive their claims is \u201cinapplicable\u201d to Lythgoe because it applies to corporate entities only. She issued her ruling \u201cwithout leave to amend,\u201d meaning the Does are barred from ever adding Lythgoe back to the complaint that now moves forward with an unidentified \u201cRoe\u201d production company as the sole defendant. \u201cToday was a good day. We\u2019ve always said that these claims were meritless and now the Court has agreed. I hope and expect that this will be the first of many similar wins as I continue to fight to clear my name,\u201d Lythgoe said in a statement sent to Rolling Stone after the ruling. During the hearing, a lawyer for the Does tried but failed to get the judge to leave the door open for a future amendment with respect to Lythgoe. The lawyer, Sahar Malek, pointed out that a proposed law known as Assembly Bill 2587 is now pending in the California state legislature. If passed, it would specifically amend The Sexual Abuse and Cover Up Accountability Act to make it clear that individuals can revive claims against individuals as well when a cover-up is alleged. \u201cWhether a law is pending or not, or whether it\u2019 going to pass or not, are complete hypothetical situations that would require rank speculation by this court,\u201d Lythgoe\u2019s lawyer, Amitabh Banerji, argued Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s proper for the court to consider pending legislation that may not even pass.\u201d The judge agreed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make a decision based upon hypotheticals that might occur in the future,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThere are no grounds at this time to grant leave to amend.\u201d The judge said that if the proposed legislation is passed and is retroactive, the Does could \u201cdecide what to do then.\u201d Malek said one option could be to file a separate lawsuit under the new law and then move to consolidate it with the current lawsuit against the corporate entity \u2014 but that would be more taxing on the \u201cresources of the court.\u201d The judge didn\u2019t budge. It was back in January that Paula Abdul first sued Lythgoe and the companies behind American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance with claims the 74-year-old producer sexually harassed and assaulted her multiple times while she was hosting or otherwise working on the reality competition shows. She claimed Lythgoe trapped her in an elevator, forced her against the wall, grabbed her genitals and breasts, and forced \u201chis tongue down her throat.\u201d Lythgoe vehemently denied the allegations. One of his lawyers called them \u201cpurely fictional\u201d in paperwork filed shortly before Abdul\u2019s lawyer announced at a hearing in April that she\u2019d reached tentative settlement agreements with American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance. The two Jane Does from All American Girl filed their lawsuit next. A third Jane Doe sued in February with claims Lythgoe groped, kissed, and digitally penetrated her in his chauffeured car in 2016. A fourth Jane Doe sued in March with claims Lythgoe sexually battered her at his home in 2018. The three remaining lawsuits against Lythgoe all cite the revival window opened by California\u2019s Sexual Abuse and Cover Up Accountability Act, but they include allegations on or after January 1, 2009, so they\u2019re not dependent on the section of the law that was ruled on by Judge Watkins on Friday. That subsection was critical to the show contestants\u2019 lawsuit because it revives any claim, no matter how old, as long as a corporate defendant is accused of engaging in a cover-up.", "summary": "The <em>American Idol</em> producer is no longer a defendant in a lawsuit that alleged he groped and forcibly kissed two contestants on the 2003 TV show <em>All American Girl</em>", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/nigel-lythgoe-dismissed-all-american-girl-contestants-lawsuit-1235049947/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Nigel-Lythgoe-Dismissed.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:51:15", "author": "Nancy Dillon", "authors": ["Nancy Dillon"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.214}

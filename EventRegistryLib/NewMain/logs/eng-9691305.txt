The Davidson County Sheriff's Office announced that Berry faces one charge of felony domestic elderly abuse/neglect with serious injuries, one misdemeanor local ordinance charge, and 20 misdemeanor animal cruelty charges.\n\nThe investigation into possible animal cruelty and elder abuse in the Denton area began after deputies received a report earlier this month. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that an elderly woman was residing in a house with more than 40 wolf-hybrid dogs and had sustained injuries that prompted authorities to conduct a welfare check at the residence. Both the interior and exterior conditions of the home were found to be unfit for living, both for humans and animals alike.\n\nThe wolf-hybrid dogs were described as unsocial and were later confirmed to be feral. As a result, the decision was made to euthanize the dogs after consulting with medical professionals and veterinarians to ensure public safety and the well-being of other pets in the area, as the dogs were exposed to and carrying diseases that posed a risk to the community.\n\nMelvin \"Sonny\" Berry is set to appear in Lexington District Court on July 23 following his arrest in the previous week. It is essential to address cases of neglect and abuse towards both vulnerable individuals and animals to ensure the safety and well-being of all members of the community.

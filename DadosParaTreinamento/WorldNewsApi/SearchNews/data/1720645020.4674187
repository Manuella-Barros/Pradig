Voters are casting ballots in two dozen languages in 27 countries with scores of different campaign issues. So here\u2019s a look at some key places to watch in the June 6-9 elections for a new European Parliament. Long-serving Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n is expected to extend his party\u2019s nearly 15-year streak of election victories when the Central European country votes in European Parliament elections on Sunday, but is facing one of the most formidable challenges of his career from a former ally. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s right-wing populist Fidesz party has taken more than 50% of the vote in the last three EU elections, and looks poised to take the most votes again this year. But a new opposition force, headed by a former Fidesz insider turned Orb\u00e1n critic, has in a matter of weeks grown to become Hungary\u2019s largest opposition party, and will likely cause Fidesz to lose at least one seat in the parliament. P\u00e9ter Magyar, a 43-year-old lawyer who was once married to Hungary\u2019s former justice minister and Orb\u00e1n ally Judit Varga, has shot to prominence since February on his public accusations of corruption and mismanagement within Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government. Magyar\u2019s party, Respect and Freedom (TISZA), has presented itself as a more centrist alternative to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s brand of illiberal populism, and is likely to gain several seats in the EU legislature. It has also capitalized on an economic crisis and disaffection with Hungary\u2019s traditional opposition parties to siphon away much of their support. PHOTOS: Here are some key races to watch in the EU Parliament elections Still, the social democratic Democratic Coalition, as well as the liberal party Momentum, could retain some of their seats, while the far-right Our Homeland party may send its first-ever delegate to Brussels after the Sunday vote. Orb\u00e1n has cast the election as an existential struggle between war and peace, telling voters that casting their ballots for his opposition would draw Hungary directly into the war in neighboring Ukraine and precipitate a global armed conflict. He has been in power since 2010. Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy party, which has neo-fascist roots, is forecast to sharply expand its number of seats in the European Parliament from seven in the last election, which could extend her influence in the EU. Her pro-Ukraine and Israel policies have proven reassuring to centrist American and European allies, but she is leading culture wars at home that preserve her far-right credentials. In Italy, the vote is not expected to destabilize the government, even if Meloni\u2019s advantage will be at the expense of her partners in the governing coalition, the populist, anti-migrant right-wing Lega, led by Matteo Salvini, and the center-right Forza Italia, led by Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani. Polling data forecasts that Brothers of Italy will get about a quarter of the vote, on par with the results of the 2022 national elections but well ahead of the last European parliamentary vote in 2019. The center-left Democratic Party is polling to come in second, followed by the opposition 5-Star Movement. Italians ages 18 and over are eligible to cast ballots to elect 76 European parliamentary seats over two days, on June 8-9. French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and the anti-immigration, nationalist ideas she has long championed are expected to be big winners in the EU elections. Pollsters expect her National Rally party to win the most of France\u2019s 81 seats, well ahead of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s moderate pro-business party. The National Rally\u2019s lead European Parliament candidate, Jordan Bardella, promises to limit free movement of migrants within the EU\u2019s open borders and dial back EU climate rules. The party no longer wants to leave the EU and the euro, but to weaken it from within. Many French voters will use the EU election to express dissatisfaction with Macron\u2019s management of the economy, farming rules, or security. That could hurt him as he tries to lead Europe-wide efforts to defend Ukraine and boost the EU\u2019s own defenses and industry. On the left, polls show a surprising resurgence of France\u2019s Socialist Party behind lead candidate Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, who pledges a more ambitious climate policy and protections for European businesses and workers. Some left-wing voters are frustrated with the staunch pro-Palestinian stance of the influential far-left France Unbowed party. France has the largest Jewish community in Europe, as well as one of the largest Muslim populations, and the Israel-Hamas war has been a flashpoint in the election campaign. In Germany, which will have the largest number of the new European Parliament\u2019s 720 seats at 96, the three parties in center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s unpopular governing coalition risk being punished by voters because of persistent squabbling and a weak economy. The mainstream center-right opposition hopes to benefit and maintain its position as the strongest German party in Brussels as it looks ahead to a national election expected in the fall of next year. But much attention will be on the performance of the far-right Alternative for Germany, which has enjoyed strong support over the past year but has been hit by a string of setbacks going into the European election. Among those are scandals surrounding its top two candidates for the EU legislature. The party can expect to make gains on its performance in 2019, but perhaps not as much as it hopes. Voters in Slovakia will cast ballots in the European Union parliamentary elections on Saturday just weeks after an attempt to assassinate populist Prime Minister Robert Fico. Analysts expect the event that sent shockwaves through the nation of 5.4 million to be a boost for turnout, which was the lowest of the entire bloc in 2014 and 2019. It\u2019s also predicted to increase the chances of Fico\u2019s leftist Smer (Direction) party, the senior partner in the governing coalition, to win the vote. Smer is in a close race against the main opposition Progressive Slovakia, a pro-Western liberal party. Fico\u2019s group has been attacking the EU\u2019s support for Ukraine, as well other policies on immigration, climate change and LGBTQ+ rights. Two other political groups are far behind: the Republic, a far-right party that wants Slovakia out of NATO; and Hlas (or the Voice), another leftist coalition party previously led by Fico\u2019s close ally Peter Pellegrini, who will be inaugurated as the country\u2019s president next week. Slovakia contests 15 seats in the election.", "summary": "It's easy to get overwhelmed by the EU elections.

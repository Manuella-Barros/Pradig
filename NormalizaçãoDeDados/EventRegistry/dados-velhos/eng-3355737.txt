Iran's parliament gave initial approval on Sunday to a bill to boost spending on Tehran's missile programme and the elite Revolutionary Guards in retaliation for new sanctions imposed by the United States.\n\nLawmakers overwhelmingly approved the outlines of the bill to \"counter America's terrorist and adventurist actions\" as some chanted \"Death to America\", the state broadcaster IRIB reported.\n\nThe measure came in retaliation to legislation passed by U.S Congress and signed by U.S. President Donald Trump in early August to impose new sanctions on Iran over its missile programme.\n\nIran denies its missile programme violates a U.N. resolution which endorsed Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and calls upon the Islamic Republic not to conduct activities related to ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. Tehran says it does not design such missiles.\n\nThe Iranian plan would require Iran's government and armed forces to draw up a strategy to counter U.S. violations of human rights around the world, and to support Iranian bodies and individuals affected by U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe measure would also allocate over $260 million each to Iran's ballistic missile programme and the Quds Force - the external arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has been deployed to battlefields in Iraq and Syria.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told members of parliament that the government backed the bill, which he said \"was designed wisely so that it does not violate the (nuclear deal) and provide excuses for opposing sides\", state news agency IRNA reported.\n\nThe bill must now pass a second vote before being submitted to a clerical body for final approval and passage into law.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T09:38:00Z", "sim": 0.9882352948188782, "source": {"uri": "in.reuters.com", "title": "Reuters India", "id": "630"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:38:00", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/iran-usa-parliament-idINKCN1AT09H", "storyUri": "eng-3358251", "id": "8896870", "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170813&t=2&i=1196905949&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXNPED7C05L", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "09:38:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

more than half a billion dollars in funding for the country's missile programme and foreign operations of the elite Revolutionary Guards in response to US sanctions.\n\nThe move follows a spike in tensions between Tehran and Washington since US President Donald Trump took office in January with a vow to get tough on the Islamic republic.\n\n\"The Americans should know that this was our first action,\" said parliament speaker Ali Larijani, after announcing overwhelming support for a package \"to confront terrorist and adventurist actions by the United States in the region\".\n\nAfter the vote result was announced, lawmakers shouted: \"Death to America.\"\n\nA total of 240 parliamentarians out of 244 present voted for the bill.\n\nIt mandates the government to allocate an additional $260 million for missile development and the same amount to the Revolutionary Guards' foreign operations wing, the Quds Force, state news agency IRNA said.\n\nThe Quds Force leads Iran's military role in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe vote came after the United States imposed fresh US sanctions against Iran in July, targeting its missile programme.\n\nTehran says the measures violate a 2015 deal with world powers that eased sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme.\n\nTrump repeatedly threatened to tear up what he once called \"the worst deal ever\", but last month he backed away from a key campaign promise to withdraw from the nuclear agreement.\n\n'Hostile US actions'\n\nIran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the bill passed on Sunday had the support of the government.\n\nThe bill is \"very smart particularly because it doesn't violate the nuclear deal and doesn't allow the other side to make excuses,\" he added.\n\n\"Iran boasts potential and actual options to confront hostile US actions\".\n\nThe United States has had no diplomatic ties with the Iran since 1980, and Trump has halted the direct contacts initiated by his predecessor Barack Obama.\n\nA string of close encounters between US ships and Iranian vessels in the Gulf in recent months has added to the tensions between the two countries.\n\nAraghchi said that the Iranian bill was a far-reaching response to the measures passed by US Congress that Iranian media have called the \"mother of sanctions\" because they sum up all existing anti-Iran sanctions.\n\nThe bill sends \"a direct message of Iran's dissatisfaction with the violations of the deal by the other side while avoiding breaching it in the process,\" Foad Izadi, a professor of international politics at Tehran University, told AFP.\n\nBy defining the cost to the US of violating the nuclear deal, the Iranian bill would help to safeguard the agreement, he said.\n\n\"When the other side doesn't pay any price, it breaches the deal with no obstacles, but it is hoped that if they are to pay the costs, at least they calculate them and reduce their violations.\"\n\nThe bill's text said that Iran \"recognises the entire American military and intelligence forces as terrorist groups\" for their \"implicit and explicit support for terrorist groups\" in the region, their role in creating the Islamic State group, and \"the support for violators of fundamental humans rights especially the dictator and violent regimes\".\n\nUnder the law, the foreign ministry is tasked to create and publish a blacklist of people to be put under sanctions -- in cooperation with the Revolutionary Guards' foreign operations wing, Central Bank, and ministry of intelligence.\n\nTehran's sanctions aim to ban such persons

approved more than half a billion dollars in funding for the country's missile programme and foreign operations of the elite Revolutionary Guards in response to US sanctions.\n\nThe move follows a spike in tensions between Tehran and Washington since US President Donald Trump took office in January with a vow to get tough on the Islamic republic.\n\n\"The Americans should know that this was our first action,\" said parliament speaker Ali Larijani, after announcing overwhelming support for a package \"to confront terrorist and adventurist actions by the United States in the region\".\n\nAfter the vote result was announced, lawmakers shouted: \"Death to America.\"\n\nA total of 240 parliamentarians out of 244 present voted for the bill.\n\nIt mandates the government to allocate an additional $260 million for missile development and the same amount to the Revolutionary Guards' foreign operations wing, the Quds Force, state news agency IRNA said.\n\nThe Quds Force leads Iran's military role in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe vote came after the United States imposed fresh US sanctions against Iran in July, targeting its missile programme.\n\nTehran says the measures violate a 2015 deal with world powers that eased sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme.\n\nTrump repeatedly threatened to tear up what he once called \"the worst deal ever\", but last month he backed away from a key campaign promise to withdraw from the nuclear agreement.\n\nIran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the bill passed on Sunday had the support of the government.\n\nThe bill is \"very smart particularly because it doesn't violate the nuclear deal and doesn't allow the other side to make excuses,\" he added.\n\n\"Iran boasts potential and actual options to confront hostile US actions\".\n\nThe United States has had no diplomatic ties with the Iran since 1980, and Trump has halted the direct contacts initiated by his predecessor Barack Obama.\n\nA string of close encounters between US ships and Iranian vessels in the Gulf in recent months has added to the tensions between the two countries.\n\nAraghchi said that the Iranian bill was a far-reaching response to the measures passed by US Congress that Iranian media have called the \"mother of sanctions\" because they sum up all existing anti-Iran sanctions.\n\nThe bill sends \"a direct message of Iran's dissatisfaction with the violations of the deal by the other side while avoiding breaching it in the process,\" Foad Izdi, a professor of international politics at Tehran University, told AFP.\n\nBy defining the cost to the US of violating the nuclear deal, the Iranian bill would help to safeguard the agreement, he said.\n\n\"When the other side doesn't pay any price, it breaches the deal with no obstacles, but it is hoped that if they are to pay the costs, at least they calculate them and reduce their violations.\"\n\nThe bill's text said that Iran \"recognises the entire American military and intelligence forces as terrorist groups\" for their \"implicit and explicit support for terrorist groups\" in the region, their role in creating the Islamic State group, and \"the support for violators of fundamental humans rights especially the dictator and violent regimes\".\n\nUnder the law, the foreign ministry is tasked to create and publish a blacklist of people to be put under sanctions -- in cooperation with the Revolutionary Guards' foreign operations wing, Central Bank, and ministry of intelligence.\n\nTehran's sanctions aim to ban such persons from entering Iran, confiscate their assets within the powers of the Islamic republic, and block their financial transactions.\n\nIt excludes whistleblowers who reveal America's \"illegal activities, crimes, torture and election fraud\", namely in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere.\n\nThe bill also mandates the economy ministry to prioritise deals with countries and companies that ignore financial and military sanctions on Iran.\n\nIt orders the foreign ministry and the judiciary to take measures to protect Iranians in US prisons for violation of sanctions or facing persecution and extradition elsewhere.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri":

programme and foreign operations of the elite Revolutionary Guards in response to US sanctions.\n\nThe move follows a spike in tensions between Tehran and Washington since US President Donald Trump took office in January with a vow to get tough on the Islamic republic.\n\n\"The Americans should know that this was our first action,\" said parliament speaker Ali Larijani, after announcing overwhelming support for a package \"to confront terrorist and adventurist actions by the United States in the region\".\n\nAfter the result was announced, lawmakers shouted: \"Death to America.\"\n\nA total of 240 parliamentarians out of 244 present voted for the bill.\n\nIt mandates the government to allocate an additional $260 million for the \"development of the missile programme\" and the same amount to the Revolutionary Guards' foreign operations wing, the Quds Force, state news agency IRNA said.\n\nThe Quds Force leads Iran's military role in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe vote came after the United States imposed fresh US sanctions against Iran in July, targeting its missile programme.\n\nTehran says the measures violate a 2015 deal with world powers that eased sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme.\n\nTrump repeatedly threatened to tear up what he once called \"the worst deal ever\", but last month he backed away from a key campaign promise to withdraw from the nuclear agreement.\n\n- 'Hostile US actions' -\n\nIran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the bill passed on Sunday had the support of the government.\n\nThe bill is \"very smart particularly because it doesn't violate the nuclear deal and doesn't allow the other side to make excuses,\" he added.\n\n\"Iran boasts potential and actual options to confront hostile US actions\".\n\nThe United States has had no diplomatic ties with the Iran since 1980, and Trump has halted the direct contacts initiated by his predecessor Barack Obama.\n\nA string of close encounters between US ships and Iranian vessels in the Gulf in recent months has added to the tensions between the two countries.\n\nAraghchi said that the Iranian bill was a far-reaching response to the measures passed by US Congress that Iranian media have called the \"mother of sanctions\" because they sum up all existing anti-Iran sanctions.\n\n\"Iran recognises the entire American military and intelligence forces as terrorist groups\" for their \"implicit and explicit support for terrorist groups\" in the region, their role in creating the Islamic State group, and \"the support for violators of fundamental humans rights especially the dictator and violent regimes,\" the bill's text said.\n\nUnder the law, the foreign ministry is tasked to create and publish a blacklist of people to be put under sanctions -- in cooperation with the Revolutionary Guards' foreign operations wing, Central Bank, and ministry of intelligence.\n\nTehran's sanctions aim to ban such persons from entering Iran, confiscate their assets within the powers of the Islamic republic, and block their financial transactions.\n\nIt excludes whistleblowers who reveal America's \"illegal activities, crimes, torture and election fraud\", namely in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere.\n\nThe bill also mandates the economy ministry to prioritise deals with countries and companies that ignore financial and military sanctions on Iran.\n\nIt orders the foreign ministry and the judiciary to take measures to protect Iranians in US prisons for violation of sanctions or facing persecution and extradition

in funding for the country's missile programme and foreign operations of the elite Revolutionary Guards in response to US sanctions.\n\nThe move follows a spike in tensions between Tehran and Washington since US President Donald Trump took office in January with a vow to get tough on the Islamic republic.\n\n\"The Americans should know that this was our first action,\" said parliament speaker Ali Larijani, after announcing overwhelming support for a package \"to confront terrorist and adventurist actions by the United States in the region\".\n\nAfter the result was announced, lawmakers shouted: \"Death to America.\" A total of 240 parliamentarians out of 244 present voted for the bill.\n\nIt mandates the government to allocate an additional USD 260 million for the \"development of the missile programme\" and the same amount to the Revolutionary Guards' foreign operations wing, the Quds Force, state news agency IRNA said.\n\nThe Quds Force leads Iran's military role in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe vote came after the United States imposed fresh US sanctions against Iran in July, targeting its missile programme.\n\nTehran says the measures violate a 2015 deal with world powers that eased sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme.\n\nTrump repeatedly threatened to tear up what he once called \"the worst deal ever\", but last month he backed away from a key campaign promise to withdraw from the nuclear agreement.\n\nIran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the bill passed on Sunday had the support of the government.\n\nThe bill is \"very smart particularly because it doesn't violate the nuclear deal and doesn't allow the other side to make excuses,\" he added.\n\n\"Iran boasts potential and actual options to confront hostile US actions\".\n\nThe United States has had no diplomatic ties with the Iran since 1980, and Trump has halted the direct contacts initiated by his predecessor Barack Obama.\n\nA string of close encounters between US ships and Iranian vessels in the Gulf in recent months has added to the tensions between the two countries.\n\nAraghchi said that the Iranian bill was a far-reaching response to the measures passed by US Congress that Iranian media have called the \"mother of sanctions\" because they sum up all existing anti-Iran sanctions.\n\n\"Iran recognises the entire American military and intelligence forces as terrorist groups\" for their \"implicit and explicit support for terrorist groups\" in the region, their role in creating the Islamic State group, and \"the support for violators of fundamental humans rights especially the dictator and violent regimes,\" the bill's text said.\n\nUnder the law, the foreign ministry is tasked to create and publish a blacklist of people

Iran's parliament gave initial approval on Sunday to a bill to boost spending on Tehran's missile programme and the elite Revolutionary Guards in retaliation for new sanctions imposed by the United States.\n\nLawmakers overwhelmingly approved the outlines of the bill to \"counter America's terrorist and adventurist actions\" as some chanted \"Death to America\", the state broadcaster IRIB reported.\n\nThe measure came in retaliation to legislation passed by U.S Congress and signed by U.S. President Donald Trump in early August to impose new sanctions on Iran over its missile programme.\n\nIran denies its missile programme violates a U.N. resolution which endorsed Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and calls upon the Islamic Republic not to conduct activities related to ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. Tehran says it does not design such missiles.\n\nThe Iranian plan would require Iran's government and armed forces to draw up a strategy to counter U.S. violations of human rights around the world, and to support Iranian bodies and individuals affected by U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe measure would also allocate over $260 million each to Iran's ballistic missile programme and the Quds Force - the external arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has been deployed to battlefields in Iraq and Syria.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told members of parliament that the government backed the bill, which he said \"was designed wisely so that it does not violate the (nuclear deal) and provide excuses for opposing sides\", state news agency IRNA reported.\n\nThe bill must now pass a second vote before being submitted to a clerical body for final approval and passage into law.

Iranian officials described the request as a \"ridiculous dream that will never come true,\" at the same time raising the question of whether the same could be said about the nuclear deal's stability and implementation.\n\nFor a while, it seemed like Trump would not deliver on his electoral promise to \"rip up the nuclear deal,\" also known as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which he described as \"the worst deal ever signed.\" He had plenty of support among the Republicans regarding this position, yet once Trump reached the White House, even the deal's vocal critics, including Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, recognized that once signed, the agreement had to be upheld.\n\nYet, months of Washington and Tehran going back and forth on all the things they did not agree on seemed to cloud the administration's judgment on the only thing they had ever agreed on: the nuclear deal. This is how the conversation on a myriad of issues between the two countries and their opposing interests in the Middle East always circles back to the nuclear deal, even though upholding or breaking it most certainly would not lead to a solution of the conflict.\n\n\"It's easier to say they comply. It's a lot easier. But it's the wrong thing. They don't comply ... We'll talk about this subject in 90 days. But I would be surprised if they were in compliance,\" said Trump, mere days after begrudgingly admitting that, once again, Iran's compliance with the deal has been confirmed through regular State Department reports to Congress.\n\nSeveral days later, an anonymous U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, would travel to Vienna later this month to discuss Iran's nuclear activities with UN atomic watchdog officials as part of Washington's review of Tehran's compliance. Haley has been very active in exchanging accusations and threats with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani and his government over their ballistic missile tests, but will Haley be able to dig up dirt on Tehran's conduct prescribed by the JCPOA?\n\n\"On behalf of the Iranian people and authorities, I explicitly announce that the Islamic Republic of Iran will not start violating the JCPOA, but will not remain quiet against the United States' continuing to wriggle out of its commitments. We have no business with novice politicians, but we announce to those more experienced that the process of the JCPOA can be used as a model for relations and international law,\" said Rouhani during his inauguration ceremony, with a not-so-subtle dig at Trump's political credentials.\n\nTechnically, Rouhani is both right and wrong. Most of the UN sanctions against Iran were lifted after the signing of the JCPOA, which saw Iran give up its developing nuclear program in exchange for economic and diplomatic incentives from the European Union and the U.S. However, an arms embargo and a number of sanctions and restrictions referring to missile tests, terrorism support and human rights violations remained out of the framework of the JCPOA, proving to be a slippery convenience and a great source of grievances for Tehran and other vocal critics of the deal. Whenever there is a batch of sanctions legally and legitimately slapped on Iran under these exceptional rules, Tehran tends to mash all of its complaints into the nuclear deal issue, accusing the U.S. of violating the agreement. On the other hand, whenever Tehran tests ballistic missiles, Washington attempts to lump that issue in with the \"nuclear threat.\"\n\nSave for emotions running high, what are the facts? The U.S. argues that Iran's latest test of a rocket capable of delivering satellites into orbit was a violation of the 2015 UN Security Council resolution. U.S. officials claim that Iran can't undertake these activities because a ballistic missile would be capable of carrying a nuclear weapon, using this justification for renewed sanctions against Iran. The exact words in UN Security Council Resolution 2231 ban Tehran from conducting any activity concerning missiles designed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads, leaving room for each side to claim that the other is in violation of the agreement.\n\nUltimately, Resolution 2231 was passed as merely a ceremonial addition to the JCPOA, allowing Iran to test missiles, which was previously altogether banned. Technically, this document exists separately from the JCPOA. It is not legally binding and does not offer any mechanisms for enforcing its implementation.\n\nWhile many things may be argued about these arrangements, the fact is that the United States and Iran have different interests. To put a very complicated network of enmities, influence zones and goals in the most simple terms, Iran sees the United States' unequivocal support for Saudi Arabia and involvement in wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Yemen as a destabilizing foreign influence, guilty of facilitating radicalization and terrorism. The United States see Iran's growing influence and support for armed groups, including Hezbollah, as a threat to their allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel, and by extension, a threat to the United States. The benefits Iran received from the nuclear deal further emboldened Tehran and made them more assertive in pursuing regional and international alliances with Qatar, Russia, Turkey and China.\n\nBut the nuclear deal was never meant to change this. Maybe former U.S. president Barack Obama, who championed it in the first place, had such delusions, but Tehran never gave him any reason to believe so. Unfortunately, Trump is continuing this fallacy, expecting the JCPOA to magically tame Iran and solve problems that go way beyond the scope of nuclear weapons development.\n\n\"You cannot bring every problem that the world has with Iran into this deal, then you would never have any deal. The agreement was focused to get Iran to halt the nuclear program and to have it under proper supervision, and all the other elements were left aside, and I think that was the right thing to do. If you want to have sanctions over other issues, you can do it, but that has nothing to do with the nuclear program,\" Zoe Levornik, a postdoctoral fellow at the Stanton Nuclear Security Program at MIT's Security Studies Program told Intelligencer Post.\n\nExpecting Trump to balance the JCPOA with legitimate U.S. grievances seems to be too much of a nuance to ask from him, as Rouhani kindly pointed out in his inauguration speech. So how is he planning to wriggle, or one might say, stomp, out of the commitments?\n\nThe U.S. legal position regarding the deal is governed by the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, another document guilty of broad, ambiguous language. Under this act, Trump can stop waiving sanctions on Iran, thereby pulling out of the deal, merely because he considers the deal to be inadequate or endangering American national security interests. But if he wants to do that, he needs receipts, and according to some experts, he's not going to get any from the key player in this scenario -- the intelligence community.\n\nResident scholar of the American Enterprise Institute Gary J. Schmitt argues that the intelligence community might use this situation as payback at an administration that routinely dismisses and berates it. \"...even if some within the [Intelligence Community] believe that Iran is not complying with the agreement, just as many, or more, will contest that assessment. Given how little information the IC is likely to have and given how much of that information can likely be read in other ways, there will be more debate, dissents and general uncertainty than judgments supporting the president's view... Even in normal times, the [Intelligence Community] sees its legitimacy as resting on its independence to call it as it sees it, a stance that often means it leans toward challenging the underlying assumptions of an administration's policies. Combine that inclination with the tense relationship Donald Trump has created with the IC, and you potentially have a perfect storm brewing,\" he wrote.\n\nFor now, Trump seems willing to skip the intelligence community and send Haley directly to the UN. But what is he hoping to find? If he wants to declare Iran not in compliance through the joint commission governing the JCPOA, there are other members who need convincing. The eight-member committee includes the U.S., Iran, Russia, Britain, France, China, Germany and the European Union, and decisions require a 5-3 vote. The U.S. and its partners have agreed on red lines that Iran would have to cross in order to be declared non-compliant -- and these red lines are hardly minor offenses, let alone offenses that aren't even part of the deal. A possible \"snapback\" to sanctions described in the agreement requires a significant violation of terms from the Iranian side, and Tehran has proven that it knows how to carefully tread the line. On top of that, the EU has made it crystal clear that the nuclear deal is in its economic and diplomatic interest, which doesn't necessarily align with Trump's feelings and opinions.\n\n\"On Iran, I simply reply with the numbers of trade and investments that from the European Union have increased to Iran in terms of double digits, and this will continue. We see a security interest to not only fully implement the nuclear deal, but also engage with Iran. And we see also, obviously, an economic interest on the European Union side. We will make sure -- I think together, but particularly personally as someone that has this responsibility to ensure -- that the deal is fully implemented, and also as the European Union that is united on this,\" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini reiterated.\n\nSo if Trump cannot find any offenses that come close to crossing the red line, is his gotcha move requesting Iran to open its military sites to additional inspection not prescribed by the JCPOA going to work, even if it's just for the purposes of cornering Iran into breaching the deal, redefining it or adding certain amendments to address what he deems \"serious flaws?\" Again, it is highly unlikely, for all of the aforementioned reasons. After all, that train left the station two years ago -- but instead of steering it, Trump seems willing to crash it.\n\nSo ultimately, the U.S. can pull out because Iran is not complying with the \"spirit\" of the deal, but that is more likely to harm the U.S. than any other signee. That kind of unilateral move would result in a diplomatic crisis with China, Russia and the U.S.'s European allies, but it would also further isolate the U.S. and take away a lot of its maneuvering space with Iran legalized and legitimized by the agreement.\n\nFrom a political standpoint, it is absurd to argue about who is right and who is wrong. Each of the two sides has its own interests to consider and hoping that would somehow change just because of one signed agreement is delusional. If delusions were Obama's sin, Trump doubled down on it.\n\nOn the U.S. side, concern regarding Iran is absolutely justified. A mere glance at the Middle East news section shows that Tehran is more or less openly clashing with the United States on several fronts and showing all the determination in the world to continue doing so. The latest reports suggest that budget increases will be in place for Iran's ballistic program and Quds Force, the elite unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, charged with exporting \"the revolution,\" which is a thinly veiled euphemism for strengthening Iran's influence in the Middle East. The IRGC already has $7.4 billion at its disposal, a pretty strong signal of what Iran prizes the most.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials and conservative pundits tend to pout when Iran asserts that these enforcements are needed because of the U.S.'s support for terrorism in the Middle East, from Tehran's, or even a neutral perspective, a loyal ally of one of the world's greatest exporters of wahhabism, Saudi Arabia, can hardly accuse someone of fostering radicalization. To be fair, neither side is too concerned with terrorism when it serves its own interests, so Hezbollah's patron state may serve the \"resistance\" and \"justice\" narrative to its domestic audience, but nobody in Lebanon, Syria or Israel is going to buy that Iran cares about either of those things.\n\nWhat does Iran care about? Unlike most of its Arab neighbors, Iran is not a failed experiment of a state. For whatever it's worth, it is light years ahead of the rest of the Middle East -- save for Israel -- and it is pretty indicative of its status and power that Jerusalem feels Iran is the only realistic threat to its interests, and even existence. After the Islamic revolution, the devastating 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War and almost 20 years of isolation, Iran survived holding on to its redefined religious identity, but along the way decided that survival was not enough, and that narrative needed to change. This changed narrative, distanced from stories of martyrs for Khomeini's cause, required a lot of nuance.\n\nMore than 60% of people in Iran are younger than 30, and these people's formative years were not tied to revolution or war. Quite on the contrary, an entire generation grew up in the internet era of speedy globalization. That generation's national pride does not necessarily conflict with an open attitude towards the rest of the world. The fact that Khomeini's successors embraced nuclear weapons, which the ayatollah once prohibited showed this shift in Iranian strategy, constituting an ironic twist in which an object of the Supreme Leader's fatwa became the savior of his vision.\n\n\"For Iran, the nuclear deal was not about making a bomb in order to immediately launch it at its enemies. The message was: 'look at us; we just want to show you that, even with all the sanctions, all the obstacles, we don't need the West. We don't need anyone. We are able to make this bomb, but we don't have to. It was a road to independence and prestige in the region,\" says Levornik.\n\nThis narrative was especially important in the midst of the accelerated growth of tension and chaos in the region, and the Iranian message of survival and stability stuck well among its supporters in the neighboring Arab countries. It was a way to bolster Iran's position internationally -- and the gamble paid off with the deal. This gamble could have been expensive, given that it recently came to light that Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu had to be talked out of going into an open war with Iran by the highest military and defense officials in the country.\n\n\"Going to war would have not been possible. It wouldn't have been a 'surgical operation' like it used to be in Iraq and Syria with covert intelligence operations,\" says Levornik. \"First of all, Iran went too far with the nuclear program by that point. The scope of the operation would have been beyond anything special units or intelligence could guarantee as remaining secret or ending successful. Second, an open war with them would have been terrible, bringing destruction to the both countries.\"\n\nHassan Rouhani's second mandate-sweeping win is a strong signal that the Iranian people support the nuclear deal. \"It represents the normalization of Iran's relationship with the international community and hope for a better future,\" says Chelsi Mueller, a research fellow at the Alliance Center for Iranian Studies of Tel Aviv University. \"While senior military figures followed Khamenei's lead and endorsed the deal, framing it as an agreement that preserved Iran's legitimate rights to a peaceful nuclear program, they remain suspicious of a political opening to the West: they fear that it will open the floodgates to American cultural influence and undermine the Islamic mores that underpin the Revolution.\"\n\nMueller points out that Iran sees rights to the Persian Gulf, rights to nuclear power and rights of self-defense as its inalienable sovereign rights. For senior military officials, and by extension, the leadership of the country, all of these rights are \"interconnected and interdependent,\" she writes. And while this seems worrisome for Tehran's adversaries for many legitimate reasons, trying to fight them by constantly keeping the nuclear question on the hot stove seems rather misplaced.\n\n\"If Iran makes one bomb or a few of them, and it's not as easy as people presume, it's a nice symbol, but you cannot really do anything with that, there is no second-strike capability in the scenario of an actual nuclear conflict. You cannot threaten Israel or the United States with those bombs. There is no denying Iran's destabilizing influence in the region. But they are not ready to lead the whole country on a suicide mission. Yes, Hezbollah members are terrorists and other militia's members might be terrorists who are ready to die for the 'cause,' but these things boil down to the individuals. No leader will lead the entire nation of tens of millions of people into destruction,\" Levornik says.\n\nThe U.S. doesn't have to like or accept Iran's positions. However, grown men and women, presumed to be experienced politicians familiar with Middle Eastern social and political dynamics, shouldn't be stomping their feet just because Iran is being Iran.\n\nIf Washington decides to pull out of the agreement and Tehran follows, the worst-case scenario is that Iran will pick up the nuclear program right where it left off in a matter of a few months. In such a scenario, Trump would have a hard time convincing the American public, military leadership or intelligence community that going to war is the right thing. Netanyahu, riddled with his own scandals and hardly nurturing a good relationship with his own military and intel, would have an even harder time convincing anyone to embark on this zero-sum war.\n\nIn the less terrible scenario of the deal continuing with the remaining members, the U.S. would give up its only legitimate channel for limited direct influence on Iran. Washington would also damage its reputation in the eyes of its allies. If Trump wants to renegotiate the deal itself, rather than pull out of it, he will face both Tehran's unwillingness to compromise and EU partners who repeatedly reiterated that they would not support such a move.\n\nThe best thing Trump and Haley could do would be dropping the public rants and discussion about the deal. If there are some doubts about Iran's compliance, they should be handled quietly and covertly -- at least while they are still just doubts. The U.S. has plenty of ways to retaliate against Iran for its provocations or ballistic missiles program, be it on fronts in Yemen, Iraq or Syria, or diplomatically through the use of sanctions. And while Iran is likely to stick to these prized weapons and politics, it might even be a good development to react to Tehran's transgressions more strictly than Obama, whose constant vigilance of Iranian mood swings shaped much of his policy in the region.\n\nSpeaking of the region, Israel should not act like an underdog, given the world's worst-kept secret: its alleged own nuclear program. Whatever Iran decides to do, or not do, in the following 10 to 15 years -- give up the nuclear weapons or reach for the nuclear threshold -- Israel might want to serve its own and U.S. interests by reconsidering its multi-decade nuclear ambiguity. \"You cannot have a stable balance of power in the region if you're not willing to admit to having a bomb and discussing red lines -- that needs to change,\" says Levornik.\n\nAdmittedly, the nuclear deal is neither perfect nor eternal, nor capable of solving every problem the entire world has with Iran. No amount of backtracking and attempted renegotiating is going to change this. The train left the station long time ago, and there is no way to go but forward. Trump can either get off or try to take more control of the train, but so far, he seems hell-bent on crashing it.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T19:03:00Z", "sim": 0.800000011920929, "source": {"uri": "intelligencerpost.com", "title": "Intelligencer Post", "id": "18982"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "13:56:00", "url": "http://www.intelligencerpost.com/iran-united-states-no-friends-nuclear-deal-never-meant-change/", "storyUri": "eng-3355737", "id": "8923337", "image": "http://www.intelligencerpost.com/wp-content/uploads/11Iran7-superJumbo.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "19:03:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

resolution.\n\nIran denies developing ballistic missiles designed to carry nuclear weapons in violation of the agreement and has accused the US of breaking its word by imposing fresh sanctions.\n\nA

But we have time, and we're going to see.\"\n\n\"I think you'll see some very strong things taking place if they don't get themselves in compliance,\" he said.\n\nFormally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the deal was signed in July 2015 between Iran, the United States, Russia, China and three European powers. It gave Iran relief from all nuclear-related sanctions in exchange for rolling back its nuclear activities.\n\nThe deal went into effect in January 2016.\n\nSince his campaign trail and eight months into his tenure, Trump has made a cascade of hostile, disquieting remarks about the nuclear deal, branding it \"one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history\".\n\nYet, Trump has not abandoned the JCPOA. In July, which marked the second anniversary of the UN-endorsed accord, Trump certified reluctantly for the second time that Tehran was in compliance. By U.S. law, the administration is required to certify Iran's compliance every 90 days. Otherwise, Congress is given a 60-day period during which it can re-impose sanctions or pull out of the deal altogether.\n\nSpeculations are around that the erratic head of the Oval Office may refuse to certify Iran's compliance in October.\n\nDiscussing what he would declare after the next 180-day cycle, Trump told The Wall Street Journal two weeks ago: \"I think they'll be noncompliant.\"\n\nAlso, days after the July certification, Trump was quoted as having commissioned a group of trustworthy White House staffers to make the potential case for withholding certification of Iran in October.\n\nAlready in April, the administration said it was launching an inter-agency review of whether the removal of sanctions against Iran was in Washington's national security interests.\n\nTrump's decertification bid is highly controversial, and is not likely to persuade other signatories to the deal to find Tehran in default.\n\nUnder the deal, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, is responsible for monitoring and verifying Iran's compliance. Since the implementation of the deal the international body has confirmed Iran's compliance for six times.\n\nHowever, Tehran has accused the U.S. of violating the spirit and letter of the deal, saying Washington is making efforts to prevent the country from reaping benefits from the sanctions ease.\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria in July, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that \"the United States has failed to implement its part of the bargain,\" citing the fact that Trump had \"used his presence in Hamburg during the G20 meeting in order to dissuade leaders from other countries to engage in business with Iran.\"\n\nParagraph 26 of the nuclear deal demands the U.S. to make best efforts in good faith to sustain it and to prevent interference with the realization of the full benefit by Iran of the sanctions lifting.\n\nRichard Nephew, who coordinated sanctions policy at the State Department under Barack Obama, said that Iran has a case.\n\n\"If he truly did wander around the G20 and said, 'Don't do business with Iran,' I think that's a pretty reasonable argument for the Iranians to make,\" Fox quoted Nephew as saying.\n\n\"It's easily a violation of the spirit of the deal,\" he added. \"Based on a plain-text reading of the [nuclear deal], I would characterize that to be a breach of our obligation.\"\n\nBut U.S. leaders have frequently charged that Tehran breaks the \"spirit\" of the agreement by continuing to test-launch ballistic missiles and rockets.\n\nWashington has imposed several rounds of sanctions over the missile and rocket launches. Iran maintains those launches are for self-defense and do not violate the deal.\n\n\"The letter and the spirit of the agreement is very clear that missiles are not part of the letter or the spirit of the agreement,\" Zarif said in an interview with the United States Institute of Peace in July.\n\nUN Security Council resolution 2231, which endorses the deal, calls upon Iran \"not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-07-", "textEnd": 667, "textStart": 658}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-01-", "textEnd": 892, "textStart": 880}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T13:45:00Z", "sim": 0.7764706015586853, "source": {"uri": "tehrantimes.com", "title": "Tehran Times", "id": "7336"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "13:45:00", "url": "http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/415838/", "storyUri": "eng-3355737", "id": "8627926", "image": "http://media.mehrnews.com/d/2017/08/11/4/2540832.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "13:45:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

To avoid isolation, he's trying to blame it on Iran,\" tweeted Zarif. JCPOA stands for Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and is the official name of the deal.\n\nHe added that Trump was showing \"bad faith on top of U.S. violating the letter & spirit\" of the deal.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump blasted Iran for not failing to comply with the terms of deal and warned that \"some very strong things\" would take place if it does not start to comply.\n\n\"President Obama in his wisdom gave them $150 billion. He gave them $1.8 billion in cash. That's a hard one to figure. But that was his decision. I think it's a horrible agreement,\" he continued.\n\nThe deal gave Iran relief from sanctions in exchange for accepting curbs on its ability to make material for nuclear weapons.\n\nThe comments are in line with what Trump said of the Iran during his presidential campaign. After he was sworn in as president, Trump described the nuclear deal as \"the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated\" and accused the Islamic Republic of \"disrespecting\" the United States because of the deal.\n\nWhile Trump's administration recently confirmed that Iran is adhering to the nuclear agreement it signed with world powers in 2015, Trump and other officials in the administration have stressed that the President has reservations about the deal.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, Trump warned Iran to adhere to the terms of the nuclear deal with world powers or \"there will be big, big problems\" for Tehran.\n\nWhile lifting nuclear-linked sanctions, the United States maintains sanctions related to Iran's ballistic missile program, human rights record and its support for international terrorism.\n\nLast week, Trump signed into law a bill that imposes new sanctions on Iran, as well as on Russia and North Korea.\n\nTehran, which says the sanctions violate the terms of the nuclear agreement, has vowed an \"appropriate and proportional\" response to them.\n\n(Arutz Sheva's North American desk is keeping you updated until the start of Shabbat in New York.

Congress would then have to continue to withhold certain nuclear sanctions against Iran.\n\nThe Trump administration notified Congress of Iran's compliance for the first time in April.\n\nIn July, Trump reluctantly agreed for the second time to verify that Iran was in compliance, based on the recommendation of his national security team and the intelligence community's collection and analysis.\n\nBut the president then immediately commissioned a group of administration staffers who have no intelligence background to generate a rationale for declaring Iran to be in violation of the deal at the next 90-day review, Foreign Policy reported last month.\n\nTrump told The Wall Street Journal in late July that he expects the \"detailed studies\" he's commissioned to validate his belief that Iran is \"noncompliant.\"\n\nExperts say Trump's actions risk \"politicizing intelligence\" and undermining the agreement.\n\n\"This is a dangerous place to go. At the most basic level, one would hope that foreign policy decisions with potentially dramatic consequences would be based on the best available facts, not political pretexts,\" said David S. Cohen, who was also assistant secretary of the Treasury Department for terrorism and financial intelligence during the administration of President Barack Obama.\n\nThe head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Ali Akbar Salehi, says Tehran will keep all options on the table if the United States violates the deal.\n\nThe US will be the one to suffer if it breaches the deal, Salehi said in an interview with Lebanon-based Arabic-language al-Mayadeen news network published on Tuesday.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:01:00Z", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org", "id": "5033"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:01:00", "url": "http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/2017/iran-170811-presstv03.htm", "storyUri": "eng-3355737", "id": "8715575", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:01:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

It gave Iran relief from all nuclear-related sanctions in exchange for rolling back its nuclear activities.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump reiterated his claim that Iran is not \"living up to the spirit\" of the nuclear accord which he called a \"horrible agreement.\"\n\n\"I don't think they're living up to the spirit of the agreement,\" Trump told reporters at his golf retreat in New Jersey, where he is on a 17-day working vacation. \"I personally don't think they're in compliance. But we have time, and we're going to see.\"\n\nHe added, \"I think you'll see some very strong things taking place if they don't get themselves in compliance.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has taken a hard line against Tehran since its inauguration in January, seeking to mar the deal, which Barack Obama hailed as his signature foreign policy achievement.\n\nAs demanded by the U.S. law, Trump has so far certified Iran's compliance with the JCPOA thought he did it in July reluctantly. A third certification is due in October, a real test for Washington's commitment to a multilateral agreement endorsed by the UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2231.\n\nReacting to Trump, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Friday: \"POTUS always wanted to kill JCPOA. To avoid isolation, he's trying to blame it on Iran. Bad faith on top of US violating the letter & spirit.\"\n\nUnlike Washington, the other JCPOA signatories and the UNSC have not found Tehran in default.\n\nIn a meeting with recently sworn-in President Hassan Rouhani in Tehran on August 5, EU High Representative Federica Mogherini confirmed the bloc's commitment to the nuclear pact, urging \"all parties\" to implement it.\n\nMogherini, who is also coordinator of the JCPOA, stressed that the deal was actually delivering its objectives, which is \"confirmed by the six International Agency for Atomic Energy reports and by the economic results following the lifting of nuclear related economic and financial sanctions\".\n\nIn his inauguration speech, Rouhani implicitly warned Trump that his political life will end in failure if he violates the nuclear agreement.\n\n\"Those who want to tear apart the nuclear deal should know that they would also tear apart their political life,\" Rouhani emphasized, accusing the \"unreliable partner\" U.S. of a \"lack of commitment\" to the deal.\n\nTehran says Washington keeps ignoring the terms of the deal, particularly citing paragraphs from the JCPOA which explicitly demands the U.S. to \"make best efforts in good faith to sustain this JCPOA and to prevent interference with the realisation of the full benefit by Iran of the sanctions lifting...\"\n\nIran also says new sanctions by Washington is undermining the nuclear deal. Trump signed into law on August 3 a piece of legislation that levied new sanctions against Iran, Russia and North Korea.\n\nThe Iranian portion of the bill seeks to ban anyone dealing with Iran's ballistic missile program from entering the U.S., and blocks transactions on properties held in the U.S. by people associated with the program, the CNN reported.\n\n\"The main purpose of the United States in implementing the sanctions against Iran is to destroy the JCPOA,\" said Abbas Araqchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister who acted as a top negotiator in the nuclear talks.\n\nTehran promised retaliation though trade between the two sides is meager and there are no diplomatic relations for decades now.\n\nOn Sunday, 240 Iranian lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a retaliatory bill to pour approximately $260 million more each into ballistic missile program and the Quds Force, the external wing of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), among others.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-05", "textEnd": 2094, "textStart": 2086}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-03", "textEnd": 3296, "textStart": 3288}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-07-", "textEnd": 503, "textStart": 494}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T13:42:00Z", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "source": {"uri": "tehrantimes.com", "title": "Tehran Times", "id": "7336"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "13:42:00", "url": "http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/415894/", "storyUri": "eng-3355737", "id": "8921726", "image": "http://media.mehrnews.com/d/2017/02/24/4/2388492.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "13:42:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Why we should consider them people we can strike a deal with or why we should even care what they think is beyond me.\n\nAnd Trump charged that Iran wasn't in compliance with nuclear deal -- despite the State Dept re-certifying Iran's compliance pic.twitter.com/vEjukcLFd1\n\n-- Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) August 11, 2017\n\nThis story has been covered many times. To recap, the certification of the deal was based on the positioning that America's allies were not yet on board with abandoning the deal and the argument that as Iran had received all of its benefits up front and the nuclear control measures were downstream it served no purpose to walk from the deal, leaving Iran with over a hundred billion in cash and sanctions relieve and see the IAEA kicked out. We know that both times Trump was against the certification. This statement, sans context, is just dishonest.\n\nThis assertion is just patent bullsh**. The Iran deal is not a treaty. It has no force of law. This is how the State Department defined it at the time:\n\nThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is not a treaty or an executive agreement, and is not a signed document. The JCPOA reflects political commitments between Iran, the P5+1 (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, China) and the European Union.\n\nAny party can walk away from the deal at anytime for any, or no, reason. But, if we were any doubts about Iran's compliance those can be put away.\n\nThis:\n\nIranian leaders have breached both the resolutions and the nuclear agreement for the third time since the nuclear deal went into effect in January 2016. Iran has repeatedly test-fired, long-range ballistic missiles and laser-guided surface-to-surface missiles.\n\nThis:\n\nFor the second time, Iran has surpassed the 130 metric tonne threshold for heavy water, used to cool reactors that can produce substantial amounts of plutonium, according to the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nIn a report issued on Wednesday, the agency monitoring the deal between Iran and six world powers noted that Iran had served notice it would resolve the issue by exporting 5 metric tonnes, substantially over the 100 kilogram (220 pound) excess amount. The shipment is believed to be leaving the country within the next few days.\n\nAnd the House just passed a new round of sanctions on Iran, these targeting the IRGC, its leaders, and the companies it controls.\n\nTrump is right. Iran is in violation of the letter and the spirit of the deal. The only remaining question is if going along with this fiction is helpful. I don't think it is.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-10", "textEnd": 739, "textStart": 724, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 1871, "textStart": 1856}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-01-", "textEnd": 3167, "textStart": 3155}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T14:42:00Z", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "title": "RedState", "id": "3604"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:42:00", "url": "http://www.redstate.com/streiff/2017/08/11/trump-iran-violating-nuke-deal/", "storyUri": "eng-3355737", "id": "8639031", "image": "http://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/trump-iran-remarks.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "14:42:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

His administration recertified Iran's adherence to the deal in mid-July, but it reportedly took the better part of a day for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster to convince Trump to go along. Trump said afterward that he likely would not recertify by the next deadline, in mid-October.\n\nAnd within days of recertification, Foreign Policy reported that Trump had set up a special White House team to provide him with a path out of the deal, seemingly sidelining Tillerson, a champion of recertification. Among those on the team: Trump's top strategic adviser, Steve Bannon, and one of his deputies, Sebastian Gorka, both known for seeking to diminish America's commitments to international alliances.\n\nEvery path out has its perils. The signatories to the 2015 deal, which trades sanctions relief for Iran's rollback of its nuclear program, are Iran on one side and the United States, France, Britain, German, China and Russia on the other. Key to the success of any American pullout is to what degree its four partners-and other major trading partners with Iran, like South Korea and India-join in.\n\nShould the United States walk away from the deal, the dilemma for those countries is what costs more: alienating the United States by keeping up trade with Iran, or angering domestic economic interests by going along with tough U.S. sanctions on the oil-rich country. The less persuasive the Trump administration case is for pulling out, the likelier it is that other nations would not cooperate and would continue to do business with Iran-setting the stage for increased U.S. isolation on the world stage.\n\n\"Europeans may look to contingency and fallback options if the United States unreasonably undermines the deal,\" said Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior policy fellow for the Middle East and North Africa Program at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nIn a conference call organized by J Street, the liberal Jewish Middle East policy group that backed the deal, Geranmayeh said European officials were planning to stage an all-out effort to keep the Trump administration from bolting.\n\n\"The challenge in the next three months is keeping the United States and the Trump character personally with keeping the deal,\" she said. \"In the next 90 days you'll see a lot of activity on the Hill, in the State Department\" by European diplomats.\n\nMark Dubowitz, who directs the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a group that opposed the deal, said the Europeans would likely stick with the alliance, especially if the Trump administration's aim was not to quit the deal but to reconfigure it.\n\n\"I don't think Europeans are going to risk a transatlantic war with the administration, particularly if the administration is not looking to abrogate the deal but to improve it by addressing some of the flaws of the existing JCPOA,\" he said, referring to the formal name of the pact, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\n\nHere is a look at the possible paths out of the Iran deal for the US. and what the likely consequences would be.\n\nJust walk away\n\nU.S. assessments of Iranian adherence to the deal are governed by a law passed in 2015 with bipartisan backing, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. Under the act's broad language, there may be room for the president to stop waiving sanctions on Iran simply because he sees the deal as inadequate. Parts of the law require Iran's adherence with the JCPOA, but others are more fungible and depend on what the president determines are U.S. national security interests.\n\nUnder those circumstances, Trump has three options:\n\n* Go to the joint commission governing the JCPOA and seek to have Iran declared not in compliance. The committee has eight members-the United States, Iran, Russia, Britain, France, China, Germany and the European Union, and decisions need a 5-3 vote. Obama pitched this arrangement as a guaranteed escape hatch because five partners at the time agreed on red lines: the United States, the three European countries and the EU.\n\nTrump's policy of distancing the United States from some aspects of the European alliance-the withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, for instance-means that comity is no longer guaranteed. He would need a substantive argument that Iran is not complying-not just that he thinks the deal is bad one.\n\n* Exercise the U.S. option to trigger the \"snapback\" of international sanctions. Under this complex mechanism, the U.S. veto on the United Nations Security Council would prevent other parties from reversing the snapback and the whole deal would effectively be dead.\n\nBusting the deal just on Trump's say-so could exacerbate tensions with U.S. allies, experts said, and drive the other partners to establish a separate arrangement with Iran.\n\n\"It will be difficult for the Europeans to defy Trump because of the close security and economic relations the Europeans have with the United States,\" Geranmayeh said. \"At the same time, I don't think we should underestimate the European capacity to do so.\"\n\n* Stop waiving sanctions, but don't blow up the deal. This would have the advantage of satisfying Trump's call to exit the deal while avoiding, for now, a direct confrontation with U.S. allies, who would continue to do business with Iran under the terms of the deal. What's uncertain is whether the United States would enforce secondary sanctions-that is, punishing companies and individuals in allied countries that do business with sanctioned Iranian entities.\n\nWalk away, but explain why\n\nThere are signs that Trump is ready to make the case to the international community that Iran is not in compliance as a predicate to pulling out. Here are some strategies:\n\n* Iran is not complying with the \"spirit\" of the deal. A day after Tillerson first recertified the deal in April, Trump said at a news conference, \"They are not living up to the spirit of the agreement, I can tell you that.\"\n\nThe reference was to Iran's continued testing of ballistic missiles, its human rights abuses, its military interventionism in the region and its backing for terrorism worldwide.\n\nThe notion that Iran must abide by the deal's \"spirit\" has been perpetuated for the most part by those who opposed the deal in the first place. The Obama administration, which brokered the deal, and its European partners do not see it this way: The deal, they say, was designed to remove the threat of a nuclear Iran as a means of more effectively confronting Iran in other arenas.\n\n\"Show me in black and white where there's a definition of the 'spirit of the deal,'\" Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, a group that promoted the deal, said in an interview. \"The Obama administration was crystal clear that this is a nuclear deal, this is not a deal that affects Iranian behavior in other areas.\"\n\nAnother tack is to insist on more intrusive inspections of some Iranian military sites, which require Iranian consent under the deal. Getting backing among U.S. allies for this gambit would require persuasive evidence that Iran is violating the deal at these sites; that's not necessarily a given.\n\n* Iran is not in compliance with the letter of the deal.\n\nThis strategy was behind a letter last month by four Republican senators-Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas and David Perdue of Georgia-urging Tillerson to declare Iran not in compliance with provisions of the deal The letter noted reports that Iran had exceeded the limits of heavy water-needed to enrich uranium-allowed under the deal, and was operating more enrichment centrifuges than permitted.\n\nThe excesses have been noted by the U.N. inspection agency charged with overseeing the deal, the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, but have also been deemed not significant enough to declare Iran in violation-a posture the Obama administration embraced.\n\nConservatives say this is typical of Iranian regime behavior, pushing the envelope as far as it can, and is dangerous.\n\n\"What would be highly imprudent is to continue the Obama-era practice of offering sheepish and fainthearted certifications as a matter of course, hoping no one takes notice,\" the senators' letter said.\n\nOne possible danger in pressing forward with such an approach: The international community, which places greater stock than the Trump administration does in international organizations, would see it as nitpicking and would side with the IAEA.\n\n* Provoke Iran into leaving the deal.\n\nExperts touted this strategy following Trump's election but before he assumed office. It would involve abiding by the agreement, but increasing pressure through non-deal related sanctions, targeting Iran's government for its missile testing and adventurism, and possibly increasing U.S. military presence in the region. According to this theory, the resulting pressure by Iranian hardliners on the government of President Hassan Rouhani, which favors the deal, would lead Iran to pull out.\n\nThe problem with this idea, said Ilan Goldenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and an Obama administration Middle East policy veteran, is that Trump has made it so clear he wants out of the deal that it would seem by now to be disingenuous-American allies would smell a set-up.\n\n\"Nobody believes he's acting in good faith,\" Goldenberg said.\n\nDon't leave the deal-but make the case it must be reconfigured\n\nThe Trump administration and Congress appear to be embracing this path for now, if only by default. Congress passed new sanctions last week targeting Iran's non-nuclear activities, and Trump keeps tacking on sanctions by executive order.\n\nThe strategy, as described by Dubowitz of the anti-deal Foundation for Defense of Democracies, would be to make the case that Iran is effectively violating the agreement.\n\n\"You make it clear that they've been violating incrementally, but not egregiously-but you also make it clear the sum total ends up being egregious,\" he said \"Then you waive the existing statutory sanctions but you impose very tough, economically painful non-nuclear sanctions that target Iran's malign behavior.\"\n\nThat gives the United States and partners leverage to bring Iran back to the table and address the deal's flaws, including sunset provisions that end some of the international oversight in 15 years.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-09-09", "textEnd": 114, "textStart": 101}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-03-", "textEnd": 422, "textStart": 412}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T14:02:00Z", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "source": {"uri": "heritagefl.com", "title": "Heritage Florida Jewish News", "id": "7866"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:02:00", "url": "http://www.heritagefl.com/story/2017/08/11/news/trump-is-thinking-of-breaking-the-iran-deal-heres-how-he-could-do-it/8410.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355737", "id": "8631160", "image": "http://www.heritagefl.com/home/cms_data/dfault/photos/stories/id/1/0/8410/s_top", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "14:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Since the nuclear deal, the French press has begun to call Iran an \"El Dorado\" for French auto, energy, and high-tech firms.\n\nThese deals point to sharp objective economic conflicts between the European Union (EU) and the United States, which underlie the growing strategic and military tensions between the two blocs. Washington has threatened to abandon the Iranian nuclear deal, undertaking a 90-day review of its policies toward Tehran. Two weeks ago, the US Congress overwhelmingly passed a bill targeting Russia, North Korea, and Iran, accusing Iran of terrorism and involvement in regional wars. [Iran vehemently denies any involvement in terrorism and itself is a chief victim of terrorism].\n\nUS sanctions are aimed not only at Iran but at other powers, including China and the EU, who are developing trade ties with Tehran. US sanctions on Moscow, Pyongyang and Tehran have been sharply criticized by European powers, and Germany and France have threatened to take retaliatory sanctions against the United States.\n\nAs Iran concludes multi-billion-dollar deals with European firms, including Germany's Volkswagen and Italy's Ferrovie dello Stato, French capital is moving aggressively into Iran. This includes France's auto companies, which are desperate to boost sales amid the economic crisis in Europe.\n\nOn Monday, Iran and French car manufacturer Renault signed a \u20ac660 million deal to produce 150,000 cars a year. Renault aims to double its market share to 20 percent of the Iranian auto market by 2020. Iran produces about 1,350,000 vehicles a year and hopes to produce 3 million a year by 2025. With the new deal, Renault expects to add 150,000 vehicles a year to the Iranian market above its current capacity of 200,000 vehicles a year in Iran.\n\nThe Renault deal comes after another French carmaker, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, which has 35 percent of the Iranian market, signed a deal last year to open a plant producing 200,000 vehicles annually. Peugeot was a major producer in Iran before sanctions were imposed. PSA only avoided a fall in overall global sales last year due to increased sales in Iran.\n\nLast month, France's Total and the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) signed a 20-year, $4.9 billion contract with Iran's Petropars to invest in the South Pars offshore gas field, which is split between Iranian and Qatari waters. With an initial $1 billion investment, Total will have a 50.1 percent stake; CNPC and Petropars will own 30 and 19.9 percent, respectively.\n\nTotal CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 called the occasion \"historic\" and encouraged other companies to invest in Iran. \"We aren't a political organization, but I hope this agreement will encourage other companies to come to Iran because economic development is also a way of building peace,\" he told AFP. \"We are here to build bridges, not walls.\"\n\nTotal is working to circumvent US sanctions, appointing a compliance officer to ensure that it is not targeted by Washington -- as in 2014, when the US imposed a $9 billion fine on France's largest bank, BNP-Paribas, for violating the embargo. Iran's oil minister Bijan Namadar Zanganeh said Iran's oil industry needs some $200 billion in investment over the next five years.\n\nThe European powers long enjoyed special access to Iranian markets, as Washington cut ties with Tehran that emerged from the 1979 revolution against the CIA-backed Shah of Iran. Particularly after the Stalinist bureaucracy's dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, US-EU rivalries surged in the Persian Gulf. France's companies grabbed Iranian market share in the 1990s, while its diplomats argued that European influence in the Persian Gulf was necessary to build a \"multi-polar\" world. These tensions culminated in the illegal and unilateral US invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nIn 2006, however, Washington and the European powers jointly voted to impose sanctions against Iran over its uranium enrichment program, which Iran insisted was for peaceful purposes. Over the last decade, China has increasingly developed its trade with Iran, which joined the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and became a focus of China's plans for a web of transport, energy and trade routes across Eurasia.\n\nThe US-backed UN sanctions slashed Franco-Iranian economic ties. Trade in 2014 amounted to only \u20ac514 million, compared with \u20ac4 billion in 2004. France's market share in Iran fell from 7 percent to 1 percent.\n\nSince the 2015 nuclear deal, European ruling circles are desperate to reestablish their presence in Iran, which has the world's second-largest gas reserves and fourth-largest oil reserves, and an internal market of nearly 80 million people. The EU is likely to clash with Washington, should it seek to reimpose sanctions on Iran in the near future. After the nuclear deal was initially ratified, the European Council on Foreign Relations issued an analysis on August 26, 2015, headlined \"Europe won't bow to an anti-Iran-deal US Congress.\"\n\nIt said, \"Europeans are now looking beyond a nuclear-centric vision of Iran to focus on how they can use the opening up to engage Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's administration. Both Iran and Europe are eager to reignite their once-prosperous trade relations, and Europeans would also like to work with Iran to more constructively deescalate conflicts in the Middle East. This kind of progress can't be easily undone, and if it is, European policy makers may blame Washington rather than Tehran for prematurely derailing an agreement that was given virtually global acceptance.\"\n\nNow, European businesses hope that the reelection of the pro-business Hassan Rouhani as Iran's president will help their business interests. Tehran signed multiple contracts, worth up to \u20ac30 billion, just during Rouhani's visit to France last year.\n\nAs Washington now threatens or actually imposes sanctions against Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea -- which the Pentagon is preparing to target for military action -- European corporations are coming into strategic conflict with their \"allies\" and rivals in the United States.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-08-26", "textEnd": 5041, "textStart": 5026}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T13:25:00Z", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "source": {"uri": "iran-daily.com", "title": "iran-daily.com", "id": "2658"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "13:25:00", "url": "http://www.iran-daily.com/News/198545.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355737", "id": "8920053", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "13:25:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

It was also a clear signal the US is losing its thrall over Europe.\n\nThink about it. According to US President Donald Trump and the American Congress, Iran is the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism. And yet here we saw European leaders respectfully attending the swearing-in of the country's re-elected president. A rather big contradiction, don't you think?\n\nFederica Mogherini, the EU's highest ranking diplomat, was accompanied at the Iranian presidential ceremony by French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Germany's Minister of State Michael Roth. Also in attendance were ministers and dignitaries from Austria, Britain, Denmark, Italy, and the Netherlands, as well as many other non-European countries.\n\nSo, what's all this American talk about Iran being a rogue state, a scourge of global terrorism? The presence of European officials - and the absence of American ones - during the inauguration of President Rouhani was a spectacular demonstration of dissonance and repudiation of American policy.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago, in May, while President Trump was on his first overseas official visit in Saudi Arabia, he called on all nations of the world to boycott Iran. Trump told assembled Arab leaders then: \"All nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran,\" accusing the Islamic Republic of threatening Middle East security.\n\nEvidently, European countries have ignored Trump and his demeaning caricature of Iran.\n\nIndeed, ever since the July 2015 signing of the international nuclear accord between Iran and six other world powers (the US, Russia, China, Britain, France, and Germany), European governments and businesses have been hot on the trail to Tehran to ink new joint ventures and investment deals.\n\nThe nuclear accord - known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - has lifted international sanctions on Iran in return for it adhering to restrictions on its nuclear program to bar weaponization. Six reviews carried out by the UN watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, have verified Iran is in full compliance with its side of the JCPOA bargain.\n\nThe Europeans seem more than happy about that. Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign affairs chief, is a formidable advocate of the nuclear deal, proclaiming it a success and a source of regional stability. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif was warmly welcomed in Brussels in June when he reported via Twitter: \"Excellent meeting with leaders in Berlin, Rome and Paris. Despite reckless US hostility, EU committed to JCPOA and constructive engagement.\"\n\nEuropean investors have duly piled in to snatch part of the Iranian market of some 80 million people and the world's second and fourth largest source of natural gas and oil, respectively.\n\nThis week, two days after Rouhani's inauguration, French automaker Renault signed the \"biggest-ever\" car deal in Iran, worth \u20ac660 million, where it will manufacture 150,000 vehicles a year in partnership with two Iranian firms.\n\nLast year, French company PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citroen, announced a similar investment in Iran, worth \u20ac400 million.\n\nThe champion breakthrough for European-Iranian investment came last month when France's Total signed up to a nearly \u20ac5 billion 20-year project with Iranian and Chinese firms to develop Iran's South Pars gas field in the Persian Gulf, reckoned to be the world's biggest reserve.\n\nBoth Germany and France have seen exports to Iran soar since the implementation of the nuclear accord. Germany's by some 26 percent and France's by nearly 50 percent, according to trade figures.\n\nEric Schweitzer of the German Chamber of Commerce estimates his country's bilateral trade with Iran will double within the next two years. Being the kingpin economy of Europe that means a burgeoning relationship between the wider EU and Iran.\n\nIt was notable the EU's Mogherini said last month the JCPOA \"does not belong to any one country,\" when she met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Brussels. This was a veiled notice to the US that the Europeans intend to implement the nuclear accord with or without the Americans. Russia and China are, of course, onboard with the agreement, both having signed significant energy deals with Iran over the past year.\n\nBy contrast, Washington has signaled that it may rip up the JCPOA. President Trump has so far reluctantly gone along with the accord, which was negotiated under the previous Obama administration. Nevertheless, Trump has reportedly sidelined his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, an ex-oil CEO, and is pushing to rescind American compliance.\n\nSuch a reversal would have legal implications since the JCPOA is an internationally binding treaty confirmed by the United Nations. What Trump's White House will seek to do is either ramp up accusations that Iran is in breach of it by testing ballistic missiles or try to antagonize Iran into rejecting the JCPOA by slapping on more bilateral sanctions against the Islamic Republic. Last week, Trump signed into law new sanctions targeting Iran, as well as Russia and North Korea.\n\nThese \"secondary sanctions\" - which nominally are unrelated to the nuclear deal - will also potentially target European banks and industries over investments in Iran.\n\nThus, while European businesses and governments are legally entitled to partner with Iran due to the JCPOA terms, Washington is seeking to impose obstacles on the grounds of its bilateral sanctions based on dubious allegations of Iranian links to terrorism or illicit development of ballistic missiles.\n\nThis echoes the same repercussions for Europe about new American sanctions imposed on Russia over its natural gas delivery projects to the continent. British, French, German and Austrian energy firms are threatened with American penalties because of their partnership with Russia's Gazprom in the construction of the Nord Stream-2 pipeline.\n\nEurope's response to those American sanctions has been furious, condemning Washington's policy as blatant interference in EU energy security.\n\nIran is another flagrant case in point, where European economic and political interests are being dictated to by Washington.\n\nHowever, increasingly it seems, the Europeans are realizing through bitter experience that Washington is not acting out of some benevolent \"transatlantic unity\" but rather for its own base, selfish strategic interests.\n\nWhether it's the Paris climate agreement, the Iranian nuclear accord, or sanctions on Russian energy supplies, the Europeans are on a journey of political discovery, in which they will fully realize their so-called strategic partnership with the US is, in fact, a huge liability.\n\nAs Deutsche Welle reported earlier this month: \"Europe and USA on a collision course over Iran nuclear deal.\"\n\nEurope needs to extricate itself from the double think of following American sanctions against Iran and Russia, while also being penalized by Washington at almost every turn.\n\nAs the Americans famously say: \"There's no such thing as allies, only interests.\" It's surely time for Europe to put its own interests first and forget about fictitious allies.\n\nNot only is the American \"ally\" fictitious; it is also destructive and rather dangerous to be around.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-07-", "textEnd": 1651, "textStart": 1642}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {"liCnt": 3, "gpCnt": 4}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T03:16:00Z", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "title": "RT", "id": "455"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:16:00", "url": "https://www.rt.com/op-edge/399225-iran-sanctions-europe-economy-us/", "storyUri": "eng-3355737", "id": "8737102", "image": "https://cdn.rt.com/files/2017.08/article/598c9391dda4c8087d8b4567.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "03:16:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Critics note such missile development violates the \"spirit\" of the JCPOA.\n\nYet again, the JCPOA does not ban missile testing by Iran in any legally binding language.\n\nIndeed, a better legal reason for withdrawing from the JCPOA than the arguments above is that the Iran nuclear deal is not legally binding at all. The JCPOA is not a treaty, but an executive agreement, never submitted to the U.S. Senate for advise and consent, and ratification, as constitutionally required.\n\nPreventing Iran, the world's leading sponsor of international terrorism, from developing nuclear weapons is vital to U.S. and global security. Yet the JCPOA is not legally or instrumentally capable of stopping an Iranian atomic bomb.\n\nTherefore, President Trump is obligated to terminate the fiction that is the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nBut the best argument for abandoning JCPOA is rarely made, that Iran is probably in material breach of the letter and main purpose of JCPOA because, like its ally North Korea, Iran has almost certainly developed nuclear weapons clandestinely.\n\nThe U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports inspecting Iran's nuclear program produced compelling evidence Iran probably developed nuclear weapons over a decade ago.\n\nFor example, IAEA's 2011 report \"Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement and Relevant Provisions of Security Council Resolutions in the Islamic Republic of Iran\" is too timorous to say so explicitly, but not only proved Iran has a nuclear weapons program -- it is a \"smoking gun\" that Iran already has the bomb.\n\nA cautious analyst can reasonably infer from IAEA reporting that -- prior to 2003 -- Iran already had all the knowledge and components needed to build atomic bombs. For example, more than 14 years ago:\n\nIran procured equipment necessary for nuclear weapon development.\n\nIran conducted hydrodynamic experiments that, according to the IAEA report \"are strong indicators of possible weapon development.\"\n\nIran cast and shaped uranium metal into hemispheres for a nuclear implosion device; a sophisticated nuclear weapon design.\n\nIran verified the design of a nuclear weapon with non-fissile explosive testing in a containment chamber. During the Manhattan Project of World War II, at this stage the U.S. was 16 months from an atomic bomb.\n\nIran developed and tested exploding bridgewire detonators, necessary to an implosion nuclear weapon. During the WWII Manhattan Project, at this stage the U.S. was 6 months from an atomic bomb.\n\nIran manufactured neutron initiators which are used to start a fission chain-reaction in a nuclear weapon.\n\nIran drafted 14 different workable designs for a nuclear weapon to fit inside the re-entry vehicle for the high-explosive (HE) warhead of Iran's Shahab-3 medium-range missile. Since designing a nuclear weapon is a lot harder than changing the shape of a re-entry vehicle -- obviously Iran was trying to hide a nuclear warhead by disguising it as the HE warhead of the Shahab-3.\n\nIran developed fusing systems for a nuclear missile warhead to perform a ground-burst or high-altitude burst above 3,000 meters.\n\nThe Congressional EMP Commission found in 2002 Iran apparently performed at least 5 fusing tests of the Shahab-3 at high-altitudes -- explicable only as practicing nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks. For more evidence Iran already has nuclear weapons see my article \"Iran: The Worst Deal\" in Family Security Matters, Oct. 3, 2015.\n\nFormer senior intelligence and national security officials of the Reagan and Clinton administrations warn Iran probably already has nuclear weapons, including: Ambassador R.

renegotiating the 2015 nuclear deal as \"meaningless\", an Iranian politician believes that fresh talks would protect the interests of both, Tehran and the world powers.\n\n\"Renegotiating the nuclear deal with the P5+1 is the only way to break the deadlock and it would allow the sides to enjoy maximum benefits of the deal,\" Saeed Yari, chief secretary of a political party known as the Organization on Iran's National Interest Protection, has told Trend.\n\nHe added that his organization had earlier drafted a new deal for replacing the current nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1 group of countries which was concluded back in 2015.\n\nSaeed Yari believes that the proposed draft would remove the shortcomings of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPO aka Iran nuclear deal) and it would protect the rights of the both sides, Iran and the members of the P5+1.\n\nHe said that the draft was proposed to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other high-ranking officials in the country.\n\nThe proposed deal would minimize the risk of a war and it would assure the Westerners about Iran's peaceful nuclear deal.\n\nHe further touched upon the recent remarks by the US President Donald Trump accusing Iran of failing to live up to the spirit of the nuclear deal and said the US president is seeking to get more privileges out of the deal.\n\nReacting to Trump's remarks Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that Donald Trump is trying to play blame game on Iran in order to avoid isolation.\n\nTrump before taking office in January, had called the July 2015 agreement \"the worst deal ever negotiated\", threatening to either scrap the accord or seek a better deal.\n\nUnder the 2015 nuclear accord with the US, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China, Tehran agreed to shrink its nuclear program to satisfy the powers that it could not be put to developing atomic bombs. In exchange, Iran received relief from sanctions, most of which were lifted in January 2016.\n\nHowever, Tehran says the US has failed to honor its commitments under the nuclear accord.\n\n---\n\nFollow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-07-", "textEnd": 1652, "textStart": 1643}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-01-", "textEnd": 2057, "textStart": 2045}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T10:09:00Z", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "source": {"uri": "azernews.az", "title": "AzerNews.az", "id": "10646"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "10:09:00", "url": "https://www.azernews.az/region/117544.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355737", "id": "8899938", "image": "https://www.azernews.az/media/2017/08/13/saeed_yari_050315.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "10:09:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

It was responding to reports that Trump may refuse to certify Iran's compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which trades sanctions relief for a rollback of Iran's nuclear program, when the next assessment period comes around in October.\n\n\"The international agreement with Iran continues to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. No American national security objective would be served by withdrawing from it as long as Iran is meeting the agreement's requirements,\" read the statement. signed by nearly 50 men and women who are either former senior officials of the U.S. government or prominent national security leaders who have not held senior government positions.\n\n\"To the contrary,\" the letter continues, \"given continuing assurance by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that Iran is in compliance with the agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), such a unilateral act would have grave long term political and security consequences for the United States.\"\n\nThe signers recommend a \"comprehensive policy toward Iran that furthers U.S. national security interests,\" including American leadership in the JCPOA; a follow-up agreement that would extend terms of the deal farther into the future; and an additional consultative body on major disputes in the area.\n\nThe letter also suggests establishing a regular channel of communication at a senior level between the U.S. and Iran, and regular consultations among U.S. allies and partners in the region to share information and coordinate strategies.\n\nThey warn that a U.S. rejection of the JCPOA could push Iran to return to its pre-agreement nuclear enrichment program under far weaker international monitoring.\n\nTrump last month recertified Iran's adherence to the 2015 deal brokered by President Barack Obama. But he did so reluctantly, at the urging of his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster; his defense secretary, James Mattis; and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. They argued that decertification would alienate U.S. allies because Iran is indeed complying with the deal's strictures.\n\nHowever, within days of giving the go-ahead to recertify, Trump reportedly tasked a separate team, led by his top strategic adviser, Stephen Bannon, to come up with a reason to decertify Iran at the next 90-day assessment in October.\n\nThe signers include: Morton Abramowitz, former assistant secretary of state for Intelligence and Research; Robert Einhorn, former assistant secretary for nonproliferation and secretary of state's special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control; Morton Halperin, former director of policy planning at the State Department; Daniel Kurtzer, former ambassador to both Israel and Egypt; Carl Levin, former U.S. senator and chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services; and Barnett Rubin, former senior adviser to the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T22:51:00Z", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "source": {"uri": "azjewishpost.com", "title": "Arizona Jewish Post", "id": "9050"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "22:56:00", "url": "https://azjewishpost.com/2017/former-top-national-security-officials-urge-trump-to-stick-to-iran-nuclear-deal/", "storyUri": "eng-3355737", "id": "8715103", "image": "https://azjewishpost.com/files/2017/02/trump-and-bannon.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "22:51:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

The Trump administration has just recertified its compliance with the nuclear deal, yet there are also whispers about it pursuing regime change policy with regards to Iran.\n\nMany believe that regime change is the only way to bring an end to the horrific human rights abuses and the only way to achieve democracy for the country. However, there are many apologists and Iran lobbyists that are trying to make us believe otherwise.\n\nOne member of the Trump administration who has publicly spoken about regime change is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. When he mentioned it in a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee he said: \"Our policy towards Iran is to push back on hegemony (in the Middle East), contain their ability to develop, obviously, nuclear weapons and to work towards support of those elements inside of Iran that would lead to a peaceful transition of that government.\"\n\nThe US Secretary of Defense James Mattis has always had very strong opinions about Iran and said that the Iranian people need to be \"rid\" of the theocracy ruling their country. He spoke about how the recent election in Iran was anything but democratic because those who were allowed to run for presidency were hand-picked by the Supreme Leader. He added that for as long as the Iranian regime is in power, it is going to be \"very, very difficult\".\n\nMany say that the current action taken by the US administration - sanctions, harsh rhetoric and diplomatic pressure - is its way of starting the process of pushing for regime change in Iran.\n\nMaking this clear to the Iranian regime in essential. The administration needs to agree on a policy and push it. Mattis and Tillerson are making strong statements and the rest of the administration really should follow in their footsteps. This will show the Iranian regime that the period of appeasement that it enjoyed for far too long really is over and the US, and the rest of the West, will not tolerate Iran's belligerence at home and abroad.\n\nThe people of Iran are very fortunate to have the Iranian opposition by their side. The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) is the most organised opposition movement and has the support of many members of parliament and other prominent political figures from around the world. It provides the people of Iran with a viable alternative that will uphold and respect the human rights, liberty and freedom of all.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 35, "textStart": 29}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T21:55:00Z", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "source": {"uri": "iranfocus.com", "title": "Iran Focus", "id": "4393"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "21:55:00", "url": "http://www.iranfocus.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=31879&catid=4&Itemid=109", "storyUri": "eng-3355737", "id": "8847804", "image": "http://www.iranfocus.com/en/images/2017/August/Wrld/US-regime-change-Iran-340.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "21:55:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

It was also a clear signal the US is losing its thrall over Europe.\n\nThink about it. According to US President Donald Trump and the American Congress, Iran is the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism. And yet here we saw European leaders respectfully attending the swearing-in of the country's re-elected president. A rather big contradiction, don't you think?\n\nFederica Mogherini, the EU's highest ranking diplomat, was accompanied at the Iranian presidential ceremony by French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Germany's Minister of State Michael Roth. Also in attendance were ministers and dignitaries from Austria, Britain, Denmark, Italy, and the Netherlands, as well as many other non-European countries.\n\nSo, what's all this American talk about Iran being a rogue state, a scourge of global terrorism? The presence of European officials -- and the absence of American ones -- during the inauguration of President Rouhani was a spectacular demonstration of dissonance and repudiation of American policy.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago, in May, while President Trump was on his first overseas official visit in Saudi Arabia, he called on all nations of the world to boycott Iran. Trump told assembled Arab leaders then: \"All nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran,\" accusing the Islamic Republic of threatening Middle East security.\n\nEvidently, European countries have ignored Trump and his demeaning caricature of Iran.\n\nIndeed, ever since the July 2015 signing of the international nuclear accord between Iran and six other world powers (the US, Russia, China, Britain, France, and Germany), European governments and businesses have been hot on the trail to Tehran to ink new joint ventures and investment deals.\n\nThe nuclear accord -- known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -- has lifted international sanctions on Iran in return for it adhering to restrictions on its nuclear program to bar weaponization. Six reviews carried out by the UN watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, have verified Iran is in full compliance with its side of the JCPOA bargain.\n\nThe Europeans seem more than happy about that. Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign affairs chief, is a formidable advocate of the nuclear deal, proclaiming it a success and a source of regional stability. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif was warmly welcomed in Brussels in June when he reported via Twitter: \"Excellent meeting with leaders in Berlin, Rome and Paris. Despite reckless US hostility, EU committed to JCPOA and constructive engagement.\"\n\nEuropean investors have duly piled in to snatch part of the Iranian market of some 80 million people and the world's second and fourth largest source of natural gas and oil, respectively.\n\nThis week, two days after Rouhani's inauguration, French automaker Renault signed the \"biggest-ever\" car deal in Iran, worth 660 million, where it will manufacture 150,000 vehicles a year in partnership with two Iranian firms.\n\nLast year, French company PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citroen, announced a similar investment in Iran, worth 400 million.\n\nThe champion breakthrough for European-Iranian investment came last month when France's Total signed up to a nearly 5 billion 20-year project with Iranian and Chinese firms to develop Iran's South Pars gas field in the Persian Gulf, reckoned to be the world's biggest reserve.\n\nBoth Germany and France have seen exports to Iran soar since the implementation of the nuclear accord. Germany's by some 26 percent and France's by nearly 50 percent, according to trade figures.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-07-", "textEnd": 1755, "textStart": 1746}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T19:07:00Z", "sim": 0.5607843399047852, "source": {"uri": "opednews.com", "title": "OpEdNews", "id": "280"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:07:00", "url": "https://www.opednews.com/articles/Rogue-state-what-rogue-st-by-Finian-Cunningham-Allies_Energy_Iran_Relationships-170812-658.html", "storyUri": "eng-3355737", "id": "8832498", "image": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lfNTCSc8NJc/mqdefault.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "19:07:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

In Congress for a new law voted with such an overwhelming majority that the powers of the President trump to impose on him his veto was reduced to a complete zero.\n\nEven antiinterventionist minded member of the house of representatives from Hawaii, Ms. Gabbard Tulsi voted \"for\", proving once again that Republicans and Democrats always find a common language when it comes to beating the drums of war against sovereign States that took the slightest unreasonable actions -- if they even took any action against the United States.\n\nBut it's just about sanctions, not military action, not acts of war, right? In fact there is nothing wrong with cost-to scare other countries and force them to surrender again to uphold global order, right?\n\nNot really.\n\nSanctions are always a prelude to war. Few know it, but the Japanese attack on pearl Harbor in 1941 was a response to America's attempts to crush undergoing a boom in Japan's economy using a set of multiple types of embargo and asset freeze. Trade relations with Japan were terminated, and such desperation provoked the attack.\n\nAnd in August 1990, the U.S. imposed sanctions regime against Saddam Hussein and Iraq. In 1990 the U.S. invaded Iraq, killing a large number voennosluzhaschih the Iraqi armed forces and largely destroyed the civilian infrastructure of the country. After the destruction of the United States expanded and deepened previously existing sanctions as further punishment of Iraq. According to the UN, these sanctions led to the deaths of 1.7 million Iraqis from among civilians, including 500,000 to 600,000 children.\n\nWhen Secretary of state in the Clinton administration Madeleine Albrightsville about the statistics, she said frankly that the price \"was worth it.\"\n\nThese sanctions were stopped only after the second US invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the international sanctions were fully lifted only in December 2010.\n\nLibya also had to experience the America imposed sanctions beginning in 1990. And we all know how that ended.\n\nIn may 2004 the US imposed economic sanctions against Syria -- officially for support by Syria of terrorism, and for its \"failure to stop the introduction of fighters into Iraq\" -- a country that the United States themselves and destabilized. In reality, these sanctions were a response to Syria and Iran over the development of bilateral relations to the extent that these countries, as reported in the same year, agreed to sign a joint defense Treaty.\n\nSyria have become the target of operations for regime change back in 2006, the US openly bombed the territory of this country and Barack Obama, and Donald trump. Just last year, the United States repeatedly bombed by the government forces of Syria. If not for the intervention of Russia, USA, most likely, would be overthrown the Syrian government by force before the power came trump.\n\nIran has for many years struggling with sanctions. Anti-Iranian sanctions regime serves as a smokescreen in the same way as the same routine before -- in Libya, Syria and Iraq.\n\nIn the case of Iran, the underlying motivations are quite clear -- a set of renewed sanctions aimed at undermining the nuclear agreement, 2015, the so-called Joint comprehensive plan of action (SVPD). Although the administration of the trump, we know exactly what Iran was fully committed to SVPD, the trump as its own official political line adopted a targeted disruption of this agreement.\n\nWhy would he want it?\n\nIn his book \"What is the path to Persia? The options for a new American strategy toward Iran,\" explains one former CIA analysts, who advocated the invasion of Iraq in 2003, \"those who favor regime change or a military attack on Iran (by the US or Israel), there is a strong argument in favor of the first to take advantage of this option. Incitement to regime change in Iran will be very backed up if the Iranian people to convince that their government is so ideologically blinkered that it refuses to do useful things for people, but instead grabs a policy that can only destroy the country. The ideal scenario would be one in which the US and the international community would set a positive enticing incentives, which tempted the Iranian citizens and were supported by them -- only to the mode of this set of incentives was rejected. In a similar vein, any military action against Iran would be very unpopular around the world and will need the proper international context -- both for logistics support of this operation, and to minimize the impact. The best way to minimize international confusion and maximize support (even miserly or covert) is to strike only when it is to be a widespread conviction that the Iranians were given an excellent proposal that was rejected. Must be convinced that the proposal is so good that only a regime, set a goal to acquire nuclear weapons and acquire it for a wrong purpose, could reject this proposal.\"\n\nThis example brilliantly demonstrates why the hawks in the team's trump entirely opposed to trump unilaterally buried SVPD. These officials don't want the U.S. blamed for the destruction of the nuclear deal with Iran because it will create new tensions in the international community and directly will hit the U.S. dollar.\n\nThus, if the U.S. government will continue to wage against Iran's subversive activities, applying sanctions against very powerful in Iran the Islamic revolutionary guard Corps (IRGC)), the United States may be able to do so, that Iran will release itself from the nuclear agreement. In such a scenario, the U.S. will get a result that they have long desired.\n\nNorth Korea for many years, suffering from sanctions organized by the United States. And all these years the American bombers violated the airspace of this country, provoking the DPRK to respond to it militarily.\n\nThe main question now is -- who will trump America on the warpath against Iran, or against North Korea?\n\nAccording to some sources), trump creates the conditions for confrontation with Iran in October. He chose a new strategy of demonization of Iran, if sanctions will not lead to war in a way that is preferable for trump, and before the expiration of the 90-day period certification of compliance with Iran. This strategy suggests that trump will instruct his team to form on-site inspections to verify Iran's nuclear facilities in hopes of finding evidence of noncompliance by Iran AGREEMENT.\n\nMeanwhile, America will continue its unilateral policy of intimidation to her contumacious States, more remaining isolated from its traditional allies. Germany, for example, without the approval looks at sanctions against Russia, because they infringe its own national interests.\n\nDon't be surprised by the fact that the sanctions imposed by the United States, pushing the country unhappy with the current situation in each other's arms. So, in early August, Iran and Russia signed a deal for two and a half billion dollars. For them it is good business as usual, but, thus, they show Donald Trump's middle finger.\n\nIf the U.S. continues the tactics of stifling the global financial markets as a tool to weaken other countries, then these countries, too, will have no choice but to abandon the dollar and switch to alternative currency, with which they will conduct their transactions. Not surprisingly, Russia had already said it.\n\nAnd make no mistake -- the United States are at a crossroads from which a road takes you to the paragraph that says \"the status of a dying global superpower.\" In order to stay afloat, it can take only one real option -- to continue on the warpath, which she to herself has chosen, and to work towards a confrontation with the countries wishing to ascend in the international order that will arise after the withdrawal from the pedestal of the United States.\n\nThe newly established sanctions regime is only a start. Ahead -- a long road. In the end, cooler heads may prevail, as is already clear, what will be the impact of these sanctions.\n\nThe American public all these wars it is almost impossible to sell. But the international community already sees evidence that the US has acted hastily and recklessly, against the interests of the rest of the world. However, if the US can provoke Iran or North Korea for something unfortunate, Washington, in the end, will justify themselves by saying that it was the war in which he desperately needed.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1990-08-", "textEnd": 1219, "textStart": 1208}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-12-", "textEnd": 2015, "textStart": 2002}, {"amb": false, "date": "2004-05-", "textEnd": 2140, "textStart": 2132}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T22:14:00Z", "sim": 0.501960813999176, "source": {"uri": "micetimes.asia", "title": "micetimes.asia", "id": "18865"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "10:02:00", "url": "http://micetimes.asia/us-sanctions-always-lead-to-war-scenario-3-world/", "storyUri": "eng-3355737", "id": "8774714", "image": "http://micetimes.asia/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/8ad90675991c50ac0af36d3a7db21a7c.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "22:14:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

One of those who was in attendance was the President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea, Kim Yong-nam.\n\nFor 40 years North Korea has been an ally to Iran and their history runs deep. Kim Il Sung, the leader of North Korea since it was established in 1948, reached out to Iran's Supreme Leader Khomeini when the announcement was made regarding the victory of the Islamic Revolution. The Supreme Leader then met with ambassador Chabeong Ouk in Iran, making comments about what he called the \"aggression of U.S. troops against the meek nation of Korea\". Since then, both countries have bonded over their disdain for the United States.\n\nDuring the Iran-Iraq War, North Korea supplied Iranian troops with arms for oil and cash. Iran was especially under-equipped, so the aid from North Korea contributed greatly to the relations between the two countries and gave a boost to Iran's forces. Later in the war, North Korea provide Iran with missiles.\n\nBoth countries are well-known for their censorship and propaganda policies. In the eighties, the current President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, met with people in North Korea's Radio and Television Broadcasting Committee during a trip to Pyongyang. On the same trip, Rouhani also was tasked with pursuing arms.\n\nAt the end of that decade, the then-President Khamenei paid a visit to North Korea that contributed to him becoming the Supreme Leader.\n\nThe Iran-Korea Friendship Association was set up after Kim Il Sung died. Friendship farms were set up and annual cultural exchanges were organised.\n\nHowever, despite the strong links between North Korea and Iran, not all Iranian officials have spoken positively of the North Korean influence. Mohsen Rezaei, Secretary of the Expediency Council and former chief of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), said in 2006 that its example should be avoided because it has become reactionary - something he did not want for his own country.\n\nThe relations between the two countries cannot be talked about without mentioning the aid North Korea has given to Iran regarding its nuclear program. It has also been claimed that the countries share military technology.

While they stressed the bill wouldn't violate the terms of that agreement, it again increases the friction between the two nations that routinely have tense encounters in the Persian Gulf.\n\nIn a session Sunday, 240 lawmakers voted for the bill, with only one abstention from the 247 legislators on hand, Iran's state-run news agency IRNA reported.\n\nThe bill now heads to an oversight committee called the Guardian Council, which is expected to approve it. Abbas Araghchi, a deputy foreign minister and senior nuclear negotiator on hand for the vote, said moderate President Hassan Rouhani's government would support the bill.\n\n\"The bill has very wisely tried not to violate the (nuclear deal) and also gives no chance to the other party to manipulate it,\" he said in comments reported by IRNA.\n\nUnder terms of the bill, some $800 million will be put toward several projects, including the Defense Ministry and its intelligence agencies. Among the agencies receiving money would be the Revolutionary Guards' Quds force, an expeditionary force run by Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who has been in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe Guard, separate from Iran's conventional military forces, answers only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe bill also imposes a visa and travel ban on U.S. military and security organizations and their commanders who have provided financial, intelligence, military, logistic and training support to terrorists in the region, naming the Islamic State group and the Syrian branch of al-Qaida.\n\nIranian officials often accuse the U.S. of being involved with both groups. The U.S. is actively involved in a massive military campaign against the Islamic State group and has struck the al-Qaida affiliate as well.\n\nPerhaps more relevantly, the bill also includes banning visas for American officials involved with the Iranian exile group called the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq. Prominent U.S. lawmakers and politicians have met with the group and spoken at its rallies. The MEK has paid one of Trump's Cabinet members and at least one adviser in the past for giving such speeches.\n\nIRNA also referred to the money also being used to develop nuclear propellers. In December, Rouhani ordered officials to draw up plans on building nuclear-powered ships, something that appears to be allowed under the nuclear deal, over an earlier dispute on U.S. sanctions under the Obama administration.\n\nTrump signed a sanctions bill earlier this month that included new measures imposed on Iran. That sparked new outrage in Iran, with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accusing Trump of trying to \"kill\" the nuclear deal.\n\n___\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355737", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T09:08:00Z", "sim": 0.47843137383461, "source": {"uri": "hosted2.ap.org", "title": "Associated Press", "id": "566"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:34:00", "url": "http://hosted2.ap.org/CARIE/0260ea4c3e85456b80715585ba3c7b5b/Article_2017-08-13-ML-Iran-US/id-c03229b22107430b83cba43a7b3afbbd", "storyUri": "eng-3355737", "id": "8896576", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "09:08:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

It has a nice ring to it, reminiscent of 2003's not-terribly-successful \"shock and awe,\" although far less intimidating than \"Drakaris\":\n\nBut such big talk in the midst of a situation where the U.S. has virtually no power to change the status quo is frustrating at best and counterproductive at worst. There are no winners in a nuclear war, and any chance to negotiate North Korea out of the global nuclear club was squandered long ago.\n\nTo discuss how the Trump administration might play such a bad hand, I talked to someone who has had his hands on a few of the relevant cards. Jake Sullivan was former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's top adviser on global affairs, and conventional wisdom assumed he would have been her national security adviser when she won the election in a landslide. And while that shows the fallibility of conventional wisdom, it does nothing to undermine Sullivan's position as one of the most informed Americans in terms of the threats the U.S. and its allies face around the world. Sullivan is now a lecturer at Yale Law School and a senior fellow the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Here is an edited transcript of our conversation:\n\nTobin Harshaw: Jake, let's start with North Korea and Trump's threat to rain down \"fire and fury.\" How does his rhetoric complicate the U.S. response to Kim Jong Un's missile and nuke testing?\n\nJake Sullivan: We do need to send a strong and clear message that the U.S. is serious about North Korea's efforts to build nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles. And I believe that through Secretary of Defense James Mattis's statements we have accomplished that effectively. The problem is that Trump seems unable to differentiate between strong, clear statements of deterrence, and bombast and bluster that will only continue a war of words and create the possibility for mistakes and complications. We should be focusing the world's attention on putting pressure on North Korea, but world attention is instead focused on what Trump will tweet or say next, which is a distraction from the larger issue.\n\nTH: Let's consider a hypothetical: If Hillary Clinton had won the election, how would her administration have handled Kim's provocations?\n\nJS: First, I think it's only fair to acknowledge that this is an incredibly difficult problem and three successive administrations have failed to stop North Korea's drive forward. Much of what has been done in the last few weeks is consistent with what we would have done -- the sanctions in the United Nations, deployment of the Thaad missile-defense system, consultation with allies, reaching out to China.\n\nBut there are three ways in which Clinton would have put her own stamp on this. First, you would not have had a president popping off at the mouth and making the situation more complicated rather than clarifying it. Two, she would have recognized that we haven't brought the sort of pressure on North Korea that that we brought on Iran. Part of this is United Nations sanctions. But it also involves a whole government effort to cut off flows of money into North Korea the way the George W. Bush administration did with Banco Delta Asia. She would have brought in a multi-department effort to make the North Koreans really feel the squeeze. Third, in the context of China, they tell us we have to sit down and work this all out with North Koreans. But we need China not just to put pressure on Pyongyang, we need them to actually join us in the diplomacy. Hillary would have said China has to sit at our side of the table, as they did at the negotiations over the Iranian nuclear freeze, and not just rely on us to do it.\n\nTH: Speaking of the Iran deal, we have reached its second anniversary. How has it held up in the early stages?\n\nJS: I believe that the best evidence that this was a strong deal for the U.S. and our national security interests is what is happening in North Korea right now. If we had not done a deal to put Iran in a box, we could now be talking about them miniaturizing warheads and the other things we are worried about in North Korea.\n\nI believe the deal is working as intended in that it is blocking the pathways to Iran getting nuclear weapons. The deal never covered Iran's other bad behavior -- missiles, support for terrorism, destabilizing the region, human rights at home. Critics say this is a problem with the pact, but it doesn't keep us from dealing with those other issues. We should do more to put constraints on Iran for its support of terrorism and the like, and the Trump administration should stop using the deal as an excuse for not doing more to confront the regime on these other grounds.\n\nAs for upholding its end of the bargain, there is no case that Iran is not complying. Trump is now going to the intelligence community to tell them that they need to come up with an instance of the Iranians not complying. This is the definition of politicizing intelligence.\n\nTH: Trump pledged to tear the Iran deal up while on the campaign trail, yet hasn't. Is there any point in doing so now, with the U.S. having given up most of its obligations while Iran has many to meet up to?\n\nJS: Walking away from the deal at this point would be folly.\n\nWe retain the capacity to re-impose sanctions if they do not comply. They still have assets overseas that can be frozen, and they need to sell oil abroad, which we can curb. We retain the tools to hold Iran to the deal. If we walked away we would be taking the target off Iran's back and putting it squarely on ours. It would leave them free to move back down the nuclear track.\n\nTH: This week on Twitter, Trump took credit for the nascent modernization of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, which actually began under Barack Obama. What do you feel should be our priorities in terms of maintaining our longstanding policy of deterrence?\n\nJS: First, Trump's claim rings hollow. People who follow this will tell you that in his 200 days in office he has not done a single thing to move toward modernizing our nuclear arsenal.\n\nWe need to make sure we have a credible deterrent, underlined by the crisis with North Korea. Still, I share a concern that the plan as laid out in the Obama administration is enormously expensive -- up to $1 trillion. We need to have a reliable, safe, credible deterrent that gives us the edge we need. But we need to find a way to do that while reducing the overall price tag. I hope we don't get on autopilot on this, but find a way to do what we need to do at sustainable cost.\n\nTH: Congress just slapped Trump on the hands with new sanctions on Russia, yet it seems inevitable that we will have to work with the Kremlin on many questions of our global national interest, such as Syria. Is it going to be possible to walk that perilous line with Vladimir Putin?\n\nJS: I have first-hand experience on how we can go about walking this line from when I was part of the negotiating team on the Iran nuclear deal. I was talking to the Russians, but at the same time the U.S. was imposing sanctions on them for Ukraine. We were able to separate an issue on which we were divided from one in which we had common aims, and we were able to advance our objectives on both tracks. I think this can be done. What concerns me most is making sure we have a clear idea of where Russia's interests lie. I doubt we have common interests in Syria and I worry we will cut a deal that helps Russia achieve it goals and eventually we will have to go back in to clean things up.\n\nComing up, we will have to work with them on an agreement on securing loose nuclear materials, and on continued efforts to have sensible arms control. I think this can be done. But it requires being clear-eyed about where our interests converge and diverge.\n\nTH: The U.S. just led a huge military exercise in Eastern Europe with NATO allies, and now Russia is undertaking one that dwarfs the West's in scale. How concerned should we be about that becoming a flashpoint -- and maybe Putin trying a \"hybrid\" military operation in the Baltic states similar to what he did in Crimea and eastern Ukraine?\n\nJS: I'm very concerned that the Russians are going to try to test Article 5 -- the mutual-defense pact at the heart of NATO -- to show our allies it is hollow. I think they have every incentive to do so. And Trump's mixed signals on this are only sending a message to Russia that this is up for debate. Whether it is a provocation in the Baltics or elsewhere, we need to be on guard for this. I strongly supported sending U.S. forces to the Baltics because we need to show Moscow that Article 5 means what it says. The other thing is that they will look for other parts of Europe to destabilize, so I am worried about the Balkans and the use of corruption and cyber as weapons that could cause disruption. NATO's newest member, Montenegro, was recently the object of a coup attempt that apparently had Russian backing.\n\nTH: Many people feel that Trump has gutted the State Department as part of a broader belief that diplomacy gets us nowhere. What's your best defense of \"soft power\" as a solution to our most pressing problems?\n\nJS: I would put Iran at top of list. We put a lid on its nuclear program without firing a shot or losing an American life. That was diplomacy at work. Having only a military tool would have put us in a more difficult situation. Terrorism emanates from unstable, chaotic parts of the world. We can bomb cities and force terrorist fighters into the desert, but they will reconstitute unless we have some plan to address it over time. That is how we got Islamic State out of al Qaeda.\n\nTH: The Trump administration, defending itself from accusations of nefarious dealings with Russia during the presidential campaign, has targeted its ire at \"leaks\" of sensitive intelligence information. Do you think the investigation of these leaks is necessary, or is it a distraction from the larger issue of Russian meddling in our democratic process?\n\nJS: I think it is a baseless ruse, and a transparent one at that, to distract from the real issue: Russia's influence on our elections and help to the Trump campaign. That's not just me -- senior people in the national-security community want them to knock it off. There is no there there.\n\nTH: We know we face a zillion global threats, from Russia and China to Iran and North Korea to ISIS and al Qaeda. But what lesser-known threat keeps you up at night?\n\nJS: I'm particularly worried about the possibility of another pandemic, a next Ebola. I don't think this administration has gotten itself organized to respond the way the Obama administration did.

Tomljanovic \u2013 who needed a wildcard to make the main draw after a torrid run of setbacks in the past two years \u2013 won the first set over Australian Open semi-finalist and No.30 seed Dayana Yastremska then held triple break point before the match took a vicious turn. The Ukrainian ball-basher escaped that dire situation before breaking Tomljanovic from 40-0 in the seventh game of the second set on her way to a rollercoaster 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory. Another Australian, Aleks Vukic, followed Tomljanovic out of the tournament soon after, losing 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 to China\u2019s Zhizhen Zhang. Jordan Thompson is the only other Australian in action on the opening day, facing Germany\u2019s Maximilian Marterer.", "summary": "Ajla Tomljanovic suffered a first-round exit at Roland-Garros despite taking the first set against her seeded opponent.

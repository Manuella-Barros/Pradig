{"id": 237088676, "title": "Water scarcity persists in Kano, cripples socio-economic activities", "text": "The perennial water scarcity, which appears to have defied all solutions in Kano and its environs, has continued to make life unbearable for the residents. Investigation by Arewa PUNCH showed that following the worsening water scarcity, water vendors have continued to exploit the situation by hiking their prices as a 25-litre jerrycan goes for between N150 and N200 against the N50 and N70 previous price. Areas affected by the scarcity include: Dala, Fagge, Gwale, Kano Municipal, Kumbotso, Tarauni, Nassarawa and Ungogo, whose residents largely depend on supply from the State Water Board, boreholes drilled by the government and some philanthropists. Some of the residents who spoke on the situation with Arewa PUNCH described the water scarcity as \u201cvery unfortunate,\u201d considering the huge amount being spent by the state for the provision of potable water in the state. One of the residents, Sani Ado, who lives in the Kano municipality, told our Correspondent that he spends about N1, 400 daily, to buy water for his family\u2019s domestic use. \u201cI am not supposed to spend my hard-earned money on water, since there is a government in power which is supposed to supply me with the commodity, but I am constrained to resort to this self-help since the government water no longer runs,\u201d Danladi lamented. Another affected resident, Abdullahi Lawan, also bemoaned the water scarcity, which he said is making life difficult for him, as he travelled long distances looking for water for domestic use. He stated, \u201cI go out every morning looking for government boreholes or outlets provided by individuals from where to fetch water because I can not afford to buy this necessity from water vendors at the exorbitant prices they sell for. \u201cThis routine is traumatic for me because I sacrifice many hours looking for water. Hours that I should spend to find money for my family\u2019s upkeep,\u201d he said in pain. The case of Sulaiman Gambo, who is a washman, is even more pathetic. In tears, he decried the situation, saying it is \u201cvery unbearable\u201d for him as he spends about N3, 000 daily on drums of water with which he washes his customers\u2019 clothes. According to him, the high rate at which vendors sell water for us because of this scarcity from the government pumps has deeply eaten into my finances. It also hinders me from increasing my production capacity because of the exorbitant costs I now have to contend with. \u201cThe situation is making it difficult for me to break even. It is not only water that goes into washing my customers\u2019 clothes; I also use detergents, bar soaps, stain removers, and starch to do a good work, yet the prices of all these things have also gone up. \u201cIt is more painful because water is ordinarily supposed to be the cheapest. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not,\u201d he lamented. The state Commissioner for Water Resources, Ali Makoda, had recently said that the State Government was working round the clock to ensure the availability of water in the eight metropolitan local governments. \u201cWe are working tirelessly to fix the prevailing water scarcity in the state capital and its environs, and in a couple of days, the problem will be over,\u201d he had assured. The commissioner blamed the challenge largely on obsolete equipment, especially at the Tamburawa Water Treatment Plant, which supplies water within the Kano metropolis and its environs.", "summary": "<p>The perennial water scarcity, which appears to have defied all solutions in Kano and its environs, has continued to make life unbearable for the residents.

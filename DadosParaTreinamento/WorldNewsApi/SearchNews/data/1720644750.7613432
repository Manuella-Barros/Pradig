{"id": 231440500, "title": "Provincial Spanish town challenges cities by showing 120 Renaissance works", "text": "In an elegant but unfinished basilica 100 miles from Madrid as the crow \u2013 or in this case the stork \u2013 flies, some of the hidden and long-dispersed religious treasures of the Spanish Renaissance have been gathered together for an unlikely and potentially pioneering exhibition. Although Alba de Tormes has a rich and turbulent history \u2013 it is home to both the illustrious House of Alba and the majority of the remains of St Teresa of \u00c1vila \u2013 the small and picturesque town in Castilla y Le\u00f3n is not a habitual venue for the kind of art show more commonly staged in Madrid or Barcelona. The exhibition, The Splendour of Painting in Valencia, is hoping to change that and to help rebalance Spain\u2019s cultural geography. If the aesthetic aim is to share 120 pieces that illustrate how the arrival of Italian and Flemish art in Valencia fuelled and influenced the Renaissance in Spain, its parallel goal is to bring cultural events to parts of the country that are all too often neglected and under-appreciated. \u201cThe idea came about because we really wanted to bring art to places where such important works have never been shown,\u201d says Nicol\u00e1s Cort\u00e9s, a 30-year veteran of the art world who is one of the promoters of the project. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about the environment. We want people to come to beautiful places like this so they can get to know them. History-wise, Alba de Tormes is just amazing: St Teresa of \u00c1vila; Saint John of the Cross, the Duke of Alba. It was like the second royal court of Spain in the 16th century when it came to painters and artists, all of whom gathered around the duke.\u201d Today, Alba de Tormes is a little quieter. Swallows hurl themselves through the blue sky high above the stork nests that stud the ancient towers while, far below, the River Tormes flows under a medieval bridge. Despite being only two hours\u2019 drive from Madrid, and half an hour from the university city of Salamanca, the town sits in a province whose rural reaches are suffering the slow ravages of depopulation seen across much of what is known as la Espa\u00f1a vaciada, or \u201cthe hollowed-out Spain\u201d. As well as the challenges of urbanisation, unemployment, demographic shifts and a lack of services, la Espa\u00f1a vaciada is often overlooked when it comes to culture. \u201cWe want to bring people to la Espa\u00f1a vaciada,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez Frechina, the exhibition\u2019s curator and an expert on Valencian art. \u201cWe want to change the circuits so that people don\u2019t just see things like this in Madrid, Barcelona, Seville or Valencia.\u201d G\u00f3mez Frechina believes that the show\u2019s exhibits \u2013 90% of which have never been on public display \u2013 will draw visitors and help celebrate the pivotal role Valencia played in the history of Spanish art. The exhibition\u2019s focal point is Juan de Juanes\u2019s painting of Christ tied to a pillar, a work widely regarded as one of the greatest achievements of the Spanish Renaissance. In a booth nearby, an immersive video take on the painting brings it eerily to life as Christ stares from the screen and moves his agonised body, tilting his thorn-crowned head and lifting his bound wrists. Around it, paintings loaned by private collectors \u2013 many of them altarpiece panels \u2013 chronicle the foreign influences that shaped art in Valencia and made the eastern city an artistic powerhouse. \u201cIn Spanish terms, between 1400 and 1550, Valencia was like the Paris or the Milan of the time,\u201d says G\u00f3mez Frechina. \u201cIt was home to the greatest cultural splendour of the time \u2013 literary, social and economic. Then Philip II establishes Madrid as the capital, with El Escorial, and Spain changes.\u201d Valencia, he adds, became an intellectual and artistic gateway thanks to its location as the port that linked Spain to Rome, Naples and Flanders. The infamous Valencian nobleman Rodrigo de Borja \u2013 better known as Rodrigo Borgia, who became Pope Alexander VI \u2013 was as keen on art as he was on womanising. The future pope brought the great Italian painter Paolo de San Leocadio to Spain, where he painted pieces including the magnificent ceiling frescoes in Valencia cathedral that were rediscovered 20 years ago. Three of the artist\u2019s works feature in the exhibition, as do paintings by Fernando Llanos and Fernando Y\u00e1\u00f1ez de la Almedina, two Spanish masters who are thought to have worked alongside Leonardo Da Vinci in Florence, and who painted part of the cathedral\u2019s main altarpiece. The arrival in Valencia of foreign works, artists and styles, says G\u00f3mez Frechina, \u201cstruck the city like a bolt of lightning, illuminating the way for all the painters there\u201d. The curator and Cort\u00e9s hope their exhibition will prove similarly catalytic. \u201cYou don\u2019t normally get something like this round here,\u201d says Cort\u00e9s, who fell in love with Alba de Tormes 20 years ago. \u201cWe want to bring this kind of culture to lots of places all over Spain \u2013 like this one \u2013 and perhaps even to different parts of Europe. But this is the first time we\u2019ve tried this; this will be the test.\u201d He is adamant that cultural projects like this one can help both the places that host them and the visitors they draw. \u201cLocal businesses have done all this,\u201d he says, gesturing at the panels, the lighting and the special light filters that a team of very brave \u201cspide-men\u201d attached to the basilica\u2019s high windows to protect the exhibits. \u201cThe money will stay here. And there are three local women who are working here.\u201d The former dealer wants people to come to the town to enjoy its sites, its hospitality and the natural riches that surround it, from the river to the storks and the golden eagles and wolves that inhabit the landscape. \u201cIn the future, we want to use projects like this to get people into nature \u2013 and to see the incredibly strong relationship between nature and art,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a long time but I think it\u2019ll go very well. At the end of the day, art is about bringing people closer to beauty.\u201d Everything, however, will depend on how many people kick themselves free of the cultural gravity of Spain\u2019s biggest cities and strike out for somewhere unassuming to see something unprecedented. \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of landed here like a meteorite,\u201d says G\u00f3mez Frechina. \u201cAnd now we need word of the meteorite to spread.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Major art exhibition in Alba de Tormes aims to break cultural stranglehold of Madrid and Barcelona</p><p>In an elegant but unfinished basilica 100 miles from Madrid as the crow \u2013 or in this case the stork \u2013 flies, some of the hidden and long-dispersed religious treasures of the Spanish Renaissance have been gathered together for an unlikely and potentially pioneering exhibition.</p><p>Although Alba de Tormes has a rich and turbulent history \u2013 it is home to both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/07/spain-duchess-marriage-fortune\">illustrious House of Alba</a> and the majority of the remains of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_of_%C3%81vila\">St Teresa of \u00c1vila</a> \u2013 the small and picturesque town in Castilla y Le\u00f3n is not a habitual venue for the kind of art show more commonly staged in Madrid or Barcelona.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/08/left-behind-spanish-town-challenges-cities-by-showing-120-renaissance-works\">Continue reading...</a>", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/08/left-behind-spanish-town-challenges-cities-by-showing-120-renaissance-works", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47801d4113142ddd5e7e21123f6fd9bd092741ef/245_402_5509_3306/master/5509.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZ", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:00:49", "author": "Sam Jones", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.61}

Her move could shape the presidential race", "body": "COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Nikki Haley is perhaps the highest-profile Republican in the nation who has refused to fall in line and endorse Donald Trump's presidential bid.\n\nIt's unclear how long that might last.\n\nSome allies believe she may be forced to endorse him before the November election to avoid permanently alienating the Republican Party base. Some even suspect that Haley will re-emerge on Trump's short list of vice presidential contenders in the coming months, despite Trump's recent statement to the contrary.\n\nWATCH: Nikki Haley suspends her presidential campaign, leaves Donald Trump as last major Republican candidate\n\nBut if Haley submits to Trump, as so many of his GOP critics have done, she also risks destroying her own coalition of independents, moderates and anti-Trump Republicans, who are still showing up to support her in low-profile primary contests from deep-red Indiana to deep-blue Maryland. On Tuesday, she gets another chance to demonstrate her sustained strength in Kentucky's presidential primary contest, which comes more than two months after she suspended her campaign.\n\nHaley's decision on Trump in the coming months will be closely watched not just by her supporters, but by allies of Trump and President Joe Biden. What she decides to do -- and whether her coalition follows -- could have a profound impact on this year's general election and her future as a top-tier Republican whose brand appeals to many people outside her party.\n\n\"Nikki Haley could be the person that unites us,\" said Thalia Floras, a 62-year-old retail manager from Nashua, New Hampshire, who was a lifelong Democrat before casting a ballot for Haley in her state's January primary.\n\nBut Floras also has a warning: \"Nikki Haley has a good place with me now. But if she goes with Trump, I'm done.\"\n\nThose close to Haley, a 52-year-old former governor and U.N. ambassador, say it's unclear what she'll do.\n\nHaley voters up for grabs, but only Biden trying\n\nHaley and Trump haven't spoken in months. That includes the period after she bowed out of the GOP primary campaign in early March, according to a person with direct knowledge of Haley's private conversations who was not authorized to speak about them publicly.\n\nAnd while some Republicans who supported Haley will certainly drift back to Trump organically, the Biden campaign is working to win over her supporters, whom they view as true swing voters.\n\nBiden's team is quietly organizing a Republicans for Biden group, which will eventually include dedicated staff and focus on the hundreds of thousands of Haley voters in each battleground state, according to people familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nThe Democratic president hasn't kept his intentions a secret.\n\nBiden issued a statement thanking Haley for her courage to challenge Trump just minutes after she bowed out of the primary race in March.\n\n\"Donald Trump made it clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley's supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign,\" Biden said at the time.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, said in late January that Haley donors would be permanently banned from his \"Make America Great Again\" camp. While he has refrained from attacking her since she left the race, Trump hasn't offered public statements of goodwill either as he has for other vanquished rivals like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nAs part of Biden's sustained outreach to Haley's coalition, his campaign released a digital ad late last month highlighting Trump's often-personal attacks against Haley, including his primary nickname of her as \"birdbrain\" and suggestion that \"she's not presidential timber.\"\n\nAsked about Trump's lack of outreach to Haley and her supporters, senior adviser Jason Miller avoided any mention of her and instead cast doubt on the strength of Biden's coalition of Black Americans, Latinos and young voters.\n\n\"The reality is the Republican Party is united behind President Trump while the Democrat Party has shattered to pieces because of Joe Biden's disastrous policies on issues like inflation and the border,\" Miller said.\n\nFew expect Haley to endorse the Democratic president outright. Such a decision would make it difficult, if not impossible, for her to win a future GOP presidential primary if she decides to run again.\n\nInstead, Biden's allies are hopeful that Haley, among other high-profile Republican Trump critics, may either stay silent or offer an endorsement focusing on the stakes of the election for democracy rather than direct praise for Biden.\n\nIf and when Biden's team does secure high-profile Republican supporters, it's likely to wait several more weeks to unveil them to help maximize their impact when voters are paying closing attention to the November election.\n\nA pro-Biden Republican speaks\n\nFormer Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican who had backed Haley in the GOP primary, formally endorsed Biden earlier in the month. In an interview, he said he made the decision before talking to Biden's campaign, although Biden personally called to thank him after Duncan announced his decision.\n\nDuncan didn't rule out playing a prominent role in the Republicans for Biden group or even speaking at the Democratic National Convention this summer, just as former Ohio Gov. John Kasich did four years ago.\n\nDuncan hopes Haley doesn't ultimately endorse Trump as so many of Trump's high-profile Republican critics have done.\n\n\"I feel like that would be a short-term sugar high to just gain favor inside the Republican Party,\" Duncan said of a potential Haley endorsement of Trump. \"She has the right to do what she wants to do. Obviously everybody's playing the political calculus. But at some point, where do we draw the line?\"\n\nThe list of high-profile Republicans willing to stand up to Trump in 2024 is extraordinarily small.\n\nEven those who described Trump as a dangerous threat to democracy, like New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, have ultimately endorsed him. Sununu, who was among Haley's top national surrogates during the campaign, declined repeated requests to comment on her political future. And DeSantis, once Trump's chief primary rival and another early 2028 prospect, now plans to raise money for Trump's general election campaign.\n\nHaley steps back into the public spotlight\n\nHaley has only just begun to emerge from a period of post-campaign seclusion, where she took time to reconnect with family, especially her husband, a military serviceman who recently returned from a nearly yearlong tour overseas.\n\nShe plans to deliver a speech on foreign policy later this week -- her first public address since ending her 2024 campaign -- at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based conservative think tank where she's agreed to serve as the Walter P. Stern Chair.\n\nAnd last week, Haley huddled with dozens of donors and allies behind closed doors in South Carolina, where she thanked her coalition, while largely ignoring Trump. She did not encourage attendees to support his campaign.\n\nSimone Levinson, a Haley bundler who attended the private gathering, said there remains an appetite among Republicans for a next-generation figure who can communicate well and build consensus.\n\n\"There is a very strong indication that she has struck a chord that is still continuing to resonate with millions of Americans,\" said Levinson, who is based in Florida.\n\nHer coalition sends her a message\n\nIndeed, without any formal organization, advertising or even private encouragement, the Haley voters continue to show up in low-profile presidential primaries, which will run through the end of June even though Trump is the only candidate still in the running.\n\nHaley earned more than 21 percent of the vote in Maryland's presidential primary last week. That's after hitting similar marks the week before in Indiana and Arizona just weeks after leaving the race.\n\n\"She's articulate and intelligent, which are things that Trump isn't,\" said retired school psychologist Kathy Showen, an independent voter from Cross Lanes, West Virginia, who cast a primary ballot for Haley last week.\n\nAnalysis: How Nikki Haley's bid for the White House made history\n\nMeanwhile, in New Hampshire, Floras said she'll begrudgingly vote for Biden this fall because she can't stomach Trump. But she's hopeful that Haley will run again in 2028.\n\nHer feelings might change, however, if Haley gives in and endorses Trump before the fall election.\n\n\"It would really disappoint me if she doesn't stand up to him,\" Floras said. \"That would do her in.\"\n\nPeoples reported from New York.

As both Trump and Biden camps vie for her supporters, Haley's stance could significantly influence the 2024 general elections. Her move will be closely watched nationwide.\n\nNikki Haley is perhaps the highest-profile Republican in the nation who has refused to fall in line and endorse Donald Trump's presidential bid. It's unclear how long that might last.\n\nSome allies believe she may be forced to endorse him before the November election to avoid permanently alienating the Republican Party base. Some even suspect that Haley will re-emerge on Trump's short list of vice presidential contenders in the coming months, despite Trump's recent statement to the contrary.\n\nBut if Haley submits to Trump, as so many of his GOP critics have done, she also risks destroying her own coalition of independents, moderates and anti-Trump Republicans, who are still showing up to support her in low-profile primary contests from deep-red Indiana to deep-blue Maryland. On Tuesday, she gets another chance to demonstrate her sustained strength in Kentucky's presidential primary contest, which comes more than two months after she suspended her campaign.\n\nHaley's decision on Trump in the coming months will be closely watched not just by her supporters, but by allies of Trump and President Joe Biden. What she decides to do -- and whether her coalition follows -- could have a profound impact on this year's general election and her future as a top-tier Republican whose brand appeals to many people outside her party. \"Nikki Haley could be the person that unites us,\" said Thalia Floras, a 62-year-old retail manager from Nashua, New Hampshire, who was a lifelong Democrat before casting a ballot for Haley in her state's January primary. But Floras also has a warning: \"Nikki Haley has a good place with me now. But if she goes with Trump, I'm done.\" Those close to Haley, a 52-year-old former governor and U.N. ambassador, say it's unclear what she'll do. HALEY VOTERS UP FOR GRABS, BUT ONLY BIDEN TRYING Haley and Trump haven't spoken in months. That includes the period after she bowed out of the GOP primary campaign in early March, according to a person with direct knowledge of Haley's private conversations who was not authorized to speak about them publicly.\n\nAnd while some Republicans who supported Haley will certainly drift back to Trump organically, the Biden campaign is working to win over her supporters, whom they view as true swing voters.\n\nBiden's team is quietly organizing a Republicans for Biden group, which will eventually include dedicated staff and focus on the hundreds of thousands of Haley voters in each battleground state, according to people familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nThe Democratic president hasn't kept his intentions a secret. Biden issued a statement thanking Haley for her courage to challenge Trump just minutes after she bowed out of the primary race in March. \"Donald Trump made it clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley's supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign,\" Biden said at the time. Trump, meanwhile, said in late January that Haley donors would be permanently banned from his \"Make America Great Again\" camp. While he has refrained from attacking her since she left the race, Trump hasn't offered public statements of goodwill either as he has for other vanquished rivals like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nAs part of Biden's sustained outreach to Haley's coalition, his campaign released a digital ad late last month highlighting Trump's often-personal attacks against Haley, including his primary nickname of her as \"birdbrain\" and suggestion that \"she's not presidential timber.\" Asked about Trump's lack of outreach to Haley and her supporters, senior adviser Jason Miller avoided any mention of her and instead cast doubt on the strength of Biden's coalition of Black Americans, Latinos and young voters. \"The reality is the Republican Party is united behind President Trump while the Democrat Party has shattered to pieces because of Joe Biden's disastrous policies on issues like inflation and the border,'' Miller said. Few expect Haley to endorse the Democratic president outright. Such a decision would make it difficult, if not impossible, for her to win a future GOP presidential primary if she decides to run again. Instead, Biden's allies are hopeful that Haley, among other high-profile Republican Trump critics, may either stay silent or offer an endorsement focusing on the stakes of the election for democracy rather than direct praise for Biden.\n\nIf and when Biden's team does secure high-profile Republican supporters, it's likely to wait several more weeks to unveil them to help maximize their impact when voters are paying closing attention to the November election.\n\nA PRO-BIDEN REPUBLICAN SPEAKS Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican who had backed Haley in the GOP primary, formally endorsed Biden earlier in the month. In an interview, he said he made the decision before talking to Biden's campaign, although Biden personally called to thank him after Duncan announced his decision.\n\nDuncan didn't rule out playing a prominent role in the Republicans for Biden group or even speaking at the Democratic National Convention this summer, just as former Ohio Gov. John Kasich did four years ago.\n\nDuncan hopes Haley doesn't ultimately endorse Trump as so many of Trump's high-profile Republican critics have done.\n\n\"I feel like that would be a short-term sugar high to just gain favor inside the Republican Party,\" Duncan said of a potential Haley endorsement of Trump. \"She has the right to do what she wants to do. Obviously everybody's playing the political calculus. But at some point, where do we draw the line?\" The list of high-profile Republicans willing to stand up to Trump in 2024 is extraordinarily small. Even those who described Trump as a dangerous threat to democracy, like New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, have ultimately endorsed him. Sununu, who was among Haley's top national surrogates during the campaign, declined repeated requests to comment on her political future. And DeSantis, once Trump's chief primary rival and another early 2028 prospect, now plans to raise money for Trump's general election campaign. HALEY STEPS BACK INTO PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT Haley has only just begun to emerge from a period of post-campaign seclusion, where she took time to reconnect with family, especially her husband, a military serviceman who recently returned from a nearly yearlong tour overseas.\n\nShe plans to deliver a speech on foreign policy later this week -- her first public address since ending her 2024 campaign -- at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based conservative think tank where she's agreed to serve as the Walter P. Stern Chair. And last week, Haley huddled with dozens of donors and allies behind closed doors in South Carolina, where she thanked her coalition, while largely ignoring Trump. She did not encourage attendees to support his campaign.\n\nSimone Levinson, a Haley bundler who attended the private gathering, said there remains an appetite among Republicans for a next-generation figure who can communicate well and build consensus. \"There is a very strong indication that she has struck a chord that is still continuing to resonate with millions of Americans,\" said Levinson, who is based in Florida.\n\nHER COALITION SENDS A MESSAGE Indeed, without any formal organization, advertising or even private encouragement, the Haley voters continue to show up in low-profile presidential primaries, which will run through the end of June even though Trump is the only candidate still in the running.\n\nHaley earned more than 21% of the vote in Maryland's presidential primary last week. That's after hitting similar marks the week before in Indiana and Arizona just weeks after leaving the race. \"She's articulate and intelligent, which are things that Trump isn't,\" said retired school psychologist Kathy Showen, an independent voter from Cross Lanes, West Virginia, who cast a primary ballot for Haley last week. Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, Floras said she'll begrudgingly vote for Biden this fall because she can't stomach Trump. But she's hopeful that Haley will run again in 2028.\n\nHer feelings might change, however, if Haley gives in and endorses Trump before the fall election.\n\n\"It would really disappoint me if she doesn't stand up to him,\" Floras said. \"That would do her in.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

Speculations surround her potential endorsement, impact on the general election, and the Biden campaign's efforts to win over swing voters. Haley's public appearances and voter sentiments play significant roles in her political trajectory.Nikki Haley is perhaps the highest-profile Republican in the nation who has refused to fall in line and endorse Donald Trump's presidential bid. It's unclear how long that might last.\n\nSome allies believe she may be forced to endorse him before the November election to avoid permanently alienating the Republican Party base. Some even suspect that Haley will re-emerge on Trump's short list of vice presidential contenders in the coming months, despite Trump's recent statement to the contrary.\n\nBut if Haley submits to Trump, as so many of his GOP critics have done, she also risks destroying her own coalition of independents, moderates and anti-Trump Republicans, who are still showing up to support her in low-profile primary contests from deep-red Indiana to deep-blue Maryland. On Tuesday, she gets another chance to demonstrate her sustained strength in Kentucky's presidential primary contest, which comes more than two months after she suspended her campaign.\n\nHaley's decision on Trump in the coming months will be closely watched not just by her supporters, but by allies of Trump and President Joe Biden. What she decides to do - and whether her coalition follows - could have a profound impact on this year's general election and her future as a top-tier Republican whose brand appeals to many people outside her party.\n\n\"Nikki Haley could be the person that unites us,\" said Thalia Floras, a 62-year-old retail manager from Nashua, New Hampshire, who was a lifelong Democrat before casting a ballot for Haley in her state's January primary.\n\nBut Floras also has a warning: \"Nikki Haley has a good place with me now. But if she goes with Trump, I'm done.\"\n\nThose close to Haley, a 52-year-old former governor and U.N. ambassador, say it's unclear what she'll do.\n\nHALEY VOTERS UP FOR GRABS, BUT ONLY BIDEN TRYING\n\nHaley and Trump haven't spoken in months. That includes the period after she bowed out of the GOP primary campaign in early March, according to a person with direct knowledge of Haley's private conversations who was not authorized to speak about them publicly.\n\nAnd while some Republicans who supported Haley will certainly drift back to Trump organically, the Biden campaign is working to win over her supporters, whom they view as true swing voters.\n\nBiden's team is quietly organizing a Republicans for Biden group, which will eventually include dedicated staff and focus on the hundreds of thousands of Haley voters in each battleground state, according to people familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nThe Democratic president hasn't kept his intentions a secret.\n\nBiden issued a statement thanking Haley for her courage to challenge Trump just minutes after she bowed out of the primary race in March.\n\n\"Donald Trump made it clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley's supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign,\" Biden said at the time.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, said in late January that Haley donors would be permanently banned from his \"Make America Great Again\" camp. While he has refrained from attacking her since she left the race, Trump hasn't offered public statements of goodwill either as he has for other vanquished rivals like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nAs part of Biden's sustained outreach to Haley's coalition, his campaign released a digital ad late last month highlighting Trump's often-personal attacks against Haley, including his primary nickname of her as \"birdbrain\" and suggestion that \"she's not presidential timber.\"\n\nAsked about Trump's lack of outreach to Haley and her supporters, senior adviser Jason Miller avoided any mention of her and instead cast doubt on the strength of Biden's coalition of Black Americans, Latinos and young voters.\n\n\"The reality is the Republican Party is united behind President Trump while the Democrat Party has shattered to pieces because of Joe Biden's disastrous policies on issues like inflation and the border,\" Miller said.\n\nFew expect Haley to endorse the Democratic president outright. Such a decision would make it difficult, if not impossible, for her to win a future GOP presidential primary if she decides to run again.\n\nInstead, Biden's allies are hopeful that Haley, among other high-profile Republican Trump critics, may either stay silent or offer an endorsement focusing on the stakes of the election for democracy rather than direct praise for Biden.\n\nIf and when Biden's team does secure high-profile Republican supporters, it's likely to wait several more weeks to unveil them to help maximize their impact when voters are paying closing attention to the November election.\n\nA PRO-BIDEN REPUBLICAN SPEAKS\n\nFormer Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican who had backed Haley in the GOP primary, formally endorsed Biden earlier in the month. In an interview, he said he made the decision before talking to Biden's campaign, although Biden personally called to thank him after Duncan announced his decision.\n\nDuncan didn't rule out playing a prominent role in the Republicans for Biden group or even speaking at the Democratic National Convention this summer, just as former Ohio Gov. John Kasich did four years ago.\n\nDuncan hopes Haley doesn't ultimately endorse Trump as so many of Trump's high-profile Republican critics have done.\n\n\"I feel like that would be a short-term sugar high to just gain favor inside the Republican Party,\" Duncan said of a potential Haley endorsement of Trump. \"She has the right to do what she wants to do. Obviously everybody's playing the political calculus. But at some point, where do we draw the line?\"\n\nThe list of high-profile Republicans willing to stand up to Trump in 2024 is extraordinarily small.\n\nEven those who described Trump as a dangerous threat to democracy, like New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, have ultimately endorsed him. Sununu, who was among Haley's top national surrogates during the campaign, declined repeated requests to comment on her political future. And DeSantis, once Trump's chief primary rival and another early 2028 prospect, now plans to raise money for Trump's general election campaign.\n\nHALEY STEPS BACK INTO PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT\n\nHaley has only just begun to emerge from a period of post-campaign seclusion, where she took time to reconnect with family, especially her husband, a military serviceman who recently returned from a nearly yearlong tour overseas.\n\nShe plans to deliver a speech on foreign policy later this week - her first public address since ending her 2024 campaign - at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based conservative think tank where she's agreed to serve as the Walter P. Stern Chair.\n\nAnd last week, Haley huddled with dozens of donors and allies behind closed doors in South Carolina, where she thanked her coalition, while largely ignoring Trump. She did not encourage attendees to support his campaign.\n\nSimone Levinson, a Haley bundler who attended the private gathering, said there remains an appetite among Republicans for a next-generation figure who can communicate well and build consensus.\n\n\"There is a very strong indication that she has struck a chord that is still continuing to resonate with millions of Americans,\" said Levinson, who is based in Florida.\n\nHER COALITION SENDS A MESSAGE\n\nIndeed, without any formal organization, advertising or even private encouragement, the Haley voters continue to show up in low-profile presidential primaries, which will run through the end of June even though Trump is the only candidate still in the running.\n\nHaley earned more than 21% of the vote in Maryland's presidential primary last week. That's after hitting similar marks the week before in Indiana and Arizona just weeks after leaving the race.\n\n\"She's articulate and intelligent, which are things that Trump isn't,\" said retired school psychologist Kathy Showen, an independent voter from Cross Lanes, West Virginia, who cast a primary ballot for Haley last week.\n\nMeanwhile, in New Hampshire, Floras said she'll begrudgingly vote for Biden this fall because she can't stomach Trump. But she's hopeful that Haley will run again in 2028.\n\nHer feelings might change, however, if Haley gives in and endorses Trump before the fall election.\n\n\"It would really disappoint me if she doesn't stand up to him,\" Floras said. \"That would do her in.\"", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Gov. Geoff Duncan leaves the Fulton County Courthouse, Aug. 14, 2023, in Atlanta. Nikki Haley exceeded expectations by becoming the last Republican standing against Donald Trump in the Republican presidential nomination fight. She still hasn't fallen in line and endorsed her former rival. Duncan, a Republican who had endorsed Haley, formally endorsed President Joe Biden earlier in the month. Duncan hopes Haley doesn't ultimately endorse Trump as so many of Trump's high-profile Republican critics have done.\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Nikki Haley is perhaps the highest-profile Republican in the nation who has refused to fall in line and endorse Donald Trump's presidential bid.\n\nIt's unclear how long that might last.\n\nSome allies believe she may be forced to endorse him before the November election to avoid permanently alienating the Republican Party base. Some even suspect that Haley will re-emerge on Trump's short list of vice presidential contenders in the coming months, despite Trump's recent statement to the contrary.\n\nBut if Haley submits to Trump, as so many of his GOP critics have done, she also risks destroying her own coalition of independents, moderates and anti-Trump Republicans, who are still showing up to support her in low-profile primary contests from deep-red Indiana to deep-blue Maryland. On Tuesday, she gets another chance to demonstrate her sustained strength in Kentucky's presidential primary contest, which comes more than two months after she suspended her campaign.\n\nHaley's decision on Trump in the coming months will be closely watched not just by her supporters, but by allies of Trump and President Joe Biden. What she decides to do -- and whether her coalition follows -- could have a profound impact on this year's general election and her future as a top-tier Republican whose brand appeals to many people outside her party.\n\n\"Nikki Haley could be the person that unites us,\" said Thalia Floras, a 62-year-old retail manager from Nashua, New Hampshire, who was a lifelong Democrat before casting a ballot for Haley in her state's January primary.\n\nBut Floras also has a warning: \"Nikki Haley has a good place with me now. But if she goes with Trump, I'm done.\"\n\nThose close to Haley, a 52-year-old former governor and U.N. ambassador, say it's unclear what she'll do.\n\nHALEY VOTERS UP FOR GRABS, BUT ONLY BIDEN TRYING\n\nHaley and Trump haven't spoken in months. That includes the period after she bowed out of the GOP primary campaign in early March, according to a person with direct knowledge of Haley's private conversations who was not authorized to speak about them publicly.\n\nAnd while some Republicans who supported Haley will certainly drift back to Trump organically, the Biden campaign is working to win over her supporters, whom they view as true swing voters.\n\nBiden's team is quietly organizing a Republicans for Biden group, which will eventually include dedicated staff and focus on the hundreds of thousands of Haley voters in each battleground state, according to people familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nThe Democratic president hasn't kept his intentions a secret.\n\nBiden issued a statement thanking Haley for her courage to challenge Trump just minutes after she bowed out of the primary race in March.\n\n\"Donald Trump made it clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley's supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign,\" Biden said at the time.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, said in late January that Haley donors would be permanently banned from his \"Make America Great Again\" camp. While he has refrained from attacking her since she left the race, Trump hasn't offered public statements of goodwill either as he has for other vanquished rivals like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nAs part of Biden's sustained outreach to Haley's coalition, his campaign released a digital ad late last month highlighting Trump's often-personal attacks against Haley, including his primary nickname of her as \"birdbrain\" and suggestion that \"she's not presidential timber.\"\n\nAsked about Trump's lack of outreach to Haley and her supporters, senior adviser Jason Miller avoided any mention of her and instead cast doubt on the strength of Biden's coalition of Black Americans, Latinos and young voters.\n\n\"The reality is the Republican Party is united behind President Trump while the Democrat Party has shattered to pieces because of Joe Biden's disastrous policies on issues like inflation and the border,\" Miller said.\n\nFew expect Haley to endorse the Democratic president outright. Such a decision would make it difficult, if not impossible, for her to win a future GOP presidential primary if she decides to run again.\n\nInstead, Biden's allies are hopeful that Haley, among other high-profile Republican Trump critics, may either stay silent or offer an endorsement focusing on the stakes of the election for democracy rather than direct praise for Biden.\n\nIf and when Biden's team does secure high-profile Republican supporters, it's likely to wait several more weeks to unveil them to help maximize their impact when voters are paying closing attention to the November election.\n\nA PRO-BIDEN REPUBLICAN SPEAKS\n\nFormer Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican who had backed Haley in the GOP primary, formally endorsed Biden earlier in the month. In an interview, he said he made the decision before talking to Biden's campaign, although Biden personally called to thank him after Duncan announced his decision.\n\nDuncan didn't rule out playing a prominent role in the Republicans for Biden group or even speaking at the Democratic National Convention this summer, just as former Ohio Gov. John Kasich did four years ago.\n\nDuncan hopes Haley doesn't ultimately endorse Trump as so many of Trump's high-profile Republican critics have done.\n\n\"I feel like that would be a short-term sugar high to just gain favor inside the Republican Party,\" Duncan said of a potential Haley endorsement of Trump. \"She has the right to do what she wants to do. Obviously everybody's playing the political calculus. But at some point, where do we draw the line?\"\n\nThe list of high-profile Republicans willing to stand up to Trump in 2024 is extraordinarily small.\n\nEven those who described Trump as a dangerous threat to democracy, like New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, have ultimately endorsed him. Sununu, who was among Haley's top national surrogates during the campaign, declined repeated requests to comment on her political future. And DeSantis, once Trump's chief primary rival and another early 2028 prospect, now plans to raise money for Trump's general election campaign.\n\nHALEY STEPS BACK INTO PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT\n\nHaley has only just begun to emerge from a period of post-campaign seclusion, where she took time to reconnect with family, especially her husband, a military serviceman who recently returned from a nearly yearlong tour overseas.\n\nShe plans to deliver a speech on foreign policy later this week -- her first public address since ending her 2024 campaign -- at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based conservative think tank where she's agreed to serve as the Walter P. Stern Chair.\n\nAnd last week, Haley huddled with dozens of donors and allies behind closed doors in South Carolina, where she thanked her coalition, while largely ignoring Trump. She did not encourage attendees to support his campaign.\n\nSimone Levinson, a Haley bundler who attended the private gathering, said there remains an appetite among Republicans for a next-generation figure who can communicate well and build consensus.\n\n\"There is a very strong indication that she has struck a chord that is still continuing to resonate with millions of Americans,\" said Levinson, who is based in Florida.\n\nHER COALITION SENDS A MESSAGE\n\nIndeed, without any formal organization, advertising or even private encouragement, the Haley voters continue to show up in low-profile presidential primaries, which will run through the end of June even though Trump is the only candidate still in the running.\n\nHaley earned more than 21% of the vote in Maryland's presidential primary last week. That's after hitting similar marks the week before in Indiana and Arizona just weeks after leaving the race.\n\n\"She's articulate and intelligent, which are things that Trump isn't,\" said retired school psychologist Kathy Showen, an independent voter from Cross Lanes, West Virginia, who cast a primary ballot for Haley last week.\n\nMeanwhile, in New Hampshire, Floras said she'll begrudgingly vote for Biden this fall because she can't stomach Trump. But she's hopeful that Haley will run again in 2028.\n\nHer feelings might change, however, if Haley gives in and endorses Trump before the fall election.\n\n\"It would really disappoint me if she doesn't stand up to him,\" Floras said. \"That would do her in.\"\n\nPeoples reported from New York.

On Tuesday, she gets another chance to demonstrate her sustained strength in Kentucky's Presidential Primary contest, which comes more than two months after she suspended her campaign.\n\nHaley's decision on Trump in the coming months will be closely watched not just by her supporters, but by allies of Trump and President Joe Biden. What she decides to do -- and whether her coalition follows -- could have a profound impact on this year's General Election and her future as a top-tier Republican whose brand appeals to many people outside her party.\n\n\"Nikki Haley could be the person that unites us,\" said Thalia Floras, a 62-year-old retail manager from Nashua, New Hampshire, who was a lifelong Democrat before casting a ballot for Haley in her state's January Primary.\n\nThose close to Haley, a 52-year-old former Governor and U.N. Ambassador, say it's unclear what she'll do.\n\nHALEY VOTERS UP FOR GRABS, BUT ONLY JOE BIDEN TRYING\n\nHaley and Trump haven't spoken in months. That includes the period after she bowed out of the GOP Primary campaign in early March, according to a person with direct knowledge of Haley's private conversations who was not authorized to speak about them publicly.\n\nAnd while some Republicans who supported Haley will certainly drift back to Trump organically, the Biden campaign is working to win over her supporters, whom they view as true swing voters.\n\nBiden's team is quietly organizing a Republicans for Biden group, which will eventually include dedicated staff and focus on the hundreds of thousands of Haley voters in each battleground state, according to people familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nThe Democratic president hasn't kept his intentions a secret.\n\nBiden issued a statement thanking Haley for her courage to challenge Trump just minutes after she bowed out of the Primary race in March.\n\n\"Donald Trump made it clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley's supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign,\" Biden said at the time.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, said in late January that Haley donors would be permanently banned from his \"Make America Great Again\" camp. While he has refrained from attacking her since she left the race, Trump hasn't offered public statements of goodwill either as he has for other vanquished rivals like Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nAs part of Biden's sustained outreach to Haley's coalition, his campaign released a digital ad late last month highlighting Trump's often-personal attacks against Haley, including his primary nickname of her as \"birdbrain\" and suggestion that \"she's not presidential timber.\"\n\nAsked about Trump's lack of outreach to Haley and her supporters, senior adviser Jason Miller avoided any mention of her and instead cast doubt on the strength of Biden's coalition of Black Americans, Latinos and young voters.\n\n\"The reality is the Republican Party is united behind President Trump while the Democrat Party has shattered to pieces because of Joe Biden's disastrous policies on issues like inflation and the border,\" Miller said.\n\nFew expect Haley to endorse the Democratic president outright. Such a decision would make it difficult, if not impossible, for her to win a future GOP Presidential Primary if she decides to run again.\n\nInstead, Biden's allies are hopeful that Haley, among other high-profile Republican Trump critics, may either stay silent or offer an endorsement focusing on the stakes of the election for democracy rather than direct praise for Biden.\n\nIf and when Biden's team does secure high-profile Republican supporters, it's likely to wait several more weeks to unveil them to help maximize their impact when voters are paying closing attention to the November election.\n\nA PRO-BIDEN REPUBLICAN SPEAKS\n\nFormer Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican who had backed Haley in the GOP Primary, formally endorsed Biden earlier in the month. In an interview, he said he made the decision before talking to Biden's campaign, although Biden personally called to thank him after Duncan announced his decision.\n\nDuncan didn't rule out playing a prominent role in the Republicans for Biden group or even speaking at the Democratic National Convention this summer, just as former Ohio Gov. John Kasich did four years ago.\n\nDuncan hopes Haley doesn't ultimately endorse Trump as so many of Trump's high-profile Republican critics have done.\n\n\"I feel like that would be a short-term sugar high to just gain favor inside the Republican Party,\" Duncan said of a potential Haley endorsement of Trump. \"She has the right to do what she wants to do. Obviously everybody's playing the political calculus. But at some point, where do we draw the line?\"\n\nThe list of high-profile Republicans willing to stand up to Trump in 2024 is extraordinarily small.\n\nEven those who described Trump as a dangerous threat to democracy, like New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, have ultimately endorsed him. Sununu, who was among Haley's top national surrogates during the campaign, declined repeated requests to comment on her political future. And DeSantis, once Trump's chief primary rival and another early 2028 prospect, now plans to raise money for Trump's General Election campaign.\n\nHALEY STEPS BACK INTO PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT\n\nHaley has only just begun to emerge from a period of post-campaign seclusion, where she took time to reconnect with family, especially her husband, a military serviceman who recently returned from a nearly yearlong tour overseas.\n\nShe plans to deliver a speech on foreign policy later this week -- her first public address since ending her 2024 campaign -- at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based conservative think tank where she's agreed to serve as the Walter P. Stern Chair.\n\nAnd last week, Haley huddled with dozens of donors and allies behind closed doors in South Carolina, where she thanked her coalition, while largely ignoring Trump. She did not encourage attendees to support his campaign.\n\nSimone Levinson, a Haley bundler who attended the private gathering, said there remains an appetite among Republicans for a next-generation figure who can communicate well and build consensus.\n\n\"There is a very strong indication that she has struck a chord that is still continuing to resonate with millions of Americans,\" said Levinson, who is based in Florida.\n\nHER COALITION SENDS A MESSAGE\n\nIndeed, without any formal organization, advertising or even private encouragement, the Haley voters continue to show up in low-profile Presidential Primaries, which will run through the end of June even though Trump is the only candidate still in the running.\n\nHaley earned more than 21% of the vote in Maryland's Presidential Primary last week. That's after hitting similar marks the week before in Indiana and Arizona just weeks after leaving the race.\n\n\"She's articulate and intelligent, which are things that Trump isn't,\" said retired school psychologist Kathy Showen, an independent voter from Cross Lanes, West Virginia, who cast a Primary ballot for Haley last week.\n\nMeanwhile, in New Hampshire, Floras said she'll begrudgingly vote for Biden this fall because she can't stomach Trump. But she's hopeful that Haley will run again in 2028.\n\nHer feelings might change, however, if Haley gives in and endorses Trump before the fall election.\n\n\"It would really disappoint me if she doesn't stand up to him,\" Floras said. \"That would do her in.\"", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

Some even suspect Haley will emerge on Trump's short list of vice presidential contenders in the coming months, despite Trump's recent statement to the contrary.\n\nBut if Haley submits to Trump, as so many of his GOP critics have done, she also risks destroying her own coalition of independents, moderates and anti-Trump Republicans, who are still showing up to support her in low-profile primary contests from deep-red Indiana to deep-blue Maryland.\n\nHer decision in the coming months will be closely watched not just by her supporters, but by allies of Trump and President Joe Biden. What she decides to do -- and whether her coalition follows -- could have a profound impact on this year's general election and her future as a top-tier Republican whose brand appeals to many people outside her party.\n\n\"Nikki Haley could be the person that unites us,\" said Thalia Floras, a 62-year-old retail manager from Nashua, New Hampshire, who was a lifelong Democrat before casting a ballot for Haley in her state's January primary.\n\nBut Floras also has a warning: \"Nikki Haley has a good place with me now. But if she goes with Trump, I'm done.\"\n\nThose close to Haley, a 52-year-old former governor and U.N. ambassador, say it is unclear what she will do.\n\nHaley and Trump have not spoken in months. That includes the period after she bowed out of the GOP primary campaign in early March, according to a person with direct knowledge of Haley's private conversations who was not authorized to speak about them publicly.\n\nAnd while some Republicans who supported Haley will certainly drift back to Trump organically, the Biden campaign is working to win over her supporters, whom they view as true swing voters.\n\nBiden's team is quietly organizing a Republicans for Biden group, which will eventually include dedicated staff and focus on the hundreds of thousands of Haley voters in each battleground state, according to people familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nThe Democrat president has not kept his intentions a secret.\n\nBiden issued a statement thanking Haley for her courage to challenge Trump just minutes after she bowed out of the primary race in March.\n\n\"Donald Trump made it clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley's supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign,\" Biden said at the time.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, said in late January that Haley donors would be permanently banned from his \"Make America Great Again\" camp. While he has refrained from attacking her since she left the race, Trump hasn't offered public statements of goodwill either as he has for other vanquished rivals like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nAs part of Biden's sustained outreach to Haley's coalition, his campaign released a digital ad late last month highlighting Trump's often-personal attacks against Haley, including his primary nickname of her as \"birdbrain\" and suggestion that \"she's not presidential timber.\"\n\nAsked about Trump's lack of outreach to Haley and her supporters, senior adviser Jason Miller avoided any mention of her and instead cast doubt on the strength of Biden's coalition of Black Americans, Latinos, and young voters.\n\n\"The reality is the Republican Party is united behind President Trump while the Democrat Party has shattered to pieces because of Joe Biden's disastrous policies on issues like inflation and the border,\" Miller said.\n\nFew expect Haley to endorse the Democrat president outright. Such a decision would make it difficult, if not impossible, for her to win a future GOP presidential primary if she decides to run again.\n\nInstead, Biden's allies are hopeful that Haley, among other high-profile Republican Trump critics, may either stay silent or offer an endorsement focusing on the stakes of the election for democracy rather than direct praise for Biden.\n\nIf and when Biden's team does secure high-profile Republican supporters, it is likely to wait several more weeks to unveil them to help maximize their impact when voters are paying closing attention to the November election.\n\nFormer Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican who had backed Haley in the GOP primary, formally endorsed Biden earlier in the month. In an interview, he said he made the decision before talking to Biden's campaign, although Biden personally called to thank him after Duncan announced his decision.\n\nDuncan did not rule out playing a prominent role in the Republicans for Biden group or even speaking at the Democratic National Convention this summer, just as former Ohio Gov. John Kasich did four years ago.\n\nDuncan hopes Haley does not ultimately endorse Trump as so many of Trump's high-profile Republican critics have done.\n\n\"I feel like that would be a short-term sugar high to just gain favor inside the Republican Party,\" Duncan said of a potential Haley endorsement of Trump. \"She has the right to do what she wants to do. Obviously everybody's playing the political calculus. But at some point, where do we draw the line?\"\n\nThe list of high-profile Republicans willing to stand up to Trump in 2024 is extraordinarily small.\n\nEven those who described Trump as a dangerous threat to democracy, like New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, have ultimately endorsed him. Sununu, who was among Haley's top national surrogates during the campaign, declined repeated requests to comment on her political future. And DeSantis, once Trump's chief primary rival and another early 2028 prospect, now plans to raise money for Trump's general election campaign.\n\nHaley has only just begun to emerge from a period of post-campaign seclusion, where she took time to reconnect with family, especially her husband, a military serviceman who recently returned from a nearly yearlong tour overseas.\n\nShe plans to deliver a speech on foreign policy later this week -- her first public address since ending her 2024 campaign -- at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based conservative think tank where she's agreed to serve as the Walter P. Stern Chair.\n\nAnd last week, Haley huddled with dozens of donors and allies behind closed doors in South Carolina, where she thanked her coalition, while largely ignoring Trump. She did not encourage attendees to support his campaign.\n\nSimone Levinson, a Haley bundler who attended the private gathering, said there remains an appetite among Republicans for a next-generation figure who can communicate well and build consensus.\n\n\"There is a very strong indication that she has struck a chord that is still continuing to resonate with millions of Americans,\" said Levinson, who is based in Florida.\n\nIndeed, without any formal organization, advertising or even private encouragement, the Haley voters continue to show up in low-profile presidential primaries, which will run through the end of June even though Trump is the only candidate still in the running.\n\nHaley earned more than 21% of the vote in Maryland's presidential primary last week. That's after hitting similar marks the week before in Indiana and Arizona just weeks after leaving the race.\n\n\"She's articulate and intelligent, which are things that Trump isn't,\" said retired school psychologist Kathy Showen, an independent voter from Cross Lanes, West Virginia, who cast a primary ballot for Haley last week.\n\nMeanwhile, in New Hampshire, Floras said she'll begrudgingly vote for Biden this fall because she cannot stomach Trump. But she is hopeful Haley will run again in 2028.\n\nHer feelings might change, however, if Haley gives in and endorses Trump before the fall election.\n\n\"It would really disappoint me if she doesn't stand up to him,\" Floras said. \"That would do her in.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meg_kinnard@newsmax.com", "name": "Meg

In an interview, he said he made the decision before speaking to Biden's campaign, although Biden personally called him to thank him after Duncan announced his decision.\n\nDuncan has not ruled out playing a leading role within the Republicans for Biden group or even speaking at the Democratic National Convention this summer, as has former Ohio Governor John Kasich, the did it four years ago.\n\nDuncan hopes Haley doesn't ultimately support Trump like so many high-profile Republican critics of Trump have done.\n\n\"I feel like it would be a short-term thrill to just curry favor with the Republican Party,\" Duncan said of Haley's possible support for Trump. She has the right to do what she wants. Obviously, everyone is playing political calculation. But at some point, where do we draw the line?\n\nThe list of leading Republicans ready to stand up to Trump in 2024 is extraordinarily small.\n\nEven those who portrayed Trump as a dangerous threat to democracy, like New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, ultimately backed him. Sununu, who was among Haley's top national surrogates during the campaign, declined repeated requests for comment on his political future. And DeSantis, once Trump's main rival and another contender in early 2028, now plans to raise money for Trump's general election campaign.\n\nHaley returns to the public spotlight\n\nHaley is just beginning to emerge from a period of post-campaign isolation, where she took time to reconnect with her family, particularly her husband, a military man who recently returned from a nearly year-long mission to the foreigner.\n\nShe plans to give a speech on foreign policy later this week, her first public address since ending her 2024 campaign at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank based in Washington where she agreed to serve as president Walter P. Stern.\n\nAnd last week, Haley met behind closed doors with dozens of donors and allies in South Carolina, where she thanked her coalition, while largely ignoring Trump. She did not encourage participants to support her campaign.\n\nSimone Levinson, a Haley aide who attended the private meeting, said Republicans still have an appetite for a next-generation figure who can communicate well and build consensus.\n\nThere are very strong indications that it struck a chord that continues to resonate with millions of Americans, said Levinson, based in Florida.\n\nHis coalition sends him a message\n\nIndeed, without any formal organization, advertising, or even private encouragement, Haley voters continue to show up in the low-key presidential primaries, which will run through the end of June, even though Trump is the only candidate still in the running.\n\nHaley received more than 21 percent of the vote in Maryland's presidential primary last week. That's after hitting similar marks the week before in Indiana and Arizona, just weeks after leaving the race.\n\nShe's articulate and intelligent, which Trump is not, said retired school psychologist Kathy Showen, an independent voter from Cross Lanes, West Virginia, who voted for Haley last week.\n\nAnalysis: How Nikki Haley's White House bid made history\n\nMeanwhile, in New Hampshire, Floras said she would reluctantly vote for Biden this fall because she can't stand Trump. But she hopes Haley will run again in 2028.\n\nHis feelings could change, however, if Haley gives in and supports Trump before the fall election.\n\nIt would really disappoint me if she didn't stand up to him, Floras said. That would make her fall.\n\nPeople reported from New York. Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

Some even suspect that Haley will re-emerge on Trump's short list of vice presidential contenders in the coming months, despite Trump's recent statement to the contrary.\n\nBut if Haley submits to Trump, as so many of his GOP critics have done, she also risks destroying her own coalition of independents, moderates and anti-Trump Republicans, who are still showing up to support her in low-profile primary contests from deep-red Indiana to deep-blue Maryland. On Tuesday, she gets another chance to demonstrate her sustained strength in Kentucky's presidential primary contest, which comes more than two months after she suspended her campaign.\n\nHaley's decision on Trump in the coming months will be closely watched not just by her supporters, but by allies of Trump and President Joe Biden. What she decides to do - and whether her coalition follows - could have a profound impact on this year's general election and her future as a top-tier Republican whose brand appeals to many people outside her party.\n\n\"Nikki Haley could be the person that unites us,\" said Thalia Floras, a 62-year-old retail manager from Nashua, New Hampshire, who was a lifelong Democrat before casting a ballot for Haley in her state's January primary.\n\nBut Floras also has a warning: \"Nikki Haley has a good place with me now. But if she goes with Trump, I'm done.\" Those close to Haley, a 52-year-old former governor and U.N. ambassador, say it's unclear what she'll do.\n\nHaley and Trump haven't spoken in months. That includes the period after she bowed out of the GOP primary campaign in early March, according to a person with direct knowledge of Haley's private conversations who was not authorized to speak about them publicly.\n\nAnd while some Republicans who supported Haley will certainly drift back to Trump organically, the Biden campaign is working to win over her supporters, whom they view as true swing voters.\n\nBiden's team is quietly organizing a Republicans for Biden group, which will eventually include dedicated staff and focus on the hundreds of thousands of Haley voters in each battleground state, according to people familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nThe Democratic president hasn't kept his intentions a secret.

Ambassador Nikki Haley speaks at the Hudson Institute in Washington, Wednesday, May 22, 2024. Haley says she will be voting for Donald Trump in the general election, encouraging the presumptive GOP nominee to work hard to win support from those who backed her in the primary. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)\n\nNikki Haley said Wednesday that she will be voting for Donald Trump in the general election, a notable show of support given their intense and often personal rivalry during the Republican primary calendar.\n\nBut Haley also made it clear that she feels Trump has work to do to win over voters who supported her during the course of the primary campaign and continue to cast votes for her in ongoing primary contests.\n\n\"I will be voting for Trump,\" Haley, Trump's former U.N. ambassador, said during an event at the Hudson Institute in Washington.\n\n\"Having said that, I stand by what I said in my suspension speech,\" Haley added. \"Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me and not assume that they're just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that.\"\n\nThe comments in her first public speech since leaving the race are another signal of the GOP's virtually complete consolidation of support behind Trump, even from those who have labeled him a threat in the past.\n\nHaley shuttered her own bid for the GOP nomination two months ago but did not immediately endorse Trump, having accused him of causing chaos and disregarding the importance of U.S. alliances abroad as well as questioning whether Trump, 77, was too old to be president again.\n\nTrump, in turn, repeatedly mocked her with the nickname \"Birdbrain,\" though he curtailed those attacks after securing enough delegates in March to become the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nTrump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Haley's announcement.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign, meanwhile, has been working to win over her supporters, whom they view as true swing voters. Biden's team is quietly organizing a Republicans for Biden group, which will eventually include dedicated staff and focus on the hundreds of thousands of Haley voters in each battleground state, according to people familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nBut Haley made several criticisms of Biden's foreign policy and handling of the U.S.-Mexico border in her speech Wednesday at the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank she recently joined as she reemerges in the political realm.\n\nEarlier this month, Haley huddled in South Carolina with some of her donors, an event characterized as a \"thank you\" to her top supporters and not a discussion about Haley's future political plans or intended to push her backers toward any other candidate.\n\nIf she runs for president again, Haley will likely need to win over former Trump supporters in a Republican primary. But her support for him now risks offending moderates and anti-Trump conservatives.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hudson Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdbrain_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birdbrain (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.castanet.net/content/2024/5/1daf2038-8099-4fb0-a841-4f7da9112dc4_p3802253.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583760", "eventUri": "eng-9583760", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Stern chair.\n\nHaley said she has \"no regrets\" about her GOP primary bid: \"We left it all on the field.\"\n\nShe also thanked the primary voters who have continued to back her even after her departure from the race -- a potential warning sign for Trump. And she reiterated the call she'd made when exiting the race in March for the former president to reach out to those voters.\n\n\"Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me, and not assume that they're just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that,\" Haley said.\n\nEarlier this year, Haley and Trump were engaged in what had become a bitter primary feud. Haley, at one point, questioned the former president's mental fitness. She told CNN in January that Trump and Biden were \"equally bad.\"\n\nHer critiques of Trump during the primary grew even sharper after the former president mocked the absence of her deployed husband and called for all of her donors to be \"permanently barred from the MAGA camp.\"\n\n\"In that moment, he showed that with that kind of disrespect for the military, he's not qualified to be the president of the United States, because I don't trust him to protect them,\" Haley said in February.\n\nThen, days before dropping out, she said she no longer believed she was bound by the Republican National Committee pledge to support the party's eventual presidential nominee.\n\nAs she ventured back onto the political stage Wednesday, after two months out of public view, Haley didn't mention Trump in her Hudson Institute speech -- only addressing the former president when asked about him afterward.\n\n\"A dangerous worldview has risen on both sides of the aisle,\" she said in her remarks. \"Once again, it threatens our prosperity and security. We need to take this seriously.\"\n\nShe offered full support for Israel's war with Hamas and strongly criticized Biden for placing conditions on military aid to the country.\n\n\"Biden thinks he's stopping a war,\" Haley said. \"In fact, he's dragging out a war, emboldening terrorists and making other wars more likely.\"\n\nShe was also critical of her fellow Republicans, urging the party to support military aid for Ukraine and Israel. But she did not criticize GOP members by name and praised House Speaker Mike Johnson for the recent passage of a military aid package.\n\n\"Sending weapons to Ukraine and Israel isn't foreign aid,\" she said. \"It's an investment in a world in which authoritarian dictators cannot run roughshod over free countries.\"\n\nSince leaving the race in March, the former South Carolina governor has spent time reconnecting with her family, aides say, including her husband, Michael, who returned from a yearlong overseas deployment.\n\nYet even in her absence, she's been winning votes in one Republican primary after another. Her lingering support has exposed a potential challenge Trump faces to unifty the party in suburban areas of swing states - such as outside Philadelphia, where Haley received nearly 25% of the vote in both Chester and Montgomery counties.\n\nWhile Trump has not extended an olive branch to Haley or her supporters, the Biden campaign has closely studied the Republican primary results, aides say, even in deep-red states such as Indiana, where Haley received about 22% of the vote earlier this month. The Biden campaign has sought to reach Haley's supporters through television and digital ads in hopes of reminding them of Trump's insults aimed at their candidate.\n\n\"The campaign has the opportunity to target and engage high-information Republican voters like Nikki Haley supporters or other voters who voted for Donald Trump in '20, but voted for Democratic candidates in '22 across battleground states,\" a top Biden adviser told CNN.\n\nThe Biden campaign argued Wednesday that Haley's backing of Trump doesn't change the choice before voters. \"Nothing has changed for the millions of Republican voters who continue to cast their ballots against Donald Trump in the primaries and care deeply about the future of our democracy, standing strong with our allies against foreign adversaries, and working across the aisle to get things done for the American people - while also rejecting the chaos, division and violence that Donald Trump embodies,\" campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement.\n\n\"Only one candidate shares those values, and only one campaign is working hard every day to earn their support - and that's President Biden's.\"\n\nIt's an open question how many of those voters backing Haley in primary contests are lodging a temporary protest against Trump or actually open to supporting Biden.\n\nRepublican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, who endorsed Haley in the primary before switching his support to Trump, said he believes she should be on the GOP ticket.\n\n\"For Nikki Haley, in Indiana, to pull over 20% and not be on the ballot is amazing,\" Norman told CNN. \"That's why she would make a great VP candidate. And I made that pitch to President Trump and also to Nikki Haley.\"\n\nNorman said that while Haley has not expressed interest in joining Trump's ticket, he believes she would be interested.\n\n\"Politics is an interesting game. People can forget the past and look forward to the future,\" Norman said.\n\nFor his part, Trump has said Haley \"is not under consideration\" but said he wished her well.\n\nAs other former Republican contenders have fallen in line behind Trump, Haley has intentionally kept her distance - not hostile, but also not hungry for his adulation.\n\nThe two have not spoken since her concession speech in March.\n\nOne longtime Haley friend told CNN that Trump \"knows how to reach her if he wants to make amends and try to start winning over her supporters.\"\n\nHaley's next steps are uncertain. She has neither ruled in - nor ruled out - a potential 2028 presidential bid. In her speech Wednesday, she offered few clues, even as she struck an optimistic note to the future.\n\n\"We are blessed to live in America,\" Haley said. \"And as every generation of Americans proves, we always rally to defend that blessing.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

So I will be voting for Trump,\" Haley said Wednesday at an event in Washington, her first public speech since dropping out of the GOP presidential primary in March.\n\nHaley said that Trump has \"not been perfect\" on many issues, including foreign policy, but that she would nonetheless support his attempt to return to the White House. President Joe Biden has openly courted her supporters to back his campaign, and it has been an open question whether she would throw her support behind Trump.\n\n\"Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me and not assume that they're just going to be with him,\" she said.\n\nHaley's endorsement of Trump is the latest sign of his near-total grip over the Republican Party.\n\nHaley served as United Nations ambassador under Trump, but they ran an acrimonious campaign against one another filled with personal attacks. After Trump in February made fun of Haley and her husband, who was deployed in the military, the Haley said her former boss was \"not qualified\" to be president because he showed \"disrespect\" to the armed services.\n\nTrump, who insulted Haley with the moniker \"Birdbrain,\" threatened to ban her donors and supporters from his wing of the GOP if they continued to support her. The college-educated voters and women who were drawn to Haley are many of the same voters Trump needs win over if he's to beat Biden in November.\n\nIt's unclear how much her endorsement will influence her coalition of moderates, independents and anti-Trump Republicans to back the former president. Haley continues to appeal to notable numbers of Republicans, including 21% of voters in an Indiana primary where votes were cast two months after she dropped out of the race.\n\nSome Republicans have floated Haley as a potential vice presidential pick. Trump batted down those suggestions earlier this month, posting on social media that she wasn't under consideration.\n\nAs a candidate, she secured the backing of high-profile conservatives on Wall Street and moderate Republicans in Washington who valued her middle-ground policies and foreign policy chops. Haley won several urban and suburban areas in early primary voting contests with the help of some Democrats, but was out-of-step with many GOP voters who cast far more ballots for Trump.\n\nHaley joined the Hudson Institute shortly after suspending her campaign in March, after she lost all but one of the Super Tuesday states to Trump.\n\nHaley is staunch advocate for Israel in their conflict with Hamas in Gaza, upholding international alliances such as Nato and curbing China.

Trump, in turn, repeatedly mocked her with the nickname \"Birdbrain,'' though he curtailed those attacks after securing enough delegates in March to become the presumptive Republican nominee. Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Haley's announcement.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign, meanwhile, has been working to win over her supporters, whom they view as true swing voters. Biden's team is quietly organizing a Republicans for Biden group, which will eventually include dedicated staff and focus on the hundreds of thousands of Haley voters in each battleground state, according to people familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nBut Haley made several criticisms of Biden's foreign policy and handling of the U.S.-Mexico border in her speech Wednesday at the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank she recently joined as she reemerges in the political realm. Earlier this month, Haley huddled in South Carolina with some of her donors, an event characterized as a \"thank you\" to her top supporters and not a discussion about Haley's future political plans or intended to push her backers toward any other candidate.\n\nIf she runs for president again, Haley will likely need to win over former Trump supporters in a Republican primary. But her support for him now risks offending moderates and anti-Trump conservatives. ___ Jill Colvin in New York contributed reporting.\n\n___ Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP NB NB\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hudson Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protests against Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_11_50_05_8739542.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583760", "eventUri": "eng-9583760", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

That's when she said \"it is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party who did not support him, and I hope he does.\"\n\nSome initial takeaways:\n\nHaley's semi-endorsement underscored the distinct probability that she will not be Trump's choice for vice president.\n\nAfter a May 11 report that Haley might be on Trump's list, the former president promptly announced on Truth Social: \"Nikki Haley is not under consideration for the V.P. slot, but I wish her well!\"\n\nNothing Haley said Wednesday would seem to change that dynamic.\n\nBiden and his aides have made many overtures to Haley voters, especially after she continued to rack up votes against Trump in a series of Republican primaries.\n\n\"Nikki Haley was willing to speak the truth about Trump: about the chaos that always follows him, about his inability to see right from wrong, about his cowering before Vladimir Putin,\" Biden said shortly after the former United Nations ambassador withdrew from the Republican race.\n\nIn her speech Wednesday, Haley excoriated Biden over foreign policy and signaled to voters they should also hold him in disdain.\n\nBut after Haley's speech, Democrats said they plan to continue to reach out to Haley voters, explicitly noting her comment that Trump must do more to harness their support.\n\n\"Nothing has changed for the millions of Republican voters who continue to cast their ballots against Donald Trump in the primaries and care deeply about the future of our democracy,\" said Michael Tyler, the Biden-Harris campaign communication's director, arguing that Biden is the only candidate in the race who holds those values.\n\nHaley's tepid-seeming endorsement suggests she won't be on the campaign trail for Trump.\n\nShe could stay as low key as another former Trump opponent, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nDeSantis gave another tepid endorsement of Trump as he withdrew from the presidential race on Jan. 21, two days before the New Hampshire primary.\n\nSince then, Trump and DeSantis have met once, a private session in which the former president sought fundraising help.\n\nSeveral other Republicans who have been critical of Trump in 2024 have since said they plan to cast votes this November for their party's nominee, including New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu and former Attorney General Bill Barr.\n\nSeveral anti-Trump Republicans expressed disappointment with Haley, saying party members need to speak out against the divisive politician who has consumed their party.\n\n\"Nikki Haley outlined every reason why Trump was unfit to be president again,\" said Sarah Longwell, founder of the organization Republican Voters Against Trump.\n\nCiting Trump's \"election denialism, his role in the January 6 insurrection, and his abandonment of our allies around the world.\" Longwell said Haley's decision \"shows a level of moral cowardice that has been the consistent theme of the Trump era.\"\n\nOthers said it wasn't too much of a surprise - not if Haley has designs on the next presidential election, and she probably does.\n\nRegardless of how the 2024 election turns out, Trump voters figure to be a major factor when Republicans look for a nominee in 2028; alienating them now would be a questionable strategy looking ahead.\n\nHaley, only 52 years old, figures to be a prospective presidential candidate down the line.\n\nHaley's unique perch in Republican politics is only one reason that her home state of South Carolina will continue to be an important barometer.\n\nOne of the state's U.S. senators, Tim Scott, is on Trump's short list for vice president; that would also made Scott a prime contender in 2028.\n\nSouth Carolina will also likely keep its place as the first southern primary in the Republican process; no Republican has ever been elected president without winning South Carolina first.",

Ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, in her first public comments since ending her 2024 Republican White House campaign, said she will vote for former President Trump in his 2024 rematch with President Biden.\n\nHaley, who was Trump's last rival in the GOP primaries before suspending her campaign more than two months ago, and who has not endorsed the former president, was asked during a question-and-answer session following her address Tuesday at a conservative think tank in the nation's capital whether Biden or Trump was stronger on national security issues.\n\n\"Trump has not been perfect on these policies. I have made that clear many, many times. But Biden has been a catastrophe. So, I will be voting for Trump,\" Haley said.\n\nBut Haley, who continues to grab up to 20% of the vote in Republican presidential primaries two months after ending her bid, said \"Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me.\"\n\nWARNING SIGNS FLASH FOR BOTH TRUMP, BIDEN AHEAD OF FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE\n\nHaley launched her presidential campaign in February last year, becoming the first major candidate to challenge Trump, who had announced his candidacy three months earlier. She was the final rival to Trump, battling the former president in a contentious two-candidate showdown from the New Hampshire primary in late January through Super Tuesday in early March.\n\nHaley announced that she was suspending her White House campaign on March 6, the day after Trump swept 14 of 15 GOP nominating contests on Super Tuesday.\n\nWHAT KIND OF FUTURE DOES HALEY HAVE IN TRUMP-DOMINATED GOP?\n\nHowever, Haley made it clear when she left the Republican presidential nomination race that she intended to keep speaking out.\n\nAnd to date, Haley has declined to endorse Trump.\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" Haley said as she got out of the race two months ago.\n\nThe Biden campaign, reacting to Haley's comments regarding Trump, continued to make a pitch forHaley supporters.\n\n\"Nothing has changed for the millions of Republican voters who continue to cast their ballots against Donald Trump in the primaries and care deeply about the future of our democracy, standing strong with our allies against foreign adversaries, and working across the aisle to get things done for the American people - while also rejecting the chaos, division and violence that Donald Trump embodies,\" Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement. \"Only one candidate shares those values, and only one campaign is working hard every day to earn their support - and that's President Biden's.\"\n\nDuring her speech on Wednesday, Haley targeted Biden and Republicans in Congress, but she didn't mention Trump by name.\n\nInstead, Haley said that \"a growing number of Democrats and Republicans have forgotten what makes America safe.\"\n\nHaley made her comments as she gave her first address at the Washington, D.C.-based Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank known for focusing on international affairs and national security.\n\nHaley - who during her White House run advocated a muscular U.S. foreign policy to deal with global hot spots such as the war between Russia and Ukraine and the fighting between Israel and Hamas, which was often in stark contrast with Trump's America First agenda of keeping the nation out of international entanglements - joined the institute a month ago as a senior adviser.\n\n\"A loud part of each party wants us to abandon our allies, appease our enemies and focus only on the problems we have at home. They believe that if we leave the world alone, the world will leave us alone. They even say ignoring global chaos will somehow make our country more secure,\" Haley said.\n\nAnd she warned that \"this worldview has already put America in great danger, and the threat is mounting by the day. I have always spoken hard truths. If we don't remember the path to peace, war will come to America, and it will claim countless lives. We have to prevent war. We have to keep Americans safe.\"\n\nHaley trained most of her verbal firepower on the Democrat incumbent in the White House.\n\nPointing to the Biden administration's recent temporary pause of a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel over concerns that the weapons would be used in attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza, where the death toll has reportedly topped 35,000, per the Hamas-run Health Ministry, Haley said, \"I can hardly imagine a more foolish move than Joe Biden withholding weapons from one of our closest allies. And it comes after more and more Democrats have turned on Israel.\"\n\nAnd she said \"Joe Biden's legacy is already clear. He will go down in history as the commander in chief who refused to stop our enemies.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut Haley also fired away at her own party, saying that \"just a few weeks before Biden threw Israel to the wolves, many Republicans in Congress tried to push Ukraine off a cliff. All told, 112 House Republicans voted against military aid to Ukraine.\"\n\nShe said \"some Republicans lack ... clarity when it comes to Ukraine. Russia's dictator has made it perfectly clear that he won't stop at Kyiv. He wants to recreate the Soviet Union, and he's threatened to attack our NATO allies. We are obligated to defend them, and if Russia attacks, American troops will go to war. We must do everything possible to ensure that doesn't happen.\"\n\nDuring a question-and-answer session after her speech, Haley said she will travel to Israel in the coming weeks.\n\nHaley also said that after ending her campaign, \"the first thing I did was catch up on my sleep. I quickly got back to running, which I missed during the campaign.\"\n\nAnd she added that she's spent more time with her parents, her children and her husband, who recently returned from a long military deployment overseas.", "source": {"uri": "foxwilmington.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "foxwilmington.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fox_wilmington@foxwilmington.com", "name": "Fox

Ambassador Nikki Haley speaks at the Hudson Institute in Washington on Wednesday. Haley says she will be voting for Donald Trump in the general election, encouraging the presumptive GOP nominee to work hard to win support from those who backed her in the primary. Cliff Owen/Associated Press\n\nBut Haley also made it clear that she feels Trump has work to do to win over voters who supported her during the course of the primary campaign and continue to cast votes for her in ongoing primary contests.\n\n\"I will be voting for Trump,\" Haley, Trump's former U.N. ambassador, said during an event at the Hudson Institute in Washington.\n\n\"Having said that, I stand by what I said in my suspension speech,\" Haley added. \"Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me and not assume that they're just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that.\"\n\nThe comments in her first public speech since leaving the race are another signal of the GOP's virtually complete consolidation of support behind Trump, even from those who have labeled him a threat in the past.\n\nHaley shuttered her own bid for the GOP nomination two months ago but did not immediately endorse Trump, having accused him of causing chaos and disregarding the importance of U.S. alliances abroad as well as questioning whether Trump, 77, was too old to be president again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump, in turn, repeatedly mocked her with the nickname \"Birdbrain,\" though he curtailed those attacks after securing enough delegates in March to become the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nTrump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Haley's announcement.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign, meanwhile, has been working to win over her supporters, whom they view as true swing voters. Biden's team is quietly organizing a Republicans for Biden group, which will eventually include dedicated staff and focus on the hundreds of thousands of Haley voters in each battleground state, according to people familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nBut Haley made several criticisms of Biden's foreign policy and handling of the U.S.-Mexico border in her speech Wednesday at the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank she recently joined as she reemerges in the political realm.\n\nEarlier this month, Haley huddled in South Carolina with some of her donors, an event characterized as a \"thank you\" to her top supporters and not a discussion about Haley's future political plans or intended to push her backers toward any other candidate.\n\nIf she runs for president again, Haley will likely need to win over former Trump supporters in a Republican primary. But her support for him now risks offending moderates and anti-Trump conservatives.\n\nJill Colvin in New York contributed reporting.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Nikki Haley - in her first public comments since ending her 2024 Republican White House campaign - said that she would be voting for former President Donald Trump in his 2024 rematch with President Biden.\n\nHaley - who was Trump's last rival in the GOP primaries before suspending her campaign over two months ago and who has not endorsed the former president - was asked during a question and answer session following her address Tuesday at a conservative think tank in the nation's capital whether Biden or Trump was stronger on national security issues.\n\n\"Trump has not been perfect on these policies. I have made that clear many, many times. But Biden has been a catastrophe. So I will be voting for Trump,\" Haley said as she answered the question.\n\nBut Haley, who continues to grab up to 20% of the vote in Republican presidential primaries two months after ending her bid, emphasized that \"Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me.\"\n\nWARNING SIGNS FLASH FOR BOTH TRUMP AND BIDEN AHEAD OF FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE\n\nHaley launched her presidential campaign in February of last year, becoming the first major candidate to challenge Trump, who had announced his candidacy three months earlier. Additionally, she was the final rival to Trump, battling the former president in a contentious two-candidate showdown from the New Hampshire primary in late January through Super Tuesday in early March.\n\nHaley announced that she was suspending her White House campaign on March 6, the day after Trump swept 14 of 15 GOP nominating contests on Super Tuesday.\n\nWHAT KIND OF FUTURE DOES HALEY HAVE IN A TRUMP DOMINATED GOP?\n\nHowever, Haley made it clear when she exited the Republican presidential nomination race that she intended to keep speaking out.\n\nAnd to date, Haley has declined to endorse Trump.\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" Haley said as she exited the race two months ago.\n\nDuring her speech on Wednesday, Haley targeted Biden and Republicans in Congress - but didn't mention Trump by name.\n\nInstead, Haley argued that \"a growing number of Democrats and Republicans have forgotten what makes America safe.\"\n\nHaley made her comments as she gave her first address at the Washington, D.C.-based Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank known for focusing on international affairs and national security.\n\nHaley - who during her White House run advocated a muscular U.S. foreign policy to deal with global hot spots such as the war between Russia and Ukraine and the fighting between Israel and Hamas which was often offering a stark contrast with Trump's American First agenda of keeping the nation out of international entanglements - joined the institute a month ago as a senior adviser.\n\n\"A loud part of each party wants us to abandon our allies, appease our enemies, and focus only on the problems we have at home. They believe that if we leave the world alone, the world will leave us alone. They even say ignoring global chaos will somehow make our country more secure,\" Haley charged as she took aim at both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAnd Haley warned that \"this worldview has already put America in great danger -- and the threat is mounting by the day. I have always spoken hard truths. If we don't remember the path to peace, war will come to America, and it will claim countless lives. We have to prevent war. We have to keep Americans safe.\"\n\nHaley trained most of her verbal firepower on the Democratic incumbent in the White House.\n\nPointing to the Biden administration's recent temporary pause of a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel over concerns that the weapons would be used in attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza - where the death toll has topped 35,000 - Haley argued \"I can hardly imagine a more foolish move than Joe Biden withholding weapons from one of our closest allies. And it comes after more and more Democrats have turned on Israel.\"\n\nAnd Haley charged that \"Joe Biden's legacy is already clear. He will go down in history as the Commander in Chief who refused to stop our enemies.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut Haley also fired away at her own party, saying that \"just a few weeks before Biden threw Israel to the wolves, many Republicans in Congress tried to push Ukraine off a cliff. All told, 112 House Republicans voted against military aid to Ukraine.\"\n\nHaley claimed that \"some Republicans lack... clarity when it comes to Ukraine. Russia's dictator has made it perfectly clear that he won't stop at Kyiv. He wants to recreate the Soviet Union, and he's threatened to attack our NATO allies. We are obligated to defend them, and if Russia attacks, American troops will go to war. We must do everything possible to ensure that doesn't happen.\"\n\nDuring a question and answer session following her speech, Haley announced that she would be traveling to Israel in the coming weeks.\n\nHaley also said that after ending her campaign, \"the first thing I did was catch up on my sleep. I quickly got back to running, which I missed during the campaign.\"\n\nAnd she added that she's spent more time with her parents, her children and her husband, who recently returned from a long military deployment overseas.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_steinhauser@foxnews.com", "name": "Paul Steinhauser", "type":

She was asked whether Joe Biden or Trump would do a better job on national security issues.\n\nThe former ambassador to the UN and South Carolina governor ran through a list of priorities when choosing a president, ranging from the need to back allies and hold enemies to account to supporting capitalism and freedom while reducing the national debt.\n\n\"Trump has not been perfect on these policies,\" Haley said. \"I have made that clear many, many times. But Biden has been a catastrophe. So I will be voting for Trump.\"\n\nThe 52-year-old added by way of caveat: \"Having said that, I stand by what I said in my suspension speech. Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me and not assume that they're just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that.\"\n\nHaley joins the US Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, the former attorney general William Barr and Chris Sununu, the New Hampshire governor, in the ranks of onetime Trump foes who will nevertheless support him as the party nominee.\n\nDuring a bruising primary campaign, she said Trump had \"lost any sort of political viability\", showed \"moral weakness\" and is \"thin-skinned and easily distracted\". She argued that America needs to move on from his \"chaos\". Trump fired back and recently dismissed reports that he might consider Haley as his running mate.\n\nHaley's U-turn provoked a swift backlash. Sarah Longwell, a political strategist and publisher of the conservative Bulwark website, tweeted: \"So when Nikki Haley said 'It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him.' She really meant, he can treat me and my voters like garbage and I'll still fall in line and support him.\"\n\nJoe Walsh, an ex-Republican congressman, added: \"This isn't complicated: Nikki Haley believes Trump is unfit. And she believes he should never be back in the White House. But if she said that publicly, her career as a Republican would be over. So, as expected, she decided to not be truthful. To keep her career as a Republican.\"\n\nAlthough she dropped out of the primaries in early March, Haley has continued to draw up to 20% in the contests, a clear warning sign for Trump's campaign. The former president has dismissed the idea of trying to appeal to Haley's voters, where Biden said in Atlanta this weekend: \"Let me say, there's always going to be a place for Haley voters in my campaign.\"\n\nTrump has also been endorsed by former Republican primary opponents including Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur, and the South Carolina senator Tim Scott.\n\nEarlier in the event at the Hudson Institute, attended by several foreign ambassadors, Haley was fiercely critical of far right Republicans who favour \"America first\" isolationism, though she did not mention Trump by name. She praised the House speaker Mike Johnson for pushing aid for Israel and Ukraine through Congress.\n\n\"A growing number of Democrats and Republicans have forgotten what makes America safe,\" she said. \"A loud part of each party wants us to abandon our allies, appease our enemies and focus only on the problems we have at home.\n\n\"They believe if we leave the world alone, the world will leave us alone. They even say ignoring global chaos will somehow make our country more secure. It will not. This worldview has already put America in great danger and the threat is mounting by the day.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Biden's team is quietly organizing a Republicans for Biden group, which will eventually include dedicated staff and focus on the hundreds of thousands of Haley voters in each battleground state, according to people familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nBut Haley made several criticisms of Biden's foreign policy and handling of the U.S.-Mexico border in her speech Wednesday at the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank she recently joined as she reemerges in the political realm.\n\nEarlier this month, Haley huddled in South Carolina with some of her donors, an event characterized as a \"thank you\" to her top supporters and not a discussion about Haley's future political plans or intended to push her backers toward any other candidate.\n\nIf she runs for president again, Haley will likely need to win over former Trump supporters in a Republican primary. But her support for him now risks offending moderates and anti-Trump conservatives.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType":

Nikki Haley of South Carolina speaks at the Hudson Institute in Washington, a conservative think tank, today. In her first public appearance since she dropped her Republican presidential bid in March, Haley, also the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said she would vote for former President Donald Trump, stopping short of an official endorsement.\n\nWASHINGTON >> In her first public appearance since she dropped her Republican presidential bid in March, Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador, said today that she would vote for former President Donald Trump, stopping short of an official endorsement.\n\nSpeaking at the Hudson Institute in Washington, a conservative think tank, Haley delivered a scathing critique of President Joe Biden and Republicans on foreign policy. During her speech, she made no mention of the elephant in the room: Trump.\n\nBut in a fireside chat afterward, the moderator, Peter Rough, asked Haley who she believed would do a better job in the White House. Haley paused before carefully continuing her answer. As a voter, she said, she would put her priorities behind a president who would have the \"backs of our allies and hold our enemies to account,\" secure the nation's borders and curb the national debt.\n\n\"Trump has not been perfect on these policies. I've made that clear many, many times,\" she said. \"But Biden has been a catastrophe. So, I will be voting for Trump.\"\n\nAs Trump's longest-standing rival in the 2024 primary contest, Haley carved out an important lane for herself as the voice for Republican and independent voters looking for an alternative to the former president. While she was included in recent chatter about Trump's possible running mates, he recently all but ruled out the possibility of selecting Haley, who also is a former South Carolina governor.\n\nHer decision on whether to endorse him could play a pivotal role in shaping the presidential contest. Haley, who was named the new Walter P. Stern chair at the Hudson Institute, has built a formidable network of high-dollar donors and has a solid base of younger people, college-educated voters and independents that she has warned Trump he needs to win. But she and the former president grew increasingly bitter at the end of the primary.\n\nIn her chat after the speech, she also said Trump \"would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me and not assume that they're just going to be with him.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign has been working behind the scenes to reach out to high-profile Republicans and target voters. It is also planning to roll out a grassroots group with dedicated staff workers to organize Republican voters in key battlegrounds, according to people with knowledge of the plans.\n\nHaley echoed many of the signature themes from her campaign during her speech. She criticized Biden for his withdrawal from Afghanistan and what she described as his failure to take on China and Iran. She called his recent decision to withhold a shipment of bombs to Israel as \"foolish.\"\n\n\"Withholding them validates the totally false and destructive narrative that Israel is acting unjustly by defending herself,\" she said.\n\nBut she did not do the same to Trump, whom she had described as a dangerous agent of chaos throughout her campaign. Instead, she reserved her choice words for members of her own party, disparaging them for promoting an isolationist approach to Ukraine's war with Russia.\n\n\"Just a few weeks before Biden threw Israel to the wolves, many Republicans in Congress tried to push Ukraine off a cliff,\" she said, praising Speaker Mike Johnson for demonstrating \"moral courage and a clear understanding of the stakes.\"", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Institute",

No more excuses,\" Haley said. \"A president who would support capitalism and freedom. A president who understands we need less debt, not more debt. Trump has not been perfect on these policies. I've made that clear many, many times. But Biden has been a catastrophe.\"\n\n\"So I will be voting for Trump,\" Haley continued. \"Having said that, I stand by what I said in my suspension speech. Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me and not assume that they're just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that.\"\n\nHaley stopped short of giving Trump a full-throated endorsement, something that she had pledged to do when she was competing in the Republican Party primary earlier this year. Many of the other competitors, including Trump's top challenger, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, did give Trump clear endorsements.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hudson Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/05/GettyImages-2051580033-scaled-e1715442674120.jpg?w=1200&h=800&ixlib=react-9.3.0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583760", "eventUri": "eng-9583760", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

But her fierce attacks on his character and competence in the final months of her campaign made Haley the standard bearer for the dwindling anti-Trump wing of the Republican Party.\n\n\"Trump has not been perfect on these policies. I've made that clear many, many times. But Biden has been a catastrophe. So I will be voting for Trump,\" Haley told an audience during a question-and-answer session on Wednesday at the Washington-based Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank.\n\nThe comments followed a speech on foreign policy, and the event marked Haley's first public appearance since dropping out.\n\nWhen she ended her campaign, she did not endorse Trump, and she still has not formally done so.\n\nIn the past, she has called on Trump to reach out to her supporters and earn their votes - comments she repeated on Wednesday.\n\n\"Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me and not assume that they're just going to be with him,\" Haley said.\n\nTrump's campaign has generally dismissed those calls, alleging that Haley's supporters tend to vote for Democrats, even as many are registered Republicans.\n\n(Reporting by Gram Slattery in Washington and Michelle Nichols in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hudson Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/93c255682dc8cb5c7cde0aa9eb32492e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583760", "eventUri": "eng-9583760", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 338, "textEnd": 344}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Maybe. Former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley said this week that she would vote for former U.S. president Donald Trump in 2024 election - although she stopped short of saying her supporters should.\n\nTo be clear: An endorsement isn't just saying you will vote for someone. An endorsement is publicly urging one's supporters to do the same. Haley did not do that. In fact, during a foreign policy address at her \"neoconservative\" think tank in Washington, D.C., she hearkened back to her speech back in March in which she continued to grill Trump.\n\n\"I will be voting for Trump,\" Haley said. \"Having said that, I stand by what I said in my suspension speech.\"\n\nHaley made the announcement during a question-and-answer session follow about Trump's foreign policy views when compared to those of current president Joe Biden.\n\n\"Trump has not been perfect on these policies,\" she said. \"I have made that clear many, many times. But Biden has been a catastrophe. So I will be voting for Trump.\"\n\nRather than rally her supporters to Trump's banner, Haley shifted that onus on her erstwhile rival.\n\n\"Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me,\" she said.\n\nHaley's \"too cute by a half\" move continues to give herself plenty of wiggle room vis-\u00e0-vis her contorted relationship with the former president, whom she unsuccessfully challenged for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.\n\nHaley bowed out of the race back in March after getting crushed by Trump - including a lopsided defeat in her home state of South Carolina. Trump's former ambassador to the United Nations, Haley even got beat by \"none of the above\" in Nevada.\n\nAfter getting shellacked by Trump, Haley refused to endorse him - despite previously pledging to support the eventual GOP nominee.\n\n\"No. I think I'll make what decision I want to make,\" Haley told NBC's Meet The Press shortly after Trump captured the nomination.\n\nHaley's support for Trump's 2024 candidacy was initially offered more than three years ago - although it was subsequently rescinded.\n\nOf interest?

Someone who can pull in additional conservative-to-moderate voters, whom Trump is leaving on the table. So why is this the Haley factor? Because she's already won these votes in the states that will decide 2024.\n\nThe last presidential election was much closer than most realize. The 7 million votes that separated Biden from Trump, were also Biden's combined majorities in California and New York. In the other 48 states, the candidates ran effectively even.\n\nSix of the 25 states won by Biden -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- were decided by less than 312,000 votes in total. Four of those -- Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and Wisconsin -- by less than 77,000 total votes. Flip that relative handful of votes, and the election would have had a different outcome.\n\nGiven that 2020 was so close and that Trump is still a divisive figure -- thus making additional votes harder to come by -- the question is where he can pick up the needed votes. The most logical constituencies are the ones he already dominates: conservatives and Republicans, extending out toward right-leaning independents. Going in the opposite direction, that was the route Biden took in 2020 when he chose Kamala Harris as his vice president.\n\nFor example, Republicans made up 36 percent of voters in 2020, and Trump lost 6 percent of them. If Trump could cut his Republican losses in half, that would be worth about 1.7 million additional votes. That may not seem like much, but it's more than 20 times the combined margins of the four decisive battleground states that Trump lost most narrowly.\n\nHowever, we do not need to rely just on hypotheticals. We have actuals from the pivotal battleground states.\n\nThis year, five of the six battleground states had primaries in which Biden and Trump both appeared on the ballots (Trump did not appear on Nevada's). The results were a mixed bag: in three (Arizona, Georgia and Michigan), Trump's vote total topped Biden's; in four (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin), Republicans' vote total topped Democrats'.\n\nBut what really stands out is the Haley factor. While never a serious threat to Trump and never winning huge totals, she was a consistent vote-getter. Haley's lowest vote percentage in the five states' Republican primaries against Trump was 12.7 percent in Wisconsin. Her highest was 26.6 percent in Michigan.\n\nSmall? Yes. Inconsequential? No.\n\nSo there were enough Haley voters in each of those five states to flip them all to Trump in 2020. Adding in Haley's votes, and Trump would have won Wisconsin by 56,000 votes, Georgia by 66,000 votes, Pennsylvania by 75,000 votes, Arizona by 100,000 votes, and Michigan by 143,000 votes.\n\nBut hasn't Trump made it clear he isn't considering her and hasn't Haley still not endorsed him?\n\nFirst, this is politics, and this race is for the presidency. Second, any animosity between Trump and Haley would have to pale in comparison to that between Biden and Harris. Harris accused Biden of cozying up to racists in a Democratic debate -- certainly, both Joe and Jill Biden were reportedly \"blindsided\" by the attack. And Harris brought far less to the table than Haley would. Recall that Harris had no federal executive experience and never even made it to the 2020 primaries.\n\nSure, the argument could be made that a good portion of those who voted for Haley will still vote for Trump anyway in a general election against Biden. The other side can be argued too, that Haley's supporters will not follow her to Trump no matter what she says.\n\nHowever, 6 percent of Republicans did not support Trump in 2020, and just half of those might be enough for Trump to win. This does not take into account the effect Haley could have on independents, minorities (where current polling shows Trump is already making inroads) and women (a group Trump lost by 11 points in 2020).\n\nThe most easily dismissed threat is that some would desert Trump if he picked someone like Haley. To anyone other than those in the House's fragging faction of bomb-throwers, who have reduced Republicans' majority to impotency, Haley or her equivalent is a conservative.\n\nTo Trump's real supporters, who have given him the party's nomination three consecutive times (a feat last accomplished by Franklin D. Roosevelt for the Democrats) his bona fides are solid. They would give him the benefit of the doubt on almost any running mate in a contest with Biden.\n\nRight now, this looks to be a tight race -- all of Trump's races have been. Every vote will matter and be hard to come by. And Trump has arguably the race's biggest wildcard yet to play: his running mate.\n\nNikki Haley herself may not be that card, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Gov. Doug Burgum (R-N.D.) and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (R-Hawaii) are also frequently mentioned.\n\nBut the role Haley played -- and more importantly, the votes she won in the primaries -- is just what Trump needs to ensure victory.\n\nCall it the Haley factor -- it could be the difference between 2016 and 2020 for Trump.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "j_t_young@thehill.com", "name": "J.T.

I've made that clear many, many times,\" Haley said. \"But Biden has been a catastrophe. So I will be voting for Trump\".\n\nHaley's backing comes despite Trump's vitriolic and humiliating attacks on her throughout the campaign, including his use of \"Birdbrain\" as a derogatory nickname.\n\nHaley's announcement -- made during an appearance at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think-tank in Washington -- could help Trump heal some of the divisions within the Republican party ahead of the nominating convention in Wisconsin in July.\n\nEven after Haley dropped out of the race in March, she continued to win significant chunks of the Republican vote in primary contests from moderate centre-right voters who were rejecting Trump's bid for a second term.\n\nNonetheless, Haley cast her decision as halfhearted support for Trump -- and more a reflection of her distaste for Biden, the incumbent Democrat.\n\nHaley's policy differences with Trump spanned a range of domestic and international issues in which she represented a more traditional brand of domestic conservatism and hawkishness on foreign affairs compared with her rival's populism.\n\nDuring the heat of the primary contests in January and February, Haley, a former US ambassador to the UN, mainly attacked Trump for fuelling \"chaos\" and for what she described as declining mental fitness.\n\nOn Wednesday, Haley said Trump should not take the backing of her voters for granted.\n\n\"Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me, and not assume that they're just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that,\" Haley said.\n\nTrump recently ruled out tapping Haley to be his vice-presidential candidate, though her declaration may help generate some goodwill for her among the Republican base and position her for a new run for the White House in 2028.\n\nHaley's announcement may raise questions about whether Biden has done enough to earn the backing of moderate Republicans who do not want to see another Trump presidency.\n\nMichael Tyler, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign, said Haley's move did not change anything for \"millions of Republican voters\" who rejected Trump in the primary race.\n\nThey \"care deeply about the future of our democracy, standing strong with our allies against foreign adversaries, and working across the aisle to get things done for the American people -- while also rejecting the chaos, division and violence that Donald Trump embodies\", Tyler said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial

Maybe she will.\"\n\nHaley dropped out of the primary contest the following day, after the Super Tuesday results showed Trump's commanding position in the race. Yet Haley's name remains on Republican ballots across the country, garnering the support of voters disaffected with Trump -- a full 76,000 votes in Wisconsin, for instance, and another 158,000 votes in Pennsylvania -- stoking speculation that Trump's hopes in 2024 could suffer, in a close election, from an inability to bring those voters back to his side.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"I suspended, truly, with gratitude,\" she said. \"We just had amazing people [on the campaign team] who really love America.

But there are some conspicuous exceptions, such as former 2024 primary rivals Mike Pence, Chris Christie, and Nikki Haley. The first two dropped out before voters voted in circumstances that would make crawling back to Trump intensely humiliating, if not impossible. Haley's situation is more interesting: She was the last Trump opponent standing and is still getting a small but non-negligible number of votes in GOP presidential primaries despite not actively campaigning.\n\nNow, there's a significant amount of speculation about whether the former South Carolina governor will eventually bend the knee to Trump, as the Associated Press observes:\n\nNikki Haley is perhaps the highest-profile Republican in the nation who has refused to fall in line and endorse Donald Trump's presidential bid ...\n\nIf Haley submits to Trump, as so many of his GOP critics have done, she also risks destroying her own coalition of independents, moderates and anti-Trump Republicans, who are still showing up to support her in low-profile primary contests from deep-red Indiana to deep-blue Maryland ...\n\nHaley's decision on Trump in the coming months will be closely watched not just by her supporters, but by allies of Trump and President Joe Biden. What she decides to do -- and whether her coalition follows -- could have a profound impact on this year's general election and her future as a top-tier Republican whose brand appeals to many people outside her party.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the size and shape of Haley's \"coalition\" are a bit hazy, though in the primaries the group definitely included non-Republicans who were voting against Trump rather than for the only other candidate on the ballot. More to the point, if Haley wants the credit or blame for keeping Trump from becoming the 47th president, the obvious thing for her to do is to endorse Biden rather than simply standing aside.\n\nThe odds are very high, however, that she'll come around and endorse Trump for the third consecutive time. She has a long history of dissing Trump when he's down and leaping back on his bandwagon when he's up, most notably in 2016, when she accepted an early appointment as his ambassador to the United Nations after tepidly endorsing his general-election candidacy, and in 2021, when she confidently tossed him into the dustbin of history after the events of January 6 before temporarily rejoining the MAGA ranks.\n\nThere's a more recent precedent for Haley as well: that moment in the first Republican presidential debate in August 2023, when she was one of six candidates who raised their hands, indicating they'd honor a pledge to support Trump as the nominee even if he's convicted of a crime. Upon suspending her own campaign in March, Haley explained her failure to endorse him on the spot as reflecting her desire to see if he would show her supporters they had a place in the GOP. Although Trump hasn't been eager to make any uncharacteristically gracious gestures, she set a pretty low threshold for him to meet, and it's hard to imagine he wouldn't welcome her back into his good graces in exchange for an endorsement. After all, he's still considering Marco Rubio as a running mate, and Little Marco once publicly suggested the infamous playboy was underendowed.\n\nWhy would Haley want to relent and endorse Trump? Because it's pretty clear she still imagines a national political career for herself (she is, after all, only 52), and you don't get one of those if you don't back your party's presidential nominee.\n\nThat's been true for a very long time -- probably since 1916, when Republicans invited supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's Bull Moose candidacy back into the party fold. Trump isn't the first presidential nominee to horrify many of his fellow partisans. Barry Goldwater's nomination in 1964 shocked conventional Republicans to their core, particularly after he voted against the Civil Rights Act. Yet his great liberal Republican opponent, Nelson Rockefeller, the object of vivid demonstrations of hatred by Goldwater delegates at that year's Republican Convention, eventually campaigned with the Arizonan despite the certainty that he would be beaten like a drum in the general election. Similarly in 1972, doomed Democratic nominee George McGovern, considered so dangerous a radical that the AFL-CIO refused to endorse him against Richard Nixon, was backed by all his former rivals and pretty much every Democratic pol with a pulse.\n\nAnd lest we forget, in 2016 Trump himself was a far more controversial candidate in terms of Republican orthodoxy than he is today and was widely, almost universally, expected to lose handily to Hillary Clinton, particularly after the Access Hollywood tape leaked, making the man's profane piggishness abundantly clear. Yet the party's potentates eventually lined up behind him. The exceptions were mostly has-beens like the two Presidents Bush and the other would-be President Bush (Jeb!) along with lots of their over-the-hill advisers and appointees.\n\nEight years into the Trump era, the shock over his nasty personal traits and his ideological heresies has worn off, and nobody doubts he can win. So if Haley withholds her endorsement of Trump, she will be very much alone. Had she wanted to leave the Republican Party, she had an expedient way to do so by accepting the pleas of the No Labels organization to accept its nomination, which would have given her robust ballot access, some generous new donors, and probably an impressive initial showing in general-election polls. But she said \"no,\" touting history as a Republican and as a conservative and expressing horror at the idea of having to snuggle with a Democratic running mate.\n\nIt's possible that Haley is so certain Trump will eventually be held in contempt by Republicans, and so confident that her brand of old-school, pre-Trump conservatism is the wave of the future, that she will take the supreme risk of refusing to endorse him. More likely, she will once again reconsider the negative things she has said about the 45th president, call him infinitely better than Joe Biden, and go along with the crowd.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_kilgore@nymag.com", "name": "Ed Kilgore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Christie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Christie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Goldwater", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barry Goldwater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Rockefeller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nelson Rockefeller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL\u2013CIO", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFL\u2013CIO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_McGovern", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George McGovern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

About 35,000 Palestinians have died as a result of the Israeli invasion, according to health authorities there.

She makes me want to literally vomit. I'm not sure I can do another Nikki Haley news cycle....\n\nBut we might not have a choice if these reports are accurate.\n\nBuckle up.\n\nOther reports are claiming a potential Haley-Bolton ticket, which makes perfect sense. Just call it the RINO Warmonger Ticket, and other than exhuming John McCain from the cold, dead ground, you couldn't get two better candidates!\n\nDon't forget this interview on MSNPC, where Nikki Haley was asked about the RNC Pledge she signed to support the eventual nominee....\n\nEven MSNBC seemed taken aback by her brazenness to say she just lied about that at the time to get on the debate stage and has no intention to honor it:\n\nBut if we're going to be forced to talk about Nikki Haley again, then I guess we'd better also relive some of these greatest hits:\n\nREVEALED: Nikki Haley's Real Name\n\nMany of you may know this already....\n\nMany probably don't....\n\nBut since I don't expect we'll be covering Nikki Haley much after today, I thought it was a good time to hit it one more time.\n\nDo you know Nikki Haley's real name?\n\nNimrod.\n\nWell, close to it.\n\n\"Nimarata\" -- the female, Indian version of Nimrod is what it sounds like.\n\nCan't fault her for this one, I'd change my name too if that was my name!\n\nVivek has trolled her for his before....\n\nNimarata Randhawa is Nikki Haley's birth name but since childhood, she has been called by close friends and family Nikki.\n\nHere's what Fox News shared:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Nikki Haley is hitting back at GOP nomination rival Vivek Ramaswamy, who called her \"lying Namrata (sic),\" referencing her given Indian name and originally misspelling it on the website.\n\nOn a new page on the newcomer's campaign website called \"TRUTH. Over myth,\" Ramaswamy, a multi-millionaire biotech entrepreneur, author, and culture wars crusader, attempts to set the record straight on Haley's recent jabs at his foreign policy positions.\n\nOne such criticism is Ramaswamy's position on U.S. support to Israel, an accusation leveled by Haley last week during the first GOP presidential nomination debate - and reiterated on Monday at Haley's town hall in Indian Land, South Carolina.\n\n\"WRONG. Keep lying, Namrata (sic) Randhawa. The desperation is showing,\" Ramaswamy's website read earlier today. It has since been updated with the correct spelling for Haley's birth name.\n\n\"Nimarata Randhawa\" appears to be a reference to Haley's birth name of Indian origin, but it leaves out \"Nikki,\" which is her legal middle name that she goes by.\n\nPer Times of India:\n\nIndian-origin Republican candidate Nikki Haley has lashed out at her GOP rival Vivek Ramaswamy after the entrepreneur's \"childish\" reference to her Indian birth name on his website.\n\nThe two Indian-origin candidates, who are vying for a Republican nomination for the 2024 US Presidential polls, have been taking potshots at each other over the last few weeks with the GOP race getting intense.\n\nHaley has called out Ramaswamy for his \"lack of foreign policy experience\" and has been targeting him over his position on America's ties with Israel.\n\nDuring the GOP debate last week, the former South Carolina governor said that Ramaswamy wants US to stop funding Israel. Haley repeated her charge at Monday's town hall.\n\nHitting back, Ramaswamy's campaign website referred to Haley by her birth name and said that her \"desperation is showing\".\n\n\"WRONG. Keep lying, Namrata (sic) Randhawa. The desperation is showing,\" Ramaswamy's website read earlier with an incorrect spelling of her birth name. The spelling was later rectified.\n\nNimarata Randhawa is Nikki Haley's birth name\n\nHere's what led to Vivek calling out Nikki on his campaign site:\n\nBut not only did Nikki Haley change her OWN name, she also changed her husband's name!\n\nDid you know?\n\nNot his last name....his first name!\n\nThe gall of this Warmongering Lady!\n\nNikki Haley Made Her Husband Change His First Name...Because She Didn't Like It!\n\nJust when you think you've heard it all....\n\nAnd just when you think you couldn't possibly loathe Nikki Haley any more than I already do, you get something new like this.\n\nActually, it isn't \"new\" but it may be \"new to you\".\n\nIt was new to me.\n\nProbably because this comes from Nikki's 2012 book, and just as I don't care about her now, I didn't care about her back then either.\n\nBut major credit to Anons for digging and putting this gem back in the spotlight.\n\nHaley admits, even gleefully recounts, how she started calling her husband by \"Michael\" simply because she didn't like his given name \"Bill\" and she thought he looked more like a Michael.\n\nUnreal.\n\nI love the summary Alex puts on this:\n\nFrom Fox News, here are more details on the story from the book:\n\nNearly 12 years ago, now-Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley wrote about how she renamed her husband, which resurfaced amid the Republican primary.\n\nA senior politics correspondent for Vox took to social media on Wednesday and posted an excerpt from her 2012 book \"Can't Is Not an Option\" in which Haley recounted how she modified how people refer to her now-husband, Michael Haley.\n\n\"You may be wondering how 'Bill' became South Carolina First Gentleman Michael Haley,\" Haley wrote in her book. \"After we started dating, I looked at him one day and said, 'What's your name?'\"\n\n\"'You know it's Bill,' he said, puzzled.\"\n\n\"'You just don't look like a Bill. What's your whole name?'\"\n\n\"'William Michael.'\"\n\n\"From that point on, I started calling him Michael, and all my friends did the same. When he transferred to Clemson his sophomore year, my friends became his friends, and before we knew it, he was universally known as Michael. Everyone who knew him before I did knows him as Bill, and everyone who met him after I did knows him as Michael.\"\n\n\"He looks like a Michael,\" she wrote.\n\nThe responses on Twitter are HILARIOUS....\n\nSugarLuvsU4sho points out that the woman who once famously said it should be a law that everyone on social media use their real names is the same person who does not call her husband by his real name:\n\nOh the irony!\n\nNikki Haley -- EXPOSED\n\nI don't think she has a snowball's chance in hell of winning the primary, but nevertheless I want to make sure we take those odds all the way down to zero.\n\nBecause we do not need the war-mongering NEO-con RINO anywhere near our Government.\n\nSo now I give you Nikki Haley exposed....in her own words.\n\nHere is a wonderful montage of 3 minutes of Nikki Haley telling you EXACTLY who she is.\n\nAnd it ain't someone I want as President or anywhere in Government for that matter.\n\nNO MORE RINOS.\n\nNo Nikki Haley.\n\nWatch for yourself:", "source": {"uri": "en-volve.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "enVolve"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_m_smith@en-volve.com", "name": "A.M.

And although I will no longer be a candidate, I will not stop using my voice.\"\n\nTrump later criticized Nikki Haley for her refusal to endorse him.\n\n\"Much of her money came from Radical Left Democrats, as did many of her voters, almost 50%, according to the polls,\" Trump said.\n\n\"At this point, I hope she stays in the 'race' and fights it out until the end! I'd like to thank my family, friends, and the Great Republican Party for helping me to produce, by far, the most successful Super Tuesday in HISTORY, and would further like to invite all of the Haley supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our Nation,\" he added.\n\nWATCH -- Leftist Media: Nikki Haley Staying in GOP Race Helps Biden Against Trump", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_bois@breitbart.com", "name": "Paul Bois", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Tuesday", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Tuesday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/05/Nikki-Haley.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583760", "eventUri": "eng-9583760", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 485, "textEnd": 491}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

However, some moderate Republicans still refuse to vote for Trump. Instead, they are casting their ballots for other candidates like Haley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador who ended her campaign in March.\n\nHaley has garnered thousands of votes, even after she dropped out of the race after losing every state but Vermont. Some Republicans have continued to voice their support for Haley after claiming they will never vote for Trump.\n\nOn Tuesday, 14 percent of Kentucky Republicans voted voted for a candidate other than Trump, with most of those votes going to Haley. Haley garnered 6.4 percent of the vote, followed by \"uncommitted\" at 3.5 percent.\n\nRon DeSantis -- who dropped out of the presidential race in January -- also garnered some votes, with 3.1 percent of Kentucky Republicans casting their ballot for the Florida governor. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie got 1 percent, Vivek Ramaswamy had 0.6% and Ryan Binkley had 0.4%.\n\nTrump has lost thousands of Republican votes in a slew of other primaries, including in Wisconsin (where Haley received 12.8 percent of the vote), Connecticut (14 percent), Rhode Island (10.6 percent), Indiana (21.7 percent) and Georgia (13 percent).\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's campaign by email for comment.\n\nDespite the votes for other candidates, Tuesday's outcome is similar to Trump's 2020 primary performance in Kentucky, in which he was the only Republican on the ballot and received 86 percent of the vote. In 2016, when several other Republicans were on the ballot, including Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and Christie, Trump still won with nearly 36 percent of the votes.\n\nTrump won the 2020 presidential election in Kentucky with 62.1 percent of the vote. At that time, support for the former president had fallen only slightly from his performance in 2016, when he received 62.5 percent.\n\nIt is unclear if support for Haley and other former Republican candidates will translate to additional votes for President Joe Biden in November, when Trump and Biden are posed to face off for the second time.\n\nScott Lucas, a professor in International Politics at University College Dublin, previously told Newsweek that the Republican Party is divided and Haley and her supporters may not switch their allegiance to Trump.\n\n\"Nikki Haley stayed in the race not because she thought she could win it, but she stayed in it for Super Tuesday because a lot of people behind her, a lot of Republican members, a lot of Republican donors are very unsettled about Donald Trump,\" Lucas said.\n\n\"They're very unsettled about his legal problems, they're very unsettled because he's unpredictable, they're very unsettled because of the damage that he can cause on domestic issues and on foreign policy.\"\n\nHowever, Michael J. Hanmer, director of the Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement at the University of Maryland, said that although he was \"surprised\" to see Haley get so much support in the state's GOP primary on May 14, he doubts those voters will cast a ballot for Biden in the general election.\n\n\"I suspect it will be hard for many Republicans who won't vote for Trump to vote for Biden, but they might sit out the election or skip the presidential race,\" he previously told Newsweek. \"The Trump campaign seems very focused on appealing to their base rather than growing it.\"", "source": {"uri":

One exception: Nikki Haley is nowhere to be found. No sooner did Axios report that Haley was being considered than Trump issued a personal statement this weekend that she's out of the running. Trump at least said he wishes her well, but rejecting her doesn't solve his main campaign problem of appealing to Haley voters.\n\nVice presidents are rarely decisive in presidential elections, but they can matter for governing and the country's future. This year the VP choice may matter more than usual on all of those counts. If Trump wins he'd be an immediate lame duck who can serve only one term. He turns 78 in June, and he'd be the second-oldest president after the current one.\n\nMike Pence was an excellent choice in 2016 as an experienced, steady hand who also reassured social conservatives. He helped to populate the first Trump administration with talented policy experts. On Jan. 6, he stood up to Trump's bullying and put the Constitution ahead of his own ambition.\n\nTrump needs a comparably reassuring choice this year to win over the suburban, college-educated and women voters who cost him re-election in 2020. They're still giving Haley upwards of 20% in the GOP primaries, though she long ago ended her campaign.\n\nHaley ought to be in the VP mix given her strong primary performance. She outlasted everyone but Trump and did well in debates. She has foreign-policy experience and was a two-term governor of South Carolina. She'd provide a notable contrast in competence and charisma to Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that Trump can't accept someone with strong views of her own, which would rule out Haley. That's probably the safest bet, and Haley hasn't endorsed him. But choosing a strong woman would be surprising enough that it might cause skeptical swing voters to take another look at the former president. The MAGA diehards would howl, but they aren't going to stay home or vote for President Joe Biden.\n\nThis assumes Haley would accept the VP offer, which carries more risk for her than for Trump. A second Trump term is likely to be as chaotic and divisive as the first, with Democrats implacably opposed to everything. Second terms are rarely a success, and the VP would go down with the ship. Then again, few people turn down the chance to be so close to power.\n\nWho else could unite the party by reassuring Haley voters? A strong and logical choice would be Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has shown he can win and govern in a swing state. He's smart, likable and a conservative who is impossible for the left to portray as crazy. He'd signal that Trump realizes he can't win with MAGA alone. The Trump campaign is boasting that it will target Virginia this year, and if that's more than spin Youngkin can help.\n\nOf those at Trump's recent VP pageant at Mar-a-Lago, few stand out. One who does is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who would be an adult in White House councils. He was a success as an entrepreneur and understands markets and global economic competition. He's not flashy, but Trump needs mature.\n\nAnother outside-the-Beltway choice would be Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has cut taxes and taken political risks to pass universal school choice in Iowa. She hasn't withstood the rigors of national scrutiny, which is always a risk, especially on foreign policy. And Trump may not forgive her for endorsing Ron DeSantis in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe biggest question is whether Trump wants his VP choice to expand his coalition or be a MAGA echo. Most of those on the stage behind him at Mar-a-Lago wouldn't appeal to the Haley voter. Tulsi Gabbard has been courting Trump, but the former Democrat's isolationism should be a deal-breaker. She denounced Trump's first-term assassination of Iranian killer Qasem Soleimani.\n\nRepublicans are increasingly confident they can win this year, but the presidential race is still in the margin of error. Trump's choice as VP is an opportunity to showcase a contrast to Harris, who could become resident if Biden wins.

She makes me want to literally vomit. I'm not sure I can do another Nikki Haley news cycle....\n\nBut we might not have a choice if these reports are accurate.\n\nBuckle up.\n\nOther reports are claiming a potential Haley-Bolton ticket, which makes perfect sense. Just call it the RINO Warmonger Ticket, and other than exhuming John McCain from the cold, dead ground, you couldn't get two better candidates!\n\nDon't forget this interview on MSNPC, where Nikki Haley was asked about the RNC Pledge she signed to support the eventual nominee....\n\nEven MSNBC seemed taken aback by her brazenness to say she just lied about that at the time to get on the debate stage and has no intention to honor it:\n\nBut if we're going to be forced to talk about Nikki Haley again, then I guess we'd better also relive some of these greatest hits:\n\nBut since I don't expect we'll be covering Nikki Haley much after today, I thought it was a good time to hit it one more time.\n\n\"Nimarata\" -- the female, Indian version of Nimrod is what it sounds like.\n\nCan't fault her for this one, I'd change my name too if that was my name!\n\nVivek has trolled her for his before....\n\nNimarata Randhawa is Nikki Haley's birth name but since childhood, she has been called by close friends and family Nikki.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Nikki Haley is hitting back at GOP nomination rival Vivek Ramaswamy, who called her \"lying Namrata (sic),\" referencing her given Indian name and originally misspelling it on the website.\n\nOn a new page on the newcomer's campaign website called \"TRUTH. Over myth,\" Ramaswamy, a multi-millionaire biotech entrepreneur, author, and culture wars crusader, attempts to set the record straight on Haley's recent jabs at his foreign policy positions.\n\nOne such criticism is Ramaswamy's position on U.S. support to Israel, an accusation leveled by Haley last week during the first GOP presidential nomination debate - and reiterated on Monday at Haley's town hall in Indian Land, South Carolina.\n\n\"WRONG. Keep lying, Namrata (sic) Randhawa. The desperation is showing,\" Ramaswamy's website read earlier today. It has since been updated with the correct spelling for Haley's birth name.\n\n\"Nimarata Randhawa\" appears to be a reference to Haley's birth name of Indian origin, but it leaves out \"Nikki,\" which is her legal middle name that she goes by.\n\nIndian-origin Republican candidate Nikki Haley has lashed out at her GOP rival Vivek Ramaswamy after the entrepreneur's \"childish\" reference to her Indian birth name on his website.\n\nThe two Indian-origin candidates, who are vying for a Republican nomination for the 2024 US Presidential polls, have been taking potshots at each other over the last few weeks with the GOP race getting intense.\n\nHaley has called out Ramaswamy for his \"lack of foreign policy experience\" and has been targeting him over his position on America's ties with Israel.\n\nDuring the GOP debate last week, the former South Carolina governor said that Ramaswamy wants US to stop funding Israel. Haley repeated her charge at Monday's town hall.\n\nHitting back, Ramaswamy's campaign website referred to Haley by her birth name and said that her \"desperation is showing\".\n\n\"WRONG. Keep lying, Namrata (sic) Randhawa. The desperation is showing,\" Ramaswamy's website read earlier with an incorrect spelling of her birth name. The spelling was later rectified.\n\nNimarata Randhawa is Nikki Haley's birth name\n\nHere's what led to Vivek calling out Nikki on his campaign site:\n\nBut not only did Nikki Haley change her OWN name, she also changed her husband's name!\n\nAnd just when you think you couldn't possibly loathe Nikki Haley any more than I already do, you get something new like this.\n\nProbably because this comes from Nikki's 2012 book, and just as I don't care about her now, I didn't care about her back then either.\n\nBut major credit to Anons for digging and putting this gem back in the spotlight.\n\nHaley admits, even gleefully recounts, how she started calling her husband by \"Michael\" simply because she didn't like his given name \"Bill\" and she thought he looked more like a Michael.\n\nNearly 12 years ago, now-Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley wrote about how she renamed her husband, which resurfaced amid the Republican primary.\n\nA senior politics correspondent for Vox took to social media on Wednesday and posted an excerpt from her 2012 book \"Can't Is Not an Option\" in which Haley recounted how she modified how people refer to her now-husband, Michael Haley.\n\n\"You may be wondering how 'Bill' became South Carolina First Gentleman Michael Haley,\" Haley wrote in her book. \"After we started dating, I looked at him one day and said, 'What's your name?'\"\n\n\"'You know it's Bill,' he said, puzzled.\"\n\n\"'You just don't look like a Bill. What's your whole name?'\"\n\n\"'William Michael.'\"\n\n\"From that point on, I started calling him Michael, and all my friends did the same. When he transferred to Clemson his sophomore year, my friends became his friends, and before we knew it, he was universally known as Michael. Everyone who knew him before I did knows him as Bill, and everyone who met him after I did knows him as Michael.\"\n\n\"He looks like a Michael,\" she wrote.\n\nThe responses on Twitter are HILARIOUS....\n\nSugarLuvsU4sho points out that the woman who once famously said it should be a law that everyone on social media use their real names is the same person who does not call her husband by his real name:\n\nI don't think she has a snowball's chance in hell of winning the primary, but nevertheless I want to make sure we take those odds all the way down to zero.\n\nBecause we do not need the war-mongering NEO-con RINO anywhere near our Government.\n\nSo now I give you Nikki Haley exposed....in her own words.\n\nHere is a wonderful montage of 3 minutes of Nikki Haley telling you EXACTLY who she is.\n\nAnd it ain't someone I want as President or anywhere in Government for that matter.", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100 Percent Fed

However, with her campaign over, she is following in the footsteps of so many former Republican challengers to Trump by backing her former tormentor.\n\nMSNBC's Nicolle Wallace broke the news to viewers on Deadline: White House, where NBC News Correspondent Vaughn Hillyard reviewed some of the history between Haley and Trump:\n\nHILLYARD: Nikki Haley, in 2015, said, \"Donald Trump is everything I taught my children not to do in kindergarten. I told my little ones, you don't lie and make things up.\"\n\nShe ended up serving in his administration.\n\nWALLACE: Who are these people?!\n\nHILLYARD: On, January 6th, she called it \"an ugly day.\" She then went and said - a couple months later that she wouldn't run against him for president. She ended up running for president. And then we saw Nikki Haley - while her husband was deployed to Africa with U.S. armed services - mocked by Donald Trump for being away. And it was the words of Nikki Haley that were very explicit about Donald Trump. [She] said in part that, \"They were disgusting, awful and unhinged,\" and said that \"somebody that makes comments like that doesn't deserve to be commander-in-chief.\" Her own husband got on social media and fired back and said, \"The difference between humans and animals - animals would never allow the dumbest ones to lead the pack.\"\n\nHis allies pushed extramarital fair rumors about her. This is somebody who suggested that she may not even be eligible to run for president because her parents are immigrants. And today, her announcing she's going to vote for Donald Trump is just, I think, another chapter in something that we've already lived out with the likes of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio eight years ago. She did raise her hand in that Republican debate and said that she would vote for a convicted felon if Donald Trump was found guilty. And today, as evidence that she's sticking to her word.\n\nWALLACE: We need shrinks and cult experts to explain this because what you're reporting doesn't make a lick of sense to me, and it's so recent. I mean, J.D. Vance, in 2015, said something similar. But for her and her husband to both have been feuding publicly with him just days and weeks before endorsing him is inexplicable to me at a human level.\n\nHILLYARD: I think it's power. And I think in American politics, access to power and a party that you identify with is a future. And I think that we have a great share of individuals that have proved this time and again, that staying closely associated to Donald Trump is a guarantee that you are relevant within politics if you choose to remain in politics.\n\nWALLACE: It's unbelievable. Unbelievable.\n\nTrump is slated for a November rematch with President Joe Biden.

We don't want to overstate the erstwhile UN ambassador's showing. She has, though, drawn some 20 percent of the votes cast so far -- including 16.5 percent in Pennsylvania and 17.8 percent in Arizona, two swing states that voted after she left the race. Are these results best seen as a worry for President Trump -- or an opportunity?\n\nThis is no small thing. In an election that will come down to \"swing-state contests that could be decided by razor-thin margins,\" the Wall Street Journal reports, Mrs. Haley's persistent base of support in the GOP could be decisive. It is prompting renewed speculation about whether she will endorse Mr. Trump -- and even whether, contrary to his protestations, she might emerge as his running mate. Mrs. Haley hasn't signaled she'd back Mr. Trump.\n\nWhen Mrs. Haley suspended her campaign, though, she did urge Mr. Trump \"to earn the votes\" of those in the party who'd backed her candidacy. \"Politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away,\" she said then. Yet just weeks ago, Mr. Trump's campaign put out a digital ad featuring personal attacks on Mrs. Haley, including his obnoxious nickname for her -- \"birdbrain\" -- and his claims that \"she's not presidential timber.\"\n\nDespite claims by some critics that Mrs. Haley is racking up votes from Democrats meddling in the Republican nomination process or seeking to undermine Mr. Trump's march to the nomination, in two closed primary states -- Maryland and Nebraska -- she earned 22 percent and 18 percent of the vote, respectively. The primary vote today in the Bluegrass State's GOP primary could provide further evidence of this trend.\n\nFar be it from us to lecture Mr. Trump on how to win a presidency, but it's hard, from our perch, to see how his Haley strategy is going to help him in a close race. It could even create an opening for President Biden. \"Donald Trump made it clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley's supporters,\" Mr. Biden says. \"I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign.\" That strikes us as exceptionally unconvincing.\n\nMrs. Haley's causes, after all, include fiscal responsibility and a robust American foreign policy. Mr. Biden hardly beckons. Yet a report today in Bloomberg Businessweek underscores why the more moderate voters who are a natural constituency for Mrs. Haley could be wary of backing Mr. Trump. Many of such voters, the report reckons, fear that \"if Trump returns to the White House,\" he'd \"refuse to step down when his term is up.\"\n\nThe concern is \"showing up in our focus groups,\" says Republican strategist Sarah Longwell. \"Trump's own provocations,\" Bloomberg reports, \"appear to be driving the fear of a permanent presidency.\" The \"obvious example\" is the Capitol riot on January 6, Bloomberg says. Pollsters \"are probing to see how widely this sentiment has spread,\" Bloomberg adds, especially among \"undecided voters likely to sway the election.\"\n\nThe concern for the GOP, Bloomberg bruits, is that these worries are \"pushing some undecided voters toward Biden.\" That, Bloomberg explains, is despite the \"significant reservations about the incumbent's age, turmoil in the Middle East and high inflation.\" More broadly, the abiding support for Mrs. Haley in the GOP suggests the upside of her keeping her options open in the weeks and months leading up to the election.\n\nAfter all, Mrs. Haley's observation that \"our conservative cause badly needs more people\" rings as true as ever. While a Haley-Biden matchup is no longer being surveyed, her lead in polls against the incumbent often exceeded Mr. Trump's. That is at least up until early March, when her campaign ended. While Mr. Trump's nomination currently has the air of inevitability, the logic is for Mrs. Haley to keep her non-campaign-campaign active.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Nikki Haley or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, struggled to keep pace.\n\nThe presidential race in the primary election has already been called, but votes continue to trickle in, with the estimated percentage of those being tallied hovering around 30%.\n\nKentucky primary election results: Trump, Biden tapped victors\n\nWith about 34% of the votes totaled, Trump pulled 85.2% of reported votes for Kentucky's primary election this year.

Despite already conceding, Haley landed in second place by pulling 6.2% of Kentucky votes as of Tuesday at 7:40 p.m.\n\nHaley pulled more than 21% of the primary votes in neighboring state Indiana earlier this month.\n\nHaley faced sharp criticism by local politicians, such as U.S. Sen. Rand Paul. In January, Paul had some positive remarks about most of the Republican presidential candidates while publicly lobbying against Haley.\n\n\"I don't think any informed or knowledgeable libertarian or conservative should support Nikki Haley,\" Paul said in a social media post shared on X, urging people to register at nevernikki.net.\n\nIn the Democratic primary, Biden only faced off against one candidate who had yet to concede -- Marianne Williamson.\n\nWilliamson suspended her campaign in February after losing the Nevada primary, but relaunched her campaign three weeks later with an announcement on X, formerly known as Twitter. She has pulled 6% of the statewide primary votes.\n\nMany Kentucky voters 'uncommitted' in 2024 presidential primary\n\nWhile the candidate pool is so narrowed for both the Republican and Democratic nomination, some voters were labeled as \"uncommitted\" to a particular presidential candidate in the race.\n\nWith 28% of the votes in for the Democratic primary, 17.8% of voters elected to be \"uncommitted,\" which was the second most popular option chosen compared to Biden's over 70% victory.\n\nIn the Republican primary, which had 34% estimated votes in, the \"uncommitted option\" was third in the race at 3.4%.\n\nTrump, Biden win handedly in Jefferson County\n\nIn Jefferson County, with about 24% of estimated votes tallied, Biden pulled 85%.

Trump.\n\nNikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador, on Wednesday made her first public appearance since she dropped her Republican presidential bid in March, delivering a scathing critique of President Biden and Republicans on foreign policy. But she made no mention of the elephant in the room: former President Donald J. Trump.\n\nEchoing many of the signature themes from her campaign during a speech at the Hudson Institute in Washington, a conservative think tank, Ms. Haley argued that \"a growing number of Democrats and Republicans have forgotten what makes America safe.\"\n\n\"A loud part of each party wants us to abandon our allies, appease our enemies and focus only on the problems we have at home,\" she added. \"And while we dither, our enemies will expand at our expense.\"\n\nAs Mr. Trump's longest-standing rival in the 2024 primary contest, Ms. Haley carved out an important lane for herself as the voice for Republican and independent voters looking for an alternative to the former president. While she was included in recent chatter about Mr. Trump's possible running mates, he recently all but ruled out the possibility of selecting Ms. Haley, who also is a former South Carolina governor.\n\nHer decision on whether to endorse him could play a pivotal role in shaping the presidential contest. Ms. Haley, who was named the new Walter P. Stern chairwoman at the Hudson Institute, has built a formidable network of high-dollar donors and has a solid base of younger people, college-educated voters and independents that she has warned Mr. Trump he needs to win. But she and the former president grew increasingly bitter at the end of the primary.\n\nIn her speech, she criticized Mr. Biden for his withdrawal from Afghanistan and what she described as his failure to take on China and Iran. She called his recent decision to withhold a shipment of bombs to Israel as \"foolish.\"\n\n\"Withholding them validates the totally false and destructive narrative that Israel is acting unjustly by defending herself,\" she said.\n\nBut she did not do the same to Mr. Trump, whom she had described as a dangerous agent of chaos throughout her campaign. Instead, she reserved her choice words for members of her own party, disaparaging them for promoting an isolationist approach to Ukraine's war with Russia.\n\n\"Just a few weeks before Biden threw Israel to the wolves, many Republicans in Congress tried to push Ukraine off a cliff,\" she said, praising Speaker Mike Johnson for demonstrating \"moral courage and a clear understanding of the stakes.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hudson Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isolationism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/22/multimedia/22pol-swiper-haley-cqhl/22pol-swiper-haley-cqhl-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583760", "eventUri": "eng-9583760", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

But if you're a potential Republican candidate thinking about the future, these days you might be more focused on how not to lose.\n\nThat's especially the case for those who might want to run for president in 2028. And the most critical decision they face is how they handle the party's presumptive nominee this year.\n\nWhile it may seem premature to consider 2028, it's clear that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu are already strategizing. Their unique approaches to former President Donald Trump -- all based on the assumption that they will need the Trump base to win the primary -- highlight the delicacy of the situation.\n\nSo far, none of these politicians has stood with Trump to give a full-throated endorsement or shown up at his trial to stand by him.\n\nDeSantis made a quick exit to Florida just before the New Hampshire primary, announcing he was dropping out and endorsing Trump. However, he recently signaled to his donors that he would be fundraising for the former president.\n\nOne of the least inspiring endorsements came from Sununu last month during an interview, which my colleague Charlie Sykes aptly described as \"painful and humiliating.\"\n\nThen there is Haley, who stayed in the primary the longest and, despite dropping out months ago, continues to get around 15% to 20% of the vote in nearly every Republican primary. She has not endorsed Trump, but I believe it is likely she will if she gets a prominent spot at the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nTrust me, I get that no one wants to even think about 2028 while we are still six months away from the 2024 election.

It looks more like a fit of pique than good politics.\n\nMaryland Democrats and Independents who are winnable for Hogan don't care if he likes Trump or not, they care about inflation, the border, crime and woke campus chaos.\n\nPut simply, it's time for Larry to get on the team, and for Haley to endorse Trump.\n\nWhat we see in the miasma of these Maryland numbers, as well as in neighboring West Virginia, where former Democrat and current GOP Governor Jim Justice will try to flip Joe Manchin's senate seat, is an opportunity not just for victories in 2024, but for much, much longer.\n\nWhen I took my first breath in 1974, Democrats had held control of the House of Representatives for 20 years; it would be another two decades before Newt Gingrich's Contract with America would shake loose that control.\n\nThis kind of majoritarian power for 40 years seems foreign and distant to today's political observer, but it is exactly what the Republican Party's goal must be if it is to undo the damage wrought by Democrat dominance in the late 20th Century.\n\nFor the first time in 100 years, Republicans can be the party that sets the long-term agenda and controls the political playing field, instead of merely standing athwart history yelling \"stop.\"\n\nTrump, who can attract tens of thousands in blue New Jersey, has brought non-white working-class voters into play, DeSantis and Youngkin appeal to suburban women, and Haley and Hogan represent the old GOP, who still can and should have a seat at the table.\n\nIf Republicans offer a big tent with broad appeal, instead of narrow purity tests, this goal of dominance is well within reach. In fact, a Republican Party that can simultaneously attract Trump voters, Haley Voters and Hogan voters might already be there.\n\nThe person who best seems to understand all of this, appears somewhat surprisingly to be Trump himself. Speaker Mike Johnson might struggle to hold together his fissiparous and raucous caucus, but Trump is managing it quite well.\n\nAfter all, it wasn't just Rep. Matt Gaetz and Sen. J.D. Vance, both Trump stalwarts, who stood behind him for his courthouse photo ops, but also Johnson and moderate New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis. The GOP establishment was in the house.\n\nThe other side of this coin of opportunity so close to the grasp of Republicans is the abject and almost hilarious fracturing of a Democrat Party that is falling into its own disunity.\n\nPut simply, it's time for Larry to get on the team, and for former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to endorse Donald Trump.\n\nIt is Democrats and liberals, not Republicans and conservatives, heckling and hectoring President Joe Biden at his appearances with chants of \"Genocide Joe.\"\n\nIt is Democrats who can't quite decide what a woman is or who should play girls' sports, even though most Americans understand basic biology.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nIt is Democrats launching dangerous lawfare at Trump all while claiming that he is the true threat to democracy.\n\nThe American people are more frustrated by the state of their union than they have been in decades, and they have a Democrat president and party who mock their worries, telling them everything is fine.\n\nThe big red wave of 2022 did not come to pass, and yes, abortion played a role in that, as did poor candidate selection, but so did disunity.\n\nIn November 2022, Republicans were gearing up for war with each other. For much of 2023, heavy words were lightly thrown in the heat of a primary battle.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNo such conditions will exist in November 2024. Instead of a fork in the road, instead of two paths, the Republican Party can forge a single, wide lane and win major victories to establish an electoral beachhead.\n\nIf, but only if, that happens, real and lasting change will be possible for the first time in a long time, and that is exactly what the American people are asking for.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

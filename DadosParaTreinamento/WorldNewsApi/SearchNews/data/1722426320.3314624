{"id": 243327972, "title": "Assam Congress opposes &#039;tainted&#039; officer&#039;s top post, cites multiple violations", "text": "The Assam Congress has put up a strong opposition against the reappointment of retired Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer MK Yadava as Special Chief Secretary, citing multiple alleged violations of administrative rules. The party also highlighted his \u201cproblematic\u201d track record involving alleged illegal land diversion, wildlife mismanagement, corruption and other serious accusations.Yadava, who is said to be a loyalist of Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, was appointed as the Special Chief Secretary in-charge of forests in March after his retirement.The Congress alleged that the reappointment violated the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules 1954 and the Department of Personnel and Training\u2019s instructions on re-employing retired All India Service officers to senior posts in the government. The party also stressed his \u201ctainted\u201d service history.Leader of Opposition in the Assam Assembly, Debabrata Saikia, alleged, \"Recently, for creating commando camps in the forest, the National Green Tribunal and the forest ministry issued him a show cause notice. Despite that, he continued as the Managing Director of Amtron, Assam Electronics Development Corporation. I don't know what his capabilities are. Why has the forest department proposed him for the post of Special Chief Secretary?\"\u201cThis is in violation of the Assam Forest Service rules, which clearly mention how a person can be promoted. It has already been compromised,\u201d he added.Recently, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) filed a case against Yadava for illegal diversion of forest lands for non-forest purposes in violation of the Forest Conservation Act and other statutes. The illegal clearance and diversion of substantial tracts of forest land were to facilitate the construction of commando battalions and other non-forestry activities like making public roads.The tribunal ordered a halt to all ongoing construction activities on the diverted forest lands and an exhaustive inquiry into it and the roles of all involved.An investigation by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) revealed that Yadava allegedly misled authorities concerning the forest land diversion. It was alleged that his conduct reflected a calculated attempt to circumvent essential legal safeguards designed to protect Assam's forest ecosystem.Congress national spokesperson Rajiv Kumar Bishnoi alleged that Yadava was accused of Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) tampering in 2009 when he was the Amtron chief.\u201cAfter that, he was accused of irregularities in government exams in the state. When MK Yadava was the director of Kaziranga, there was an increase in rhinoceros poaching cases. All this is a matter of investigation,\u201d Bishnoi said.\u201cOn whose orders are the BJP government of Assam and Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma trying to save this retired IFS officer?\u201d he asked.It was also alleged that at least two Chief Secretaries had put in writing regarding Yadava\u2019s direct involvement in the alleged misappropriation of huge amounts while heading Amtron in connection with work to install networking equipment in the secretariat. It was suggested that he should be removed from service.While Yadava was the Director of Kaziranga National Park, 44 rhinos were poached in two years. As Chief Wildlife Warden, multiple cases were reported whereby elephants were being transported in Assam without mandatory tagging.Yadava is also accused of diverting Rs 1.12 crore from the Tiger Conservation Fund and Rs 51 lakh from the General Wildlife Fund for the VVIP movement. This came to light through an RTI and led to the removal of Yadava as Chief Wildlife Warden.According to reports, when Yadava was the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, he facilitated the promotion of 209 forest personnel without following the requisite procedural steps mandated by law and established administrative practices.Recently, a complaint was filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Karimganj, alleging criminal intimidation and coercion by forest officials and others in various villages. The complaint named several forest officials, including Yadava.Local environmentalists alleged that Yadava authorised the construction of barriers, concrete structures, metal posts and cable fencing along NH-37, blocking animal movement on crucial wildlife corridors, leading to animals not being able to migrate to their traditional higher ground during the monsoon season, which could result in possible drowning.Congress spokesperson Rajiv Bishnoi demanded a High Court-monitored probe into the alleged violations and corruption by Yadava.\u201cWe want this case to be investigated under the supervision of the Gauhati High Court and Yadava's tenure should be seriously investigated. The BJP and the Chief Minister have pushed Assam into corruption today,\u201d he added.Published By: Ajmal Published On: Jun 29, 2024ALSO READ | Assam Home Secretary shoots self at hospital after wife's deathMust Watch", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/assam-special-chief-secretary-forest-retired-ifs-officer-mk-yadava-2559968-2024-06-29\"> <img align=\"left\" hspace=\"2\" height=\"180\" width=\"305\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/mk-yadava-291609674-16x9_0.png?VersionId=ewVjlE9zpTdfzYtt7fsCGUoEtySlAYyY\"> </a> Assam Congress opposes Special Chief Secretary appointment, cites multiple violations", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/assam-special-chief-secretary-forest-retired-ifs-officer-mk-yadava-2559968-2024-06-29", "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/mk-yadava-291609674-16x9_0.png?VersionId=ewVjlE9zpTdfzYtt7fsCGUoEtySlAYyY?size=1280:720", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:16:24", "author": "Saraswat Kashyap", "authors": ["Saraswat Kashyap"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.387}

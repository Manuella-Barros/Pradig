habit of popping up when he's needed the most, Kyle Walker-Peters makes an impressive debut and Jonjo Shelvey simply cannot be trusted to be captain\n\nTottenham made a winning start to the new Premier League season as they beat 10-men Newcastle 2-0 at St James' Park.\n\nNewcastle made a good start to the match, but had it all to do when their captain Jonjo Shelvey was sent off early into the second-half for stamping on Dele Alli.\n\nThe England international opened the scoring just a few minutes later, when he latched onto Christian Eriksen's diagonal pass into the box.\n\nAnd less than ten minutes later full-back Ben Davies made sure of the win with a smart close-range finish.\n\nHere are five things we learned from the match.\n\nWalker-Peters makes an instant impression The young full-back impressed on his debut (Getty)\n\nThe 20-year-old had an impressive Spurs debut and was even spotted animatedly waving Moussa Sissoko further forward up the pitch at one moment in the first-half, with all the exasperation of a hardened first-team regular.\n\nIt was a confident start to life in the Premier League for the youngster and, with half an hour of the game gone, no player on the pitch had touched the ball as many times as Walker-Peters. That's largely because Newcastle ran at him whenever possible, but he stood up well to everything that was thrown at him and proved that he can be a viable alternative to Kieran Trippier this season.\n\nShelvey is not captain material Shelvey was rightfully shown a red card (Getty)\n\nNewcastle manager Rafa Benitez has defended his decision to hand Shelvey the captain's armband on more than one occasion. And this is not the first time the Spaniard has been let down by his skipper.\n\nShelvey may be a fantastically talented player - and arguably the best player Benitez has available at his disposal - but his tendency to self-destruct means he simply cannot be trusted. His petulant stamp on Dele Alli was a pathetic moment of ill-discipline and went a long way to costing Newcastle this match.\n\nAlli makes the difference when it matters Alli scored the crucial first goal (Getty)\n\nThe England international didn't so much as have a quiet half as an exceptionally poor one. Well tracked by former Arsenal man Isaac Hayden and restricted largely to a role on the fringes, Alli was growing visibly frustrated as his usual repertoire of flicks, tricks and dinks failed to delight.\n\nBut the 21-year-old is a big-game player and has a habit of popping up and making the difference when he is most needed. After being stamped on by Shelvey and hacked down by Matt Ritchie, Alli latched onto a perfectly weighted Christian Eriksen pass to nudge the ball past Rob Elliot at the back post. It was a big finish at a big moment.\n\nNewcastle fans should not be too disheartened (yet) Newcastle have to hang onto Benitez (Getty)\n\nNewcastle supporters can be forgiven for not feeling entirely optimistic about the season ahead, especially after Rafa Benitez made it known he wants to make more signings before the transfer window swings shut. Owner Mike Ashley has already poured cold water on that idea.\n\nBut until Shelvey's sending off, Newcastle looked comfortable against Tottenham - the side that finished runners-up in the Premier League last season. Benitez is a manager who knows what he is doing and his side were tough to break down and looked lively on the counter. It is imperative that the club retain his services.\n\nTottenham's squad is deeper than people think Tottenham's squad is not as thin as people make out (Getty)\n\nIt would be fascinating to know what Mauricio Pochettino really thought of Antonio Conte's recent comments about the cripplingly small size of Chelsea's squad - even with the recent arrivals of Antonio R\u00fcdiger, Tiemou\u00e9 Bakayoko and \u00c1lvaro Morata for a combined \u00a3127m.\n\nTottenham, of course, are still yet to spend a single penny and many pundits have tipped the side to struggle this season because of their failure to bolster their squad this summer.\n\nBut Spurs still have options: Son Heung-min, Vincent Wanyama and Harry Winks are first-team players who Pochettino decided to leave on the bench against Newcastle, while Trippier, Danny Rose and Erik Lamela are all due to make their respective returns from injury soon.\n\nMore about: Premier League Tottenham Hotspur Newcastle United Maurico Pochettino Rafa Benitez Dele Alli Jonjo Shelvey Reuse content", "time": "14:08:00"}

campaign with a 2-0 win over 10-man Newcastle United at St James' Park.\n\nNewcastle kept Tottenham, who finished runners-up last term, at arm's length during a lacklustre first half, but Shelvey trod on Alli's ankle three minutes into the second period and was shown a straight red card by referee Andre Marriner.\n\nRafael Benitez's side, who had already lost Paul Dummett and debutant Florian Lejeune to injury, were unable to contain Spurs thereafter, with Alli making the breakthrough when he stretched to volley Christian Eriksen's exquisite delivery into the back of the net.\n\nDavies added Tottenham's second with 20 minutes remaining, finishing a slick move with a composed finish beyond Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot, Eriksen again the provider.\n\nIt will be a pleasing result for Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino, who has fielded difficult questions following Tottenham's absence of movement in the transfer market and the explosive comments from Danny Rose in which the left-back hit out at the way the club has been operating.\n\nHarry Kane, last season's Golden Boot winner, could have added more gloss but struck the post late on and his wait for a Premier League goal in August continues.\n\nBenitez, meanwhile, will be hugely frustrated that Newcastle's return to the top flight was spoiled by Shelvey's peevishness.\n\nDwight Gayle overcame a hamstring injury to lead the Newcastle line and sliced over the crossbar when presented with an opportunity by Dummett, who soon suffered a similar issue and was forced off after just seven minutes - Jamaal Lascelles his replacement.\n\nTottenham controlled possession but Gayle threatened in behind and went down in the box under contact from Kyle Walker-Peters, making his Spurs debut at right back with Kyle Walker sold to Manchester City and Kieran Trippier out with an ankle injury, only to see the flag raised for offside.\n\nSpurs lacked ingenuity and Kane was shown a yellow card for scything down Lejeune in a tackle that brought the Frenchman's outing to an early end.\n\nEriksen worked Rob Elliot four minutes before half-time with a dipping, 25-yard drive the goalkeeper saw all the way and was able to hold.\n\nThere was drama just three minutes after the restart when Shelvey was dismissed for reacting to Alli kicking the ball away while down on the ground by treading on his ankle.\n\nThe game suddenly burst into life, with Gayle forcing Hugo Lloris into a save at his near post, but Newcastle's positive response soon fizzled out.\n\nA deflection off Matt Ritchie saw Eriksen's pass loop up for the unmarked Kane inside the box, but Elliot stayed big and blocked his powerful strike in the 51st minute.\n\nMoussa Sissoko was booed as his return to St James' Park ended with Son Heung-min taking his place before the hour mark, and Tottenham soon made their extra man count.\n\nAlli lost Lascelles inside the box and guided a lovely ball from the right courtesy of Eriksen across Elliot and into the net.\n\nThe England international was involved in Tottenham's second as his flick was guided into the path of Davies by Eriksen, the left-back finishing a slick move with a cool finish.\n\nAlli was booed as he made way for Victor Wanyama in the 82nd minute and Kane was unable to rub salt into Newcastle's wounds when his fierce strike cannoned back off the upright in stoppage time, meaning his August Premier League drought extends to 11 games, but Shelvey's moment of madness had already proved the Magpies' undoing.\n\nKey Opta stats:\n\n- Tottenham have won 29 of their last 31 Premier League games against newly promoted sides, drawing the other two.\n\n- Dele Alli has scored 13 Premier League goals in 2017; among English players, only Harry Kane (21) has scored more.\n\n- Jonjo Shelvey was the first Newcastle player to be sent off on the opening day of a Premier League season at St. James' Park since Alan Shearer in 1999.\n\n- Shelvey has been sent off twice under Rafael Benitez at Newcastle, more than any other player. He was also red carded in a Championship match at Nottingham Forest in December 2016.\n\n- Since the start of the 2015/16 season, Christian Eriksen has assisted more Premier League goals than any other player (30).\n\n- Florian Lejeune became the 200th French player to feature in the Premier League and also the 27th to represent Newcastle, more than any other side in the competition's history.\n\n- Ben Davies has scored twice in his last two Premier League appearances, as many as in his previous 102 combined.\n\n- None of the last 10 winners of the Championship have won their opening match in the Premier League the following season (D2 L8).", "time": "12:56:00"}

Reuters\n\nIt was the kind of incident that has often provoked a furious response from Alli and landed him in trouble in the past.\n\nBut, having been told by Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino to keep his emotions under control, this time Alli didn't react to Shelvey's foul.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be a physical game. It's not an easy place to come. It happens sometimes,\" Alli said of his clash with Shelvey.\n\n\"I've been pulled up for my temper before but today we had to keep our cool. There was no need to react today.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about it too much. I've had a few talks with the gaffer in the past.\n\n\"I'm sure Shelvey will be disappointed. It was important we stayed professional.\"\n\nAlli was rewarded for his composure as Shelvey was dismissed, sparking Tottenham's 2-0 victory in their Premier League opener.\n\nFittingly, it was Alli who opened the scoring with a clinical finish from Christian Eriksen's sublime pass before Ben Davies wrapped up the points.\n\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez revealed former Liverpool midfielder Shelvey had apologised to his team-mates for the rush of blood that cost his newly promoted team their chance of a shock win.\n\n\"The sending off changed everything.

victory at Newcastle on Sunday after the England midfielder was involved in the crucial dismissal of Magpies midfielder Jonjo Shelvey.\n\nShelvey was shown a second half red card for deliberately

He's upset with himself and thinks he let the team down. He apologised to everyone and we believe he will come back stronger.\"", "time": "16:24:00"}

Alli as Newcastle's return to the Premier League was ruined by Tottenham.\n\nSkipper Jonjo Shelvey was sent off for standing on Dele Alli as Newcastle's return to the Premier League was ruined by Tottenham.\n\nSecond-half goals from Alli and Ben Davies ultimately did for the promoted Magpies with the visitors coasting to a 2-0 victory, but it was Shelvey's 49th-minute dismissal which opened the door after his side had scrapped their way to the break without major incident.\n\nThe 25-year-old, who was banned for five games last season after being accused of making racist comments towards Wolves midfielder Romain Saiss, saw red to the astonishment of his team-mates and the locals among a crowd of 52,077, although television replays suggested he had stood on Alli's ankle as the Tottenham man lay on the floor.\n\nHis impending suspension and injuries to defenders Paul Dummett and Florian Lejeune made it a bad afternoon for manager Rafael Benitez and watching owner Mike Ashley.\n\nIn contrast, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino left Tyneside having seen a satisfactory performance from his men, who were eventually rewarded for their patience.\n\nBenitez had admitted in the run-up to the game that his players would have to battle for their lives throughout the entire campaign, and they did just that before Shelvey's premature exit.\n\nWith the hosts sitting deep and attempting to maintain their shape, Spurs dominated possession as Christian Eriksen, seemingly in perpetual motion, orchestrated proceedings with the help of Mousa Dembele, Alli and pantomime villain Moussa Sissoko, who was booed at every touch on his return to St James' Park.\n\nIt was the Magpies who created the first opening when last season's top scorer Dwight Gayle ran on to Dummett's ball over the top, only to shank his left-foot shot wide of the target.\n\nHowever, chances proved few and far between for the home side with only winger Christian Atsu causing the visitors sporadic problems, and it was Eriksen who looked the most likely to break the deadlock.\n\nThe Dane shot across the face of goal with 27 minutes gone after Spurs had broken from a Newcastle corner, and he tested goalkeeper Rob Elliot with a dipping volley four minutes before the break.\n\nBut the game was to take a nasty twist for Newcastle within minutes of the restart when, after referee Andre Marriner had blown for a foul by Alli, Shelvey appeared to stand on the prone player's ankle as he walked by, prompting the official to show a straight red card.\n\nGayle forced a near-post save from Hugo Lloris in the immediate aftermath, but opposite number Elliot had to make a fine 52nd-minute block to deny Harry Kane the opening goal.\n\nHowever, there was nothing the Republic of Ireland international could do to keep his side level nine minutes later when Eriksen picked out Alli's run into the box and the England midfielder guided the ball home.\n\nNewcastle's hopes of a comeback were dashed with 20 minutes remaining when the ball broke to full-back Davies inside the penalty area and he slotted past the advancing Elliot, while Kane hit a post in stoppage time to spare them further punishment.", "time": "12:56:00"}

A challenge on the latter ought to have seen Harry Kane even more harshly sanctioned than the yellow he received.\n\nYet it was Tottenham who seemed worse off for absent defenders, with the absence of the injured Danny Rose and \u00a350million Manchester City right-back Kyle Walker keenly felt.\n\nWithout their flying full-backs Spurs' attack lacked any bite, even as debutant Kyle Walker-Peters put in a hard-working display on debut. Christian Eriksen and Moussa Sissoko drifted infield but there was no-one on the overlap to stretch Newcastle out of shape.\n\nThat meant the Tottenham's attack dissolved to little more than Eriksen pot-shots, only one of which on 26 minutes offered a feasible threat to Rob Elliot's goal even as it flashed wide of the far post.\n\nWith the hosts holding on manfully their rearguard was harmed no end by the immaturity of captain Shelvey, who having come off the better from a challenge with Alli chose to tamp on his opponent's ankle three minutes into the second half.\n\nImmediately the game became stretched, Dwight Gayle and Harry Kane volleying at their opposing goalkeepers from close range in a matter of moments.\n\nThe Magpies' resistance could not last. Eriksen was left in space outside the area and on this occasion he looked for a team-mate's run rather than a shot. The delivery was exceptional, requiring Alli only to make enough contact on the ball to divert it past Elliot.\n\nAfter an obdurate hour on the defence the 10-men of Newcastle were shattered and it was not long before Ben Davies found himself slotting home after delicate combination play between Kane, Alli and Eriksen.\n\nNewcastle had not been neutered when they went down to 10 men in their last Premier League match, the 5-1 win over Spurs in May 2016, and Christian Atsu continued to probe down the left. But it was not enough and the Magpies were left to wonder what might have been had their captain not proven to be such an inadequate leader.", "time": "14:23:00"}

against Spurs\n\nDele Alli fired Tottenham to a 2-0 victory at Newcastle on Sunday after the England midfielder was involved in the crucial dismissal of Magpies midfielder Jonjo Shelvey.\n\nShelvey was shown a second half red card for deliberately treading on Alli, who was on the ground only yards from referee Andre Marriner.\n\nTottenham capitalised by scoring through Alli and then Ben Davies to open their Premier League campaign with a comfortable three points at St James' Park.\n\nAfter finishing second last season, Tottenham will hope their winning start bodes well for a sustained title challenge.\n\nIt added up to a frustrating return to the Premier League for promoted Newcastle, who had competed well until Shelvey's needless dismissal.\n\nUntil the red card, this encounter between two teams whose supporters have been critical of their lack of transfer investment was in danger of meandering towards a goalless stalemate.\n\nNewcastle's net spend has been less than \u00a320 million ($25 million, 21 million euros), while Tottenham opted not to make even one new signing, choices which appeared ill-judged for long periods here.\n\nIf future decisions are based on analysis of this game, the two managers will surely move in the market to strengthen their squad before the end of the transfer deadline.\n\nMauricio Pochettino will know Tottenham lacked imagination before the red card, while Newcastle's Rafa Benitez will be particularly anxious to recruit reinforcements after suffering injuries to two defenders long before the half-time whistle.\n\nLeft-back is the position where Benitez has no cover for Paul Dummett, so central defender Ciaran Clark had to move there when Dummett suffered a leg injury after only six minutes.\n\nNewcastle were forced to improvise again by the 34th when Chancel Mbemba took over from another centre-half, Florian Lejeune, leaving Newcastle with their third defensive partnership of the afternoon.\n\nLejeune, who already looks the pick of Newcastle's new signings, went down under a challenge from Harry Kane, who was booked.\n\nIt was one of Kane's few contributions to the opening half, but others were equally anonymous as both teams struggled to locate any early-season fluency.\n\n- Danger man -\n\nDwight Gayle sliced an early shot wide from a chance created by Dummett's final involvement, while excellent work down the left by Christian Atsu was wasted when nobody was in front of goal to meet his cross.\n\nChristian Eriksen was the Tottenham danger man in the first 45 minutes, steering a 26th minute shot narrowly wide, then bringing a save from Rob Elliot shortly before the end of the opening half.\n\nThe pattern of the rest of the game was dictated by the dismissal of Shelvey in the 48th minute.\n\nGayle did force Hugo Lloris to finally make a save moments later, but Newcastle's 10 men were largely pinned back in their own half from that point.\n\nKane, needing only one goal to complete a century for Tottenham could have secured it in the 51st minute when he was left in space and hooked a shot that brought a marvellous save from Elliot.\n\nIt was only a matter of time, though, before the 10 men were opened up and Eriksen was the man responsible with a fine pass that Alli slid past the exposed Elliott after 61 minutes.\n\nThe Tottenham pair were also involved in their second goal after 70 minutes when they combined with Kane before Davies nipped in front of Eriksen to finish calmly.\n\nKane, who rarely scores for Tottenham in the month of August, was inches away from ending that drought when he struck the post in stoppage time.\n\nHe will have to wait a little longer for that 100th goal for the club.", "time": "17:05:00"}

Newcastle United on Sunday after Dele Alli scored one goal and helped create the other at St James's Park.\n\nHaving eased back into the top flight from the second-tier Championship, Newcastle held their own against last season's Premier League runners-up in the opening half but succumbed after Jonjo Shelvey was sent off in the 48th minute.\n\nShelvey got his marching orders for stomping on Alli and Spurs duly took advantage as the England midfielder, who pulled all the strings for the visitors, broke the deadlock on the hour when he steered in an inch-perfect cross by Christian Eriksen.\n\nAlli, who helped Eriksen set up the other for Davies in the 70th minute, made light of Shelvey's petulant reaction.\n\n\"I'm sure he'll be disappointed,\" Alli told Sky Sports.\n\n\"It was important we stayed professional. I don't want to talk about it too much. I've been pulled up for my temper before but today we had to keep our cool. There was no need to react.\"\n\nNewcastle, whose fans incessantly booed their former midfielder Moussa Sissoko now playing for Spurs, missed their best chance straight after Shelvey's dismissal as keeper Hugo Lloris denied Dwight Gayle with a fine save.\n\nHarry Kane, last season's top scorer in the Premier League with 29 goals, missed a sitter at the other end before Alli slid in at the far post and beat Robert Elliot with a fine finish.\n\nThe influential Eriksen and livewire Alli carved open Newcastle's defence with a lightning move 10 minutes later, presenting Davies with a simple finish from seven metres.\n\nKane should have added the third in stoppage time as Spurs charged forward but hit the post with only Elliot to beat.\n\nNewcastle winger Christian Atsu said the temperamental Shelvey had apologised to his team mates after the game.\n\n\"That's football,\" the Ghanaian said.\n\n\"He'll learn from his mistakes. He's upset with himself and thinks he let the team down. He apologised to everyone and we believe he will come back stronger.\"\n\n(Writing by Zoran Milosavljevic, editing by Pritha Sarkar)", "time": "15:18:00"}

to the Premier League.\n\nGoals from Dele Alli and Ben Davies gave Mauricio Pochettino a comfortable win at St James' Park, more than eradicating the memory of their 5-1 thrashing when Newcastle said farewell to the top flight two years ago.\n\nIt was the ease of Spurs' victory which will concern Newcastle boss Benitez who saw midfielder Jonjo Shelvey sent off for a mindless stamp on Alli after he had already been forced to replace two injured defenders before half-time.\n\nShelvey, who was Benitez's last signing for Liverpool seven years ago and a major contributor in Newcastle's promotion last season, clearly stood on Alli's leg deliberately after an innocuous foul three minutes into the second-half.\n\nThe former Swansea midfielder now faces a three-match ban which the stretched Newcastle squad can ill afford.\n\nBenitez will also be awaiting news of defenders Paul Dummett and Florian Lejeune who were both forced off injured in the opening 34 minutes.\n\nWales left-back Dummett looks likely to be out for weeks after he pulled his hamstring in the seventh minute while Lejeune was injured in a nasty challenge from Harry Kane which earned the Spurs captain a caution.\n\nEven before the two substitutions, Newcastle were on the back foot and they spent long periods chasing Spurs shadows before going behind.\n\nThe visitors clinched three points with two well-worked goals and Alli broke the deadlock in the 61st minute when he tapped home Christian Eriksen's perfect delivery in front of goal.\n\nFull-back Ben Davies completed another four-man sweeping move when he slotted past Rob Elliot nine minutes later.\n\nSpurs could easily have matched the five they conceded in May 2016 but Elliot made two superb saves to deny Eriksen and Kane, who also hit the post late on.\n\nThe defeat was a reality check for Benitez and Newcastle supporters, who at least entertained themselves with the pantomime booing of former player Moussa Sissoko who was substituted after an unimpressive return to Tyneside.\n\nNewcastle travel to fellow newly-promoted Huddersfield next Sunday while Spurs face Chelsea in their first Premier League home game at

victory at Newcastle on Sunday after the England midfielder was involved in the crucial dismissal of Magpies midfielder Jonjo Shelvey.\n\nShelvey was shown a second half red card for deliberately treading on Alli, who was on the ground only yards from referee Andre Marriner.\n\nTottenham capitalised by scoring through Alli and then Ben Davies to open their Premier League campaign with a comfortable three points at St James' Park.\n\nAfter finishing second last season, Tottenham will hope their winning start bodes well for a sustained title challenge.\n\nIt added up to a frustrating return to the Premier League for promoted Newcastle, who had competed well until Shelvey's needless dismissal.\n\nUntil the red card, this encounter between two teams whose supporters have been critical of their lack of transfer investment was in danger of meandering towards a goalless stalemate.\n\nNewcastle's net spend has been less than \u00a320 million ($25 million, 21 million euros), while Tottenham opted not to make even one new signing, choices which appeared ill-judged for long periods here.\n\nIf future decisions are based on analysis of this game, the two managers will surely move in the market to strengthen their squad before the end of the transfer deadline.\n\nMauricio Pochettino will know Tottenham lacked imagination before the red card, while Newcastle's Rafa Benitez will be particularly anxious to recruit reinforcements after suffering injuries to two defenders long before the half-time whistle.\n\nLeft-back is the position where Benitez has no cover for Paul Dummett, so central defender Ciaran Clark had to move there when Dummett suffered a leg injury after only six minutes.\n\nNewcastle were forced to improvise again by the 34th when Chancel Mbemba took over from another centre-half, Florian Lejeune, leaving Newcastle with their third defensive partnership of the afternoon.\n\nLejeune, who already looks the pick of Newcastle's new signings, went down under a challenge from Harry Kane, who was booked.\n\nIt was one of Kane's few contributions to the opening half, but others were equally anonymous as both teams struggled to locate any early-season fluency.Dwight Gayle sliced an early shot wide from a chance created by Dummett's final involvement, while excellent work down the left by Christian Atsu was wasted when nobody was in front of goal to meet his cross.\n\nChristian Eriksen was the Tottenham danger man in the first 45 minutes, steering a 26th minute shot narrowly wide, then bringing a save from Rob Elliot shortly before the end of the opening half.\n\nThe pattern of the rest of the game was dictated by the dismissal of Shelvey in the 48th minute.\n\nGayle did force Hugo Lloris to finally make a save moments later, but Newcastle's 10 men were largely pinned back in their own half from that point.\n\nKane, needing only one goal to complete a century for Tottenham could have secured it in the 51st minute when he was left in space and hooked a shot that brought a marvelous save from Elliot.\n\nIt was only a matter of time, though, before the 10 men were opened up and Eriksen was the man responsible with a fine pass that Alli slid past the exposed Elliott after 61 minutes.\n\nThe Tottenham pair were also involved in their second goal after 70 minutes when they combined with Kane before Davies nipped in front of Eriksen to

"TOTTENHAM handed ten man Newcastle United and Rafa Benitez a harsh lesson on their return to the Premier League.\n\nGoals from Dele Alli and Ben Davies gave Mauricio Pochettino a comfortable win at St James' Park, more than eradicating the memory of their 5-1 thrashing when Newcastle said farewell to the top flight two years ago.\n\nIt was the ease of Spurs' victory which will concern Newcastle boss Benitez who saw midfielder Jonjo Shelvey sent off for a mindless stamp on Alli after he had already been forced to replace two injured defenders before half-time.\n\nShelvey, who was Benitez's last signing for Liverpool seven years ago and a major contributor in Newcastle's promotion last season, clearly stood on Alli's leg deliberately after an innocuous foul three minutes into the second-half.\n\nThe former Swansea midfielder now faces a three-match which the stretched Newcastle squad can ill afford.\n\nBenitez will also be awaiting news of defenders Paul Dummett and Florian Lejeune who were both forced off injured in the opening 34 minutes.\n\nWales left-back Dummett looks likely to be out for weeks after he pulled his hamstring in the seventh minute while Lejeune was injured in a nasty challenge from Harry Kane which earned the Spurs captain a caution.\n\nEven before the two substitutions, Newcastle were on the back foot and they spent long periods chasing Spurs shadows before going behind.\n\nThe visitors clinched three points with two well-worked goals and Alli broke the deadlock in the 61st minute when he tapped home Christian Eriksen's perfect delivery in front of goal.\n\nFull-back Ben Davies completed another four-man sweeping move when he slotted past Rob Elliot nine minutes later.\n\nSpurs could easily have matched the five they conceded in May 2016 but Elliot made two superb saves to deny Eriksen and Kane, who also hit the post late on.\n\nThe defeat was a reality check for Benitez and Newcastle supporters, who at least entertained themselves with the pantomime booing of former player Moussa Sissoko who was substituted after an unimpressive return to Tyneside.\n\nNewcastle travel to fellow newly-promoted Huddersfield next Sunday while Spurs face Chelsea in their first Premier League home game at Wembley.\n\nINTERACTIVE LINE-UPS - CLICK on a player's number below to see their stats\n\nBen Davies was the unlikely goalscorer as Spurs went two-up against Newcastle\n\nDele Alli, on the Jonjo Shelvey incident: \"Some of them things in football happen, I am sure he is going to be disappointed. We just had to stay professional.\n\n\"I have had a few talks with the gaffer about my temper, it is something I like to keep in my game but it is important to stay cool. There was no need to react today.\n\n\"We have some fantastic players here, everyone has been working hard and we have started the season strongly.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be a physical game, but we knew if we stuck to our gameplan the chances would come\n\n\"Fair play to Kyle for coming in and doing very well and taking his chance.\n\nKyle Walker-Peters added: \"Playing here is a fantastic stadium, and most importantly we got the three points. But yes, I am happy.\n\n\"I found out in training, I was a bit nervy but nerves are good. Some of the boys even teased me about it.\"\n\nNewcastle: Elliot 6 , Manquillo 6, Clark 6, Lejeune 6 (Mbemba 6), Dummet 6 (Lascelles 6), Ritchie 6, Shelvey 5, Hayden 6, Atsu 6, Perez 5, Gayle 6 (Merino 6)\n\nTottenham: Lloris 7, Walker-Peters 7, Alderweireld 7, Vertonghen 7, Davies 7 , Dier 7, Dembele 7 (Winks 6), Sissoko 6 (Son, 6), Eriksen 8, Alli 7 (Wanyama 6) , Kane 7", "time": "14:51:00"}

The 48th-minute incident took place right in front of the referee, at a time when Newcastle was looking comfortable against one of the favorites for the title.\n\nTottenham immediately took charge of the match and Alli slid in at the far post to steer in a cross from Christian Eriksen in the 61st minute.\n\nNewcastle United's Florian Lejeune received medical attention on the pitch during the English Premier League soccer match against Tottenham Hotspur at St James' Park, Newcastle, England, Sunday, Aug. 13, 2017.

Harry Kane struck the post in injury time as Newcastle fell apart late on.\n\nSpurs started off slowly but looked assured and dangerous going forward after Shelvey's game-turning dismissal. Alli opened his scoring account in his first game of the season, building on his career-high 18 goals from last season.\n\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has come under pressure to add some new players to a squad that finished second to Chelsea last season and has lost right back Kyle Walker, who moved to Manchester City.\n\nHis options have improved, though, with young right back Kyle Walker-Peters impressing on his first league start and South Korea forward Heung-min Son making a return to action after sustaining a broken arm in preseason.\n\nNewcastle's cause wasn't helped by losing defenders Paul Dummett and Florian Lejeune - the 200th French player to feature in a Premier League game - to injury in the first half.\n\nTottenham Hotspur's Ben Davies, centre, celebrates scoring his side's second goal of the game with team mates during the Premier League soccer match against Newcastle at St James' Park in Newcastle, England, Sunday Aug. 13, 2017.

Jonjo Shelvey will now serve a three game suspension for straight red. (Source: Reuters) Dele Alli shines as Spurs start off with 2-0 win over Newcastle UnitedCisse double-strike ends Chelsea's unbeaten run; Arsenal go down 3-2Toon trouble for Liverpool\n\nNewcastle captain Jonjo Shelvey apologised to his team mates after his red card for a stamp on Tottenham Hotspur's Dele Alli left them with 10 men for almost all the second half in the 2-0 Premier League defeat at St James' Park on Sunday. \"Jonjo apologised to the team after the game,\" said manager Rafa Benitez.\n\nTV replays showed Shelvey deliberately trod on Alli's ankle in full view of referee Andre Marriner after the Tottenham player failed to give him the ball. The referee immediately gave the midfielder a straight red card.\n\nShelvey will now serve an automatic three-match ban, missing games against Huddersfield Town, West Ham United and Swansea City as Newcastle seek to re-establish themselves in England's top tier after promotion.\n\nShelvey's moment of madness changed the course of the game with Newcastle still level.\n\nIt appeared even more ill-advised because Newcastle had already lost two players injured in a hectic first half hour. The incident happened in the 48th minute after Alli had been fouled by Isaac Hayden.\n\nShelvey went to get the ball from Alli and, apparently annoyed when the Spurs midfielder knocked it away, stepped on Alli's ankle.\n\nBenitez admitted Shelvey's red card changed the match but said the stamp was not as dangerous as a Harry Kane tackle on Florian Lejeune, for which he was booked.\n\n\"It was difficult from the beginning. We had to adapt things [after injuries]. The red card changed everything. I think we were defending well. We have to improve. We had our chances but we missed them,\" Benitez said.\n\n\"The Harry Kane tackle was worse than this one. It's more dangerous. We lost one player from that. We made a mistake, but I think maybe someone has to analyse these things to see what's more dangerous.\"\n\nAlli did not want to talk about the incident when he was interviewed by Sky TV after the game. \"It was one of those things.

Dele Alli fired Tottenham to a 2-0 victory at Newcastle on Sunday after the England midfielder was involved in the crucial dismissal of Magpies midfielder Jonjo Shelvey.\n\nShelvey was shown a second half red card for deliberately treading on Alli, who was on the ground only yards from referee Andre Marriner.\n\nTottenham capitalised by scoring through Alli and then Ben Davies to open their Premier League campaign with a comfortable three points at St James' Park.\n\nAfter finishing second last season, Tottenham will hope their winning start bodes well for a sustained title challenge.\n\nIt added up to a frustrating return to the Premier League for promoted Newcastle, who had competed well until Shelvey's needless dismissal.\n\nUntil the red card, this encounter between two teams whose supporters have been critical of their lack of transfer investment was in danger of meandering towards a goalless stalemate.\n\nNewcastle's net spend has been less than \u00a320 million ($25 million, 21 million euros), while Tottenham opted not to make even one new signing, choices which appeared ill-judged for long periods here.\n\nIf future decisions are based on analysis of this game, the two managers will surely move in the market to strengthen their squad before the end of the transfer deadline.\n\nMauricio Pochettino will know Tottenham lacked imagination before the red card, while Newcastle's Rafa Benitez will be particularly anxious to recruit reinforcements after suffering injuries to two defenders long before the half-time whistle.\n\nLeft-back is the position where Benitez has no cover for Paul Dummett, so central defender Ciaran Clark had to move there when Dummett suffered a leg injury after only six minutes.\n\nNewcastle were forced to improvise again by the 34th when Chancel Mbemba took over from another centre-half, Florian Lejeune, leaving Newcastle with their third defensive partnership of the afternoon.\n\nLejeune, who already looks the pick of Newcastle's new signings, went down under a challenge from Harry Kane, who was booked.\n\nIt was one of Kane's few contributions to the opening half, but others were equally anonymous as both teams struggled to locate any early-season fluency.\n\n- Danger man -\n\nDwight Gayle sliced an early shot wide from a chance created by Dummett's final involvement, while excellent work down the left by Christian Atsu was wasted when nobody was in front of goal to meet his cross.\n\nChristian Eriksen was the Tottenham danger man in the first 45 minutes, steering a 26th minute shot narrowly wide, then bringing a save from Rob Elliot shortly before the end of the opening half.\n\nThe pattern of the rest of the game was dictated by the dismissal of Shelvey in the 48th minute.\n\nGayle did force Hugo Lloris to finally make a save moments later, but Newcastle's 10 men were largely pinned back in their own half from that point.\n\nKane, needing only one goal to complete a century for Tottenham could have secured it in the 51st minute when he was left in space and hooked a shot that brought a marvellous save from Elliot.\n\nIt was only a matter of time, though, before the 10 men were opened up and Eriksen was the man responsible with a fine pass that Alli slid past the exposed Elliott after 61 minutes.\n\nThe Tottenham pair were also involved in their second goal after 70 minutes when they combined with Kane before Davies nipped in front of Eriksen to finish calmly.\n\nKane, who rarely scores for Tottenham in the month of August, was inches away from ending that drought when he struck the post in stoppage time.\n\nHe will have to wait a little longer for that 100th goal for the club.", "time": "15:36:00"}

Dele Alli as Newcastle's return to the Premier League was ruined by Tottenham.\n\nSecond-half goals from Alli and Ben Davies ultimately did for the promoted Magpies with the visitors coasting to a 2-0 victory, but it was Shelvey's 49th-minute dismissal which opened the door after his side had scrapped their way to the break without major incident.\n\nThe 25-year-old saw red to the astonishment of his team-mates and the locals among a crowd of 52,077, although television replays suggested he had stood on Alli's ankle as the Tottenham man lay on the floor.\n\nMeanwhile, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino left Tyneside having seen a satisfactory performance from his men, who were eventually rewarded for their patience.\n\nTom Collomosse assesses the key talking points for Spurs...\n\nIf asked at the start of the month to pick their team for the opening game of the season, how many Tottenham fans would have included Moussa Sissoko?\n\nThe Frenchman appeared to be on his way out of the club, having struggled after his \u00a330million move from Newcastle 12 months ago.\n\nSissoko is also wanted by Turkish club Trabzonspor. Yet after an encouraging display in Tottenham's pre-season friendly against Juventus last weekend, Sissoko was handed a place in the starting XI against his former club.\n\nHe was booed throughout the first half by the home fans as he initially struggled to justify Mauricio Pochettino's decision, either on the left or the right of the attack.\n\nThe loudest jeers were reserved for Sissoko's substitution, in the 58th minute. We could still see him depart by August 31.\n\nSpurs' inactivity in the transfer market has left fans anxious and Pochettino has not hidden his wish for new players to be signed.\n\nThere is no substitute, though, for excellent players who understand each other perfectly.\n\nWith Tottenham looking to press home their advantage after Jonjo Shelvey was sent off, Harry Kane found Christian Eriksen with a short pass on the edge of the penalty area.\n\nQuick as a flash, Dele Alli lost his marker and ran for the far post. Eriksen delivered the perfect cross and Alli finished it with a left-foot volley past Rob Elliot.\n\nThe trio repeated the trick with another wonderful move five minutes later to allow Ben Davies to stroke in the second goal.\n\nDuring Dele Alli's early days at Tottenham, in the 2015-16 season, Pochettino sometimes used him alongside Eric Dier in a deep-lying midfield role.\n\nAlli caught the eye and was always at the centre of the play as he broke up opponents' attacks and helped start them for his own team.\n\nHe earned his first senior England call-up playing in that position. Yet as his Tottenham career has progressed, Alli has moved further and further up the pitch.\n\nThe result is that he may sometimes be on the periphery of the action, but he is absolutely deadly when he is involved: Alli scored the opening goal here and was part of the move that created the second for Davies.\n\nPerhaps unwittingly, the 21-year-old moved the odds in Tottenham's favour even before that, when Shelvey foolishly trod on his ankle and was sent off.\n\nIt has been a mixed weekend for the defences of the top six teams. Arsenal began the Premier League season by letting in three goals against Leicester, Liverpool then drew 3-3 at Watford and Chelsea were beaten 3-2 at home by Burnley.\n\nLike Manchester City, who won 2-0 at Brighton, Tottenham looked more sure-footed at the back than their rivals.\n\nTheir miserly defending was one of the key features of the 2015-16 and 2016-17 campaigns, and they have started with a clean sheet here.\n\nOn his Premier League debut, Kyle Walker-Peters was occasionally exposed by the pace of Christian Atsu but did enough to suggest he can have a role as a squad player this season.", "time": "14:29:00"}

The 48th-minute incident took place right in front of the referee, at a time when Newcastle was looking comfortable against one of the favorites for the title.\n\nTottenham immediately took charge of the match and Alli slid in at the far post to steer in a cross from Christian Eriksen in the 61st minute.\n\nNine minutes later, Eriksen ran into the area but was beaten to the ball by Davies, who tucked a close-range finish under goalkeeper Rob Elliot. Harry Kane struck the post in injury time as Newcastle fell apart late on.\n\nSpurs started off slowly but looked assured and dangerous going forward after Shelvey's game-turning dismissal. Alli opened his scoring account in his first game of the season, building on his career-high 18 goals from last season.\n\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has come under pressure to add some new players to a squad that finished second to Chelsea last season and has lost right back Kyle Walker, who moved to Manchester City.\n\nHis options have improved, though, with young right back Kyle Walker-Peters impressing on his first league start and South Korea forward Heung-min Son making a return to action after sustaining a broken arm in preseason.\n\nNewcastle's cause wasn't helped by losing defenders Paul Dummett and Florian Lejeune -- the 200th French player to feature in a Premier League game -- to injury in the first half.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The Dane was the architect once again when he set up Davies as Spurs doubled their advantage minutes later.\n\nNewcastle lost Paul Dummett and debutant Florian Lejeune to injury on a miserable return to the top flight, and it could have got worse when Harry Kane struck the post in the dying stages.\n\nRafa Benitez's side will aim to bounce back when they visit Huddersfield next Sunday, while Tottenham host title rivals Chelsea on the same day.\n\nJonjo Shelvey's red card: Newcastle had been fairly comfortable until their captain was sent off for the most needless and ridiculous action. At 25 years old, the midfielder should know better and he's let his team-mates and club down.\n\nChristian Eriksen (Tottenham): Young Kyle Walker-Peters - replacing namesake Kyle Walker at full-back, with Kieran Trippier out injured - deserves a mention for an impressive debut, but you can't look past the influence Eriksen had on the match.

It goes through the legs of Lascelles, but wide of the bottom corner. That's as close as Spurs have come thus far.\n\n33' - INJURY: Florian Lejeune appears to have hurt his ankle - and will be forced off. He's replaced by Chancel Mbemba.\n\n48' - RED CARD! Shelvey is shown a straight red for a foul on Alli! He appears to stand on his ankle, right in front of Andre Marriner. It was the RIGHT decision and totally senseless\n\n61' - GOAL!

The England international is picked out wonderfully by Eriksen and he slides home to give his side a well-deserved lead.\n\n70' - GOAL! A lovely team move involving Alli and Kane is almost finished by Eriksen, but Davies nips in to steal the goal from the Dane! Spurs are cruising to victory.\n\n83' - CLOSE! The unmarked Hayden nods a ball to the back post, but Atsu can only find the side netting. It was a chance for Newcastle.\n\n90'+ 2 - KANE HITS THE POST! The Spurs frontman times his run to perfection to meet Son's pass, but he's denied by the woodwork.", "time": "12:56:00"}

Tottenham to a 2-0 victory at Newcastle on Sunday after the England midfielder was involved in the crucial dismissal of Magpies midfielder Jonjo Shelvey.\n\nShelvey was shown a second half red card for deliberately treading on Alli, who was on the ground only yards from referee Andre Marriner.\n\nTottenham capitalised by scoring through Alli and then Ben Davies to open their Premier League campaign with a comfortable three points at St James' Park.\n\nAfter finishing second last season, Tottenham will hope their winning start bodes well for a sustained title challenge.\n\nIt added up to a frustrating return to the Premier League for promoted Newcastle, who had competed well until Shelvey's needless dismissal.\n\nUntil the red card, this encounter between two teams whose supporters have been critical of their lack of transfer investment was in danger of meandering towards a goalless stalemate.\n\nNewcastle's net spend has been less than \u00a320 million ($25 million, 21 million euros), while Tottenham opted not to make even one new signing, choices which appeared ill-judged for long periods here.\n\nIf future decisions are based on analysis of this game, the two managers will surely move in the market to strengthen their squad before the end of the transfer deadline.\n\nMauricio Pochettino will know Tottenham lacked imagination before the red card, while Newcastle's Rafa Benitez will be particularly anxious to recruit reinforcements after suffering injuries to two defenders long before the half-time whistle.\n\nLeft-back is the position where Benitez has no cover for Paul Dummett, so central defender Ciaran Clark had to move there when Dummett suffered a leg injury after only six minutes.\n\nNewcastle were forced to improvise again by the 34th when Chancel Mbemba took over from another centre-half, Florian Lejeune, leaving Newcastle with their third defensive partnership of the afternoon.\n\nLejeune, who already looks the pick of Newcastle's new signings, went down under a challenge from Harry Kane, who was booked.\n\nIt was one of Kane's few contributions to the opening half, but others were equally anonymous as both teams struggled to locate any early-season fluency.\n\n- Danger man -\n\nDwight Gayle sliced an early shot wide from a chance created by Dummett's final involvement, while excellent work down the left by Christian Atsu was wasted when nobody was in front of goal to meet his cross.\n\nChristian Eriksen was the Tottenham danger man in the first 45 minutes, steering a 26th minute shot narrowly wide, then bringing a save from Rob Elliot shortly before the end of the opening half.\n\nThe pattern of the rest of the game was dictated by the dismissal of Shelvey in the 48th minute.\n\nGayle did force Hugo Lloris to finally make a save moments later, but Newcastle's 10 men were largely pinned back in their own half from that point.\n\nKane, needing only one goal to complete a century for Tottenham could have secured it in the 51st minute when he was left in space and hooked a shot that brought a marvellous save from Elliot.\n\nIt was only a matter of time, though, before the 10 men were opened up and Eriksen was the man responsible with a fine pass that Alli slid past the exposed Elliott after 61 minutes.\n\nThe Tottenham pair were also involved in their second goal after 70 minutes when they combined with Kane before Davies nipped in front of Eriksen to finish calmly.\n\nKane, who rarely scores for Tottenham in the month of August, was inches away from ending that drought when he struck

floor.\n\nHis impending suspension and injuries to defenders Paul Dummett and Florian Lejeune made it a bad afternoon for manager Rafael Benitez and watching owner Mike Ashley.\n\nIn contrast, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino left Tyneside having seen a satisfactory performance from his men, who were eventually rewarded for their patience.\n\nBenitez had admitted in the run-up to the game that his

left-foot shot wide of the target.\n\nHowever, chances proved few and far between for the home side with only winger Christian Atsu causing the visitors sporadic problems, and it was Eriksen who looked the most likely to break the deadlock.\n\nThe Dane shot across the face of goal with 27 minutes gone after Spurs had broken from a Newcastle corner, and he tested goalkeeper Rob Elliot with a dipping volley four minutes before the break.\n\nBut the game was to take a nasty twist for Newcastle within minutes of the restart when, after referee Andre Marriner had blown for a foul by Alli, Shelvey appeared to stand on the prone player's ankle as he walked by, prompting the official to show a straight red card.\n\nGayle forced a near-post save from Hugo Lloris in the immediate aftermath,

nine minutes later when Eriksen picked out Alli's run into the box and the England midfielder guided the ball home.\n\nNewcastle's hopes of a comeback were dashed with 20 minutes remaining when the ball broke to full-back Davies inside the penalty area and he slotted past the advancing Elliot, while Kane hit a post in stoppage time to spare them further punishment.", "time": "15:55:00"}

target as Jonjo Shelvey sees red By Kate Burlaga\n\nLast Updated: 13/08/17 3:44pm\n\nTottenham opened their Premier League campaign with a 2-0 win at Newcastle as the Magpies' top-flight return was sullied by Jonjo Shelvey's red card.\n\nRafa Benitez's side had delivered a disciplined first-half display until Shelvey lost his soon after the restart, treading on Dele Alli's ankle in front of the referee to leave a side that had already lost two players to injuries facing an even sterner task.\n\nAlli made Shelvey's team-mates pay, meeting a Christian Eriksen cross at the back post in the 61st minute, and Ben Davies slotted a second soon after (70) as last year's runners-up shrugged off scrutiny of their transfer business to start with three points on the first Nissan Super Sunday of the season.\n\nTeam news\n\nDefenders Javier Manquillo and Florian Lejeune made their Newcastle debuts, while Dwight Gayle was passed fit after a recent hamstring injury.Kieran Trippier's injury meant a Tottenham start for Kyle Walker-Peters, while Moussa Sissoko got the nod from the off.\n\nNewcastle had started brightly in the Tyneside sunshine, old boy Moussa Sissoko enthusiastically booed, but Dwight Gayle caught an early half-volley with shin rather than boot and saw a penalty appeal rendered academic by an offside flag.\n\nPaul Dummett had hobbled off with a hamstring injury just eight minutes in and Benitez was forced into a further defensive reshuffle when Harry Kane scythed down debutant Florian Lejeune, Chancel Mbemba sent on in his place.\n\nEriksen watched a snapshot spin wide of the post and saw a curling effort comfortably claimed but an organised Newcastle side largely nullified Spurs' threat and carried their own on the counter, Christian Atsu a regular source of spark down the left.\n\nBenitez would have been buoyed at the break but he was fuming just two minutes after the restart when Shelvey was shown a straight red, treading witlessly on Alli's ankle in front of the referee after the Spurs player had provocatively prodded the ball from his grasp.\n\nThe game lurched into life, Kane scenting his 100th Tottenham goal only to be denied by Rob Elliot at point-blank range, but, to the chagrin of St James' Park, it was Alli who made the breakthrough, meeting Eriksen's clipped ball on the stretch at the far post.\n\nSpurs were now in control and Alli was involved in a neat second just nine minutes later, his flick eventually falling to Davies to slot into the far corner.\n\nMauricio Pochettino's side might have had a third but Kane, set free by Heung-min Son's through-ball, clattered a post, his wait for a Spurs milestone - and a first Premier League goal in August - stretching on.", "time": "14:46:00"}

Sportsmail kept its eyes and ears open to bring you the things you missed...\n\nTottenham Hotspur got their Premier League season off to a smooth start with a 2-0 away win\n\nSissoko not popular on Tyneside\n\nMoussa Sissoko left Newcastle for Tottenham last summer in a \u00a330million move, and after being surprisingly named in the Spurs starting line-up, did not get a welcome reception.\n\nThe French midfielder was reportedly booed as he got off the team coach, and some Newcastle fans even joked on Twitter of offering their players money to go in with a rough tackle.\n\nSpurs fans were also keen to have their say - some speculating as to the reasons why the under-performing signing was involved, although others wondering how he would react if he scored. Eventually, Sissoko had a quiet game and was subbed off before the hour mark.\n\nTottenham Hotspur fans were keenly anticipating Moussa Sissoko lining up against his old club\n\nNewcastle United fans meanwhile were not giving the Frenchman a welcome return up north\n\nSpurs fans pondered the reason behind Sissoko's inclusion - before he was substituted off\n\nSpurs' bizarre training kit\n\nNew season, new kit - but while Spurs' new home and away strips have been well received, their training gear has gone under the radar.\n\nWhat exactly is the pattern? Egg shapes? '70s wallpaper tribute? Out of tune TV? You have to wonder what the thinking was.\n\nPerhaps the idea behind the triple blue shaded T-shirts was to make the opposition nauseous before the game.\n\nSpurs modelled their new training kit before the game - a bizarre pattern of various blues\n\nThe pattern could be variously described as being 70s wallpaper, or an un-tuned television\n\nKyle Walker out... Kyle Walker in... Kyle Walker MOTM\n\nAfter selling Kyle Walker to Manchester City this summer, Mauricio Pochettino had a back-up plan - with a very similar name.\n\nKyle Walker-Peters made his Premier League debut at St James' Park, much to the delight of the fans and wags on Twitter.\n\nMaybe Walker-Peters is in the Spurs first team because he is one of the most promising young English defenders. Maybe it is nominative determinism. The fact he was named man of the match provides the answer.\n\nKyle Walker-Peters made his Premier League debut at St James' Park, replacing Kyle Walker\n\nThe similarity of names brought plenty of humour to the wags and supporters on Twitter\n\nMaybe Walker-Peters is in the Spurs first team on merit. Maybe it is nominative determinism.\n\nKev is still King\n\nIf you get on the right side of the Newcastle fans - and your name isn't Sissoko - then you could become a hero for years to come.\n\nThe Gallowgate End of St James' Park was awash with banners for their return to the Premier League, a monochrome, Geordie wall.\n\nHowever there was one familiar, permed, cartoon face among them, a Yorkshireman yet an honorary Magpie - Kevin Keegan is still a United hero.\n\nThe Gallowgate End of St James' Park was awash with banners for their Premier League return\n\nHowever there was one familiar, permed, cartoon face, of honorary Geordie Kevin Keegan\n\nVive La Toon\n\nNewcastle have featured some superb French talent throughout the years - Hatem Ben Arfa, Yohan Cabaye - and some more less stellar figures - Sebastian Guivar'ch, Jean-Alain Boumsong, Florian Thauvin, Sylvain Marveaux...\n\nIn fact, more Frenchmen have played for Newcastle - Florian Lejeune became No 27, as well as the 200th player to cross the channel in the Premier League era.\n\nIt didn't end well, however, as he was subbed off in the first half after suffering an injury. Sacre bleu.\n\nUnfortunately Florian Lejeune's Premier League bow ended through injury in the first half\n\nDele back in action\n\nDele Alli is arguably Europe's most exciting young footballer not only because of his prodigious skill, but also because of his spikiness.\n\nMidway through the opening half of action this season, he reacted to a foul by Jamaal Lascelles, getting up and chest barging the defender.\n\nThe pair exchanged words until Jonjo Shelvey intervened - and Dele exchanged words with him instead.\n\nNo surprise then that it was Dele who Jonjo stood on at the start of the second half to earn his red card. Or indeed that Dele scored the opener on the hour.\n\nSpurs have never lost a Premier League game in which Alli has scored - 25 matches, 20 wins, five draws.\n\nDele Alli was at the centre of the action immediately after being caught by Jamaal Lascelles\n\nAlli later was stood on by Jonjo Shelvey for his red card, then scored the opening goal\n\nKane's August drought goes on\n\nHarry Kane is not a one-season - or even two-season - wonder as many thought, but he still cannot score in the summer.\n\nThe England striker hit the post and had a goal disallowed in second half stoppage time, meaning he is still yet to score a Premier League goal in August.\n\nThis is a run stretching back to 10 games now. Don't worry though Spurs fans - he hits his stride when the leaves turn brown.\n\nHarry Kane is still yet to score a Premier League goal in August after drawing a blank here", "time": "14:31:00"}

were runners-up to an imperious Chelsea side last season but finished the campaign strongly, winning 12 and losing one of their final 13 league games.\n\nIt could therefore be argued that the adage 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' suits Spurs. Alli and Christian Eriksen combined to score or assist 48 goals for Tottenham in 2016-17 and it was little surprise both were involved in the opener, Eriksen setting up his team-mate to finish at the back post.\n\nPochettino also boasts an excellent record of promoting players from the club's academy at the correct time. Walker's place at right-back was filled by 20-year-old youth product Kyle Walker-Peters, a World Cup winner with England Under-20s over the summer, and the youngster put in a man-of-the-match display with some strong runs and crosses.\n\nShelvey sending off the turning point\n\nNewcastle, while lacking bite, were good value for a point until Shelvey's sending off.\n\nThe 25-year-old, who was banned for five games last season after being found guilty of making racist comments towards Wolves midfielder Romain Saiss, stood on Alli's ankle in the 49th minute. Just 12 minutes later Spurs took the lead.\n\nShelvey's dismissal means Newcastle will now be without the influential midfielder for their next three games - against Huddersfield and West Ham in the Premier League and Nottingham Forest in the EFL Cup.\n\nNewcastle midfielder Christian Atsu revealed after the game that Shelvey had apologised to his team-mates.\n\n\"That's football. Mistakes do happen,\" Atsu told Sky Sports. \"He'll learn from his mistakes.\n\n\"He's upset with himself. He thinks he let the team down. We are really behind him. We believe he will come back stronger. He apologised to everyone.\"\n\nAlli, meanwhile, said \"there was no need\" for Shelvey to react as he did.\n\n\"I'm sure he'll be disappointed,\" said the Tottenham attacker. \"It was important we stayed professional. I don't want to talk about it too much.\n\n\"I've had a few talks with the gaffer in the past [about his temperament]. I've been pulled up for my temper before but today we had to keep our cool. There was no need to react today.\"\n\nToon troubles highlight the need to strengthen\n\nOf the three teams promoted to the Premier League - Newcastle, Brighton and Huddersfield - Rafael Benitez's side are the ones who have been backed by many as the most likely to flourish.\n\nHowever, Benitez has been frustrated in his efforts to build a squad capable of doing just that.\n\nNewcastle brought in five players over the summer, defenders Florian Lejeune and Javier Manquillo and midfielders Mikel Merino, Atsu and Jacob Murphy, but the club missed out on some of Benitez's targets.\n\nSunday's match highlighted their need to strengthen in one area in particular - attack. The last time Newcastle hosted Tottenham, in May last year, the Magpies ran out 5-1 winners but there was never any danger of a repeat of that scoreline.\n\nThe hosts managed just one shot on target in more than an hour before finishing with a flourish but by then Tottenham were 2-0 up and had slowed down the tempo of their own attacks.\n\nShevley's dismissal, coupled with the first-half departure of defenders Paul Dummett and Lejeune to injury, will only strengthen Benitez's desire to add to his squad before the end of the month.", "time": "15:48:00"}

for standing on Dele Alli as Newcastle's return to the Premier League was ruined by Tottenham.\n\nSecond-half goals from Alli and Ben Davies ultimately did for the promoted Magpies with the visitors coasting to a 2-0 victory, but it was Shelvey's 49th-minute dismissal which opened the door after his side had scrapped their way to the break without major incident.\n\nThe 25-year-old, who was banned for five games last season after being accused of making racist comments towards Wolves midfielder Romain Saiss, saw red to the astonishment of his team-mates and the locals among a crowd of 52,077, although television replays suggested he had stood on Alli's ankle as the Tottenham man lay on the floor.\n\nHis impending suspension and injuries to defenders Paul Dummett and Florian Lejeune made it a bad afternoon for manager Rafael Benitez and watching owner Mike Ashley.\n\nIn contrast, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino left Tyneside having seen a satisfactory performance from his men, who were eventually rewarded for their patience.\n\nBenitez had admitted in the run-up to the game that his players would have to battle for their lives throughout the entire campaign, and they did just that before Shelvey's premature exit.\n\nWith the hosts sitting deep and attempting to maintain their shape, Spurs dominated possession as Christian Eriksen, seemingly in perpetual motion, orchestrated proceedings with the help of Mousa Dembele, Alli and pantomime villain Moussa Sissoko, who was booed at every touch on his return to St James' Park.\n\nIt was the Magpies who created the first opening when last season's top scorer Dwight Gayle ran on to Dummett's ball over the top, only to shank his left-foot shot wide of the target.\n\nHowever, chances proved few and far between for the home side with only winger Christian Atsu causing the visitors sporadic problems, and it was Eriksen who looked the most likely to break the deadlock.\n\nThe Dane shot across the face of goal with 27 minutes gone after Spurs had broken from a Newcastle corner, and he tested goalkeeper Rob Elliot with a dipping volley four minutes before the break.\n\nBut the game was to take a nasty twist for Newcastle within minutes of the restart when, after referee Andre Marriner had blown for a foul by Alli, Shelvey appeared to stand on the prone player's ankle as he walked by, prompting the official to show a straight red card.\n\nGayle forced a near-post save from Hugo Lloris in the immediate aftermath, but opposite number Elliot had to make a fine 52nd-minute block to deny Harry Kane the opening goal.\n\nHowever, there was nothing the Republic of Ireland international could do to keep his side level nine minutes later when Eriksen picked out Alli's run into the box and the England midfielder guided the ball home.\n\nNewcastle's hopes of a comeback were dashed with 20 minutes remaining when the ball broke to full-back Davies inside the penalty area and he slotted past the advancing Elliot, while Kane hit a post in stoppage time to spare them further punishment.", "time": "15:21:00"}

England midfielder was involved in the crucial dismissal of Magpies midfielder Jonjo Shelvey.\n\nShelvey was shown a second half red card for deliberately treading on Alli, who was on the ground only yards from referee Andre Marriner.\n\nTottenham capitalised by scoring through Alli and then Ben Davies to open their Premier League campaign with a comfortable three points at St James' Park.\n\nAfter finishing second last season, Tottenham will hope their winning start bodes well for a sustained title challenge.\n\nIt added up to a frustrating return to the Premier League for promoted Newcastle, who had competed well until Shelvey's needless dismissal.\n\nUntil the red card, this encounter between two teams whose supporters have been critical of their lack of transfer investment was in danger of meandering towards a goalless stalemate.\n\nNewcastle's net spend has been less than 20 million, while Tottenham opted not to make even one new signing, choices which appeared ill-judged for long periods here.\n\nIf future decisions are based on analysis of this game, the two managers will surely move in the market to strengthen their squad before the end of the transfer deadline.\n\nMauricio Pochettino will know Tottenham lacked imagination before the red card, while Newcastle's Rafa Benitez will be particularly anxious to recruit reinforcements after suffering injuries to two defenders long before the half-time whistle.\n\nLeft-back is the position where Benitez has no cover for Paul Dummett, so central defender Ciaran Clark had to move there when Dummett suffered a leg injury after only six minutes.\n\nNewcastle were forced to improvise again by the 34th when Chancel Mbemba took over from another centre-half, Florian Lejeune, leaving Newcastle with their third defensive partnership of the afternoon.\n\nLejeune, who already looks the pick of Newcastle's new signings, went down under a challenge from Harry Kane, who was booked.\n\nIt was one of Kane's few contributions to the opening half, but others were equally anonymous as both teams struggled to locate any early-season fluency.\n\nDwight Gayle sliced an early shot wide from a chance created by Dummett's final involvement, while excellent work down the left by Christian Atsu was wasted when nobody was in front of goal to meet his cross.\n\nChristian Eriksen was the Tottenham danger man in the first 45 minutes, steering a 26th minute shot narrowly wide, then bringing a save from Rob Elliot shortly before the end of the opening half.\n\nThe pattern of the rest of the game was dictated by the dismissal of Shelvey in the 48th minute.\n\nGayle did force Hugo Lloris to finally make a save moments later, but Newcastle's 10 men were largely pinned back in their own half from that point.\n\nKane, needing only one goal to complete a century for Tottenham could have secured it in the 51st minute when he was left in space and hooked a shot that brought a marvellous save from Elliot.\n\nIt was only a matter of time, though, before the 10 men were opened up and Eriksen was the man responsible with a fine pass that Alli slid past the exposed Elliott after 61 minutes.\n\nThe Tottenham pair were also involved in their second goal after 70 minutes when they combined with Kane before Davies nipped in front of Eriksen to finish calmly.\n\nKane, who rarely scores for Tottenham in the month of August, was inches away from ending that drought when he struck the post in stoppage time.\n\nHe will have to wait a little longer for that 100th goal for the club.", "time":

difficult return to the top flight.\n\nThe Magpies, promoted as winners of the Championship last term, had captain Jonjo Shelvey sent off early in the second half for standing on Dele Alli.\n\nThe Spurs attacker then put his side ahead with a close-range finish before Ben Davies finished off a neat move for Tottenham's second.\n\nIt was a harsh re-introduction to life back in the Premier League for Newcastle, who were relegated from the division at the end of the 2015-16 season.\n\nRafael Benitez's side did not really threaten Hugo Lloris in the Tottenham goal until late on, Christian Atsu forcing the goalkeeper into a low save and Ciaran Clark going close with a volley from 12 yards.\n\nInstead, Spurs could have added to their lead as Harry Kane, last season's Premier League top scorer with 29 goals, struck the post in injury time.\n\nTottenham are the only Premier League side yet to make any signings this summer and the lack of transfer activity has frustrated some fans, especially after the sale of right-back Kyle Walker to Manchester City for \u00a345m.\n\nMauricio Pochettino's team were runners-up to an imperious Chelsea side last season but finished the campaign strongly, winning 12 and losing one of their final 13 league games.\n\nIt could therefore be argued that the adage 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' suits Spurs. Alli and Christian Eriksen combined to score or assist 48 goals for Tottenham in 2016-17 and it was little surprise both were involved in the opener, Eriksen setting up his team-mate to finish at the back post.\n\nPochettino also boasts an excellent record of promoting players from the club's academy at the correct time. Walker's place at right-back was filled by 20-year-old youth product Kyle Walker-Peters, a World Cup winner with England Under-20s over the summer, and the youngster put in a man-of-the-match display with some strong runs and crosses.\n\nShelvey sending off the turning point\n\nNewcastle, while lacking bite, were good value for a point until Shelvey's sending off.\n\nThe 25-year-old, who was banned for five games last season after being found guilty of making racist comments towards Wolves midfielder Romain Saiss, stood on Alli's ankle in the 49th minute. Just 12 minutes later Spurs took the lead.\n\nShelvey's dismissal means Newcastle will now be without the influential midfielder for their next three games - against Huddersfield and West Ham in the Premier League and Nottingham Forest in the EFL Cup.\n\nNewcastle midfielder Christian Atsu revealed after the game that Shelvey had apologised to his team-mates.\n\n\"That's football. Mistakes do happen,\" Atsu told Sky Sports. \"He'll learn from his mistakes.\n\n\"He's upset with himself. He thinks he let the team down. We are really behind him. We believe he will come back stronger. He apologised to everyone.\"\n\nAlli, meanwhile, said \"there was no need\" for Shelvey to react as he did.\n\n\"I'm sure he'll be disappointed,\" said the Tottenham attacker. \"It was important we stayed professional. I don't want to talk about it too much.\n\n\"I've had a few talks with the gaffer in the past [about his temperament]. I've been pulled up for my temper before but today we had to keep our cool. There was no need to react today.\"\n\nToon troubles highlight the need to strengthen\n\nOf the three teams promoted to the Premier League - Newcastle, Brighton and Huddersfield - Rafael Benitez's side are the ones who have been backed by many as the most likely to flourish.\n\nHowever, Benitez has been frustrated in his efforts to build a squad capable of doing just that.\n\nNewcastle brought in five players over the summer, defenders Florian Lejeune and Javier Manquillo and midfielders Mikel Merino, Atsu and Jacob Murphy, but the club missed out on some of Benitez's targets.\n\nSunday's match highlighted their need to strengthen in one area in particular - attack. The last time Newcastle hosted Tottenham, in May last year, the Magpies ran out 5-1 winners but there was never any danger of a repeat of that scoreline.\n\nThe hosts managed just one shot on target in more than an hour before finishing with a flourish but by then Tottenham were 2-0 up and had slowed down the tempo of their own attacks.\n\nShevley's dismissal, coupled with the first-half departure of defenders Paul Dummett and Lejeune to injury, will only strengthen Benitez's desire to add to his squad before the end of the month.", "time": "15:37:00"}

Tottenham opened their Premier League campaign with a 2-0 win over 10-man Newcastle United at St James' Park.\n\nNewcastle kept Tottenham, who finished runners-up last term, at arm's length during a lacklustre first half, but Shelvey trod on Alli's ankle three minutes into the second period and was shown a straight red card by referee Andre Marriner.\n\nRafael Benitez's side, who had already lost Paul Dummett and debutant Florian Lejeune to injury, were unable to contain Spurs thereafter, with Alli making the breakthrough when he stretched to volley Christian Eriksen's exquisite delivery into the back of the net.\n\nDavies added Tottenham's second with 20 minutes remaining, finishing a slick move with a composed finish beyond Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot, Eriksen again the provider.\n\nIt will be a pleasing result for Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino, who has fielded difficult questions following Tottenham's absence of movement in the transfer market and the explosive comments from Danny Rose in which the left-back hit out at the way the club has been operating.\n\nHarry Kane, last season's Golden Boot winner, could have added more gloss but struck the post late on and his wait for a Premier League goal in August continues.\n\nBenitez, meanwhile, will be hugely frustrated that Newcastle's return to the top flight was spoiled by Shelvey's peevishness.\n\nDwight Gayle overcame a hamstring injury to lead the Newcastle line and sliced over the crossbar when presented with an opportunity by Dummett, who soon suffered a similar issue and was forced off after just seven minutes - Jamaal Lascelles his replacement.\n\nTottenham controlled possession but Gayle threatened in behind and went down in the box under contact from Kyle Walker-Peters, making his Spurs debut at right back with Kyle Walker sold to Manchester City and Kieran Trippier out with an ankle injury, only to see the flag raised for offside.\n\nSpurs lacked ingenuity and Kane was shown a yellow card for scything down Lejeune in a tackle that brought the Frenchman's outing to an early end.\n\nEriksen worked Rob Elliot four minutes before half-time with a dipping, 25-yard drive the goalkeeper saw all the way and was able to hold.\n\nThere was drama just three minutes after the restart when Shelvey was dismissed for reacting to Alli kicking the ball away while down on the ground by treading on his ankle.\n\nThe game suddenly burst into life, with Gayle forcing Hugo Lloris into a save at his near post, but Newcastle's positive response soon fizzled out.\n\nA deflection off Matt Ritchie saw Eriksen's pass loop up for the unmarked Kane inside the box, but Elliot stayed big and blocked his powerful strike in the 51st minute.\n\nMoussa Sissoko was booed as his return to St James' Park ended with Son Heung-min taking his place before the hour mark, and Tottenham soon made their extra man count.\n\nAlli lost Lascelles inside the box and guided a lovely ball from the right courtesy of Eriksen across Elliot and into the net.\n\nThe England international was involved in Tottenham's second as his flick was guided into the path of Davies by Eriksen, the left-back finishing a slick move with a cool finish.\n\nAlli was booed as he made way for Victor Wanyama in the 82nd minute and Kane was unable to rub salt into Newcastle's wounds when his fierce strike cannoned back off the upright in stoppage time, meaning his August Premier League drought extends to 11 games, but Shelvey's moment of madness had already proved the Magpies' undoing.", "time": "14:50:00"}

Park\n\nSkipper Jonjo Shelvey was sent off for standing on Dele Alli as Newcastle's return to the Premier League was ruined by Tottenham.\n\nSecond-half goals from Alli and Ben Davies ultimately did for the promoted Magpies with the visitors coasting to a 2-0 victory, but it was Shelvey's 49th-minute dismissal which opened the door after his side had scrapped their way to the break without major incident.\n\nThe 25-year-old, who was banned for five games last season after being accused of making racist comments towards Wolves midfielder Romain Saiss, saw red to the astonishment of his team-mates and the locals among a crowd of 52,077, although television replays suggested he had stood on Alli's ankle as the Tottenham man lay on the floor.\n\nHis impending suspension and injuries to defenders Paul Dummett and Florian Lejeune made it a bad afternoon for manager Rafael Benitez and watching owner Mike Ashley.\n\nIn contrast, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino left Tyneside having seen a satisfactory performance from his men, who were eventually rewarded for their patience.\n\nBenitez had admitted in the run-up to the game that his players would have to battle for their lives throughout the entire campaign, and they did just that before Shelvey's premature exit.\n\nWith the hosts sitting deep and attempting to maintain their shape, Spurs dominated possession as Christian Eriksen, seemingly in perpetual motion, orchestrated proceedings with the help of Mousa Dembele, Alli and pantomime villain Moussa Sissoko, who was booed at every touch on his return to St James' Park.\n\nIt was the Magpies who created the first opening when last season's top scorer Dwight Gayle ran on to Dummett's ball over the top, only to shank his left-foot shot wide of the target.\n\nHowever, chances proved few and far between for the home side with only winger Christian Atsu causing the visitors sporadic problems, and it was Eriksen who looked the most likely to break the deadlock.\n\nThe Dane shot across the face of goal with 27 minutes gone after Spurs had broken from a Newcastle corner, and he tested goalkeeper Rob Elliot with a dipping volley four minutes before the break.\n\nBut the game was to take a nasty twist for Newcastle within minutes of the restart when, after referee Andre Marriner had blown for a foul by Alli, Shelvey appeared to stand on the prone player's ankle as he walked by, prompting the official to show a straight red card.\n\nGayle forced a near-post save from Hugo Lloris in the immediate aftermath, but opposite number Elliot had to make a fine 52nd-minute block to deny Harry Kane the opening goal.\n\nHowever, there was nothing the Republic of Ireland international could do to keep his side level nine minutes later when Eriksen picked out Alli's run into the box and the England midfielder guided the ball home.\n\nNewcastle's hopes of a comeback were dashed with 20 minutes remaining when the ball broke to full-back Davies inside the penalty area and he slotted past the advancing Elliot, while Kane hit a post in stoppage time to spare them further punishment.", "time": "15:16:00"}

They stood up to the spirit of a newly-promoted side, who withered and then went, first through injuries, and then because of the most reckless of stamps from Jonjo Shelvey, early at the start of the second half.\n\nNewcastle have not strengthened sufficiently themselves for such eventualities. Their best central defender from last season, Ciaran Clark, spent 82 minutes of the game at left back. The forward Dwight Gayle, who was declared fit on Friday, played 78 minutes. There will be the need for much more of the bravery Rafa Benitez dragged from a side he wanted to be sprinkled with more quality.\n\nOnly towards the first half's close did Spurs begin to add purpose to their possession, but the contest became a mismatch once Shelvey was dismissed.\n\nIt would become the game's defining moment in the 48th minute, and given that the player was handed the captain's armband at the game's start, with Jamaal Lascelles on the Newcastle bench, it was a thoughtless act.\n\nTottenham summer transfer targets 8 show all Tottenham summer transfer targets 1/8 Tottenham summer transfer targets\n\nWhich players could Spurs sign this summer?\n\nGetty\n\n2/8 Joshua King, Bournemouth\n\nNorwegian striker Josh King has had a fine season, scoring 16 goals for a Bournemouth side which hovered precariously above the relegation zone for parts of the season. He played a key role in keeping the Cherries up and, given his performances, has caught the interest of Tottenham. The player admitted in an interview earlier in the season that he is pleased that Spurs have recognised his talents - comments which have added fuel to the fire over a potential \u00a315m move. Pochettino is eager to solve the goalscoring issue his team faces when Harry Kane is injured or rested and King, who also qualifies as home-grown, could be the ideal solution.\n\n3/8 Max Meyer, Schalke\n\nSchalke set the midfielder's price-tag last summer at \u00a345m for interested teams, but having remained at the club, Meyer has stalled over signing a new contract. With his current deal expiring next summer there is a realistic chance he will look to move on, and for a significantly lower fee than originally stated, at around \u00a320m. Tottenham are among those monitoring his situation and could look to bring him in to increase squad depth ahead of another packed season.\n\n4/8 Ben Gibson, Middlesbrough\n\nA similar case to Michael Keane, the 24-year-old centre back is highly rated and won his first England call-up against Lithuania this year. Chelsea, who view him as an ideal replacement for the departing John Terry, seem to be in the driving seat. With Kevin Wimmer looking likely to leave, Tottenham will be in the market for a centre-back and hold interest in Gibson, though Chelsea's eagerness to secure his signature may complicate things.\n\n5/8 Ross Barkley, Everton\n\nThe Everton midfielder has obvious talent but has failed to perform consistently at his club. It is thought a change of scenery to invigorate his career is something the player would consider, and Tottenham are keen to snap him up if the chance arises. Barkley's contract expires next summer and it is believed that Ronald Koeman will look to cash in on the playmaker to avoid losing him for free next season. That is no surprise, especially as he could cost interested clubs \u00a330m.\n\n6/8 Demarai Gray, Leicester City\n\nPochettino's preference to buy players who already possess Premier League experience could see the Leicester winger, 20, become the subject of Tottenham interest this summer. Gray made 72 appearances for Birmingham City, where he came through the ranks, before joining Leicester in 2016 and gained 12 league caps to help the club win the Premier League title. With bags of pace and potential, he has also represented England from U18 to U21 level and is tipped for future success. A fee of \u00a312m could be enough to prise the youngster away from Leicester this summer.\n\n7/8 Ryan Sessegnon, Fulham\n\nThe young left-back has now turned 17 and, as a result, is legally allowed to sign his first professional contract. A host of top clubs have scouted the player, who impressed at Craven Cottage in Fulham's televised FA Cup tie against Tottenham back in February, but the West Londoners are keen to keep hold of him by guaranteeing him first team football. Tottenham have been strongly linked to the youngster in recent days, though, and Fulham can expect a fight to hold onto the defender.\n\n8/8 Wilfried Zaha, Crystal Palace\n\nThe winger recently signed a new five-year contract at Selhurst Park in a move that will surely repel any interested clubs. Nonetheless, football works in mysterious ways and having already made a move for the winger last season, there's no reason Spurs won't come knocking a second time. Having said that, Tottenham would need to be serious in what they offer, as opposed to last summer's \u00a312m bid, if they're to stand any chance of bringing Palace to the trading table.\n\nDele Alli had been floored and then ignored by the referee Andre Marriner as he sought a free-kick, around 10 yards from the edge of the Newcastle penalty area. Shelvey, in his desire to get the ball, grabbed it, and in his frustration, planted his left boot (which looked deliberate in replay) onto the ankle of the Spurs player.\n\nThere was a brief double take as the enormity of the consequence of the mindless act began to sink in (wth Alli holding his foot) and Marriner produced the straight red which ended Newcastle's brave resistance. Two players had already been forced off with injury by then, the left back Paul Dummett in the eighth minute because of a hamstring injury, and then, just past the half hour mark, Florian Lejeune, one of only two debutants on the field, limped off after unforgiving challenge from Harry Kane.\n\nShelvey looked bemused as to why he was sent-off but the stamp was a reckless decision (Getty)\n\nThe physical power of Spurs was a theme throughout, but Benitez did not build this team for this division. They were bigger and quicker and stronger, but then Newcastle do not have \u00a3200m to spend on a player, as the Newcastle owner Mike Ashley said in an interview that was first screened on Friday. He was sat in the stands to watch a team that has had an outlay of less than \u00a320m (net) spent on it since it was promoted as champions. It needs work, and the assumption had been so do Spurs.\n\nThat will remain a theme, and it is difficult to gauge at this stage where their title challenge lies. The front three of Kane, Christian Eriksen and Alli were excellent. Holding them together might be the most important bits of business that Tottenham and Daniel Levy undertake before September begins.\n\nBen Davies struck home the second to finish a flowing move by Spurs (Getty)\n\nThe triumvirate combined with style for the opening goal, in the 61st minute. Kane worked the ball wide to Eriksen, the cross was floated to find Alli and the England midfielder slid in at the far post.\n\nNewcastle, a player short in numbers, on a hot day, were in dire trouble from there and by the 70th minute, they were out of the game. Alli flicked the ball to Kane this time, his first-time pass reached Ben Davies, and the left back steadied himself to coolly slot his finish past Rob Elliot in the Newcastle goal.\n\nRead more Five things we learned from Tottenham's away win over Newcastle\n\nIt was about damage limitation from there. Benitez brought on the holding midfielder Mikel Merino for his only striker, Gayle. Christian Atsu, who had been dangerous in the early stages of the game, struck a side-netting in the 83rd minute and Clark had a shot saved by Hugo Lloris.\n\nKane struck a post in the 91st minute when he looked set to add to the scoreline, and when it finished there was a hug between the friends Mauricio Pochettino and Benitez.

after his red card for a stamp on Tottenham Hotspur's Dele Alli left them with 10 men for almost all the second half in the 2-0 Premier League defeat at St James' Park on Sunday.\n\n\"Jonjo apologised to the team after the game,\" said manager Benitez.\n\nTV replays showed Shelvey deliberately trod on Alli's ankle in full view of referee Andre Marriner after the Tottenham player failed to give him the ball.\n\nThe referee immediately gave the midfielder a straight red card.\n\nShelvey will now serve an automatic three-match ban, missing games against Huddersfield Town, West Ham United and Swansea City as Newcastle seek to re-establish themselves in England's top tier after promotion.\n\nShelvey's moment of madness changed the course of the game with Newcastle still level.\n\nIt appeared even more ill-advised because Newcastle had already lost two players injured in a hectic first half hour. The incident happened in the 48th minute after Alli had been fouled by Isaac Hayden.\n\nShelvey went to get the ball from Alli and, apparently annoyed when the Spurs midfielder knocked it away, stepped on Alli's ankle.\n\nBenitez admitted Shelvey's red card changed the match but said the stamp was not as dangerous as a Harry Kane tackle on Florian Lejeune, for which he was booked.\n\n\"It was difficult from the beginning. We had to adapt things [after injuries]. The red card changed everything. I think we were defending well. We have to improve. We had our chances but we missed them,\" Benitez said.\n\n\"The Harry Kane tackle was worse than this one. It's more dangerous. We lost one player from that. We made a mistake, but I think maybe someone has to analyse these things to see what's more dangerous.\"\n\nAlli did not want to talk about the incident when he was interviewed by Sky TV after the game. \"It was one of those things. He is a great player and I am sure he is going to be disappointed,\" he said.\n\n\"I have been called up a couple of times for my own temper but it is important we kept our cool.\"\n\nThe red card is the third of the 25-year-old Shelvey's controversial career and follows the five-match ban and 100,000 pound ($130,110.00) fine he received last season for racially abusing Wolverhampton Wanderers' Moroccan-born player Romain Saiss.\n\nFive years ago he was also involved in a touchline argument with former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson when he was sent off while playing for Liverpool for a two-footed lunge on Jonny Evans.\n\n($1 = 0.7686 pounds)\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "time": "16:19:00"}

"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/08/13/newcastle-0-tottenham-2-jonjo-shelvey-sees-red-stamp-dele-alli/", "body": "New season, same old Jonjo Shelvey. The Newcastle captain's annual moment of madness arrived early as the notoriously short-fused midfielder received a straight red card for treading on a prone Dele Alli shortly after half-time, paving the way for a comfortable opening-game victory for Mauricio Pochettino's side.\n\nThe hosts had coped comfortably enough with a largely lacklustre Tottenham display up until that pivotal 49th-minute moment of stupidity, but the numerical disparity soon told. Pochettino introduced Son Heung-Min to increase his attacking options, and almost immediately Alli, unmarked at the far post, stretched to volley home a cross from Christian Eriksen just after the hour mark, beyond which point the outcome wasn't in doubt.\n\nThe lack of protest from Shelvey, chosen to lead the side with club captain Jamaal Lascelles on the bench, suggested the former Liverpool and Swansea man knew his fate when, in attempting to pick Alli up as the England midfielder lay on the St James' Park turf after conceding a free-kick, he inexplicably, but very deliberately, trod on his opponent's ankle under the nose of referee Andre Marriner, who was left with little option but to brandish red.\n\nHaving served a five-match suspension last season for racially abusing Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder Romain Saiss, while having another red card against Nottingham Forest rescinded on appeal, Shelvey clearly isn't learning from his mistakes. His departure merely added insult to injury, with Rafa Benitez forced to replace injured defensive duo Paul Dummett and Florian Lejeune before half-time.\n\nThe potential absence of the pair adds further urgency to the Spaniard's on-going efforts to strengthen a squad whose limitations were ruthlessly exploited by a Tottenham side which didn't need to reach anywhere near the heights it often scaled last season en route to a second-place finish, to ensure a comfortable victory.\n\nIn Shelvey's absence, Tottenham took Benitez's tiring troops through almost three-quarters of an hour of chase-ball purgatory. Ben Davies doubled the advantage from close range with 20 minutes remaining, nipping in ahead of Eriksen to thump the ball past Rob Elliot after some eye-catching approach play from Alli and Harry Kane.\n\nChristian Atsu and Ciaran Clark had late half-chances to make for an interesting finale, but the opportunities went begging and Tottenham kept the hosts at arm's length to run down the clock in efficient manner to play out the final few minutes before a rapidly-emptying St James' Park. There was even time for Kane to strike the post with a firm, low drive to narrowly miss out on his 100th goal for the club.\n\nSpurs have been conspicuous by their absence from this summer's transfer market, but for this 90-minute stroll, their failure to strengthen didn't matter. More stern tests await, starting with Chelsea next weekend, but for the time being, Shelvey ensured they slipped easily back into the winning groove in a chastening re-introduction to the top flight for those clad in black and white.\n\n3:23PM Time on ball (at full time) 3:23PM Average touch positions (full time) 3:23PM FULL TIME\n\nSpurs off to a winning start! Jonjo Shelvey is the villain of the piece, Dele Alli the star.\n\n3:21PM 90 mins +2\n\nKANE HITS THE POST! Fantasy Football fans wince around the world. Kane is threaded through after a wonderful flowing Spurs attack but his low shot across the keeper smacks back off the post.\n\nSky Sports have given MOTM to Walker-Peters, even though it's really been Dele Alli. The youngster has impressed in that right back role, to be fair.\n\n3:18PM 90 mins\n\nSpurs are now passing the ball around the pitch, happy to just keep possession and see out the rest of the game. Wanyama puts the ball out for play by accident and that means Dembele comes off for Harry Winks. Who needs transfer signings when you have academy graduates, eh?\n\n3:16PM 88 mins\n\nThe cross comes in... it's headed but drops to Clark just inside the area! This is a huge chance!!! And he's not put enough on the shot. He lifts the volley into Lloris' grasp - had he put his foot through that it would have flown into the back of the net. Newcastle showing real desire to get a goal back from this one.\n\n3:15PM 87 mins\n\nNewcastle have turned on the attacking style! They actually look dangerous at the moment and are playing really clever passes into the channels for runners to chase, throwing everyone forward. Mbemba gets into a right wing position to join in.\n\nDavies is booked for chopping down a player on the touchline and Newcastle have a decent free-kick opportunity. Ritchie is good at sending these into the box.\n\n3:13PM 85 mins\n\nAtsu hits the side netting! Newcastle haven't given up here. Walker-Peters does really well to get across and narrow the angle of Atsu' shot.\n\n3:11PM 83 mins\n\nAtsu runs at the defence, turns them and has people chasing him to the box... and shoots low at goal. Lloris can save easily but that was excellent from the Newcastle man. He's been their best player by far today.\n\nWanyama is about to come on for Dele Alli, presumably to protect him from being kicked in these final minutes. He doesn't look particularly happy about it either.\n\n3:08PM 80 mins\n\nNewcastle have still only had two shots on goal.\n\n3:07PM 79 mins\n\nOocha! Spurs work the ball around the final third looking for an opening and the ball drops for Dier on teh edge of the box. He tries a bending, powerful Steven Gerrard-esque shot towards the top corner and wins a corner. Elliot catches that.\n\nSpurs pressing high to stop Newcastle passing out from the back - something they do actually seem to be pretty good at. It's just lacking in attack for Benitez's team.\n\n3:05PM Time on ball (60 - 75 min) 3:05PM 76 mins\n\nGayle off, Merino on. Gayle must be knackered.\n\n3:02PM 74 mins\n\nSpurs are totally in control now. Newcastle will do well to end it at 2-0.\n\n3:00PM GOOOOOOAAAAAL!\n\nSpurs have doubled their lead, and it's Ben Davies with the goal to make it 0-2.\n\nThis is another brilliant, fast-passing move. Players swap positions, move into space and link play quickly - Newcastle can't deal with it and Spurs have a deserved second.\n\n2:59PM 70 mins\n\nPerez chips a long pass to Gayle, who runs into space and takes on Walker-Peters on the left wing, decides against trying to beat him for pace and waits for teammates to arrive. They do, Hayden crosses from the right... and it's a goal kick.\n\n2:55PM 67 mins\n\nAlli gets the ball on the left and walks with it, waiting for the challenge. Manquillo comes in and tackles hard, sending Alli to the floor. He's such a clever wee player and was looking for it. No free-kick this time though.\n\nNewcastle are still doing alright here. With 11 men they were giving Spurs a good game.\n\n2:53PM One-way traffic at St. James' Park\n\nIt's been all Spurs, with the visitors racking up 15 shots so far - Newcastle have managed just two in reply.\n\n2:51PM GOOOOOOOOAAAAAAL!\n\nIt's been coming. Newcastle are defending well but Spurs have that little bit of magic upfront needed to undo all the hard work and Dele Alli has broken the deadlock. Kane to Eriksen, who looks up and curls a superb pass into the box ahead of Alli's run. His finish is neat and doesn't give the goalkeeper a chance.\n\n2:48PM 60 mins\n\nThe other thing to note from that Shelvey incident is that Alli didn't even milk it. You've seen players roll around in pain when they haven't even been touched - Alli had all of Shelvey's weight forced down on his ankle and took a minute to absorb the pain before getting up. He likes a battle.\n\n2:46PM 58 mins\n\nAnother Newcastle player is down hurt now. Perez slides into a challenge on Eriksen to stop him shooting from distance and is clipped by his own teammate. Spurs are closing in on the first goal now, Newcastle being held back in their own half.\n\nElliot goes into an aerial challenge with Sissoko and has come off worse, clutching his upper chest.\n\nSissoko is being taken off for Son. He applauds the crowd who loudly boo him.\n\n2:43PM 55 mins\n\nThat is just pathetic Jonjo Shelvey \u1f621 #NEWTOT -- Alan Shearer (@alanshearer)\n\nAugust 13, 2017\n\nIn amongst all that noise, Kane has missed a massive chance to open the scoring.\n\nThe ball drops to him over the shoulder of the last man, he waits for it to arrive at his feet, swivels his body and swings a volley at goal, but puts it straight at the goalkeeper.\n\n2:40PM 52 mins\n\nSpurs are on the counter-attack, Ritchie goes in hard on Alli and the ref waves play on. That'll definitely be a yellow card. Newcastle are in danger of losing their heads here. They've targeted Alli but he's smarter than the average bear (that's a Yogi bear reference).\n\nRitchie is booked.\n\n2:38PM 49 mins\n\nThat's the stupidest red card I think I've seen. It's up there anyway. He's done it right in front of the referee as well, just as Alli kicks the ball away, to try and wind up Alli. So stupid.\n\n2:38PM Red card! Jonjo Shelvey sent off for Newcastle\n\nReferee Andre Marriner gives Jonjo Shelvey his marching orders.\n\n2:37PM RED CARD\n\nShelvey walks!\n\n2:37PM 49 mins\n\nShelvey should be off. That should be a red card. He's treaded on Alli's ankle on purpose just to annoy him.\n\n2:36PM 48 mins\n\nDavies has the whole of the left wing to run into and Sissoko finds him but the cross is low and cleared by the Newcastle defence. Atsu just can't quite control a chipped pass out to him.\n\n2:34PM KICK-OFF 2\n\nWe're back!\n\n2:23PM The Harry Kane tackle\n\nNow. I predict Spurs fans will be going \"never a yellow card\" and I reckon Graeme Souness will say that it wasn't even a foul. However, having watched that tackle back a few times... if it had happened right in front of the referee I wouldn't have been shocked to see red. In the same way that Gary Cahill flew into a challenge yesterday and was way too aggressive in his attempt to win the ball, Kane's was dangerous.\n\nYes, it's a \"contact sport\" and whatever other outdated things people want to say about it. But if you were playing Sunday League football and someone came charging in from behind and launched into a scissor kick tackle, trapping your standing leg and going through you to win the ball, do you think you'd be happy about it?\n\nI don't think there was anything malicious in Kane's attempt to win the ball but he definitely went in with a little too much aggression there and may have caused damage to Lejeune, who had to be substituted. Without wanting to jump to big statements, can you imagine him getting away with a yellow for that in La Liga? Or the Champions League? In the Premier League it's a yellow most days of the week and a red when the referee's looking for it.\n\n2:19PM Time on ball (first half) 2:19PM Newcastle looking toothless in attack\n\nNewcastle managed just a single shot in the opening 45 minutes.\n\n2:18PM HALF TIME\n\nThat was a lovely half of football! Two teams who can actually defend... they do not belong in the world of the Premier League.\n\n2:18PM Average touch positions (half time) 2:18PM 45 mins +2\n\nJust for a few seconds it looks like Newcastle have a real chance to counter-attack but the ball is taken too wide and Lloris is able to catch the cross that comes in.\n\nNewcastle have still only had one shot on goal.\n\n2:15PM 45 mins\n\nPerez controls a difficult bouncing ball, flicks it forward and takes on three players at once. Unsurprisingly he doesn't manage to do it and Spurs win possession, before giving it away rather quickly. They've not quite been at it today and need more urgency and drive about their play to cause this defence problems. Benitez has Newcastle really well organisd at the back.\n\nEriksen shoots from 30 yards, Elliot saves easily.\n\n2:13PM 43 mins\n\nAtsu has been superb on the left today. Dembele is doubling up with Walker-Peters to support on that flank, with the Newcastle winger going through some tricks to nip past defenders.\n\n2:10PM 40 mins\n\nThe game has slowed down a bit now. Newcastle taking their time over throw-ins and the like, probably looking forward to getting in at half-time at 0-0. Will they get there? Spurs are going on an adventure, Eriksen is popping up everywhere at the moment.\n\n2:07PM 37 mins\n\nThis hasn't been an ideal half for Newcastle substitutions. Benitez has lost two first choice defenders to injury - both could potentially be medium term, especially if Lejeune has tweaked something in his ankle - and the wide players are having to work hard to counter-attack. This might be the kind of game Spurs win late on when Newcastle tire.\n\n2:04PM 34 mins\n\nHarry Kane discovering that the good, old Welcome to the Premier League tackle has now been outlawed. Sad times. -- Adam Hurrey (@FootballCliches)\n\nAugust 13, 2017\n\nI don't understand why more isn't being made of that Kane tackle. It was awful.\n\nAnd Mbemba has to come on now to replace Lejeune.\n\n2:01PM 32 mins\n\nHayden can't control a ball thrown to him by Clark but he gets lucky and Newcastle keep the ball in the final third. Clark tries to dribble round his man, Perez tries some skill, Spurs counter. Kane goes in hard from behind on Lejeune.\n\nHow on earth Kane can claim that wasn't a booking is beyond me. Footballers are such odd creatures. He flew into a slide tackle from behind and might have really hurt the Newcastle defender here.\n\n2:00PM Time on ball (15 - 30 min) 1:59PM 29 mins\n\nThe corner goes short and Clark chips into the area but does it terribly and Lloris can just catch it in the air. Spurs sprint forward on the counter-attack and have men over but Newcastle block the space. Eriksen forces a shot through Lascelle's legs but it bends outwards and fizzes wide of the far post.\n\nAtsu absolutely rockets down the left wing - where is Walker-Peters? - and pulls a low ball into the box. Dembele keeps having to cover for the young right-back and had a Newcastle striker been in the area, that was a certain goal.\n\n1:55PM Spurs are dominating the ball so far\n\nSpurs are making the hosts do the chasing - they've had 218 touches of the ball compared to just 128 for Newcastle.\n\n1:55PM 26 mins\n\nNewcastle are really trying to stretch the pitch and prevent Spurs being too narrow and denying space, but Spurs are also attacking through the middle of the pitch, which is why their team shape looks like that. Walker-Peters has done pretty well so far although he's caught out of position as Atsu wins a corner on the left wing.\n\n1:53PM 24 mins\n\nEriksen curls a free-kick into the box but the header that follows ends up in Elliot's hands. Spurs are growing into this game. Dele Alli doesn't like a strong tackle from Lascelles who goes in hard on the midfielder to win a lose ball. It was a strong, aggressive challenge, much like many that Alli puts in on players himself. I can't see him letting this go. Yellow card for Alli to follow soon probably in a bit of revenge served red hot.\n\n1:50PM 21 mins\n\nSissoko moves to the left and tries to speed things up a bit but his teammates are patiently passing the ball around. Newcastle have dropped into a 4-4-2 defensive shape.\n\n1:47PM 18 mins\n\nPENALTY! Is it?! Shelvey takes a quick free-kick and Gayle is in behind! Walker-Peters bundles him over and the referee blows his whistle... but it's for offside.\n\nThis is a pretty open game at the moment - Spurs are not the solid outfit we saw at the end of last season but they look dangerous on the counter-attack. We might see them come out of their shell a little bit after these opening 20 minutes.\n\n1:46PM Neither Newcastle or Spurs are testing the goalkeepers so far\n\nTense opening quarter of an hour at St. James' Park, as Newcastle and Spurs struggle to get shots on goal\n\n1:45PM Time on ball (0 - 15 min) 1:44PM 15 mins\n\nDavies takes a Spurs corner but Sissoko knocks it out for a goal kick. Spurs keep up the pressure and win another corner, which is played short... and Eriksen crosses too close for Eliott, who gathers and takes his time.\n\n1:41PM 12 mins\n\nNewcastle's tactic for now is to ping the ball long over the top of the Spurs defence, which is a very high line, and look for Gayle to use his pace in behind.\n\n1:41PM Spurs threaten for the first time\n\nFollowing the earlier Newcastle effort, Spurs register their first attempt at goal.\n\n1:38PM 9 mins\n\nLascelles comes on for Dummett, which will probably mean that Ciaran Clark moves to left-back.\n\nSpurs' corner is headed away and Spurs are aggressive in the tackle but can't win possession back. Newcastle have started well but seem to lack a bit of quality in the final third.\n\n1:36PM 6 mins\n\nGayle goes down with a head injury but the referee plays on and Dembele brings the ball out from the back. Alli drops deep, Sissoko is welcomed with a stadium booing him.\n\nGayle is in! He stays onside and runs between the centre-backs but snatches his shot and doesn't get it on target.\n\nAnd then Gayle has a chance to volley from another ball sent from wide but he kicks the air! That was a great chance.\n\nSpurs counter-attack and Sissoko is in miles of space! Kane doesn't see him and runs into the corner.\n\nPaul Dummett has a muscle injury and might have to go off.\n\n1:32PM 3 mins\n\nNewcastle start well, trying to push Spurs back into their own half but the visiting team try to play their way out from the back, get caught out and then win a goal kick with an over hit pass.\n\n1:31PM KICK-OFF\n\nHere we go!\n\n1:21PM Benitez doesn't seem overly confident\n\n\"After one year in the Championship, this club deserves to be in the Premier League and I hope we stay a long time.\n\n\"I think we have to try both (careful and attack). If you wait too much they are patient on the ball and can make the difference too. We will find the balance and pick our times.\"\n\nPochettino says he forgives Danny Rose.\n\nTo win, to play, to show an exciting performance and of course different challenge we have ahead but always the same mentality.\n\nOn Danny Rose:\n\nMaybe you can see outside it's a big issue, inside the players are calm. Good thing he apologised to everyone and for me I forget.\n\n1:16PM More from Ashley\n\n\"It's not enough. It won't generate enough - it's Newcastle United. I am nowhere near wealthy enough in football now to compete with man City etc, not just them, a wealthy individual taking on the equivalent of countries. I cannot and I will not, yeh? If someone wants to come and take my seat and add a nought on the end, I will not stand in their way. The Newcastle fans and I will be together a bit longer yet.\n\n\"Let's hope we can do some stuff, give Rafa some building blocks over the coming years. It would be quite nice if we could, Rafa.\"\n\n1:15PM Mike Ashley interview\n\nThis is fascinating.\n\nOn why he bought the club:\n\n\"I think you have the ambition to do something and make it more than it was. Maybe if we didn't live for every Saturday for the game and had a three year plan, a five year plan, we could build something.\n\n\"I probably rushed in too early. The first thing was when we let Sam go, I was probably too keen to get involved and I was too naive to know how football worked.\"\n\nWhat does he mean by that?\n\n\"People said whatever you do in an interview don't talk about changing the name of St James' Park. Well I'm here and I want to talk about it. I made an error. I should not have done that.\n\n\"At the start I was naive. In the middle I thought I was about to get my arms right, we had a manager on an eight year contract and then 18 months later the wheels came off.\n\n\"Sam Allardyce, I apologise to him, I was too hasty. I didn't know Alan Pardew before football at all, I was very unfair to Chris Hughton.\n\n\"Alan Shearer was one of the only people on this planet who could have kept Newcastle up and he did a fantastic job but luck didn't go our way. And then was he the right per\n\n\"Never say never Alan. If you're watching, who knows.\"\n\n\"It wasn't always easy for Kevin at the football club. We didn't have the structure around to support him. I will take the blame for that. So Kevin, sorry. I apologise.\"\n\n1:10PM The Danny Rose thing\n\nGraeme Souness is on Rose's side when it comes to Spurs players not being paid as much as their Premier League rivals.\n\n\"If I was a big player & knew I was on less, I'd bang on the manager's door. If you're not going to give it to me, I'm off,\" he said. It's a tricky one for Spurs to navigate - Daniel Levy doesn't want to destroy the wage structure to pander to player demands as it sets a dangerous precedent, but worse than that is surely losing his best players. Soccernomics - an excellent book you should check out - made it explicitly clear that teams who pay the most wages are the most successful. It's not about the money spent on buying player, but the money spent on retaining the better ones.\n\n1:05PM Rafa Benitez wants a sofa, not a lamp\n\nBenitez wants some new players:\n\n\"I was expecting something in the summer and it didn't happen,\" he said. \"Now I want to be sure of doing the right things to be a little better. We will see where we are at the end of August. The main thing is we have to stick \u00adtogether and move forward.\n\n\"I am not someone who says, 'You have to do this because it's me'. No, it's because we have experience, we have been successful and we want to replicate this way to do things. If I am here and they pay me the salary that they pay me, it's because they trust me. It's because I have won something and we are doing things in a professional way.\n\n\"We are not demanding crazy things, we are demanding just to do things in the right way, like we did with Liverpool or with Chelsea or the other clubs where we have been.\"\n\n12:57PM By Jove I want to play on this pitch\n\nLook at it. It's gorgeous. Like a big lovely carpet but real.\n\n12:55PM Kyle Walker-Peters\n\nI mean... what are the odds on having two right backs, both called Kyle Walker? It's really such a massive coincidence, isn't it?\n\nOn FIFA 17 he's not particularly highly rated but their player evaluation isn't exactly on a par with Football Manager, who tend to get these things right. On FM17, Walker-Peters is a wonderkid - determined, quick to accelerate and seriously fast at full speed. Pochettino said he wasn't ready last week... how will he cope today?\n\n12:48PM This is vaguely Newcastle related\n\n12:39PM Harry Kane\n\nI know what you're thinking: 'was I right to put Harry Kane in my Fantasy Football team from the start of the season?'\n\nHe tends to have a bit of a slow start but since Spurs haven't changed anything at all over the summer, there's a fair chance he could just pick off where he left off. That Newcastle defence isn't exactly the greatest you'll see in the Premier League all season, though Shelvey and Hayden should provide a bit of cover for them. Width comes from Ritchie and Atsu so the full-backs might not ping forward as much Rafa Benitez would allow otherwise. It's important Newcastle don't get carried away by the noise of the crowd today - a draw would be a fantastic result.\n\n12:33PM Team news\n\nDwight Gayle STARTS! Exciting times. Ayoze Perez is in at number 10.\n\nNewcastle\n\nElliot; Manquillo, Lejeune, Clark, Dummett; Shelvey, Ritchie, Hayden, Atsu; Perez, Gayle\n\nSpurs\n\nKyle is gone, long live Kyle! Walker-Peters that is, because he's making his debut at right-back. Also, Moussa Sissoko is playing. Hmmm.\n\nLloris; Walker-Peters, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Davies; Dier, Dembele; Sissoko, Eriksen, Dele Alli; Kane\n\n12:19PM Preview\n\nWhat is it?\n\nIt is Newcastle vs Tottenham in the Premier League on the opening weekend of the new season.\n\nWhen is it?\n\nIt's on Sunday August 13.\n\nWhat time is kick-off?\n\nIt begins at 1.30pm BST.\n\nWhat TV channel is it on?\n\nThis one is on Sky and can be found on the broadcaster's new channel selection: Sky Sports Premier League, Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Ultra HD.\n\nWhat is the team news?\n\nNewcastle:\n\nFull-back DeAndre Yedlin will miss Newcastle's opening Premier League fixture against Tottenham on Sunday through injury.\n\nThe United States international could be sidelined for several weeks with a hamstring problem he sustained in pre-season.\n\nStriker Dwight Gayle is fit after his own hamstring problem and manager Rafael Benitez otherwise has only a series of minor knocks with which to contend as he prepares to send out his team - which could include several of summer recruits Florian Lejeune, Javier Manquillo, Mikel Merino, Christian Atsu and Jacob Murphy - for the first time since their return to the top flight.\n\nProvisional squad: Elliot, Darlow, Manquillo, Dummett, Gamez, Lascelles, Lejeune, Clark, Mbemba, Hayden, Shelvey, Merino, Colback, Ritchie, Atsu, Murphy, Aarons, De Jong, Diame, Perez, Gayle, Mitrovic.\n\nTottenham:\n\nDanny Rose continues his recovery from knee surgery and will miss Tottenham's Premier League clash with Newcastle.\n\nRose, who has apologised for giving an interview criticising the club's transfer policy on the eve of the season, is expected to be back in action in September.\n\nErik Lamela (hips), Georges-Kevin Nkoudou (foot) and Kieran Trippier (ankle) are also missing.\n\nProvisional squad: Lloris, Vorm, Lopez, Davies, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Dier, Wimmer, Wanyama, Shashoua, Dembele, Eriksen, Alli, Sissoko, Onomah, Lesniak, Winks, Edwards, Son, Janssen, Kane, Walker-Peters.\n\nWhat are they saying?\n\nRafa Benitez:\n\n\"Obviously, I said how I feel during this summer, but at the same time, I said that my commitment is 100 per cent with this team, this club in terms of trying to win from the first game until the last one.\n\n\"My ambition is to do well in every single game to get three points and see where we are in the table.\n\n\"I am not saying I am really pleased with everything because it's not true, but I am not saying that I will not do my best to be as high as possible in the table.\"\n\nMauricio Pochettino:\n\n\"Danny apologised to the club, chairman, manager, team-mates and fans. This was important and good,\" Pochettino said.\n\n\"Sometime as a player you are frustrated for different reasons. But the players are calm and the club is calm. I forgive him.\n\n\"It was his opinion and then he understood that maybe he needed to apologise to us, and that is very good for him and the club. For me it's not a big issue. Now we move on.\"\n\nWhat are the odds?\n\nNewcastle - 4/1 Tottenham - 4/6\n\nDraw - 3/1\n\nWhat's our prediction?\n\nA meeting of two teams whose transfer activity - or lack of it - has alarmed supporters. Tottenham need a decent start tosuggest they are right not to have recruited during the summer, while Newcastle have not bought enough quality, according to manager Rafa Benitez. Newcastle are without DeAndre Yedlin and Dwight Gayle is a doubt. Erik Lamela, Danny Rose and Kieran Trippier are missing for Tottenham.

after Shelvey's stamp on Alli\n\nGet football updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nDele Alli inspired Tottenham to a 2-0 victory over Newcastle at St James' Park with a goal moments after Jonjo Shelvey earned himself a red card for a stamp on the England star.\n\nShelvey needlessly handed the visitors the initiative at 0-0, stepping on Alli's ankle to give Newcastle a mountain to climb with 10 men.\n\nSpurs were frustrated for long spells and Harry Kane was denied from close-range by a stunning save from Rob Elliott, as the England striker's half-volley on the turn cannoned off him.\n\nChristian Eriksen's sublime cross finally opened up the Magpies, with Alli converting from close range before Ben Davies benefited from poor defending to sweep home a second.\n\nHere are five talking points from St James' Park.\n\nWalker-Peters passes test\n\nMaking his first senior appearance, Kyle Walker-Peters was given a huge show of faith by Mauricio Pochettino to start, not only away to Newcastle in a Premier League opener, but in a back four -- which affords him less margin for error.\n\nThe 20-year-old showed great maturity with his positioning and covered well against Christian Atsu and Ayoze Perez, as the majority of the game was played down his side.\n\nNeat on the ball, without anything too extravagant, the England under-20 international looks to be an outstanding prospect and earned the man of the match award.\n\nBenitez may look for defensive reinforcements before window shuts\n\nIt proved to be a damaging afternoon for Rafa Benitez as he lost Paul Dummett to injury after just eight minutes, replaced by Jamaal Lascelles.\n\nA poor challenge from Harry Kane after half an hour in a scissor kick motion took out new \u00a39m signing Florian Lejeune, leading to another enforced change as Chancel Mbemba came on.\n\nMike Ashley acknowledged that his Spanish manager has not received enough funds in a candid interview before kick-off, with two key injuries, the Magpies will surely dip into the market for a defender in the coming weeks.\n\nPochettino must trust Kane more and add pace\n\nDespite having the option to start both Eric Dier and Victor Wanyama and play with three at the back, Pochettino started with a back four.\n\nA stale first half saw Newcastle frustrate last year's runners-up, with Harry Kane isolated and presumably not trusted to receive the ball into feet and link runners.\n\nShould Pochettino persevere with the 4-2-3-1, Kane needs to be involved more and more pace is needed in the wide areas.\n\nSissoko's future looks bleak\n\nMoussa Sissoko was frequently booed by the St James' Park crowd and found it difficult to fit in to Spurs' build-up play.\n\nUnsettled, perhaps, the club's record signing gave it away needlessly and was caught on his heels when not in possession with his team-mates urging him to push into space to create openings.\n\nEven in transition, where he should be at his best and a situation which may transpire less with Spurs due to their dominance in possession, moves broke down through Sissoko, as he dwindled on the ball for too long.\n\nSubstituted before the hour mark, with Son Heung-min returning from injury, Sissoko failed to grasp a golden opportunity to ignite his Spurs career.\n\nEriksen stakes claim as league's best crosser\n\nStarved of creativity and ingenuity in the final third for an hour, Spurs broke the deadlock through Dele Alli thanks to Christian Eriksen's wonderful vision from an inside channel.\n\nThe Dane's signature cross, whipped to the back post for Alli to convert, helps distinguish him above others and potentially lay claim to be the best in the Premier League.\n\nMarc Albrighton's stunning delivery for Jamie Vardy against Arsenal provided a reminder of his speciality, while Kevin De Bruyne and Paul Pogba are also amongst the very best around.\n\npoll loading Who will win the 2017/18 Premier League? 85000+ VOTES SO FAR Chelsea Manchester City Manchester United Liverpool Arsenal Tottenham Hotspur Everton Other", "time": "14:45:00"}

SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nIf Newcastle United weren't aware of how difficult it's going to be in the Premier League before a disastrous afternoon against Spurs, they certainly are now.\n\nNewcastle played with discipline and determination in the first half but lost Paul Dummett and new boy Florian Lejeune to injuries, forcing a reshuffle. Then they shot themselves in the foot when Jonjo Shelvey trod on Dele Alli and Spurs made the ten men pay with two second half goals.\n\nIt was an afternoon that emphasised the importance of further strengthening the team and not making the mistakes which have undermined Newcastle's efforts in the Premier League in recent years. Here is what Newcastle United Editor Mark Douglas learned from the game.\n\n1. Jonjo Shelvey let down his team-mates - and the impact will be felt for a month\n\nWhat on earth was Shelvey - United's most outstanding player in pre-season - thinking?\n\nThere was absolutely nothing in the game or the challenge when Dele Alli held on to the ball and United's captain trod on his foot. Andre Marriner was on the spot and the result was always going to be the red card that quickly followed.\n\nShelvey had spent the summer talking about how he had matured and his performances in the friendlies suggested he could play a major role. But at the first sign of trouble he made a horrendous error of judgement that let his manager and his teammates down badly.\n\nIf Rafa Benitez had more of a free hand in transfers, a bigger budget and more options, Shelvey would be on his way. But the fact is Benitez knows he needs him and the red mist is the reason why a player of his quality has not had more takers. It's a big, big problem for a manager who has illustrated with Aleksandar Mitrovic that he has little time for players who go rogue in games.\n\nNewcastle have no choice but to persist with Shelvey. They lost out here because of him but the bigger impact is over the next three games - all winnable - when Newcastle must play Huddersfield and West Ham without their main creative outlet. In fact, with the League Cup game taken into account, he won't play again until September 10 and the trip to Swansea. There are going to be significant repercussions from his moment of utter madness.\n\nIt is a big, big problem of their own making.\n\n2. A very Newcastle United-y return to the top flight\n\nArsenal fans like to taunt their North London rivals by characterising their misfortunes as \"Spursy\". This was \"Newcastle-y\": losing a left-back within the half hour, a new centre-back who had played with class and composure before half-time and their main playmaker on 50 minutes.\n\nNewcastle already needed everything to fall in their favour to have a good season back in the Premier League and by the hour mark, the job has become more difficult for them. Every single game is important, every point precious. Playing a big bottom half rival whose tails are up next weekend is going to be difficult with those three.\n\nYou'd think by now, Mike Ashley would have learned that cutting corners and gambling just doesn't work in the Premier League.\n\n3. Benitez's meticulous planning will be unravelled if Newcastle don't add to their squad\n\nBenitez tells a story in his book 'Champions League dreams' about one of his first games in management, when he did not name enough substitutes because he was given the wrong information by a club official. His team drew the game but he rued the fact that the phantom sub could have earned them a win. From that moment on, he recalled, he would never be let down by his own lack of planning.\n\nOn Sunday, Newcastle's system was clear: contain Spurs, work hard and make sure Tottenham's attacking threat was nullified. Within 45 minutes they had been forced into two reshuffles, losing the excellent Florian Lejeune and Paul Dummett, who pulled up in the first 20 minutes.\n\nBenitez stocked his squad full of defenders last season to cope with injuries and make sure his team would not be stretched too thin if they had knocks. But that requires him to be given the tools that he feels he needs in the transfer market. His insistence on Newcastle's squad being deeper last season means they were able to call on two central defenders with pedigree on the bench, but United do not have the same strength-in-depth up front. What happens if Gayle breaks down? What is going to happen now Shelvey, their creator-in-chief, is missing?\n\nBenitez's squad is short in certain departments and - to be frank - there's not enough quality either. Lucas Perez and Jack Wilshere have been linked in the last 24 hours. Mike Ashley and Lee Charnley were watching in the director's box. If they needed a reminder of what still needs to be done before August 31, here it was in glorious technicolour.\n\n4. Christian Atsu looked like a different player in the first half\n\nThe Ghana winger was the most low-key of Newcastle close season signings, confirming his permanent deal for \u00a36million in the early weeks of the summer. It was billed as a signing to provide squad cover but for the first 45 minutes on Sunday he was the most clear and present danger to a Tottenham defence that looked unruffled by either Ayoze Perez or Dwight Gayle.\n\nAtsu was a player of promise and potential at Chelsea but they were happy to let him go and his role in the Championship title win was largely reserved for cameos. But he ended the season with a flourish and through pre-season he maintained that form.\n\nAgainst Spurs, his performance carried enough substance to suggest he can be a big weapon in Newcastle's armoury this season.\n\n5. It'll get lost in the aftermath, but Newcastle were doing OK until the red\n\nBenitez's system and the way he set Newcastle up was not Kevin Keegan putting the Premier League on notice. They were set up to contain, squeeze the space and make life hard for Tottenham with their discipline, drive and desire. It wasn't pretty and didn't conjure up much in the final third of the final, but it was pretty effective until Shelvey's moment of madness.\n\nIt wasn't great and they'll have to improve in the final third but Newcastle were playing OK and Benitez is hardly likely to tweak it significantly in the coming weeks. This is how Newcastle are going to set themselves up at home against the big guns.", "time": "16:46:00"}

To say he ran the show from start to finish would not be an understatement, and it wasn't even the slightest bit of a surprise that, when Spurs finally made the breakthrough it was Eriksen who created the goal.\n\nJust over an hour into the match Eriksen bent a gorgeous arcing cross into the area straight into the path of Dele Alli. The Englishman still had to catch it well, but Eriksen made it as easy as anyone could. Less than 10 minutes later Eriksen blew through the Spurs defence and controlled the ball into the path of Ben Davies to make it 0-2 Spurs.\n\nDefending\n\nAfter the Premier League's first two games gave us 13 goals and then champions Chelsea went into half-time 0-3 down to Burnley, many expected a Premier League season where goals were the currency and no one gave much of a care for defending.\n\nThen Mauricio Pochettino and Rafa Benitez came along. This match was a display of diligent defending from both sides, and Spurs didn't look like scoring until Newcastle had lost two defenders to injury (including key new signing Florian Lejeune) and had a man sent off. Scoring against either of these teams in the upcoming months should prove to be very difficult.\n\nDele Alli\n\nLess than five minutes into the second half Jonjo Shelvey stood on Dele Alli's ankle. The tackle earned him a red card and almost guaranteed that Dele, who after an hour in the game had yet to create a chance or have a shot on target, would come back to haunt the Toon.\n\nSure enough he did just that. 63 minutes in Christian Eriksen bent the ball around the defence with all the grace and skill of a renaissance master, allowing Dele to drift into its path and clip it with his left foot into the back of the net to give Spurs the lead.\n\nDele was rolling; it was his quick one-two with Harry Kane freed Christian Eriksen to create Spurs' second. With the game secure and with his presence agitating the home fans, he was removed with eight minutes left to play, almost relishing in the crowd's hatred as he knew he had been the matchwinner.\n\nLosers Jonjo Shelvey\n\nShelvey was Newcastle's creative hub last season, driving the team back up to the Premier League. So any success they were going to have in the big time was going to revolve around him playing well. Unfortunately for Newcastle, he did not.\n\nObviously the red card stands out as a particularly terrible and stupid thing to do, but the thing is he wasn't even playing well before that. Shelvey had attempted just 8 passes, and worse, completed only 4 of them. He had created no chances, taken no shots nor won any take-ons.\n\nHe had won his only tackle, out on the left-flank inside his own half. This was a pitiful showing from Newcastle's stand-in skipper even before he stood on Dele Alli's ankle in a show of cruel petulance. His impending suspension hampers Newcastle's season before it even has a chance to get going.\n\nRafa Benitez\n\nOh poor Rafa. Poor poor Rafa. Obviously on the one hand the Magpies were actually very impressive on their return to the Premier League. They were defensively diligent and coped well with the excellence of Spurs' fluid attack, conceding just twice and allowing onto two more good chances (which were both to Harry Kane in August - so, you know, not too bad).\n\nBut Benitez suffered today, and his pain may yet to be over. His first-choice left-back Paul Dummett left the match injured after just seven minutes, and then his new star defender Florian Lejeune went off after being scythed down by Harry Kane (who had hitherto been in his pocket).\n\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, Jonjo Shelvey's ridiculous red card not only robbed him of his best midfielder for this game, but the extended ban (possibly 3 games) means he now has to plan for his side's return to the Premier League without his best playmaker.\n\nHarry Kane\n\nKane vs. Newcastle: 6 shots, 0 on target\n\nThere's no doubt that Harry Kane is one of the two best strikers in the Premier League. He's incredible and bordering on world-class. For Spurs he's been on fire since becoming a first-team regular in 2013/14, playing 139 games and scoring 94 goals. Yet none of those goals have come in August. In fact Kane has never scored a league goal in August.\n\nToday against Newcastle he had six shots (more than any other player in the league) and yet failed to score, including two clear-as-daylight 1v1's that, if it were any month other than August, he would have buried into the back of the net without a seconds hesitation. This frustration led him to make a vicious tackle on Florian Lejeune (the defender who had easily marked him) that injured the French defender and saw Kane lucky to avoid a red card.", "time": "13:03:00"}

Davies ultimately did for the promoted Magpies with the visitors coasting to a 2-0 victory, but it was Shelvey's 49th-minute dismissal which opened the door after his side had scrapped their way to the break without major incident.\n\nAfter Shelvey's red, there was nothing Rob Elliot could do to keep his side level nine minutes later when Eriksen picked out Alli's run into the box and the England midfielder guided the ball home.\n\nNewcastle's hopes of a comeback were dashed with 20 minutes remaining when the ball broke to full-back Davies inside the penalty area and he slotted past the advancing Elliot, while Kane hit a post in stoppage time to spare them further punishment.\n\nHere, we rate the players on both sides...\n\nNewcastle\n\nElliot 7\n\nOne terrific save to deny Kane, did well overall and looked solid.\n\nManquillo 7\n\nFairly solid debut at right back amid a host of defensive injuries.\n\nLejeune 5\n\nWent off injured 35 minutes into his debut after fierce Kane challenge.\n\nClark 6\n\nSwitched to left back after Dummett went off, was solid in both roles.\n\nDummett 5\n\nLasted all of eight minutes before limping off clutching his hamstring.\n\nShelvey 4\n\nSent off for a stamp on Alli, ridiculous reaction cost his team dear.\n\nHayden 7\n\nA physical presence in midfield, showed signs he will be good Premier player.\n\nRitchie 6\n\nBooked. Shown a yellow for nasty challenge on Alli as frustration grew.\n\nAtsu 7\n\nHis pace was electric, ometimes even too fast for team mates to keep up.\n\nPerez 6\n\nWorked hard behind the front line, chasing and trying to make things happen.\n\nGayle 6\n\nFairly thankless task - especially after Shelvey's red - up front but kept trying.\n\nSubstitutes\n\nLascelles, for Dummett, 8 mins, 6\n\nMbemba, for Lejeune, 35 mins, 6\n\nMerino, for Gayle, 76 mins\n\nTottenham\n\nLloris 7\n\nMade a smart save from Gayle, always solid and quick off his line.\n\nWalker-Peters 7\n\nPoch said last week he wasn't ready, but proved he is.

subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nActions will speak louder than words at St James' Park this summer - and Rafa Benitez knows that better than anybody.\n\nOn a weekend in which Mike Ashley put his hands up and admitted he'd been naive about the running of Newcastle United in the past, surely even he could see how ill-equipped his team are for the Premier League challenge ahead this season.\n\nPutting aside unfortunate injury blows for Florian Lejuene and Paul Dummett - and Jonjo Shelvey's stupidity after a senseless stamp on Dele Alli - the Magpies finished this game with just one permanent summer signing in Javier Manquillo on the field and a borrowed body in Mikel Merino.\n\nThe rest of Benitez's depleted side all played in the Sky Bet Championship last season and, in all truth, didn't always find life in the second tier easy.\n\nIt's a point that Benitez has been forced to labour all summer but despite his pleas to managing director Lee Charnley, the only message that seems to have been transmitted to Ashley is that the former Real Madrid boss is asking for too much.\n\nAshley has claimed that he can't write cheques for \u00a3200million, but Benitez is merely requesting more Premier League quality and not an extravagant summer shopping spree.\n\nThis game was won by the team that had more Premier League guile in their lockers - something that Newcastle are lacking badly.\n\nHarry Kane's challenge on Lejuene was shocking but he done enough to pick up just a yellow card and stay on the field.\n\nHe knew the boundaries and how far he could push Andre Marriner.\n\nThe England international wouldn't dream of trying to stamp on an opponent right under the nose of the referee, which is exactly what Jonjo Shelvey did at the start of the second half to effectively pave the way for Spurs to take three points.\n\nAfter that Tottenham took full advantage as wounded United crumbled to hand the visitors three opening day points.\n\nThe day had started in more optimistic circumstances at St James' Park.\n\nFans have worked hard during the summer months to organise a new singing section and the increased volume was noticeable with St James' Park jumping.\n\nAnd as a new banner reading: \"This is the Gallowgate\" was unfurled there was a real sense of anticipation in the air as the noise cascaded down from Block K of the 23-year-old all seater stand.\n\nNewcastle started the game with plenty of spark but when Dwight Gayle latched on to the ball on the left-hand side he could only scuff his attempt high and wide.\n\nThe Magpies were then forced into an early change when Dummett picked up an early injury after just five minutes and was replaced by Jamaal Lascelles with Ciaran Clark switching to left-back.\n\nThe Magpies absorbed a spell of pressure from Tottenham and then had a penalty shout on 16 minutes.\n\nHowever, when Kyle Walker-Peters tripped Dwight Gayle in the area the linesman raised his flag for an offside.\n\nSpurs enjoyed the majority of the possession in the first half an hour with 68% of the ball, but Newcastle still posed a threat on the counter.\n\nThere was then concern for new signing Lejuene after a dangerous tackle from Harry Kane.\n\nKane was booked for his trouble and Lejuene required lengthy treatment before being taken off and replaced by Chancel Mbemba.\n\nFor all Tottenham's possession in the first half, they didn't manage to test Rob Elliot too much in the opening 45 minutes.\n\nSpurs resorted to long range efforts just before the break with Christian Eriksen firing a shot from distance but Elliot, announced as the club's number 1 this week, gathered it comfortably.\n\nThe Dane then tried another effort from long range moments later but it trickled harmlessly into the palms of Elliot.\n\nUnited battled hard in the first half but failed to produce a shot on target against a Spurs side that have not invested in their squad this summer.\n\nDespite absorbing some early pressure at the start of the second half, Newcastle were rocked further when Shelvey was sent off for standing on Alli.\n\nThe incident took place right under the nose of referee Andre Marriner leaving him with no choice but to issue a red card.\n\nGayle then forced Hugo Lloris into a save at Gallowgate for Newcastle's first dangerous effort at goal.\n\nBut United were then indebted to Elliot who made a fine block to keep out Kane at the other end.\n\nJust before the hour mark there were inevitable boos for Moussa Sissoko as he was replaced by Son Heung-Min.\n\nHowever, just as Newcastle were trying to adapt with man less due to Shelvey's stupidity, Spurs grabbed the lead.\n\nKane and Eriksen worked the ball into the box before Alli hooked it into the net with 61 minutes played.\n\nNine minutes later Spurs doubled the lead after Kane played in Eriksen before he pierced the Newcastle defence for a second time and Ben Davies swept home.\n\nNewcastle tried to rally with 10 men with Atsu and Clark testing the goalkeeper but the damage had long been done.\n\nHad Kane's late effort bounced in off the post in the dying stages it would have been harsh on Newcastle but the first game of the season had by then offered plenty of food for thought for United's board and watching owner Ashley.\n\npoll loading Where

Tottenham defy critics but Harry Kane's August hoodoo goes on opinion\n\nEwan Roberts for Metro.co.ukSunday 13 Aug 2017 3:38 pm Share this article with Facebook Share this article with Twitter Share this article with Google Plus Share this article with Whatsapp Share this article through email Share this article through sms\n\nTottenham made a roaring start to the new Premier League season with a comprehensive victory over newly promoted Newcastle, putting to bed any doubts over unrest or stagnation after Danny Rose's explosive comments to a tabloid newspaper.\n\nThe north Londoners were in control of the match throughout, though only really showed their fangs after the home side had been reduced to 10 men. Goals from Dele Alli and Ben Davies secured the three points, and there were plenty of positives...\n\nSTAR MAN - CHRISTIAN ERIKSEN\n\nThis could be the season that Christian Eriksen really starts to get the credit his immense talent deserves. The Dane started the new campaign like he ended the last, totally controlling every facet of the match at St James' Park.\n\nEriksen the dangerman in Newcastle win Most chances created v Newcastle:\n\nChristian Eriksen - 3\n\nBen Davies - 2\n\nMoussa Sissoko - 2\n\nHarry Kane - 2\n\nIn the first half he was by far Spurs' most dangerous player, finding and exploiting space, and it was he who unlocked the defence to setup the first goal with a deliciously weighted lobbed pass for Alli to volley home not long after the restart.\n\nMinutes later he setup Spurs' second goal, meaning he has now assisted more goals (30) since the start of the 2015/16 season than any other player. He was a class above against Newcastle.\n\nFAILED TO IMPRESS - HARRY KANE\n\nHarry Kane won't get many better opportunities to end his barren run of goals in the month of August than against an injury-hit, 10-man Newcastle side. The forward has incredibly gone 11 games now without netting in the first month of the season.\n\nKane fluffs his lines in front of goal Most shots v Newcastle:\n\nHarry Kane - 6\n\nChristian Eriksen - 6\n\nDele Alli - 2\n\nHe had chances to break his duck though, notably spanking an effort straight at the body of Rob Elliott from six yards out and then rattling the post. The Golden Boot holder looked a little sluggish, though understandably so given that he was afforded an extended break. For now, August truly is the cruellest month for Kane.\n\nBIGGEST ERROR - JONJO SHELVEY\n\nHanded the captaincy for Sunday's match, Jonjo Shelvey gave his side a mountain to climb when he stupidly and deliberately stamped on Alli as he clung to the ball on the deck. It was a simple decision for Andre Marriner to pull out the red card.\n\nUp until that point, Rafa Benitez's gameplan had worked very well. Newcastle blocked passing lanes and stifled the supply into Spurs' front two. But their resistance was impossible to maintain when a man down. Shelvey must stamp out that kind of ill-discipline if he is to help his side stay up... and even stay in the Magpies' side.\n\nWHO SURPRISED US? - KYLE WALKER-PETERS\n\nA week ago, his manager felt he was not yet ready for the Premier League, but Kyle Walker-Peters never looked overawed as he made his debut for Spurs. The 20-year-old lined up at right-back and was as composed and confident in possession as he usually is in the youth sides.\n\nWalker-Peters talking to Sky Sports about his debut 'Yeah I definitely [enjoyed it]. Playing here as well, at a fantastic stadium. We got the three points, made a great start to the season, so I'm very happy. I found out yesterday in training, before we worked on our shape. I was a bit nervy, but nerves are good. A few of the boys tried to tease me about it.'\n\nIn the first half an hour, no player on the pitch had had more touches of the ball - he eventually ended the match with 80 touches - while his one successful take-on was more than Kieran Trippier managed all of last season.\n\nHe picked up a clean sheet, had 91 per cent passing accuracy, dominated the right flank as the match wore on - despite Benitez deliberately doubling up on him - and looks like he can be genuine competition for Trippier this season. A very impressive debut.\n\nMORE: Chelsea's potential line up vs Tottenham with Cesc Fabregas and Gary Cahill suspended after Burnley defeat", "time": "14:52:00"}

campaign with a comfortable three points at St James' Park.\n\nAfter finishing second last season, Tottenham will hope their winning start bodes well for a sustained title challenge.\n\nIt added up to a frustrating return to the Premier League for promoted Newcastle, who had competed well until Shelvey's needless dismissal.\n\nUntil the red card, this encounter between two teams whose supporters have been critical of their lack of transfer investment was in danger of meandering towards a goalless stalemate.\n\nNewcastle's net spend has been less than \u00a320 million ($25 million, 21 million euros), while Tottenham opted not to make even one new signing, choices which appeared ill-judged for long periods here.\n\nIf future decisions are based on analysis of this game, the two managers will surely move in the market to strengthen their squad before the end of the transfer deadline.\n\nMauricio Pochettino will know Tottenham lacked imagination before the red card, while Newcastle's Rafa Benitez will be particularly anxious to recruit reinforcements after suffering injuries to two defenders long before the half-time whistle.\n\nLeft-back is the position where Benitez has no cover for Paul Dummett, so central defender Ciaran Clark had to move there when Dummett suffered a leg injury after only six minutes.\n\nNewcastle were forced to improvise again by the 34th when Chancel Mbemba took over from another centre-half, Florian Lejeune, leaving Newcastle with their third defensive partnership of the afternoon.\n\nLejeune, who already looks the pick of Newcastle's new signings, went down under a challenge from Harry Kane, who was booked.\n\nIt was one of Kane's few contributions to the opening half, but others were equally anonymous as both teams struggled to locate any early-season fluency.\n\n- Danger man -\n\nDwight Gayle sliced an early shot wide from a chance created by Dummett's final involvement, while excellent work down the left by Christian Atsu was wasted when nobody was in front of goal to meet his cross.\n\nChristian Eriksen was the Tottenham danger man in the first 45 minutes, steering a 26th minute shot narrowly wide, then bringing a save from Rob Elliot shortly before the end of the opening half.\n\nThe pattern of the rest of the game was dictated by the dismissal of Shelvey in the 48th minute.\n\nGayle did force Hugo Lloris to finally make a save moments later, but Newcastle's 10 men were largely pinned back in their own half from that point.\n\nKane, needing only one goal to complete a century for Tottenham could have secured it in the 51st minute when he was left in space and hooked a shot that brought a marvellous save from Elliot.\n\nIt was only a matter of time, though, before the 10 men were opened up and Eriksen was the man responsible with a fine pass that Alli slid past the exposed Elliott after 61 minutes.\n\nThe Tottenham pair were also involved in their second goal after 70 minutes when they combined with Kane before Davies nipped in front of Eriksen to finish calmly.\n\nKane, who rarely scores for Tottenham in the month of August, was inches away from ending that drought when he struck the post in stoppage time.\n\nHe will have to wait a little longer for that 100th goal for the club.", "time": "15:55:00"}

"body": "Spurs totally outclassed the Magpies at St James' Park and cruised to an easy three points after scoring twice in the second half\n\nTOTTENHAM cruised past Newcastle in the second half at St James' Park as they downed the Magpies to win 2-0.\n\nGoals from Dele Alli and Ben Davies gifted the win for Maurico Pochettino's men as they kick-off their quest to be crowned as Premier League champions in the best way possible.\n\nLast season's runners-up proved why they are serious contenders for the title this time around against a spirited Newcastle performance.\n\nHere's what we learned from Sunday afternoon's early clash...\n\nHe just seems to never learn from his mistakes.\n\nNewcastle were matching Spurs going into the second half, but Jonjo Shelvey needlessly decided to stamp on Dele Alli's ankle when the former MK Dons star was sitting on the ground.\n\nShown a straight red card just three minutes after the break, he let down his side who had to withstand an onslaught of pressure from the Lilywhites.\n\nThat was his third red card in the Premier League having previously been given an early bath when playing for Liverpool against Everton, while he was also shown his marching orders when at Swansea City.\n\nHe has also been handed a retrospective four-match suspension for violent conduct after clashing with Emre Can.\n\nIf Newcastle weren't thinking of any bringing in any more recruits before the transfer window, they will now.\n\nThey lost defenders Paul Dummett and Florian Lejeune in the first half, with skipper Jamaal Lascelles and Chancel Mbemba coming on, while Jonjo Shelvey will face time out to serve his suspension.\n\nIt means they are running scarce in the centre-back department, with owner Mike Ashley seemingly having to dip into his pockets to fund Rafa Benitez's demands.\n\nEven though there were no injury concerns for their opponents, they still need another forward to compete with Kane.\n\nVincent Janssen is not up to the standard for Spurs, and they need another striker to share the burden.\n\nFans are crying out for a marquee signing, if anything just to boost the atmosphere around North London.\n\nThey're the only side in the top seven not to make any major signings, and it showed early on.\n\nMauricio Pochettino's side failed to create any clear-cut chances in the first half, and looked vulnerable when Newcastle broke on the counter, but were completely dominant in the second period.\n\nA real positive for them was the performance of Moussa Sissoko who looked back to his best where he was strong in the middle, and powerful when gliding with the ball before being replaced by Son Heung-min.\n\nDespite a lack of opportunities in the first 45 minutes, they still continues to press and got a deserved lead when Dele Alli netted on the hour mark.\n\nAnd when Ben Davies doubled their tally, it was nothing short of what they deserved.\n\nThey never let Newcastle back in the game, and with a couple of new additions, will be a force to be reckoned with yet again.\n\nIf Rafa Benitez was manager of the Magpies two season's ago, they wouldn't have suffered the drop, and they won't this time around.\n\nDespite the lack of any real major signings this summer, they posed a threat for Spurs when breaking on the counter.\n\nChristian Atsu - who made his loan deal from Chelsea permanent in the summer, was a constant pain for Tottenham in the opening period, and was arguably one of the most exciting players on the pitch to watch.\n\nStuipid mistakes still continue to derail a good performance for last campaign's Championship winners such as Shelvey's red card.\n\nThey were outclassed today against a far superior and hungry team - no shame in that, with few clubs to be able to match the quality of Spurs this season.\n\nIf his name is anything to go by, most certainly. Kyle Walker-Peters - making his Premier League debut, was nothing short of outstanding.\n\nBooming down the right flank whenever possible, and holding his position well at the back, Kieran Trippier will be left worried he might have to play second fiddle to another Walker.\n\nStruggling at times in the first half to thwart Atsu from advancing, he sussed him out and dealt with him with ease in the second period.\n\nPochettino has unearthed another gem.", "time": "14:51:00"}

And who had a day to forget?\n\nSportsmail's CRAIG HOPE was at St James' Park to run the rule over every player and the referee as the match unfolded...\n\nJonjo Shelvey let Newcastle down after being sent off for an act of petulance\n\nNewcastle United\n\nRob Elliot 6.5 - Made a terrific instinctive save from Kane with the game goalless but was left exposed for Alli's opener. Did nothing wrong.\n\nJavier Manquillo 6 - A steady enough debut and looked better than he did during entirety of last season's loan spell at Sunderland.\n\nCiaran Clark 6 - Shifted to left back after early injury to Dummett and did okay.\n\nFlorian Lejeune 6.5 - Will be a blow if his injury is serious, for he had kept Kane quiet for more than half an hour before a heavy challenge from the Spurs striker forced his withdrawal.\n\nPaul Dummett 6 - Only lasted seven minutes before hamstring went.\n\nJonjo Shelvey 3 - Had a quiet first half and perhaps it was the frustration at having no impact on the game which led him to needlessly trod on Alli, leading to his dismissal early in the second half. It was stupid, he can have no excuse.\n\nShelvey has no excuse for getting sent off and had a quiet first half to boot\n\nIsaac Hayden 6 - Worked diligently alongside Shelvey as Newcastle kept it tight until his midfield partner was sent off. Chasing shadows after that.\n\nMatt Ritchie 5 - Worked hard but barely had a kick and was unable to impact like last season.\n\nAyoze Perez 5 - Played behind Gayle but did not link well with lone striker. He mis-placed one crucial pass which could have freed Gayle before half-time.\n\nChristian Atsu 6 - Started very well and looked like his side's chief threat only to fade.\n\nDwight Gayle 5.5 - Snatched at an early chance and that was a sign of things to come with the striker looking rusty after a hamstring layoff.\n\nDwight Gayle (left) looked rusty after a long layoff with a hamstring injury\n\nSubs\n\nJamaal Lascelles (on 7mins for Dummett) 6 - Did not fare as well as Lejeune against Kane.\n\nChancel Mbemba (on 34mins for Lejeune) 6 - Did okay and he could now be set for a run in the side if injuries elsewhere are serious.\n\nMikel Merino (on 76mins for Gayle) 6 - Kept it tidy.\n\nTottenham\n\nHugo Lloris 6 - Did what he had to with minimum fuss.\n\nKyle Walker-Peters 7 - Settled any nerves with an early dribble and grew into the game after that. A very confident and steady display.\n\nToby Alderweireld 6.5 - It was a relatively easy afternoon up against what looked like a half-fit Gayle.\n\nMousa Dembele was class act, effortlessly knitting play from the middle of the park\n\nJan Vertonghen 6.5 - Much like his Belgian comrade Alderweireld, he strode through this one with little trouble.\n\nBen Davies 7 - Hadn't offered a great deal in attack but appeared in right place at right time to force home the second goal. A couple of timely blocks at the other end as well.\n\nEric Dier 6.5 - Covered well when Walker-Peters bombed forward and put in a disciplined if unspectacular shift in the holding role.\n\nMousa Dembele 7.5 - A class act, as ever, effortlessly knitting play and dictating the tempo from the middle of the park. MOM.\n\nDele Alli picked up where he left off last season with a well-taken goal for Tottenham\n\nMoussa Sissoko 5 - An unhappy return to St James' Park. He was booed throughout and did nothing before his withdrawal on the hour.\n\nDele Alli 7 - His breakthrough goal was crucial and, although it was one of his quieter outings, he produced the goods when his side needed it.\n\nChristian Eriksen 7 - A delightful cross for Alli's goal and was a threat throughout, picking passes and bringing in those around him.\n\nHarry Kane 6.5 - Unlucky not to score - once thwarted by Elliot and then by a post - but worked tirelessly and the goals will come.\n\nHarry Kane was unlucky not to score as he was denied by Rob Elliot and then the post\n\nSubs\n\nSon Heung-Min 6 (on 58mins for Sissoko) A couple of purposeful bursts down the left.\n\nVictor Wanyama (on 82mins for Alli)\n\nHarry Winks (on 85mins for Dembele)\n\nReferee\n\nAndre Marriner 7 - He got the big call on Shelvey absolutely spot on.", "time": "14:49:00"}

From Jonjo Shelvey's sending off to Kyle Walker-Peters' impressive debut, here are five talking points from the game.\n\nShelvey's moment of madness\n\nThe second half was barely three minutes old when Shelvey trod on Alli's ankle following an innocuous coming together in the middle of the pitch. Referee Andre Marriner, standing just a few yards away, did not hesitate to brandish the red card. \"Is that the most stupid red card you've ever seen in your life?\" asked Alan Smith in the Sky Sports commentary box.\n\nIt was the latest in a long line of controversies involving Shelvey and it raises serious questions about Rafael Benitez's decision to hand him the captain's armband. The hosts had largely nullified Spurs up until that point, but in the end they were fortunate to the margin of defeat wasn't greater.\n\n\"He's gone from captain to clown in the space of 10 seconds,\" said Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness. \"Newcastle were well in the game but he's done that right under the referee's nose, and the referee is left with no alternative but to send him off.\"\n\nWalker-Peters impresses\n\nMuch has been made of Tottenham's inactivity in the transfer market but Kyle Walker-Peters repaid Mauricio Pochettino's faith in youth with a man-of-the-match performance on his senior debut. The 20-year-old was thrown in at right-back in the absence of Kieran Trippier and acquitted himself well at both ends of the pitch.\n\nWalker-Peters, who is no relation to the departed Kyle Walker, held his own as Newcastle targeted him in the early stages and showed confidence to carry the ball forward at every opportunity. He was fortunate to see the linesman flag for offside after he bundled Dwight Gayle to the floor in the box in the first half, but that was the only hint of inexperience in an accomplished display.\n\nHe showed impressive energy throughout, with Premier League tracking data showing he made more sprints (59) than any other player on the pitch. He also made more tackles than any of his team-mates (three) and registered a 91 per cent passing accuracy. \"He's seen plenty of the ball, he's enjoyed his afternoon and he's done himself proud out there,\" said Smith.\n\nEriksen holds the key\n\nAs impressive as Walker-Peters was, the man-of-the-match award could just as easily have gone to Christian Eriksen. The Dane was Tottenham's most dangerous attacking player throughout. He went close to breaking the deadlock twice in the first half, and created both goals after the break.\n\nHis chipped delivery for Alli's opener was perfectly measured, and he made a well-timed run to set up Davies for Tottenham's second. His eye-catching display was a continuation of last season. The 25-year-old has now assisted five goals in his last three appearances and becomes the first Spurs player to assist twice in consecutive Premier League games since Rafael van der Vaart in 2010.\n\nSissoko struggles again\n\nMoussa Sissoko's future has been the subject of speculation all summer after a disappointing debut season at Spurs, and there were few signs of a return to form at St James' Park. The Frenchman, whose every touch was booed by Newcastle fans, struggled to make an impact before making way for Heung-Min Son in the 58th minute.\n\nTottenham's small squad means they can ill-afford to let any more players go, but it remains to be seen how many more indifferent displays Pochettino will be willing to tolerate. With Turkish side Trabzonspor eager to sign him, a Spurs departure might yet make sense for all parties.\n\nTransfer work to do\n\nBoth sides now head into the final weeks of the transfer window knowing they have work to do. Walker-Peters' performance was an undoubted boost for Pochettino, but full-back is one of many areas where squad depth could become an issue as Spurs, who are yet to sign a single player this summer, battle on domestic and European fronts.\n\nNewcastle have already made seven new signings but their needs are just as pressing. Benitez admitted he is far from happy with their summer business in the build-up to the game, and with Shelvey now facing a three-game suspension and injury concerns over defenders Paul Dummett and Florian Lejeune, bolstering the squad further becomes even more important.\n\nAlso See: Spurs make Shelvey pay 'Rose right to speak out'", "time": "15:31:00"}

The incident happened in the 48th minute after Alli had been fouled by Isaac Hayden.\n\nShelvey went to get the ball from Alli and, apparently annoyed when the Spurs midfielder knocked it away, stepped on Alli's ankle.\n\nBenitez admitted Shelvey's red card changed the match but said the stamp was not as dangerous as a Harry Kane tackle on Florian Lejeune, for which he was booked.\n\n\"It was difficult from the beginning. We had to adapt things [after injuries]. The red card changed everything. I think we were defending well. We have to improve. We had our chances but we missed them,\" Benitez said.\n\n\"The Harry Kane tackle was worse than this one. It's more dangerous. We lost one player from that. We made a mistake, but I think maybe someone has to analyse these things to see what's more dangerous.\"\n\nAlli did not want to talk about the incident when he was interviewed by Sky TV after the game. \"It was one of those things. He is a great player and I am sure he is going to be disappointed,\" he said.\n\n\"I have been called up a couple of times for my own temper but it is important we kept our cool.\"\n\nThe red card is the third of the 25-year-old Shelvey's controversial career and follows the five-match ban and 100,000 pound ($130,110.00) fine he received last season for racially abusing Wolverhampton Wanderers' Moroccan-born player Romain Saiss.", "time": "16:34:00"}

He has gone from captain to clown in the space of 10 seconds.\n\n\"He is annoyed because Dele Alli has kept the ball. So what? How stupid is that?\n\n\"Newcastle are very much in the game, he is right under the referee's nose and the referee has been left with no alternative but to send him off.\n\n\"I said to Alan before that I like Shelvey. He is always positive, always looks to move the ball forward, he plays risky passes but you can't have anybody doing that at your football club. Nobody.\n\n\"That has cost them the game. I'm not saying Tottenham wouldn't have won but there was a real chance the game could have been a bit more 'nip and tuck'.\n\n\"But when you have someone like that in your group, that should be his last chance. You can't do that.\n\n\"They might get relegated by one point, they might get relegated by two points, it might not matter in the bigger picture but right now his team are entitled to be very angry.\"\n\nPardew used to manage Shelvey when he was an emerging youngster at Charlton Athletic and he believes his actions lacked responsibility.\n\nHe added: \"I have been his manager and you have to have chats with Jonjo.\n\n\"He has a very short fuse over tiny little incidents like that.\n\n\"The stamp isn't a stamp that's going to hurt you but it is a petulant stamp.

victory over a 10-man Newcastle United side at St James' Park this afternoon.\n\nMauricio Pochettino's men had second-half goals from Dele Alli and Ben Davies to thank, as Spurs made use of the dismissal of Jonjo Shelvey for a stamp on Alli in order to claim three points on the road.\n\n\u00a9 Offside\n\nNewcastle arguably started as the better of the two sides and Dwight Gayle caused some early issues as he spun Toby Alderweireld, before skewing a volley over the crossbar without troubling Hugo Lloris.\n\nSpurs were unable to find a rhythm for much of the first half, largely thanks to United's impressive industry, leaving Christian Eriksen to try his luck from distance with an effort that was saved down low by Rob Elliot.\n\n\u00a9 Offside\n\nChristian Atsu grew into the game for the hosts and he caused a few issues down the left, although Spurs youngster Kyle Walker-Peters provided some important pace to prevent the Ghanaian from causing too many problems.\n\nIn a first half that proved to be more intriguing than entertaining, Eriksen tried his luck again from distance, this time bending a curling effort towards the far post that a diving Elliot saved comfortably.\n\n\u00a9 Offside\n\nThe game was turned on its head after the break, however, when Shelvey was given a straight red card for an off-the-ball stamp on Alli, handing Spurs what turned out to be a decisive numerical advantage.\n\nIt did not take too long for the visitors to make the required breakthrough, as Eriksen picked out Alli with a memorable ball in behind the defence, leaving the playmaker to break free and prod beyond Elliot.\n\n\u00a9 Offside\n\nThe goal seemed to kick Spurs into action and the rise in tempo soon saw Pochettino's men double their lead, Eriksen and Alli combining again with a neat one-two which left Davies with the chance to stroke past the Newcastle keeper.\n\nUnited sought to push for a route back into the match in the final 10 minutes, although it proved too little too late for Benitez's men as Spurs closed out the game to earn three opening points.", "time": "12:56:00"}

football updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nNewcastle were let down by Jonjo Shelvey's brainless stamp on Dele Alli as they returned to the Premier League with a 2-0 defeat to Tottenham.\n\nAlli and Ben Davies both scored in the last half and hour after the red card to give the Spurs the perfect start to the season.\n\nMauricio Pochettino decided to give youngster Kyle Walker-Peters a debut at right-back - in lieu of the injured Kieran Trippier.\n\nRafa Benitez largely stuck with the side which lifted the Championship title last season - although gave starts to Florian Lajeune and Javier Manquillo, while Christian Atsu played for the first time since turning his loan from Chelsea permanant.\n\nOur man Alex Smith has run the rule over how the debutants performed.\n\nKyle Walker-Peters (Tottenham)\n\nHas big feet, and name, to fill - with his almost name-sake moving to Manchester City for \u00a350m this summer - but proved he was more a Kyle Walker-Plus.\n\nThe 20-year-old wasn't overly tested on his first Spurs start defensively as he replaced Trippier in the starting XI.\n\nWas out paced by Christian Atsu in the first half on one occasion but that was the only hiccup.\n\nOverall will be happy with his performance, seeing plenty of the ball and distributing it well.\n\nAnother good option for Mauricio Pochettino and yet another star nurtured from the academy by the Argentine.\n\nVERDICT: HIT\n\nFlorian Lejeune (Newcastle)\n\nDidn't take long to acclimatise to the Premier League following his switch from Eibar this summer.\n\nThe Frenchman couldn't have had much more difficult first assessment in English football, as he watched Harry Kane strut his stuff.\n\nBut Lejeune prevented the England ace from grabbing his 100th Spurs goal in an assured outing before being subbed off after a nasty tackle from Kane in the 34th minute.\n\nVERDICT: HIT\n\nJavier Manquillo (Newcastle)\n\nWell known in the Premier League after spells at Liverpool and Sunderland.\n\nBarely registered at full-back as the ball went through the centre or down the Newcastle left more often than not.\n\nDealt well with the regular enforced first half changes at the back and slotted in without whoever he was paired up with on the left-side of defence.\n\nVERDICT: TOO SOON TO TELL\n\nChristian Atsu (Newcastle)\n\nOne brilliant run down the wing in the first half showcased what he is all about.\n\nBut other than that breathless sprint he shied away from the action, with Matt Ritchie on the other flank more often involved.\n\nRafa Benitez knows how to get the best out of him, after being an integral part of the promotion team while on loan, and again a lesser team could be lethal.\n\nVERDICT: MISS\n\nMikel Merino (Newcastle)\n\nCame off the bench for the last 14 minutes with the game already lost.\n\nSured up the weakened midfield somewhat but Spurs were in cruise control.\n\nCould be in line for his full debut next week, with Shelvey set to miss the next three matches.\n\nVERDICT: TOO SOON TO TELL\n\npoll loading Where will Tottenham finish this season?

He's annoyed because Alli has kept the ball. How stupid is that?\" he said.\n\n\"Newcastle are right in the game, he's done it right under the referee's nose, who has no other alternative but to send him off. I was saying to Alan just before it that I liked Shelvey and he has something about him but you can't have anybody doing that at a football club. Nobody.\n\n\"He lost them the game arguably. I'm not saying Tottenham wouldn't have won but the game but there would've been a lot more nip and tuck play.\n\n\"That should be his last chance because you can't do that. They might get relegated by one or two points. It might not matter in the bigger picture but his team-mates have the right to be very angry.\"\n\nHuddsf'ld vs Newcastle\n\nAugust 20, 2017, 12:30pm\n\nLive on\n\nGet Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass\n\nAlan Pardew joined the punditry team for the match and was also scathing of Shelvey, who he managed while at Charlton.\n\n\"You have to have chats with Jonjo and he has a very short fuse over tiny little incidents like that. What irritates me is it isn't a stamp like he's going to hurt him, it is a petulant stamp,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\n\"That is the sort of thing that you have to ask him about in training on Monday - 'what are you doing? Why are you doing it? You are the captain of the football team and you have to set an example not just for your team-mates but for everyone watching around the world' and that's the responsibly the has to understand in that role.\"\n\nCo-commentator Alan Smith also shared the sentiments of his Sky Sports colleagues as he gave his initial reaction to the sending off as it happened.\n\n\"That has come as a shock to everyone in the stadium. It certainly has to me. Dele Alli thinks Shelvey's stepped on his ankle intentionally from his reaction,\" he said.\n\n\"Is that the most stupid red card you've ever seen in your life?

Do teams need a single inspirational figure, a chest-thumper who stirs the heart and soul? An experienced head, one who can offer big-brotherly advice to his colleagues? Someone who \"leads by example\", which usually just means \"being better than everyone else\"?\n\nIn theory it should not matter who has the armband. As long as you can tell the difference between heads and tails on a coin and are half-respected by your colleagues, you shouldn't need much else. Oh, and just one other thing: ideally you should not brainlessly get yourself sent off at a crucial phase of a game against title contenders.\n\nIn many ways Jonjo Shelvey is a maverick choice as a captain. Not known for his sense and cool head, he does not immediately strike one as the ideal leader for a team returning to the Premier League. But with club captain Jamaal Lascelles on the bench, Shelvey did the honours, and during the first half there was at least a nod towards maturity: following a robust challenge between the two, Lascelles and Dele Alli circled each other like territorial cats deciding whether to swipe at each other, and Shelvey stepped in to advice his colleague that a scrap wasn't worth the trouble. Perhaps he has grown-up.\n\nPerhaps the impetuous youth who accused Sir Alex Ferguson of \"grassing him up\" after a red card back in 2012 is gone, and a new, wiser Shelvey is here to stay.\n\nThat lasted about half an hour. When Alli was on the turf not long after half-time after a challenge, Shelvey tried to quickly grab the ball but it was poked away by his scampish adversary. The newly-sage Shelvey did the only thing he really could at that point: stamp on Alli's foot, with the referee observing from about five yards away.\n\nIt was a textbook \"hook, line and sinker\" move, the equivalent of Lucy convincing Charlie Brown that she wasn't going to pull the football away as he tried to kick it, only to do exactly that, poor gullible Charlie left in the mud again. Mildly inconveniencing a combustible opponent might have been the sort of thing Alli didn't think would actually provoke a significant reaction, but was worth a try anyway. That it worked provided an example of the learning curves on both men involved.\n\nBecause it is the sort of thing that you could imagine Alli himself falling for, at one point, and back in 2016, with Spurs trying to reel in Leicester City in the title race, he punched West Brom's Claudio Yacob in the stomach and received a three-game ban.\n\nStill a young and relatively inexperienced player, Alli's temperament has been the one real question mark of his career to date, a sense that all of his terrific talent might be for nought if he couldn't control himself more. In this game Alli had plenty of opportunities to do just as Shelvey did, with kicks here and there and one particularly nasty challenge, from behind by Matt Ritchie, that could have provoked a reaction. But the only reaction that came was to wind up an opponent and then score the first goal of the game.\n\nPerhaps this is the way Alli has chosen to channel the \"devil\" in his game that people always say he has to retain. Rather than launching into rash challenges and elbows to ribs, he has instead decided to focus on riling whoever he happens to be playing that day. Not that this is new: Alli has enjoyed chiding opponents for as long as he has been around, but now the signs are it's without the stuff that will actually get him in trouble with the law.\n\nThink of it as a poacher turned gamekeeper situation, the wind-uppee becomes the wind-upper, a man who knows exactly what will irritate players with a short fuse, because he has one himself. Alli revelled in his status as an antagonist, soaking up the ire of Newcastle's players and fans: a needless stepover and showboat here, a funereal trudge off the pitch when substituted here. He is the player who opponents find easy to hate, but fans find even easier to love. Shelvey could perhaps learn a lesson or two from Alli, a man four years younger and with more than 100 fewer senior appearances to his name, but one has seemingly learned lessons from the past and the other has yet to.\n\nThe way the respective managers spoke about both players after the game summed it up neatly. \"He was calm,\" Mauricio Pochettino said of Alli. \"That's important. Last season we talked a lot about how he needs to behave and improve. He's mature enough now to accept what happens on the pitch.\" Rafael Ben\u00edtez resembled a parent who has repeatedly told a young child not to touch the hot kettle, but is on the way back from the burns unit for the fourth time. \"All the effort we put in on the pitch was lost in one moment,\" he said. Was he angry? \"We cannot change anything now.\" He's not mad, he's just disappointed.\n\nAlli has any number of fine qualities, and would be among the most effective attacking midfielders in the Premier League even if he was a placid, likeable character. But the devil, when channeled in the right way, makes him even better.", "time": "17:16:00"}

face the Toon at St James' Park without their influential midfielder.\n\nNottingham Forest have been handed a boost ahead of their Carabao Cup tie with Newcastle United later this month.\n\nIn their first Premier League game since winning promotion from the Championship in May, Toon captain for the day Jonjo Shelvey was given his marching orders by referee Andre Marriner for a stamp on Dele Alli's ankle.\n\nThe Tottenham star was sat on the ground, when Shelvey started talking to him, before planting his boot on All's ankle, something which drew an immediate red card for the United captain.\n\nThe game was nicely poised at 0-0 when Shelvey was given his marching orders just three minutes into the second half, with Spurs then going on to win 2-0.\n\nMidfielder Christian Atsu then revealed that his captain had apologised in the dressing room after the game.\n\n\"That's football. Mistakes do happen\", Atsu told Sky Sports.\n\n\"He'll learn from his mistakes. He's upset with himself. He thinks he let the team down. We are really behind him. We believe he will come back stronger.\n\n\"He apologised to everyone.\"\n\nAlli himself said there was no reason for 25-year-old to react as he did, which aided Spurs attempts to go on and win the game against 10 men.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be a physical game. It's not an easy place to come. It happens sometimes,\" said Alli.\n\n\"I'm sure he'll be disappointed. It was important we stayed professional. I don't want to talk about it too much. I've had a few talks with the gaffer in the past (about his temperament). I've been pulled up for my temper before but today we had to keep our cool.\n\n\"There was no need to react today.\"\n\nShelvey is no stranger to controversy, having been sent off in Forest's 2-1 win against Rafael Benitez's man at the City Ground in December.\n\nIn an incident that saw him sent off for an apparent kick out at Henri Lansbury, Forest went on to miss the resultant penalty, and Shelvey, along with teammate Paul Dummet, both had their red cards overturned on appeal.\n\nThat game will long live in the memory, with the Reds failing to convert two penalties following the two dismissals, before going on to win courtesy of goals from Nicklas Bendtner and a Jamaal Lascelles own goal four minutes from time.", "time": "15:33:00"}

inspired a 4-0 rout of West Ham, while Jonjo Shelvey's dismissal was the pivotal moment in Tottenham's 2-0 win at Newcastle on Sunday.\n\nUnited manager Jose Mourinho paid a British record \u00a375 million ($96 million, 82 million euros) to sign Lukaku from Everton in the close-season and the 24-year-old needed just 33 minutes to get off the mark for his new club.\n\nAccelerating on Marcus Rashford's pass, Lukaku drilled a powerful strike in off the post to put United ahead in their Premier League opener at Old Trafford.\n\nLukaku was virtually unplayable at times and he doubled United's advantage in the 53rd minute with a bullet header from Henrikh Mkhitaryan's free-kick.\n\nSubstitute Anthony Martial added United's, slotting past Joe Hart in the 87th minute, before Paul Pogba's 90th minute strike sent Mourinho's men to the top of the table above Huddersfield on goal difference.\n\nOnce sold by Mourinho when the pair were at Chelsea together, Lukaku could be the catalyst for a first serious title challenge from United since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.\n\nLukaku wasn't the only impressive United debutant, with Nemanja Matic delivering a solid display that underlined why Chelsea manager Antonio Conte was so miffed his club sanctioned the \u00a340 million sale of the Serbia midfielder to a title rival.\n\nAt St James' Park, Shelvey was sent off early in the second half for deliberately treading on Tottenham star Dele Alli, who was on the ground only yards from referee Andre Marriner.\n\nAlli got his revenge by firing Tottenham ahead in the 61st minute with a cool close-strike from Christian Eriksen's superb lofted pass.\n\nFollowing Tottenham's Danny Rose had ranted about the club's failure to sign quality players during the close-season, it was fitting that the injured left-back's replacement Ben Davies was the man to increase his side's lead in the 70th minute.\n\nAlli, Eriksen and Harry Kane opened up Newcastle with a flowing move before Davies produced a clinical finish.\n\nHaving finishing second last term, Tottenham will hope their winning start bodes well for a sustained bid to dethrone Chelsea.\n\nPochettino's side host the champions next weekend in their first league match at Wembley following their move to the national stadium while White Hart Lane is being redeveloped this season.\n\nBy then, the Argentine would like to have added to his squad after a frustrating transfer window.\n\n\"It was important to start with three points, but it wasn't a great game and wasn't our best performance,\" Pochettino said.\n\n\"The balance of the team is the main thing and we need some new players to bring some new energy.\"\n\nNewcastle boss Rafael Benitez revealed Shelvey apologised to his team-mates for ruining the promoted club's return to the top-flight.\n\n\"The sending off changed everything. He made a mistake,\" Benitez said.\n\n\"Hopefully he will learn from it. He has apologised but that changes nothing now.\"", "time": "17:36:00"}

St James' Park.\n\nThe 25-year-old was given his marching orders during the Magpies' opening day defeat to Tottenham on Sunday, after appearing to stamp on the foot of Spurs playmaker Dele Alli just after half-time, becoming the first Newcastle player to be sent off during during an opening day fixture at St James' Park since legendary striker Alan Shearer in 1999.\n\nIt is just the latest in a series of incidents to involve Shelvey, whose career has long been blighted by accusations of indicsipline.\n\nLast season saw the Englishman banned for five games and fined \u00a3100,000 after being found guilty of racially abusing Wolves midfielder Romain Saiss.\n\nHe was also sent off during the Magpies' clash with Nottingham Forest at the City Ground after a confrontation involving Henri Lansbury.\n\nHis latest dismissal for violent conduct means Shelvey is now facing up to the prospect of a three-game ban, but could well be back in Rafa Benitez's side for the trip to former club Swansea on September 10.\n\nIf given the nod, it will be Shelvey's first visit to the Liberty Stadium since his transfer to the north east in January 2016, which saw him leave under a heavy amount of criticism from Swans fans after the FA Cup Third Round defeat to Oxford United.", "time": "15:37:00"}

It happens sometimes,\" Alli said of his clash with Shelvey.\n\n#COYS pic.twitter.com/uIM19dcLXa\n\n-- Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) August 13, 2017\n\n\"I've been pulled up for my temper before but today we had to keep our cool. There was no need to react today.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about it too much. I've had a few talks with the gaffer in the past.\n\n\"I'm sure Shelvey will be disappointed. It was important we stayed professional.\"\n\nAlli was rewarded for his composure as Shelvey was dismissed, sparking Tottenham's 2-0 victory in their Premier League opener.\n\nFittingly, it was Alli who opened the scoring with a clinical finish from Christian Eriksen's sublime pass before Ben Davies wrapped up the points.\n\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez revealed former Liverpool midfielder Shelvey had apologised to his team-mates for the rush of blood that cost his newly promoted team their chance of a shock win.\n\n\"The sending off changed everything. He made a mistake,\" Benitez said.\n\n\"Hopefully he will learn from it.

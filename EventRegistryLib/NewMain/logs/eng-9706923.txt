Simon Amobeda of the Federal High Court has instructed Justices Faruk Adamu and Zuwaira Yusuf, judges of Kano State High Court, to step down from their positions as chairmen of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry on Misappropriated Public Properties and Assets as well as Political Violence and Missing Persons within 48 hours.\n\nThe National Judicial Council (NJC), Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission, Attorney General of Kano State, Justices Faruk Adamu and Justice Zuwaira Yusuf are defendants in the case.\n\nIn a ruling on Thursday in a case brought by former Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, Justice Amobeda stated that the NJC should halt payment of any remuneration, allowances and benefits to the two judges from the consolidated revenue fund if they do not comply with the order.\n\nNaija News understands that Kano State Governor, Abba Kabir Yusuf, had on April 4 inaugurated the two judicial commissions of inquiry under the chairmanship of Justices Adamu and Yusuf to investigate cases of misappropriation of public properties, political violence and cases of missing persons from 2015 to 2023.\n\nJustice Amobeda directed that the judges should refrain from carrying out the executive functions assigned to them by the governor in courtrooms designated for adjudicating disputes between individuals and authorities in the state.\n\nThe judge held that \"The combined effects of sections 6, 84, 153(1), 271(2), 272 together with paragraph 21(c) of part 1 of the third schedule to the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the 4th and 5th defendants

appoint and administer the oath of office for individuals to serve as chairmen of a commission of inquiry, a position designated for commissioners exercising executive powers.\n\nThe court emphasized that Justice Abdullahi Muhammad Liman's ruling, which stated that only the EFCC and the ICPC have the jurisdiction to investigate the former governor, deems it an abuse of power and a violation of judicial integrity for the governor to establish a commission of inquiry to probe the plaintiff's administration.\n\nNevertheless, the court dismissed the plaintiff's counsel's argument that the judges compromised their judicial roles by participating in the judicial commission of inquiry.", "source": {"uri": "naijanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"Governor Yusuf appointed Farouk Adamu and Zuwaira Yusuf in April to the Judicial Commission of Inquiry he set up to probe former Governor Ganduje.\n\nThe Federal High Court in Kano has ordered two judges to quit the judicial commissions set up by Kano State Governor, Abba Yusuf, to probe his predecessor, Abdullahi Ganduje.\n\nMr Yusuf appointed Farouk Adamu and Zuwaira Yusuf in April to the Judicial Commission of Inquiry he set up to investigate allegations of misappropriation of public properties, political violence and missing persons under former Governor Ganduje.\n\nThe commissions' scope of investigation covers 2015 to 2023, the period when Mr Ganduje served two consecutive terms as governor.\n\nBut Justice Simon Amobeda said the judges cannot take a fresh oath to perform an executive role while still being judicial officers.\n\nMr Amobeda gave the order while delivering judgement on Thursday in a case filed by Mr Ganduje asking the court to stop the probe of his administration.\n\nHe ordered the judges to vacate their seats on the commissions within 48 hours, failing which he ordered the National Judicial Council (1st Defendant) to stop paying their remuneration, allowances and benefits as judicial officers from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation.\n\nHe said the judges cannot perform executive functions assigned to them by the governor of Kano State in courtrooms meant to adjudicate disputes between persons and authorities in Kano State.\n\nMr Amobeda noted that the governor set up commissions to investigate Mr Ganduje without appealing a judgement delivered by Justice Abdullahi Liman of the Federal High Court declaring that Mr Ganduje can only be investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) or the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC).\n\nHe said the governor's action amounts to abuse of office and undermines the sanctity of the judiciary.\n\nREAD ALSO: Kano Emirate Crisis:

48 hours within which to rescue themselves from their roles in the Kano State Government, or face the consequences.\n\nThe Source reports that Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf had early May this year appointed the two serving Justices to head two Commissions of Inquiry constituted by the State Government to probe the activities of the immediate past administration in the state headed by Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje.\n\nDr Ganduje is the current National Chairman of the All Progressive Congress APC.\n\nWhile Justice Adamu accepted to serve as the Chairman of the Panel to investigate alleged misappropriation of public funds and properties, Justice Yusuf is heading another commission charged with unravelling those behind the spate of thuggery activities and concomitant deaths in kano state between 2015 and 2019.\n\nBut ruling on an application filed by Dr Ganduje challenging the legality of the constitution of the probe panels ,Justice Simon Amobeda of a Federal High Court, Kano on Thursday July 4, 2024, insisted that failure of the two serving justices to distance themselves from performing executive functions within the stipulated dateline, will lead to a formal petition being forwarded against them to the National Judicial Council NJC .\n\nJustice Amobeda also ruled that, the NJC which is the 1st defendant in the suit will be compelled to stop the payments of their remunerations, allowances and other benefits, should they (the two serving justices) fail to resign their appointments with the Kano state Government.\n\nJustice Amobeda, blasted his colleagues for throwing caution to the wind ,with their acceptance to serve in the executive arm of the Kano State Government, while at the same time sitting to adjudicate in matters involving same Executive Arm of Government and other parties.\n\nSimilarly, the trial Judge condemned the action of the Kano State Government which instead of appealing against an earlier ruling on the issue of probing Dr Ganduje at the Appeal Court ,decided to bring same case before a court of same jurisdiction .\n\nThe Source reports that, Justice Abdullahi Mohammed Liman of a Federal High Court Kano earlier this year dismissed a corruption case filed by the Kano state Government against Dr Gandunje .\n\nJustice Liman ,had maintained that going by the provisions of extant laws ,only the Federal Government and the Economic and Financial Crime Commission EFCC ,and Independent Corrupt Practices And Other Related Offences Commission ICPC are empowered to investigate and prosecute corruption allegations against the immediate past Governor of kano state .\n\nIn his ruling on Thursday, Justice Amobeda, said the Kano State Government has no powers to appoint the serving justices on to the probe panel.", "source":

He further directed the National Judicial Council (NJC), the first defendant in the case, to cease payment of any remuneration, allowances, and benefits from the consolidated revenue fund of the federation to the judges if they fail to comply with the 48-hour deadline.\n\nThe judge criticized the governor for establishing the commission without appealing an earlier court judgment by Judge A.

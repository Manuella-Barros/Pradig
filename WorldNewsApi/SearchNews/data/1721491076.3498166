{"id": 237080498, "title": "One World International School: A K-12 digital campus for the new generation", "text": "At OWIS, students are nurtured to embody values like kindness and compassion in their daily lives, ensuring a values-based environment. Primary students participate in the Mindfulness Programme, which introduces them to self-awareness and emotional regulation. From Grade 6 onwards, secondary students join the Personal, Social, Health and Economic Programme, where each student is paired with a mentor advisor, who is also a teacher. These advisors serve as the main contact for parents regarding academic progress and overall development, providing personalised insights during parent-teacher conferences, complementing input from subject teachers. Said Mrs Henderson: \u201cWhether it\u2019s understanding academic concepts, experimenting in a laboratory, practising on stage or creating art, OWIS fosters an environment where students can push the boundaries of their knowledge and creativity, leading to endless opportunities for growth and innovation.\u201d The school operates in a sustainable environment, using efficient technologies to reduce its carbon footprint. Moving forward, OWIS aims to meet 15 per cent of its energy needs through solar power. After a day at OWIS, students return home having experienced an educational journey tailored to meet the challenges of tomorrow. From engaging in innovative learning environments to fostering cultural awareness, OWIS ensures that each child blossoms in today\u2019s globally connected world, and is one step closer to becoming tomorrow\u2019s leader.

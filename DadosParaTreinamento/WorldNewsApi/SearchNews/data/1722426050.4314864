Find Out: The Surprising Way You Can Get Guaranteed Retirement Income for Life Yet whether you\u2019re decades away or less than a few years, according to a recent Northwestern Mutual Planning and Progress Study, which deals with people\u2019s financial attitudes, most Americans are off on predicting how much they\u2019ll need in retirement. Do you fall into this camp too? Experts offer some tips. Wealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them. The Gap Between Needs and Reality The gap between what people need and what they think they need is significant, said Spencer T. Hakimian, founder of the hedge fund Tolou Capital Management, L.P. \u201cMany Americans underestimate the impact of inflation, longer life expectancies, and the rising costs of healthcare,\u201d he said. He mentioned a survey done by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, which found that while many workers believe they need around $500,000 for retirement, experts often recommend a minimum of $1 million, depending on lifestyle and healthcare needs.

By using this formula, a person earning $75,000 annually would ideally need a retirement fund that can provide approximately $52,500 to $60,000 per year.\u201d Hakimian said this can be achieved by saving 10%-15% of their income annually, starting as early as possible. Another Approach Michael Ashley, a finance advisor and founder of Richiest.com, suggested a slightly different formula: By age 30, you should have saved 1x your annual income3x by 406x by 508x by 6010x by 67 So, if you earn $75,000 annually, you\u2019d need $750,000 by retirement by this formula, he said. \u201cHowever, data shows average 401(k) balances are far below these targets,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cGen X, for example, has an average of $178,500 saved but ideally needs $300,000 to $600,000. This gap is often due to underestimating future needs, inflation, and rising healthcare costs.\u201d To bridge this gap, he recommended maximizing retirement plan contributions, increasing savings rates gradually, ensuring proper investment growth and automating savings to stay on track. Financial Education Is Key This disparity between what people think they need and what they actually have saved highlights the importance of financial literacy and planning, Hakimian said. Finding out you have a shortfall is a lot better when you\u2019re younger, as well. \u201cFor instance, millennials and Gen Z should be particularly aware of the benefits of compound interest and start saving early, while Gen X and baby boomers need to focus on catching up and maximizing their contributions,\u201d Hakimian said. Addressing this knowledge gap requires comprehensive financial education and personalized planning, he said. Utilize Multiple Strategies There are many tools and strategies people can use to prepare, from employer-sponsored retirement plans to maximizing Social Security benefits, Hakimian said. You may also want to consider other income streams like part-time work or annuities, which can contribute to a more secure and comfortable retirement. Financial planners play a crucial role in helping you determine how much you need by offering tailored advice that considers individual circumstances such as age, income, health and retirement goals. \u201cEncouraging regular financial check-ups and adjustments to savings strategies can help individuals stay on track,\u201d Hakimian said. Most importantly, don\u2019t put off retirement planning for \u201csomeday\u201d only to find yourself there with a shortfall.

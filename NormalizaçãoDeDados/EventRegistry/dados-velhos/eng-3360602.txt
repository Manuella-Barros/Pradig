This protest resulted in the death of one woman, with dozens of others wounded. Although Trump condemned \"in the strongest possible terms\" the \"egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence\" that took place \"on many sides\" in Charlottesville, he received widespread criticism for failing to identify specific groups.\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said in his statement. \"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\nHe added: \"Our country's strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations, and political beliefs.\"\n\nIn response, Trump took to Twitter Monday morning to needle Frazier over his resignation, saying, \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nThe American Manufacturing Council, led by Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris, originally sported 28 members when it was formed in January to aid Trump in revitalizing U.S. manufacturing and creating jobs. But Frazier became the latest White House council member to step down in a protest against Trump and his policies.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney CEO Robert Iger resigned in June after Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris climate accord. Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick withdrew from Trump's business advisory council in February after the president issued his travel-ban executive order.\n\nAlthough Frazier took issue with Trump's all-encompassing Charlottesville statement on Saturday, the White House issued a statement Sunday clarifying that Trump \"said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred. Of course that includes white supremacists, KKK Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.\"\n\nBut that didn't stop Frazier from making a personal statement and removing his voice and expertise from Trump's manufacturing council.\n\nTrump responded to Frazier's departure less than an hour after the Merck CEO made his announcement -- a fact that mainstream media members noticed and exploited as they continued to push their narrative.\n\n\"It took Trump 54 minutes to condemn Merck CEO Ken Frazier, but after several days he still has not condemned murdering white supremacists,\" CNN commentator Keith Boykin tweeted.\n\n\"Merck CEO Ken Frazier has officially earned more vigorous denunciation from Donald Trump than neo-Nazis. Happy 2017,\" MSNBC's Joy Reid tweeted.\n\n\"It took Trump 54 minutes to harass Ken Frazier but we're still waiting for him to denounce white nationalists,\" Huffington Post global social media editor Ethan Klapper tweeted.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "15:18:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "00:55:00", "title": "What Trump Had to Say About Merck CEO

After a car plowed into a crowd, killing a counter-protester, Trump said there was violence \"on many sides\" without specifically denouncing white supremacists. It wasn't until Sunday that members of the Administration finally said that Trump denounces white supremacists.\n\nFrazier, an African-American who became CEO of Merck in 2011, was among the chief executives to join the President's American Manufacturing Council on January 27. The other CEOs to join included Whirpool's Jeff Fettig, Ford's Mark Fields, General Electric's Jeff Immelt, Kevin Plank of Under Armour and Dennis Muilenburg of Beoing.\n\nTesla's Elon Musk and Disney's Robert Iger also left another Trump advisory council in June. They were members of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, but left in June after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the UN Paris climate accord.\n\nFrazier and Trump were on good terms until today. In July, Frazier traveled to the White House during \"Made in America Week\" to announce a partnership with Pfizer and Corning on \"valor glass.\" The project is set to add 1,000 jobs to the Corning plant in Vineland, New Jersey.\n\n\"This initiative will bring a key industry to our shores that for too long has been dominated by foreign countries,\" Trump said in July. \"This announcement

Prominent Democrats and Republicans criticized Trump's response to the violence over the weekend.\n\nA gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in Virginia took a deadly turn on Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters and killed at least one person.\n\nTrump had said \"many sides\" were involved, drawing fire from across the political spectrum for not specifically denouncing the far right.\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said in a statement announcing his resignation. (http://bit.ly/2fFnITM)\n\n\"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\" he said.\n\nTrump responded in a tweet, saying now that \"Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents the pharmaceutical industry and lobbies on its behalf in Congress, declined to offer a statement of support for Frazier or to comment on Trump's reaction.\n\nThe industry's silence comes as Trump is finalizing an executive order on drug prices that would relax industry regulation and contains measures that, some say, would protect existing drug prices or even increase them.\n\nIndividually, at least one CEO, John Maraganore of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, tweeted his support, saying he was \"proud to stand with leaders like Ken Frazier.\"\n\nMerck shares rose 0.6 percent in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, roughly in line with the wider market.\n\nFrazier has been at Merck for around 25 years, starting as general counsel of one of the drugmaker's subsidiaries in 1992. He became CEO of the company in 2011.\n\nFrazier frequently made political contributions during the 2016 election, donating to both Republican and Democratic members of Congress but no donations to a presidential candidate during the year.\n\nThe political PAC maintained by Merck and funded through donations from Merck employees made over $1.1 million in candidate contributions during the 2016 campaign - but did not contribute to Trump or his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission.\n\n\"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is,\" Paul Polman, the CEO of Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever Plc said in a tweet.\n\nOther top business leaders also spoke out in reaction to the violence in Charlottesville.\n\n\"Lincoln: 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together,\" Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted on Monday morning.\n\nA Dell spokeswoman said, \"While we would not comment on any member's personal decision, there's no change in Dell engaging with the Trump administration and governments around the world.\"\n\nSeveral executives from top U.S. companies have stepped down from a number of presidential advisory councils in protest to Trump policies.\n\nTesla Inc CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger left the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, in June, after Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Musk also left the manufacturing council.\n\nFormer Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe White House said Sunday that Trump's remarks condemning violence at a white nationalist rally were meant to include the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans criticized Trump for waiting too long to address the violence - his first major domestic crisis as president - and for failing when he did speak out to explicitly condemn white-supremacist marchers who ignited the melee.\n\nTrump on Saturday initially denounced what he called \"this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.\"\n\nOn Sunday, however, the White House added: \"The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "18:42:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "18:42:00",

Frazier, who is African-American, is the only CEO so far to leave one of Trump's advisory councils because of his reaction to the violence in Virginia. Prominent Democrats and Republicans criticized Trump's response to the violence over the weekend.\n\nThe gathering of hundreds of white nationalists took a deadly turn on Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters and killed at least one person. Trump had said \"many sides\" were involved, drawing fire from across the political spectrum for not specifically denouncing the far right. \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said in a statement announcing his resignation. (http://bit.ly/2fFnITM) \"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\" he said. Trump responded in a tweet, saying now that \"Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nThe son of a janitor, Frazier joined Merck as general counsel of one of the drugmaker's subsidiaries in 1992, working his way up to CEO of the company in 2011. He made his name as the company's top lawyer, steering it through daunting litigation over Vioxx, its widely used painkiller that was withdrawn in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks. Many observers thought Merck would eventually have to shell out $10 billion or more to thousands of plaintiffs over the drug's withdrawal. But Frazier's legal strategy led to a $4.85-billion settlement in 2007, allowing Merck to refocus on its pipeline of experimental medicines. Merck shares rose 0.6 percent in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, roughly in line with the wider market.\n\nFrazier frequently made political contributions during the 2016 election, donating to both Republican and Democratic members of Congress but no donations to a presidential candidate during the year. The political PAC maintained by Merck and funded through donations from Merck employees made over $1.1 million in candidate contributions during the 2016 campaign - but did not contribute to Trump or his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents the pharmaceutical industry and lobbies on its behalf in Congress, declined to offer a statement of support for Frazier or to comment on Trump's reaction.\n\nThe industry's silence comes as Trump is finalizing an executive order on drug prices that would relax industry regulation and contains measures that, some say, would protect existing drug prices or even increase them.\n\nIndividually, at least one CEO, John Maraganore of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, tweeted his support, saying he was \"proud to stand with leaders like Ken Frazier.\" Other top business leaders also spoke out in response to the violence in Charlottesville. \"I support Ken Frazier's decision. I'm thankful we have business leaders such as Ken to remind America of its better angels,\" said Hewlett Packard Enterprises CEO Meg Whitman, who ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2010.\n\nGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted: \"Lincoln: 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.\" Several executives from top U.S. companies have previously stepped down from a number of presidential advisory councils in protest to Trump policies. Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger left the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, in June, after Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Musk also left the manufacturing council.\n\nFormer Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies. The White House said Sunday that Trump's remarks condemning violence at a white nationalist rally were meant to include the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups. Democrats and Republicans criticized Trump for waiting too long to address the violence - his first major domestic crisis as president - and for failing when he did speak out to explicitly condemn white-supremacist marchers who ignited the melee.\n\nTrump on Saturday initially denounced what he called \"this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.\" On Sunday, however, the White House added: \"The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "18:24:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "18:24:00",

Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\n\"Our country's strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations and political beliefs,\" Frazier tweeted.\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said. \"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump has clashed this year with high-profile CEOs over his handling of policy matters. In June, Disney CEO Robert Iger and Tesla CEO Elon Musk quit another White House business advisory council over Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from a global climate-change treaty, called the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn February, former UBER CEO Travis Kalanick also quit advising Trump on business matters over the president's proposal to ban travel from seven Muslim countries. Trump has come under fire over the weekend for his refusal to specifically denounce neo-Nazis, KKK and other racists groups after their rally in Charlottesville resulted in at least three people killed and dozens more hurt.\n\nHis initial response, issued on Twitter, called for \"all\" to be united and \"condemn all that hate stands for.\"\n\nMany lawmakers -- including some Republicans -- considered his response to be inadequate given the tragedy and national outrage. Some of Trump's political opponents called it a \"dog whistle\" to his far-right voter bloc supporters.\n\nWe ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nFrazier, who in the past has donated to both Republicans and Democrats, sat beside Trump in February when the president had a roundtable discussion with pharmaceutical company executives.\n\nTrump urged the companies to lower their prices, but he also promised they would benefit from relaxed federal regulations, better trade deals and tax reform. He stopped short of repeating a campaign promise to have Medicare negotiate for drug discounts with manufacturers.\n\nFrazier also represented Merck at a White House event in July where his company and Pfizer announced an agreement with Corning to develop a new generation of stronger glass vials and an investment in manufacturing jobs.\n\nFrazier declined to comment further.\n\n\u00a9 2017

The decision comes hours after the CEO of pharmaceutical giant Merck announced he'd do the same.\n\nWhen Merck's boss, Kenneth C. Frazier, announced he'd leave the White House's council, he said it was a \"matter of personal conscience\" to \"take a stance against intolerance and extremism.\" Plank didn't explicitly reference the white supremacist-driven violence in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend, or President Trump's decision not to immediately single out those racists for blame.\n\nShortly after the president took office, Plank joined his White House Manufacturing Jobs Initiative in an advisory role. Plank appeared on CNBC and said Trump would be a \"real asset\" to the United States and hailed him for being friendly to business:\n\n\"He wants to build things. He wants to make bold decisions and be really decisive,\" Plank said, alluding to Trump's desire to bolster American manufacturing and his plans to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and pass a large infrastructure improvement bill.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of people that operate in the world of 'publish and iterate' versus 'think, think, think, think, think,'\" Plank said. \"So there's a lot that I respect there.\"\n\nPlank's praise of Trump didn't play well at home.\n\nPlank is a former football player at the University of Maryland. He started his business there and still runs it in Maryland today. Under Armour is headquartered in Baltimore, a deeply Democratic city in a solidly Democratic state. Hillary Clinton won 60 percent of the vote statewide, and she trounced Trump in Baltimore County and City. The president isn't popular there or in any of the big cities in that part of the country.\n\nUnder Armour is a national business, and how the CEO's political views gel with his home state's aren't everything on their own. But Under Armour has a big business presence in the state and works closely with state and local government.\n\nSome of Under Armour's biggest stars publicly broke with the guy who writes their endorsement checks. Stephen Curry agreed Trump was an asset -- if you removed the last two letters from the word \"asset.\" Dwayne Johnson said Plank lacked perspective. Misty Copeland said she \"strongly disagreed.\" Much of the apparel-buying public did, too, which is part of the risk when an executive speaks up about a polarizing politician.\n\nPlank took out a full-page open letter in the Baltimore Sun, where he backed off some of his Trump praise, which he said \"did not accurately reflect my intent.\" He expressed opposition to Trump's proposed (and since partially enacted) travel ban on visitors from some Muslim-majority countries, because it might affect his workforce.\n\n\"We stand firmly for equal rights,\" Plank's letter read. \"Through our investment, hiring and in everything we do, we expect to be leaders in the advancement of all forms of diversity and gender.\"\n\nAfter protesting in Charlottesville turned violent, Trump initially blamed \"many sides\" for the outbreak, declining to specifically condemn white supremacists. He read a speech on Monday, two days after the fighting, that singled them out.\n\nBut both times, Plank's comments have been measured.\n\nJust as looking too close to Trump isn't good, Plank and his communications team likely don't want to look too opposed, either. You don't need to look beyond Trump's Twitter account on Monday to see why.\n\nUnder Armour doesn't want to look too cozy with an unpopular president who's widely reviled in the state where the company is headquartered. But if Trump were to start tweeting about Nike's superiority to his brand, Plank might not like that, either. Not appearing offensive to customers who support or oppose him is a hard balance.\n\nDespite Trump's Twitter tirade against Merck, the company's stock finished Monday slightly more valuable than it started it.

Prominent Democrats and Republicans criticized Trump's response to the violence over the weekend.\n\nThe gathering of hundreds of white nationalists took a deadly turn on Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters and killed at least one person.\n\nTrump had said \"many sides\" were involved, drawing fire from across the political spectrum for not specifically denouncing the far right.\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said in a statement announcing his resignation.\n\n\"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\" he said.\n\nTrump responded in a tweet, saying now that \"Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nThe son of a janitor, Frazier joined Merck as general counsel of one of the drugmaker's subsidiaries in 1992, working his way up to CEO of the company in 2011.\n\nHe made his name as the company's top lawyer, steering it through daunting litigation over Vioxx, its widely used painkiller that was withdrawn in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks.\n\nMany observers thought Merck would eventually have to shell out $10 billion or more to thousands of plaintiffs over the drug's withdrawal.\n\nBut Frazier's legal strategy led to a $4.85-billion settlement in 2007, allowing Merck to refocus on its pipeline of experimental medicines.\n\nMerck shares rose 0.5 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, roughly in line with the wider market.\n\nFrazier frequently made political contributions during the 2016 election, donating to both Republican and Democratic members of Congress but no donations to a presidential candidate during the year.\n\nThe political PAC maintained by Merck and funded through donations from Merck employees made over $1.1 million in candidate contributions during the 2016 campaign - but did not contribute to Trump or his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents the pharmaceutical industry and lobbies on its behalf in Congress, declined to offer a statement of support for Frazier or to comment on Trump's reaction.\n\nThe industry's silence comes as Trump is finalizing an executive order on drug prices that would relax industry regulation and contains measures that, some say, would protect existing drug prices or even increase them.\n\nIndividually, at least one CEO, John Maraganore of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, tweeted his support, saying he was \"proud to stand with leaders like Ken Frazier.\"\n\nOther top business leaders also spoke out in response to the violence in Charlottesville.\n\n\"I support Ken Frazier's decision. I'm thankful we have business leaders such as Ken to remind America of its better angels,\" said Hewlett Packard Enterprises CEO Meg Whitman, who ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2010.\n\nGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted: \"Lincoln: 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.\"\n\nSeveral executives from top U.S. companies have previously stepped down from a number of presidential advisory councils in protest to Trump policies.\n\nTesla Inc CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger left the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, in June, after Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Musk also left the manufacturing council.\n\nFormer Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe White House said Sunday that Trump's remarks condemning violence at a white nationalist rally were meant to include the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans criticized Trump for waiting too long to address the violence - his first major domestic crisis as president - and for failing when he did speak out to explicitly condemn white-supremacist marchers who ignited the melee.\n\nTrump on Saturday initially denounced what he called \"this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.\"\n\nOn Sunday, however, the White House added: \"The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "19:34:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "19:34:00",

(AP) -- President Donald Trump lashed out at the CEO of the nation's third-largest pharmaceutical company after he resigned from a federal advisory council, citing the president's failure to explicitly rebuke the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nMerck CEO Kenneth Frazier wrote on Twitter Monday that \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which runs counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\"\n\nFrazier is one of the few African Americans to head a Fortune 500 company.\n\nRELATED: 1 dead, 35 injured after vehicle plows into counter-protesters at white nationalist rally\n\nTrump is under increasing pressure to call out the white supremacist and hate groups involved. He lashed out almost immediately on Monday following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nRELATED: Racist website 'Daily Stormer' calls Trump's comments 'good, really, really good'\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices -- the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates -- increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 percent and 6.2 percent per year. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices. Much of the furor over drug prices recently has been over increases that have been far bigger and come one after another for drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president. Trump eventually made a statement condemning bigotry Monday afternoon at a press conference.\n\nMeanwhile, other executives stated their support for Frazier.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow Linda A.

Trump's advisory jobs panel on Monday after the president was widely criticized\n\nPlank's statement, issued Monday night,\n\n, saying the company did not want to focus on \"politics.\"\n\nPlank said he joined the American Manufacturing Council because he believed it was important for Under Armour to \"have an active seat at the table and represent our industry.\"\n\n\"However, Under Armour engages in innovation and sports, not politics,\" Plank said in a statement posted to Twitter. \"I love our country and our company and will continue to focus my efforts on inspiring every person that they can do anything through the power of sport which promotes unity, diversity and inclusion.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier said he was leaving the manufacturing initiative, citing the president's failure to explicitly denounce those groups that marched in the rally.\n\n\"I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\" said Frazier, calling on America's leaders -- including Trump -- to clearly reject \"expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy.\"\n\nIn January, Frazier and Plank were named to the 28-member panel established by the White House to promote job growth.\n\nAppearing later Monday, Trump labeled members of the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists who participate in violence as \"criminals and thugs.\"\n\nNineteen people were injured and a woman was killed when a car plowed into counter-protesters. Another dozen or so people were injured in clashes between white nationalists and counter-protesters and two state troopers were killed when their helicopter, which was monitoring the rally, crashed.\n\n\"We are saddened by #Charlottesville,\" Plank said on Under Armour's Twitter account. \"There is no place for racism or discrimination in this world. We choose love & unity.\"\n\nBy mid-afternoon on Monday, a few hundred people had responded to Plank's message on Twitter, many of them urging him to quit the advisory group.\n\n\"Please keep us loyal to your brand by resigning from Trump's board,\" wrote one.\n\nAnother tweeter, Charles H. Bryan of Gladwin, Mich., wrote to Plank: \"You're in a position to send a real message to President Trump. You should do so.\"\n\nIn response to a question from the Baltimore Sun, Bryan added that each of the company CEOs who are part of the advisory panel should withdraw \"as a show of solidarity\" with Frazier.\n\nThe social media debate echoed one Under Armour faced in February after Plank was asked about Trump during a televised interview. Plank, who has contributed in the past both to Republican and Democratic elected officials in federal and state posts, told CNBC that having \"such a pro-business president is something that's a real asset to this country.\"\n\nA number of celebrity Under Armour endorsers -- including basketball star Stephen Curry and ballerina Misty Copeland -- released statements saying they did not agree with Plank's assessment.\n\n\"We engage in policy, not politics,\" Under Armour said at the time.\n\nTrump was quick to rebuke Frazier on Monday, lashing out on Twitter that the pharmaceuticals company CEO will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nFrazier is one of the few African-Americans to head a Fortune 500 company.\n\nOthers on the White House manufacturing council include top executives from Boeing, Dell Technologies, Dow Chemical and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nLike Plank, the other CEOs faced calls on social media Monday to resign, but none did.\n\nDow CEO Andrew Liveris issued a statement condemning the violence in Charlottesville and saying the company \"will continue to work to strengthen the social and economic fabric of the communities where it operates -- including supporting policies that help create employment opportunities in manufacturing and rebuild the American workforce.\"\n\nAnother panel member, Brian Krzanich of Intel, tweeted: \"There should be no hesitation in condemning hate speech or white supremacy by name.\"\n\nIn February, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick left the advisory group and said his participation had not meant that he favored the president's policies.\n\nElon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, resigned from the council and two other presidential advisory groups in June after Trump vowed to exit the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump did to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\njebarker@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/sunjeffbarker", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "01:21:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "01:21:00", "title":

From left are, White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner, Trump, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, and Ford CEO Mark Fields.

Frazier, one of the few African American CEOs in the Fortune 500, said \"I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism\" and touted the power of diversity. \"Our country's strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations and political beliefs.\"\n\nWithin an hour after the statement was first issued, Trump tweeted his response. \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\npic.twitter.com/a1PNQZism5\n\n-- Merck (@Merck) August 14, 2017\n\nNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2017\n\nFrazier's resignation followed an outcry by critics about how President Trump had responded to protests in Charlottesville, Va. over the weekend that were led by white supremacist groups and turned violent. Many questioned why Trump had not explicitly named neo-Nazi, Ku Klux Klan or white nationalist groups when he said \"we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,\" repeating \"on many sides\" for emphasis.\n\n[Trump condemns Charlottesville violence but doesn't single out white nationalists]\n\nA spokesman for Merck said the company had no further comment about Frazier's decision, his tweet, or the president's response. An email to spokespersons for the White House was not immediately returned.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, following the eruption of violence in Charlottesville that morning, Trump first made a general statement about the violence, tweeting that \"We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!\" Later Saturday, he read a statement that included his condemnation of \"hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.\" Critics, including Republicans in his own party, said he should directly condemn the groups by name.\n\nMr. President - we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism. https://t.co/PaPNiPPAoW\n\n-- Cory Gardner (@SenCoryGardner) August 12, 2017\n\nTrump's swift response -- and his willingness to go after an American CEO but not specifically name white supremacists in Charlottesville -- was noted by a number of observers Monday on social media.\n\nAdd Merck to list of groups/individuals that Trump has denounced more forcefully - by name - than the white nationalists in Charlottesville https://t.co/dGBYywq6fg\n\n-- Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) August 14, 2017\n\nLess than 1 hour after Frazier's announcement. Some events still get immediate response from president https://t.co/Ebal9r8Enk\n\n-- Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) August 14, 2017\n\nFrazier is not the first corporate chieftain to resign in protest from one of the president's advisory councils. In June, following the president's announcement that he planned to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, both Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney CEO Robert Iger resigned from White House advisory councils.\n\nLowering drug prices was a major campaign promise for Trump, and throughout the early part of the year, Trump made threatening and vague statements about the prices of drugs being too high. In the midst of one of the drug industry's biggest conferences in January, Trump accused the pharmaceutical industry of \"getting away with murder,\" fueling speculation that he might take action on drug prices that the industry has long fought -- such as allowing the government to bid on prices in the Medicare program.\n\nBut in the intervening months, industry leaders have grown increasingly confident that any governmental actions won't harm their business models. Pharmaceutical chief executives, including Frazier, met with Trump in January and came away from the meeting with the impression that they would not face a serious effort from the White House to lower drug prices through government negotiation on Medicare drug prices.\n\nKey leaders from across government have been meeting to discuss the issue of pricing, but based on leaked documents that have been circulating, including a potential draft executive order on drug pricing, Wall Street analysts have noted that some of the actions being proposed could actually help the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nCarolyn Johnson contributed to this report.\n\nRead also:\n\n'Climate change is real': CEOs share their disappointment over Trump's Paris accord exit\n\nLike On Leadership?

He lashed out almost immediately on Monday following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the US, including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices - the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates - increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 per cent and 6.2 per cent per year. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices.\n\nMuch of the furore over drug prices recently has been over increases that have been far bigger and come one after another for drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president. Trump eventually made a statement condemning bigotry Monday afternoon at a press conference.\n\nMeanwhile, other executives stated their support for Frazier.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks (at)Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighbourhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "21:59:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "00:58:00", "title": "Trump slams Merck CEO for quitting council",

(AP) - President Donald Trump lashed out at the CEO of the nation's third-largest pharmaceutical company after he resigned from a federal advisory council, citing the president's failure to immediately and explicitly rebuke the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nBy early afternoon, the president did issue a direct condemnation of hate groups, but it did not appear to tamp down criticism that it was not done over the weekend when fringe groups clashed with protesters.\n\nMerck CEO Kenneth Frazier wrote on Twitter Monday that \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which runs counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\"\n\nFILE - In this Thursday, Feb. 23, 2017, file photo, President Donald Trump, left, speaks during a meeting with manufacturing executives at the White House in Washington, including Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, center, and Ford CEO Mark Fields. Frazier is resigning from the President's American Manufacturing Council citing \"a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\" Frazier's resignation comes shortly after a violent confrontation between white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville, Va. Trump is being criticized for not explicitly condemning the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nFrazier is one of the few African Americans to head a Fortune 500 company.\n\nTrump mocked the executive almost immediately following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices - the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates - increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 percent and 6.2 percent. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president.\n\nOther corporate executives aired support for Frazier as well.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow Linda A.

The White House later stated that Trump was including \"white supremacists, KKK Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups\" in his remarks about the violence.\n\nFrazier's departure is the latest high-profile exit from a presidential business council since Trump took office in January.\n\nWhen Trump announced the U.S. would be leaving the Paris climate accord, both Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney CEO Bob Iger left his business advisory council.\n\nAnd in February, Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick left the same advisory council during the fallout from Trump's executive order that banned immigrants from seven Muslim countries.\n\n\"The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,\" Kalanick said at the time.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "14:25:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {"liCnt": 40}, "timeCrawl": "14:25:00", "title": "Merck CEO Resigns From A Trump Business Council, Citing His Conscience", "date": "2017-08-14", "uri": "709272876", "image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/08/14/gettyimages-819739236_wide-06c16f04824f27da3e596d4f1e35a05e696854cf.jpg?s=1400", "source": {"title": "NPR.org", "uri": "npr.org", "id": "78"}, "id": "9097333", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "wgt": 100, "id": 121}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 258}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "id": "233", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "id": "113913", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "id": "200134", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "type": "org", "id": "302546", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302718", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303051", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303321", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304262", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}, "type": "org", "id": "304900", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305262", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}, "type": "person", "id": "305547", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305969", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber_(company)", "label": {"eng": "Uber (company)"}, "type": "org", "id": "313247", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience", "label": {"eng": "Conscience"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313284", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream", "label": {"eng": "American Dream"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313957", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan", "label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "318256", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_&_Co.", "label": {"eng": "Merck & Co."}, "type": "org", "id": "321096", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homegrown_terrorism", "label": {"eng": "Domestic terrorism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "348655", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Iger", "label": {"eng": "Bob Iger"}, "type": "person", "id": "393556", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacism", "label": {"eng": "Supremacism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "415285", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Frazier", "label": {"eng": "Kenneth Frazier"}, "type": "person", "id": "961781", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kalanick", "label": {"eng": "Travis Kalanick"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1281217", "score": 1}]}

Frazier attends a meeting at the school's Worthington Scranton campus in Dunmore, Pennsylvania July 13, 2012. -- Reuters pic WASHINGTON, Aug 15 -- Merck & Co Inc chief executive Kenneth Frazier resigned from US President Donald Trump's American Manufacturing Council yesterday, saying he was taking a stand against intolerance and extremism.\n\nTrump denounced neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan as criminals and thugs yesterday, bowing to mounting political pressure after initially saying many sides were to blame after a white-nationalist rally turned deadly in Virginia.\n\nFrazier, who is African-American, is the only CEO so far to leave one of Trump's advisory councils because of his reaction to the violence in Virginia, although the AFL-CIO said it was considering pulling its representative on the committee. Prominent Democrats and Republicans criticised Trump's response to the violence over the weekend.\n\nThe gathering of hundreds of white nationalists took a deadly turn on Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters and killed at least one person.\n\nTrump had said \"many sides\" were involved, drawing fire from across the political spectrum for not specifically denouncing the far right.\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said in a statement announcing his resignation.\n\n\"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\" he said.\n\nTrump responded shortly after in a tweet, saying that now \"Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nTrump doubled down on his attack later in the day, tweeting that Merck \"is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the US Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!\"\n\nThe son of a janitor, Frazier joined Merck as general counsel of one of the drugmaker's subsidiaries in 1992, working his way up to CEO of the company in 2011.\n\nHe made his name as the company's top lawyer, steering it through daunting litigation over Vioxx, its widely used painkiller that was withdrawn in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks.\n\nMany observers thought Merck would eventually have to shell out US$10 billion (RM42.94 billion) or more to thousands of plaintiffs over the drug's withdrawal. But Frazier's legal strategy led to a US$4.85 billion settlement in 2007, allowing Merck to refocus on its pipeline of experimental medicines.\n\nMerck shares rose 0.5 per cent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, roughly in line with the wider market.\n\nFrazier frequently made political contributions during the 2016 election, donating to both Republican and Democratic members of Congress but making no donations to a presidential candidate during the year.\n\nThe political PAC maintained by Merck and funded through donations from Merck employees made over US$1.1 million in candidate contributions during the 2016 campaign - but did not contribute to Trump or his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents the pharmaceutical industry and lobbies on its behalf in Congress, declined to offer a statement of support for Frazier or to comment on Trump's reaction.\n\nThe industry's silence comes as Trump is finalizing an executive order on drug prices that would relax industry regulation and contains measures that, some say, would protect existing drug prices or even increase them.\n\nIndividually, at least one CEO, John Maraganore of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, tweeted his support, saying he was \"proud to stand with leaders like Ken Frazier.\"\n\nOther top business leaders also spoke out in response to the violence in Charlottesville.\n\n\"I support Ken Frazier's decision. I'm thankful we have business leaders such as Ken to remind America of its better angels,\" said Hewlett Packard Enterprises CEO Meg Whitman, who ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2010.\n\nGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted: \"Lincoln: 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.\"\n\nRichard Trumka, president of the largest federation of US labor unions, the AFL-CIO, questioned the council's effectiveness and said the group was mulling leaving.\n\n\"The AFL-CIO has unequivocally denounced the actions of bigoted domestic terrorists in Charlottesville and called on the president to do the same,\" Trumka said in a statement.\n\nSeveral executives from top US companies have previously stepped down from a number of presidential advisory councils in protest to Trump policies.\n\nTesla Inc CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger left the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, in June, after Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Musk also left the manufacturing council.\n\nFormer Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe White House said Sunday that Trump's remarks condemning violence at a white nationalist rally were meant to include the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans criticised Trump for waiting too long to address the violence -- his first major domestic crisis as president -- and for failing when he did speak out to explicitly condemn white-supremacist marchers who ignited the melee.\n\nTrump on Saturday initially denounced what he called \"this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\".\n\nOn Sunday, however, the White House added: \"The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.\" -- Reuters", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 187, "textStart": 174, "amb": false, "date": "2012-07-13"}, {"imp":

Merck's price rose 1 percent, the biggest jump the company has seen in roughly a month.\n\nThe company's CEO, Kenneth Frazier, resigned from the president's American Manufacturing Council Monday because of Trump's response to the violent attacks in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices -- the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates -- increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 percent and 6.2 percent. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president.\n\nOther corporate executives aired support for Frazier as well.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this story.\n\nBusiness Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nMake it your business.

Two state police officers died in a helicopter crash near the area.\n\nIn an appearance Saturday at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump faulted \"many sides\" for the violence. He made no mention of the far-right militia groups involved in the Charlottesville melee, some of whom were wearing Trump hats or T-shirts.\n\nWhite House officials have since made explicit they oppose bigotry and white supremacy. Several top officials, including Vice President Mike Pence and White House advisor Ivanka Trump, have spoken forcefully against hate groups.\n\nBut Trump, whose presidential campaign was championed by prominent white supremacists such as David Duke, has come under fire from many in his own party for not speaking out clearly on the matter.", "location": {"label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country":

Prominent Democrats and Republicans criticised Trump's response to the violence over the weekend.\n\nThe gathering of hundreds of white nationalists took a deadly turn on Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters and killed at least one person.\n\nGet The Straits Times\n\nnewsletters in your inboxSign Up\n\nTrump had said \"many sides\" were involved, drawing fire from across the political spectrum for not specifically denouncing the far right.\n\n\"America's leaders must honour our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said in a statement announcing his resignation.\n\n\"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\" he said.\n\nTrump responded shortly after in a tweet, saying that now\"Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nTrump doubled down on his attack later in the day, tweeting that Merck \"is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!\"\n\nThe son of a janitor, Frazier joined Merck as general counsel of one of the drugmaker's subsidiaries in 1992, working his way up to CEO of the company in 2011.\n\nHe made his name as the company's top lawyer, steering it through daunting litigation over Vioxx, its widely used painkiller that was withdrawn in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks.\n\nMany observers thought Merck would eventually have to shell out US$10 billion (S$13.6 billion) or more to thousands of plaintiffs over the drug's withdrawal. But Frazier's legal strategy led to a US$4.85 billion settlement in 2007, allowing Merck to refocus on its pipeline of experimental medicines.\n\nMerck shares rose 0.5 per cent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, roughly in line with the wider market.\n\nFrazier frequently made political contributions during the 2016 election, donating to both Republican and Democratic members of Congress but making no donations to a presidential candidate during the year.\n\nThe political PAC maintained by Merck and funded through donations from Merck employees made over US$1.1 million in candidate contributions during the 2016 campaign - but did not contribute to Trump or his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents the pharmaceutical industry and lobbies on its behalf in Congress, declined to offer a statement of support for Frazier or to comment on Trump's reaction.\n\nThe industry's silence comes as Trump is finalising an executive order on drug prices that would relax industry regulation and contains measures that, some say, would protect existing drug prices or even increase them.\n\nIndividually, at least one CEO, John Maraganore of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, tweeted his support, saying he was \"proud to stand with leaders like Ken Frazier.\"\n\nOther top business leaders also spoke out in response to the violence in Charlottesville. \"I support Ken Frazier's decision. I'm thankful we have business leaders such as Ken to remind America of its better angels,\" said Hewlett Packard Enterprises CEO Meg Whitman, who ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2010.\n\nGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted: \"Lincoln:'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.\"\n\nRichard Trumka, president of the largest federation of US labour unions, the AFL-CIO, questioned the council's effectiveness and said the group was mulling leaving.\n\n\"The AFL-CIO has unequivocally denounced the actions of bigoted domestic terrorists in Charlottesville and called on the president to do the same,\" Trumka said in a statement.\n\nSeveral executives from top U.S. companies have previously stepped down from a number of presidential advisory councils in protest to Trump policies.\n\nTesla Inc CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger left the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, in June, after Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Musk also left the manufacturing council.\n\nFormer Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe White House said Sunday that Trump's remarks condemning violence at a white nationalist rally were meant to include the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans criticised Trump for waiting too long to address the violence - his first major domestic crisis as president - and for failing when he did speak out to explicitly condemn white-supremacist marchers who ignited the melee.\n\nTrump on Saturday initially denounced what he called \"this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.\"\n\nOn Sunday, however, the White House added: \"The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textEnd": 160, "textStart": 154, "amb": false, "date": "2017-08-14"}], "time":

He lashed out almost immediately on Monday following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nThe president followed up later in the day, tweeting that Merck \"is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barbs, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices -- the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates -- increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 percent and 6.2 percent per year. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices. Much of the furor over drug prices recently has been over increases that have been far bigger and come one after another for drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president. Trump eventually made a statement condemning bigotry Monday afternoon at a press conference.\n\nMeanwhile, other executives stated their support for Frazier.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned from the manufacturing advisory council days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when they were very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak in Washington

(AP) -- President Donald Trump lashed out at the CEO of the nation's third-largest pharmaceutical company after he resigned from a federal advisory council, citing the president's failure to explicitly rebuke the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nMerck CEO Kenneth Frazier wrote on Twitter Monday that \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which runs counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\"\n\nFrazier is one of the few African Americans to head a Fortune 500 company.\n\nTrump is under increasing pressure to call out the white supremacist and hate groups involved. He lashed out almost immediately on Monday following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nThe president followed up later in the day, tweeting that Merck \"is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barbs, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices -- the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates -- increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 percent and 6.2 percent per year. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices. Much of the furor over drug prices recently has been over increases that have been far bigger and come one after another for drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president. Trump eventually made a statement condemning bigotry Monday afternoon at a press conference.\n\nMeanwhile, other executives stated their support for Frazier.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned from the manufacturing advisory council days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when they were very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow Linda A.

Frazier to the White House, calling him one of the \"great, great leaders of business in this country.\" On Monday morning, Trump singled out Frazier again, this time to express his displeasure over the pharmaceutical executive's abrupt decision to resign from the president's American manufacturing council.\n\nFrazier, citing a \"matter of personal conscience,\" said he felt \"a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism\" in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville and Trump's failure to quickly and explicitly condemn the white supremacists who organized the rally.\n\nIt took Trump just 54 minutes to respond, calling out Frazier among the legions of activists, celebrities and politicians from both parties expressing similar sentiments.\n\n\"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nFrazier, one of a handful of African American chief executives of Fortune 500 companies, is just the latest corporate executive to break with the administration. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Disney chief Robert Iger stepped down from their roles on White House advisory councils following Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. Former Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick, too, said he would no longer participate in a White House economic council, following an uproar in February over Trump's travel ban.\n\nLate Monday, Kevin Plank, CEO of Under Armour, said on Twitter that he, too, was stepping down from the Manufacturing Council.\n\nEver since Trump assumed office, executives have struggled to balance their desire to engage the White House on policy with the growing expectations by some that they exercise a voice on social issues -- all at the risk of alienating shareholders and customers on one side or another.\n\nExecutives at giants like General Electric, Dell and Dow tried to walk that fine line Monday, saying they would continue to work with the administration, in hopes of representing their companies' interests, even as they decried hate, bigotry and violent extremism.\n\nBut Frazier, without criticizing Trump by name, chose to part ways. \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy,\" Frazier said in a statement tweeted by Merck.\n\nSome rallied to support Frazier.\n\n\"I'm thankful we have business leaders such as Ken to remind America of its better angels,\" tweeted Meg Whitman, chief executive of technology services giant Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a Trump critic in the past.\n\nOthers criticized Frazier for undermining the president, who ultimately denounced white supremacists and neo-Nazis in remarks Monday afternoon, two days after the Charlottesville unrest.\n\nFrazier, chief executive of Merck since 2011, has not been shy about wading into sensitive issues. As a corporate lawyer, he took on a death-row appeal that led him to write about the injustices within the system for capital punishment. (James Willie \"Bo\" Cochran's conviction was ultimately overturned). While acting as CEO of Merck, he led a committee investigating child abuse by former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky. Under his leadership, Merck announced that its charitable foundation would suspend donations to the Boy Scouts of America over its anti-gay stance at the time. The Scouts have since changed their policy.\n\n\"Ken Frazier has been speaking truth to power since well before he crossed over to the ranks of the powerful,\" said Seamus Duffy, a partner at the law firm Drinker Biddle & Reath, who called Frazier a role model for him and a generation of lawyers. \"He's a man of principle, and I think he just couldn't let himself or his company be associated with an administration that would hesitate to condemn racism.\"\n\nFrazier found support among current and past Merck leaders.\n\n\"I have known Ken for 25 years, since I first recruited him to Merck. He is always smart, always ethical and repeatedly makes the right decisions. I applaud his decision to step down from the Council,\" Roy Vagelos, former chairman and chief executive of Merck said in a statement. \"Ken is driven by a strong sense of morality in everything he does and he continues to make me proud.\"\n\nThomas H. Glocer, former chief executive of Thomson Reuters and a Merck board member, encouraged other CEOs to do the same.\n\n\"Ken has stood up for true American values,\" he wrote in a tweet. \"I call on all other members of Trump's image-burnishing committees to do the same.\"\n\nFrazier rose to prominence at Merck when, as general counsel, he was the architect of the company's legal strategy to aggressively defend itself against lawsuits from people who suffered heart attacks and strokes while taking its Vioxx painkiller. The company eventually settled thousands of cases for $4.85 billion, a fraction of what analysts estimated the company might face if it stuck to its plan to fight every lawsuit.\n\nA Merck spokeswoman said the company had nothing to add beyond Frazier's statement and declined a request to interview him.\n\nTrump has courted the business community assiduously in his presidency, filling his Cabinet with business leaders and inviting CEOs from various industries to Trump Tower and the White House to advise on an agenda he promised would cut taxes, eliminate regulations and boost jobs.\n\n\"We'll have these meetings every -- whenever you need them, actually -- but I would say every quarter, perhaps,\" Trump said at one gathering.\n\nAt an early meeting with pharmaceutical companies, Frazier sat at Trump's side. Just last month, Frazier was at the White House again, standing beside Trump, with other chief executives, as the president championed an initiative to manufacture better glass packing for drugs.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump's tweet could portend negative repercussions for Merck or the pharmaceutical industry generally. Trump has repeatedly promised to bring down drug prices and has used harsh language to describe the industry, but has not taken any strong actions.\n\nThe president, though, continued to press his cause Monday night, tweeting: \"@Merck Pharma is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!\"\n\nUltimately, those who know Frazier said he acted as he did because of his deep convictions, which have guided him throughout his career.\n\n\"This is one of the finest men I've ever met,\" said Jim Sweet, former chairman of Drinker Biddle & Reath, who has known Frazier for four decades -- since Frazier was a summer intern at the law firm. \"If he knew that [Trump's tweet] was coming and that was the response, he would have done it anyway. That wouldn't have inhibited him.\"\n\nSintia Radu contributed to this report.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "00:38:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {"liCnt": 3},

Frazier, one of the few African-American CEOs in the Fortune 500, said \"I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism\" and touted the power of diversity. \"Our country's strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations and political beliefs.\"\n\nWithin an hour after the statement was first issued, Trump tweeted his response. \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nFrazier's resignation followed an outcry by critics about how President Trump had responded to protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend that were led by white supremacist groups and turned violent. Many questioned why Trump had not explicitly named neo-Nazi, Ku Klux Klan or white nationalist groups when he said \"we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,\" repeating \"on many sides\" for emphasis.\n\nA spokesman for Merck said the company had no further comment about Frazier's decision, his tweet or the president's response. An email to spokespersons for the White House was not immediately returned.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, following the eruption of violence in Charlottesville that morning, Trump first made a general statement about the violence, tweeting that \"We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!\" Later Saturday, he read a statement that included his condemnation of \"hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.\" Critics, including Republicans in his own party, said he should directly condemn the groups by name.\n\nSen. Cory Gardner, R-Colorado, tweeted, \"Mr. President -- we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism.\"\n\nTrump's swift response -- and his willingness to go after an American CEO but not specifically name white supremacists in Charlottesville -- was noted by a number of observers Monday on social media.\n\nFrazier is not the first corporate chieftain to resign in protest from one of the president's advisory councils. In June, following the president's announcement that he planned to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, both Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney CEO Robert Iger resigned from White House advisory councils.\n\nLowering drug prices was a major campaign promise for Trump, and throughout the early part of the year, Trump made threatening and vague statements about the prices of drugs being too high. In the midst of one of the drug industry's biggest conferences in January, Trump accused the pharmaceutical industry of \"getting away with murder,\" fueling speculation that he might take action on drug prices that the industry has long fought -- such as allowing the government to bid on prices in the Medicare program.\n\nBut in the intervening months, industry leaders have grown increasingly confident that any governmental actions won't harm their business models. Pharmaceutical chief executives, including Frazier, met with Trump in January and came away from the meeting with the impression that they would not face a serious effort from the White House to lower drug prices through government negotiation on Medicare drug prices.\n\nKey leaders from across government have been meeting to discuss the issue of pricing, but based on leaked documents that have been circulating, including a potential draft executive order on drug pricing, Wall Street analysts have noted that some of the actions being proposed could actually help the pharmaceutical industry.", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 215, "textStart": 202, "amb": false, "date": "2017-02-23"}], "time": "15:44:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl":

Buzz60\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nMerck CEO Ken Frazier quit President Donald Trump's manufacturing business council on Monday, after the president's widely criticized response to violence that erupted after a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.\n\nThe resignation prompted an angry response from Trump on Twitter. \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!,\" Trump tweeted.\n\npic.twitter.com/a1PNQZism5 -- Merck (@Merck)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\n\"Our country's strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations and political beliefs,\" Frazier tweeted.\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said. \"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\nOne of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers, Merck develops and makes a wide variety of vaccines and drugs, including allergy medicine Clarinex and cholesterol treatments Zocor and Vytorin.\n\nMerck declined to comment on Trump's response tweet regarding lowering drug prices. Prices for the most popular brand-name drugs in the U.S. rose 208% from 2008 to 2016, according to AARP. In January, Merck issued its own pricing report that showed seven years of price hikes. Prices for its drugs rose on average 9% since 2010, it said.\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSE\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Saturday there was \"no place\" in the United States for the kind of violence that broke out at a white nationalist rally in Virginia and appealed to Americans to \"come together as one.\" (Aug. 12) AP\n\nRep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democrat from Mercer County who got to know Frazier when they were seated together at an event honoring black fraternities a few years ago, praised his decision.\n\n\"A lot of good people who may not have voted for this president were willing to work with him,\" Watson Coleman said. \"By his incompetence or his ignorance, he is pushing them to a point where they can't associate themselves with him.\"\n\nFrazier was also praised by Dr. Roy Vagelos, a former Merck CEO.\n\n\"I have known Ken for 25 years, since I first recruited him to Merck,\" said Vagelos, who is now chairman of Regeneron. \"I applaud his decision to step down from the council this morning. Ken is driven by a strong sense of morality in everything he does.\"\n\nTrump came under fire over the weekend for his refusal to denounce neo-Nazis and white supremacists after their rally in Charlottesville resulted in at least three people killed and dozens more hurt.\n\nInstead, his statement denouncing hate and violence said it had come from \"many sides.\"\n\nTrump was more direct speaking from the White House on Monday.\n\n\"Racism is evil,\" Trump said. \"And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\"\n\nRep. Leonard Lance, a Republican from Hunterdon County whose district includes Merck's headquarters in Kenilworth, said he wished Trump had been that clear on Saturday.\n\nLance called Frazier an \"able CEO\" whose company is important to the state, and said he hoped Trump's follow-up remarks would have an effect.\n\n\"I hope the president can continue to rely on his advice, and I hope Mr. Frazier will consider the situation after the president's remarks today,\" Lance said.\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for comment about Trump's statement.\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump has clashed this year with high-profile CEOs over his handling of policy matters. In June, Disney CEO Robert Iger and Tesla CEO Elon Musk quit another White House business advisory council over Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from a global climate-change treaty, called the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn February, former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick also quit advising Trump on business matters, over the president's proposal to ban travel from seven Muslim countries.\n\nFrazier, who in the past has donated to both Republicans and Democrats, sat beside Trump in late January when the president had a round-table discussion with pharmaceutical company executives.\n\nTrump urged the companies to lower their prices, but he also promised they would benefit from relaxed federal regulations, better trade deals and tax reform. He stopped short of repeating a campaign promise to have Medicare negotiate for drug discounts with manufacturers.\n\nFrazier also represented Merck at a White House event in July where his company and Pfizer announced an agreement with Corning to develop a new generation of stronger glass vials and an investment in manufacturing jobs.\n\nFrazier declined to comment further. The Harvard-trained lawyer took over the job in 2010 after he spent years working his way up the corporate ladder, including stints as general counsel and head of the company's global human health business.\n\nShares of Merck rose 29 cents to $62.67 on Monday.\n\nMost of the companies whose CEOs are on the manufacturing council declined to comment.\n\nBut AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said the president's manufacturing council hasn't held \"any real meeting\" and the labor union group is \"assessing our role.\"\n\n\"The AFL-CIO has unequivocally denounced the actions of bigoted domestic terrorists in Charlottesville and called on the president to do the same,\" Trumka said. \"There are real questions into the effectiveness of this council to deliver real policy that lifts working families.\"\n\nGE, whose former CEO and current board Chairman Jeff Immelt is a member of the manufacturing council, said Immelt plans to remain on the council while he's still board chairman. He will step down as the company's board chairman at the end of the year.\n\n\"GE has no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism, and we strongly condemn the violent extremism in Charlottesville over the weekend,\" the company said in a statement. \"With more than 100,000 employees in the United States, it is important for GE to participate in the discussion on how to drive growth and productivity in the U.S.\"\n\nIn a statement, computer maker Dell Technologies, whose CEO Michael Dell is a council member, said there was no change \"in Dell engaging with the Trump administration and governments around the world to share our perspective on policy issues that affect our company, our customers and our employees.\"\n\nDow Chemical Co. and Campbell Soup also confirmed that their CEOs will remain on the council but condemned expressions of racism.\n\nIn January, in response to Merck's pricing report, Robert Weissman, president of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said Merck and Trump \"are both villains, except that Trump is the one who has a position where we should expect action to lower prices. But that's not happening.\"\n\nFacing more competition from generic drug makers, Merck reported second-quarter sales that were relatively flat. Revenue rose 0.8% year over year to $9.9 billion, it reported in late July. Net income rose 61% to $1.95 billion.\n\nThe company also said a cyberattack significantly disrupted its operations, including sales and delivery of products to customers.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2

He lashed out almost immediately on Monday following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices -- the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates -- increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 percent and 6.2 percent per year. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices. Much of the furor over drug prices recently has been over increases that have been far bigger and come one after another for drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president. Trump eventually made a statement condemning bigotry Monday afternoon at a press conference.\n\nMeanwhile, other executives stated their support for Frazier.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time":

(AP) -- President Donald Trump lashed out at the CEO of the nation's third-largest pharmaceutical company after he resigned from a federal advisory council, citing the president's failure to explicitly rebuke the White nationalists who marched in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nMerck CEO Kenneth Frazier wrote on Twitter Monday that \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which runs counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\"\n\nFrazier is one of the few African Americans to head a Fortune 500 company.\n\nTrump is under increasing pressure to call out the White supremacist and hate groups involved. He lashed out almost immediately on Monday following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has maneuvered to push prices lower, at least on some drugs.\n\nLast year, the company launched a new hepatitis C medicine at a big discount to the drugs already on the market. In January, Merck reported that since 2010 its annual average net price increase has ranged from 3.4 percent to 6.2 percent, roughly half its list price increases. Other drugmakers have hiked list prices 20 percent or more every year and launched new drugs with eye-popping price tags.\n\nMerck also is developing cheaper versions of complex injected medicines called biologics that can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president.\n\nThere was also support from other executives.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman on Twitter wrote, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.

He lashed out almost immediately on Monday following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices - the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates - increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 percent and 6.2 percent per year. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices. Much of the furor over drug prices recently has been over increases that have been far bigger and come one after another for drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president. Trump eventually made a statement condemning bigotry Monday afternoon at a press conference.\n\nMeanwhile, other executives stated their support for Frazier.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks (at)Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time":

Johnson, The Associated Press on August 14, 2017.\n\nTRENTON, N.J. - President Donald Trump lashed out at the CEO of the nation's third-largest pharmaceutical company after he resigned from a federal advisory council, citing the president's failure to explicitly rebuke the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nMerck CEO Kenneth Frazier wrote on Twitter Monday that \"America's leaders must honour our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which runs counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\"\n\nFrazier is one of the few African Americans to head a Fortune 500 company.\n\nTrump is under increasing pressure to call out the white supremacist and hate groups involved. He lashed out almost immediately on Monday following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices - the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates - increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 per cent and 6.2 per cent per year. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices. Much of the furor over drug prices recently has been over increases that have been far bigger and come one after another for drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president. Trump eventually made a statement condemning bigotry Monday afternoon at a press conference.\n\nMeanwhile, other executives stated their support for Frazier.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighbourhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak in Washington

Crain's reached out to both companies to ask if the two men will continue to serve on the councils and will update this story once they respond.\n\nTrump is under increasing pressure to call out the white supremacist and hate groups involved. He lashed out almost immediately on Monday following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices -- the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates -- increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 percent and 6.2 percent per year. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices. Much of the furor over drug prices recently has been over increases that have been far bigger and come one after another for drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president. Trump eventually made a statement condemning bigotry Monday afternoon at a press conference.\n\nMeanwhile, other executives stated their support for Frazier.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time":

He lashed out almost immediately on Monday following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices _ the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates _ increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 per cent and 6.2 per cent per year. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices. Much of the furor over drug prices recently has been over increases that have been far bigger and come one after another for drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president. Trump eventually made a statement condemning bigotry Monday afternoon at a press conference.\n\nMeanwhile, other executives stated their support for Frazier.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks ?Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighbourhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter\n\nGet our daily briefing on innovation, leadership, technology & the economy.\n\nWeekdays at 6 AM ET.

He lashed out almost immediately on Monday following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nThe president followed up later in the day, tweeting that Merck \"is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barbs, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices - the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates - increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 percent and 6.2 percent per year. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices. Much of the furor over drug prices recently has been over increases that have been far bigger and come one after another for drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president. Trump eventually made a statement condemning bigotry Monday afternoon at a press conference.\n\nMeanwhile, other executives stated their support for Frazier.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned from the manufacturing advisory council days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when they were very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow Linda A.

Frazier's resignation -- the latest CEO to quit one of Trump's high-profile executive advisory groups -- comes after a weekend of violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, that resulted in one death.\n\nFrazier is an African-American CEO -- a rarity in large American corporations -- and Merck has sometimes taken stands on social issues. In 2012, the Kenilworth, New Jersey-based company's foundation ended funding for the Boy Scouts of America over the group's exclusion of gays from its leadership ranks. He is a registered Democrat, according to Pennsylvania voter records.\n\nCEO departures\n\nOther chief executives have also stepped down from the various business-advisory groups pulled together by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Elon Musk of Tesla Inc. and Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger quit a strategy and policy panel after Trump withdrew from the Paris climate pact.\n\nFormer Uber Technologies Inc. CEO Travis Kalanick quit in February after Trump's executive order on immigration. The manufacturing group, spearheaded by Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris, hasn't met in five months.\n\nTrump made US drug prices an issue during the presidential campaign and after -- at one point accusing drug companies of \"getting away with murder.\" While his rhetoric on the subject has cooled, the Food and Drug Administration has taken steps to try and bring more competition to the market for some drugs, and speed more generic drugs to the market.\n\nFrazier, in December, said his company has a \"restrained\" approach to price increases, calling aggressive price increases a foolhardy move by the industry.\n\nMerck shares were up less than 1% in trading before the markets opened in New York.

One protester was killed and 19 people were injured.\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said in a statement released Monday morning on Twitter.\n\npic.twitter.com/a1PNQZism5 -- Merck (@Merck)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nThe president immediately fired back his own criticism of Frazier, saying on Twitter that the CEO should concentrate on lowering \"ripoff drug prices.\"\n\nNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nTrump responded to Saturday's violence by blaming bigotry on \"many sides.\" He has not explicitly condemned the white supremacists, although Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Monday the president had \"explicitly condemned\" violence and \"he totally opposes\" the values espoused by white supremacy organizations.\n\nThe manufacturing council is an advisory group of executives from across the country. Led by Dow CEO Andrew Liveris, its members include leaders of Intel, Dell, General Electric and Lockheed Martin. Tesla CEO Elon Musk stepped down in June, in protest of Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords.\n\nFrazier said in his statement that his decision was made not only as CEO of Merck, the country's third-largest pharmaceutical company, but as a \"matter of personal conscience.\"\n\n\"I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\" he said.\n\nHeadquartered in Kenilworth, New Jersey, Merck employs thousands of people in Pennsylvania, most at its sprawling West Point vaccine manufacturing plant in Upper Gwynedd.

(AP) - President Donald Trump lashed out at the CEO of the nation's third-largest pharmaceutical company after he resigned from a federal advisory council, citing the president's failure to immediately and explicitly rebuke the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nBy early afternoon, the president did issue a direct condemnation of hate groups, but it did not appear to tamp down criticism that it was not done over the weekend when fringe groups clashed with protesters.\n\nMerck CEO Kenneth Frazier wrote on Twitter Monday that \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which runs counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\"\n\nFrazier is one of the few African Americans to head a Fortune 500 company.\n\nTrump mocked the executive almost immediately following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices - the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates - increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 percent and 6.2 percent. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president.\n\nOther corporate executives aired support for Frazier as well.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow Linda A.

Prominent Democrats and Republicans criticized Trump's response to the violence over the weekend.\n\nThe gathering of hundreds of white nationalists took a deadly turn on Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters and killed at least one person.\n\nTrump had said \"many sides\" were involved, drawing fire from across the political spectrum for not specifically denouncing the far right.\n\n\"America's leaders must honour our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said in a statement announcing his resignation.

But Frazier's legal strategy led to a $4.85-billion settlement in 2007, allowing Merck to refocus on its pipeline of experimental medicines.\n\nMerck shares rose 0.5 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, roughly in line with the wider market.\n\nFrazier frequently made political contributions during the 2016 election, donating to both Republican and Democratic members of Congress but no donations to a presidential candidate during the year.\n\nThe political PAC maintained by Merck and funded through donations from Merck employees made over $1.1 million in candidate contributions during the 2016 campaign - but did not contribute to Trump or his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents the pharmaceutical industry and lobbies on its behalf in Congress, declined to offer a statement of support for Frazier or to comment on Trump's reaction.\n\nThe industry's silence comes as Trump is finalising an executive order on drug prices that would relax industry regulation and contains measures that, some say, would protect existing drug prices or even increase them.\n\nIndividually, at least one CEO, John Maraganore of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals\n\nOther top business leaders also spoke out in response to the violence in Charlottesville.\n\n\"I support Ken Frazier's decision.

Less than a month ago, Frazier stood by Trump's side to announce a new project at the White House.\n\nFrazier, an African American lawyer, joined Merck in 1992. He became CEO in 2011 and also serves as chairman and president. According to FiercePharma, the 62-year-old Frazier earns $1.5 million in salary, $3.28 million in stock and $3.8 million worth of options. He also gets $2.5 million in incentive pay, $4.32 million in pension growth and deferred compensation, plus $57,850 in perks.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Frazier and his relationship with Trump.\n\nIn a statement on Merck's Twitter page, Frazier announced that he resigned from the President's American Manufacturing Council.\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said. \"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\n\"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES,\" Trump tweeted in response.\n\nTrump was widely criticized by politicians on both sides of the aisle on Saturday for not specifically denouncing white supremacists after a person was killed when a car plowed into counter-protesters at the \"Unite The Right\" tally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n\"We condemn in the strongest possible terms, this display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides. On many sides,\" Trump said during his Saturday speech.\n\nIt wasn't until Sunday and Monday that members of Trump's administration started publicly denouncing white supremacists. Attorney General Jeff Sessions told the media Monday that the attack was \"domestic terrorism.\"\n\nFrazier joined Trump's American Manufacturing Council on January 27. \"President Trump plans to continually seek information and perspectives from a diverse range of business leaders, including those listed below and others, on how best to promote job growth and get Americans back to work again,\" the White House said of the advisory board.\n\nOn July 20, Frazier went to the White House to meet with Trump during \"Made In America Week.\" As NJ.com reported, Trump announced that Merck, Pfizer and Corning were working together to make \"valor glass,\" a pharmaceutical glass packaging for vials and cartridges.\n\n\"This initiative will bring a key industry to our shores that for too long has been dominated by foreign countries,\" Trump said at the announcement. \"This announcement reflects a central theme of my administration that when we invest in America, it's a win for our companies, our workers, and our nation as a whole.\"\n\nThe project is expected to create 1,000 new jobs, including some at Corning's Vineland, New Jersey plant.\n\n\"Biologics today are on the leading edge of scientific innovation, and valor glass represents a similar advancement in materials science: glass that is purpose-built for medicines and vaccines,\" Frazier said in July.\n\nIn November 2011, Frazier was picked by the Penn State board of trustees to lead the committee investigating the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal. The committee hired Freeh, Sporkin & Sullivan to investigate, and the result was the Freeh Report.\n\nFrazier was criticized for firing football coach Joe Paterno. When Bill Cluck, a lawyer, questioned the report and its conclusions, Frazier lashed out, notes Centre Daily Times.\n\n\"I believe that we are entitled to look at the words and contemporaneous emails and other documents that draw the conclusions that we need to draw as a university,\" Frazier said.\n\nFrazier then issued several apologies. \"\"I employed an analogy that was unhelpful. Absolutely no offense was intended. I apologize,\" he said in the first apology. After consultation with Merck, a longer apology was issued in a Centre Daily Times letter to the editor.\n\n\"One of my core values is to treat people equally based on their abilities and character. This is likewise a fundamental value at both Penn State and Merck. The words I used did not reflect that principle,\" Frazier wrote. \"I hope that people will see my comments for what they were: a momentary lapse in judgment in the heat of frustration, and not a reflection on what I truly believe and stand for. My commitment to racial equality, diversity and social justice is well-established, and deepens my regret that my poorly chosen words have distracted from the important issues at Penn State.\"\n\nFrazier has been at Merck since 1992, after working as a lawyer at Drinker Biddle. The Harvard Law School graduate first worked as general counsel and was promoted to senior general counsel in 1999. During his tenure as a company lawyer, he led Merck's defense against litigation involving Vioxx. The Vioxx crisis ended with Merck paying out a $4.85 billion settlement, notes Reuters.\n\nIn 2006, he was promoted to executive vice president, then president of Merck & Co in 2010. In 2011, he was named CEO, becoming the first African-American to lead a major American pharmaceutical company.\n\n\"My biggest accomplishment is staying the course, I would say, at a time when investors are increasingly skeptical of pharmaceutical research and development,\" Merck told the Associated Press in 2013. \"We are one of the companies that didn't cut our research budget. We said we weren't going to do that, and our stock got pounded initially. (The stock price fell 17 percent in barely 9 months, then steadily rebounded, climbing from just under $30 to around $43 now.) I'm feeling a lot better about it than I was a year ago.\"\n\nFrazier is motivated to find a cure for Alzheimer's Disease because his late father suffered from the disease. Frazier told the Associated Press that his father was a janitor who spent his last days at Frazier's home with his wife. Frazier's mother died when he was a child.\n\n\"My father, to me, was 10 feet tall,\" Frazier told the AP. \"To see this disease take away his brain and to see him rendered like a child, it was devastating.\"\n\n\"At 85 you have a one in three chance of getting Alzheimer's or that form of dementia, so this is an incredible tsunami that's hitting our society given the fact that people are living longer,\" Frazier told Fox Business in January 2017.\n\nHe added that Merck is developing a new drug to treat it.\n\n\"We have a drug that we're actually going to get data on in the middle of 2017. It's called a BACE inhibitor. And what we know from human genetic studies is if you have lower levels of BACE, you're much less likely to have dementia,\" he told Fox Business. \"What we need is a drug that slows down the death of the neurons, slows down the dementia process.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2139, "textStart": 2129, "amb": false, "date": "-01-27"}, {"imp": true, "textEnd": 2424, "textStart":

President Trump has been rightfully criticized for his response to the violence -- but he just ramped it up to an entirely new level of \"how not to respond to incidents of white nationalist violence\" on Monday. Trump took to Twitter to bash Kenneth Frazier for having the fortitude to stand up to what is appearing more and more like the Trump administration's tacit acceptance of white nationalist values. Who is Kenneth Frazier? He's the CEO of Merck Pharmaceuticals, and until 8 a.m. Monday morning, was a member of the President's American Manufacturing Council -- but after Charlottesville and Trump's terrible response to it, has resigned.\n\nFrazier announced his resignation via a statement on by Merck's official Twitter account Monday morning, saying in part, \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\" His response is important: As Merck's CEO, Frazier is African-American -- and one of only a very few African-Americans running Fortune 500 companies.\n\nNaturally, the most presidential way to respond to Frazier's act of \"personal conscience,\" was for Trump to bash him on Twitter.\n\nAccording to CNN, Frazier was the only black male CEO of the President's American Manufacturing Council. Frazier was invited to the White House in July to promote an agreement between three major U.S. companies -- Merck, Pfizer, and Corning -- to create 1,000 new jobs as part of Trump's \"Made in America\" week. In January, Frazier and Trump shook hands at the council's first meeting. But after Monday's tweet, it's obvious that any previous job creation love Trump may have had for Frazier is apparently non-existent.\n\nFrazier isn't only the most prominent business mogul to leave the council -- but he's certainly the most recent. In June, Tesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from from two presidential councils, including the manufacturing council, over Trump's decision to pull out from the Paris climate agreement. Likewise, Disney CEO Bob Iger resigned from a separate presidential advisory council in June in protest of Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin wrote for The Washington Post encouraging that rest of the President's Manufacturing Council to follow Frazier's lead and resign in protest:\n\nFrazier's complete statement over his resignation from Trump's manufacturing council is below.\n\nWhile Trump has since issued a second statement on Charlottesville early Monday afternoon -- a clear \"do over\" from Trump's tone deaf \"many sides\" response from Saturday -- the damage has been done. Here's hoping that other business leaders will put their money where their mouths are and stand with Frazier against Trump's atrocious response to pro-Nazi violence by following Frazier's resignation with their own.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "14:17:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "19:45:00", "title": "Here's What You Need To Know About Kenneth

He lashed out almost immediately on Monday following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices -- the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates -- increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 percent and 6.2 percent per year. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices. Much of the furor over drug prices recently has been over increases that have been far bigger and come one after another for drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president. Trump eventually made a statement condemning bigotry Monday afternoon at a press conference.\n\nMeanwhile, other executives stated their support for Frazier.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow Linda A.

He lashed out almost immediately on Monday following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has maneuvered to push prices lower, at least on some drugs.\n\nLast year, the company launched a new hepatitis C medicine at a big discount to the drugs already on the market. In January, Merck reported that since 2010 its annual average net price increase has ranged from 3.4 percent to 6.2 percent, roughly half its list price increases. Other drugmakers have hiked list prices 20 percent or more every year and launched new drugs with eye-popping price tags.\n\nMerck also is developing cheaper versions of complex injected medicines called biologics that can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president.\n\nThere was also support from other executives.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman on Twitter wrote, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned from a White House advisory council for the same reason.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier, Musk and Iger, resign.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "17:26:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {},

Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\n---\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak in Washington

(Reuters)\n\nDonald Trump has lashed out against the CEO of a major pharmaceutical company who resigned from a federal advisory panel over the US President's failure to unequivocally criticise white supremacists widely blamed for recent race clashes that claimed three lives.\n\nTrump, resisting mounting pressure even from fellow Republicans to offer a more muscular condemnation, said of the resignation, \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nFrazier, who is African American, resigned on Monday morning from the council, the principal private sector panel advising the secretary of commerce, saying, \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\"\n\nFrazier is the latest CEO to resign from an advisory role in the Trump administration, joining Tesla's Elon Musk, who left after the president withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement, and Walt Disney's Robert Iger, who left as a matter of principle.\n\n\"As CEO of Merck, and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\" Frazier said in the statement.\n\nThe problem is Trump doesn't feel the same way, evidently, and has refused to offer a more direct condemnation of white supremacists, most of whom voted for him in the elections and lose no opportunity to remind him of it, if on the rare occasion he forgot or distanced himself from them.\n\n\"I would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists,\" David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan and a Trump supporter, tweeted after Trump tweeted a tame appeal for unity on Saturday.\n\nIn brief remarks later the same day, Trump said \"many sides\" were responsible for the violence, which critics said spared white supremacists and sought to spread the blame to counter-protestors. And which many among white supremacists and the Alt-Right said was a criticism of the counter-protestors.\n\nEven Republicans were appalled and urged Trump to do more. One of the most poignant was the appeal from Senator Orrin Hatch, who tweeted, \"We should call evil by its name. My brother didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home.\"\n\nInstead of condemning neo-Nazis, white supremacists and KKK members whose rally in Charlottesville -- to protest against the remove of a statue of Robert E Lee, the general who led the confederates in the American Civil War -- started the clashes, Trump has gone after Frazier.\n\nThe White House clarified in a statement from an unidentified official that Trump \"condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred. Of course that includes white supremacists, KKK neo-Nazi and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 154, "textStart": 141, "amb": false, "date": "2017-02-"}], "time": "15:18:00",

He lashed out almost immediately on Monday following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has maneuvered to push prices lower, at least on some drugs.\n\nLast year, the company launched a new hepatitis C medicine at a big discount to the drugs already on the market. In January, Merck reported that since 2010 its annual average net price increase has ranged from 3.4 percent to 6.2 percent, roughly half its list price increases. Other drugmakers have hiked list prices 20 percent or more every year and launched new drugs with eye-popping price tags.\n\nMerck also is developing cheaper versions of complex injected medicines called biologics that can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president.\n\nThere was also support from other executives.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman on Twitter wrote, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned from a White House advisory council for the same reason.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier

Ken noted that leaders of the U.S. like President Trump need to honor the values that the country is based upon by taking steps to clearly reject hate, racism, and bigotry. The 62-year-old Harvard Law educated Frazier called out the white nationalist and supremacy group melee that took place in Virginia with his statement.\n\nWhile Frazier's statement was posted to Twitter on Monday, August 14, at 8 a.m., President Trump would soon hit back with a statement of his own, knocking Ken. As seen in the below tweet, President Trump took to Twitter at 8:54 a.m., writing that since Frazier quit President Trump's American Manufacturing Council, Frazier would now have more time to lower what President Trump called \"ripoff drug prices.\"\n\nPresident Trump used an exclamation point to end his sentence and wrote the \"lower ripoff drug prices\" phrase in all capital letters, a move that means a person is typically yelling their statement.\n\nNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\n\n-- Donald J.

Frazier, one of the few African American CEOs in the Fortune 500, said \"I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism\" and touted the power of diversity. \"Our country's strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations and political beliefs.\"\n\nWithin an hour after the statement was first issued, Trump tweeted his response. \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nFrazier's resignation followed an outcry by critics about how President Trump had responded to protests in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend that were led by white supremacist groups and turned violent. Many questioned why Trump had not explicitly named neo-Nazi, Ku Klux Klan or white nationalist groups when he said, \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,\" repeating \"on many sides\" for emphasis.\n\nA spokesman for Merck said the company had no further comment about Frazier's decision, his tweet or the president's response. An email to spokespersons for the White House was not immediately returned.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, following the eruption of violence in Charlottesville that morning, Trump first made a general statement about the violence, tweeting that \"We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!\" Later Saturday, he read a statement that included his condemnation of \"hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.\" Critics, including Republicans in his own party, said he should directly condemn the groups by name.\n\nSen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., tweeted, \"Mr. President - we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism.\"\n\nTrump's swift response - and his willingness to go after an American CEO but not specifically name white supremacists in Charlottesville - was noted by a number of observers Monday on social media.\n\nFrazier is not the first corporate chieftain to resign in protest from one of the president's advisory councils. In June, following the president's announcement that he planned to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, both Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney CEO Robert Iger resigned from White House advisory councils.\n\nLowering drug prices was a major campaign promise for Trump, and throughout the early part of the year, Trump made threatening and vague statements about the prices of drugs being too high. In the midst of one of the drug industry's biggest conferences in January, Trump accused the pharmaceutical industry of \"getting away with murder,\" fueling speculation that he might take action on drug prices that the industry has long fought - such as allowing the government to bid on prices in the Medicare program.\n\nBut in the intervening months, industry leaders have grown increasingly confident that any governmental actions won't harm their business models. Pharmaceutical chief executives, including Frazier, met with Trump in January and came away from the meeting with the impression that they would not face a serious effort from the White House to lower drug prices through government negotiation on Medicare drug prices.\n\nKey leaders from across government have been meeting to discuss the issue of pricing, but based on leaked documents that have been circulating, including a potential draft executive order on drug pricing, Wall Street analysts have noted that some of the actions being proposed could actually help the pharmaceutical industry.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "13:47:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "17:15:00", "title": "Trump fires back after Merck CEO resigns from

Kelly, pressed Trump to issue a more forceful rebuke after his comment Saturday that the violence in Charlottesville was initiated by \"many sides,\" prompting nearly universal criticism.\n\nThat pressure reached a boiling point early Monday after the president attacked the head of Merck pharmaceuticals, who is black, for quitting an advisory board over his failure to call out white nationalists.\n\nMerck's chief executive, Kenneth C. Frazier, resigned from the president's American Manufacturing Council on Monday, saying he objected to the president's statement Saturday blaming violence that left one woman dead on \"many sides.\"\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said in a tweet announcing he was stepping down from the panel.\n\nFrazier is one of just a handful of black chief executives of a Fortune 500 company.\n\nLess than an hour later, Trump responded on social media as he departed his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, for a day trip back to Washington.\n\nNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nTrump's shot at one of the country's best-known black executives prompted an immediate outpouring of support for Frazier from major figures in business, media and politics.\n\nThanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is pic.twitter.com/ckabeobZBL -- Paul Polman (@PaulPolman)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nIt's not unusual for Trump to attack, via Twitter, any public figure who ridicules, criticizes or even mildly questions his actions. But his decision to take on Frazier, a self-made multimillionaire who rose from a modest childhood in Philadelphia to attend Harvard Law School, was extraordinary given the wide-ranging criticism he has faced from both parties for not forcefully denouncing the neo-Nazis and Klan sympathizers who rampaged in Charlottesville.\n\nFrazier appeared next to Trump at the White House last month to announce an agreement among drugmakers that would create 1,000 jobs.\n\nHe is only the second African-American executive to lead a major pharmaceutical firm and rose in prominence as Merck's general counsel when he successfully defended the company against class-action lawsuits stemming from complications involving the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx.\n\nKeith Boykin, a former aide to President Bill Clinton who comments on politics and race for CNN, wrote in a tweet:\n\nIt took Trump 54 minutes to condemn Merck CEO Ken Frazier, but after several days he still has not condemned murdering white supremacists. https://t.co/ps9AVUTTH7 -- Keith Boykin (@keithboykin)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nFrazier's exit from the business council marks a mini-exodus of business leaders, resulting from the president's stances on social issues and the environment. His recent decision to leave the Paris climate accord prompted Elon Musk of Tesla to resign, as did the chief executive of Disney, Bob Iger, and Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman

That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president.\n\nOther corporate executives aired support for Frazier as well.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.

creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an

But he didn't let up on Merck and Frazier.\n\n\"@Merck Pharma is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!\" Trump tweeted.\n\n.@Merck Pharma is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nThe renewed criticism doubled down on the Monday morning tweet in which Trump referenced Frazier and Merck in connection with large U.S. price hikes for prescription drugs.\n\nNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nTrump's latest tweet appeared to take aim at the size of Merck's U.S. workforce. The company's most recent annual report said it employed approximately 26,500 people in the U.S. and Puerto Rico as of December 31, 2016. The domestic employees are part of Merck's roughly 68,000 worldwide work force, the report said.\n\nMerck declined to comment earlier Monday on Trump's tweet on lowering drug prices. U.S. costs for the most popular brand-name drugs in the nation have soared 208% from 2008 to 2016, according to social welfare organization AARP.\n\nIn January, Merck issued its own pricing report that showed prices of its drugs had risen 9% on average since 2010.\n\nRelated:\n\nMerck's CEO quits Trump's council over Charlottesville, the president claps back\n\nPresident Trump condemns white

It's been going on for a long time in our country. Not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama.

He just said the nation should come together. Nothing specific against us. He said that we need to study why people are so angry, and implied that there was hate... on both sides!\"\n\nThe user went on to add, \"There was virtually no counter-signaling of us at all. He said loves us all. Also refused to answer a question about White Nationalists supporting him.\"\n\nSeveral white supremacists, such as former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, said Saturday's rally was a sign of white America's determination to fulfill Donald Trump's promises to \"take [their] country back.\"\n\n\"We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump,\" Duke said on Saturday. \"That's what we believed in. That's why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he's going to take our country back.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the White House insisted on Sunday that the president's statement on Saturday included white supremacists. \"The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred. Of course that includes white supremacists, KKK Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.

on Monday to sign an executive action on China's trade policies.\n\nHe will likely face questions and criticism from the media over his initial response to the violence on Saturday.\n\nOn Monday, attorney general Jeff Sessions said the death of paralegal Heather Heyer, 32, who was killed when a car ploughed into a group of counter-protesters in Charlottesville \"does meet the definition of domestic terrorism in our statute\".\n\nHe told ABC: \"You can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation towards the most serious charges that can be brought, because this is an unequivocally unacceptable and evil attack that cannot be accepted in America.\"\n\nMr Sessions said he expects to hear more from Mr Trump after a meeting on Monday.\n\nA White House statement on

condemn 'repulsive' far-right protests\n\nMr Trump criticised Mr Frazier's decision on Twitter, but has come under fire himself for repeatedly not condemning the neo-Nazis who staged the initial rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nIn a tweet announcing his resignation, Mr Frazier said: \"America's leaders must honour our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\"\n\nThe US President hit back, saying that now that \"Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from the President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nMr Trump has claimed \"many sides\" were involved in the violence in Charlottesville, but has been heavily criticised across the political spectrum for not specifically denouncing the far right.\n\nThe US President has been at his New Jersey golf club on a \"working vacation\", but is expected to return to Washington on Monday to sign an executive action on China's trade policies.\n\nHe will likely face questions and criticism from the media over his initial response to the violence on Saturday.\n\nOn Monday, attorney general Jeff Sessions said the death of paralegal Heather Heyer, 32, who was killed when a car ploughed into a group of counter-protesters in Charlottesville \"does meet the definition of domestic terrorism in our statute\".\n\nHe told ABC: \"You can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation towards the most serious charges that can be brought, because this is an unequivocally unacceptable and evil attack that cannot be accepted in America.\"\n\nMr Sessions said he expects to hear more from Mr Trump after a meeting on Monday.\n\nA White House statement on Sunday said: \"The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.\n\n\"He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.\"\n\nSeveral executives from top US companies have stepped down from a number of presidential advisory councils in protest over Mr Trump's policies.\n\nTesla chief executive Elon Musk and Walt Disney chief executive Robert Iger quit the Strategic and Policy Forum in June after Mr Trump announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\n\nMr Musk has also left the manufacturing council.\n\nFormer Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick left the business advisory council in February amid

Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nThe council has included top executives from Boeing Co., Dow Chemical Co. and Johnson & Johnson. The move by Frazier -- the latest CEO to quit the groups -- comes after a weekend of violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, that resulted in one death.\n\nTrump, over the weekend, said \"many sides\" bore blame for the violence, though has so far not directly criticized the supremacist groups that were protesting the removal of a statue of the confederate war general Robert E. Lee. On Saturday, a man drove a Dodge Challenger into a group of counter-demonstrators, killing a woman.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said there is \"no bigger case right now that we are working on\" and said the attack with the car met the definition of domestic terrorism.\n\nFrazier is a black CEO -- a rarity in large American corporations -- and Merck has in the past taken stands on social issues. In 2012, the Kenilworth, New Jersey-based company's foundation ended funding for the Boy Scouts of America over the group's exclusion of gays from its leadership ranks. Frazier is a registered Democrat, according to Pennsylvania voter records.\n\nTrump created two CEO advisory groups early in his presidency. Blackstone Group CEO Steve Schwarzman leads one described as a strategy and policy forum, and Dow Chemical Co.'s Andrew Liveris organized a manufacturing initiative. After an initial burst of activity and press attention, the councils have fizzled with neither meeting since April.\n\nOther chief executives have also stepped down from the various business-advisory groups. Earlier this year, Elon Musk of Tesla Inc. and Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger quit the strategy and policy panel after Trump withdrew from the Paris climate pact. Former Uber Technologies Inc. CEO Travis Kalanick quit in February after Trump's executive order on immigration.\n\nTrump made U.S. drug prices an issue during the presidential campaign and after -- at one point accusing drug companies of \"getting away with murder.\" While his rhetoric on the subject has cooled, the Food and Drug Administration has taken steps to try and bring more competition to the market for some drugs, and speed more generic drugs to the market.\n\nFrazier, in December, said his company has a \"restrained\" approach to price increases, calling aggressive price increases a foolhardy move by the industry. In a company report published this year, Merck said it has a \"long history of making our medicines and vaccines accessible and affordable through responsible pricing practices.\"\n\nFor 2016, the list price on its drugs rose by 9.6% on average while the net price, which more closely reflects what is paid by consumers, rose 5.5%, according to the report.\n\nMerck shares were up 0.7% to $62.84 at 9:42 a.m. in New York.\n\nToby Cosgrove, the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, plans to remain on strategy and policy group, said to Eileen Sheil, a spokeswoman for the health system. She said the group hasn't met since April, and there are no meetings scheduled.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd Blankfein also took to Twitter Monday in response to the violence, citing former president Abraham Lincoln. \"A house divided against itself cannot stand,\" wrote Blankfein, whose inaugural tweet in June expressed disapproval over Trump's decision to ditch the Paris climate accord.", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 818, "textStart": 803, "amb": false, "date":

(AP) -- President Donald Trump lashed out at the CEO of the nation's third-largest pharmaceutical company after he resigned from a federal advisory council, citing the president's failure to immediately and explicitly rebuke the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nBy early afternoon, the president did issue a direct condemnation of hate groups, but it did not appear to tamp down criticism that it was not done over the weekend when fringe groups clashed with protesters.\n\nMerck CEO Kenneth Frazier wrote on Twitter Monday that \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which runs counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\"\n\nFrazier is one of the few African Americans to head a Fortune 500 company.\n\nTrump mocked the executive almost immediately following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices -- the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates -- increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 percent and 6.2 percent. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president.\n\nOther corporate executives aired support for Frazier as well.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this story.\n\n-- -- --\n\nFollow Linda A.

(AP) -- President Donald Trump lashed out at the CEO of the nation's third-largest pharmaceutical company after he resigned from a federal advisory council, citing the president's failure to immediately and explicitly rebuke the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nBy early afternoon, the president did issue a direct condemnation of hate groups, but it did not appear to tamp down criticism that it was not done over the weekend when fringe groups clashed with protesters.\n\nMerck CEO Kenneth Frazier wrote on Twitter Monday that \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which runs counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\"\n\nFrazier is one of the few African Americans to head a Fortune 500 company.\n\nTrump mocked the executive almost immediately following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices - the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates - increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 percent and 6.2 percent. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president.\n\nOther corporate executives aired support for Frazier as well.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\n---\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak in Washington

The move by Frazier -- the latest CEO to quit the groups -- comes after a weekend of violent clashes in Charlottesville, Va., that resulted in one death.\n\nTrump, over the weekend, said \"many sides\" bore blame for the violence, though has so far not directly criticized the supremacist groups that were protesting the removal of a statue of the confederate war general Robert E. Lee. On Saturday, a man drove a Dodge Challenger into a group of counterdemonstrators, killing a woman.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said there is \"no bigger case right now that we are working on\" and said the attack with the car met the definition of domestic terrorism.\n\nSocial Issues\n\nFrazier is a black CEO -- a rarity in large American corporations -- and Merck has in the past taken stands on social issues. In 2012, the Kenilworth, N.J.-based company's foundation ended funding for the Boy Scouts of America over the group's exclusion of gays from its leadership ranks. Frazier is a registered Democrat, according to Pennsylvania voter records.\n\nTrump created two CEO advisory groups early in his presidency. Blackstone Group CEO Steve Schwarzman leads one described as a strategy and policy forum, and Dow Chemical's Andrew Liveris organized a manufacturing initiative. After an initial burst of activity and press attention, the councils have fizzled with neither meeting since April.\n\nOther chief executives have also stepped down from the various business-advisory groups. Earlier this year, Elon Musk of Tesla and Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger quit the strategy and policy panel after Trump withdrew from the Paris climate pact. Former Uber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick quit in February after Trump's executive order on immigration.\n\nTrump made U.S. drug prices an issue during the presidential campaign and after -- at one point accusing drug companies of \"getting away with murder.\" While his rhetoric on the subject has cooled, the Food and Drug Administration has taken steps to try and bring more competition to the market for some drugs and speed more generic drugs to the market.\n\nMerck's Prices\n\nFrazier, in December, said his company has a \"restrained\" approach to price increases, calling aggressive price increases a foolhardy move by the industry. In a company report published this year, Merck said it has a \"long history of making our medicines and vaccines accessible and affordable through responsible pricing practices.\"\n\nFor 2016, the list price on its drugs rose by 9.6 per cent on average while the net price, which more closely reflects what is paid by consumers, rose 5.5 per cent, according to the report.\n\nMerck shares were up 0.25 per cent to $62.62 at 3:05 p.m. in New York.\n\nToby Cosgrove, the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, plans to remain on the strategy and policy group, said Eileen Sheil, a spokesperson for the health system. She said the group hasn't met since April, and there are no meetings scheduled.\n\nGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein also took to Twitter Monday in response to the violence, citing former president Abraham Lincoln.\n\n\"A house divided against itself cannot stand,\" wrote Blankfein, whose inaugural tweet in June expressed disapproval over Trump's decision to ditch the Paris climate accord.",

That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president.\n\nOther corporate executives aired support for Frazier as well.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time":

Frazier, chief executive of Merck, the pharmaceuticals company, on Monday resigned from President Donald Trump's American Manufacturing Council after the president failed to directly condemn the white nationalist protesters at the center of violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said in a statement. \"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against extremism.\"\n\nLess than an hour later, the president took aim at the Merck executive.\n\nTrump replied swiftly to Frazier on Twitter, suggesting that stepping down from the council would give him \"more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nLater in the day, Trump explicitly condemned hate groups including neo-Nazis and the KKK, offering the kind of sharp denunciation of racism that many critics believed was lacking over the weekend.\n\nBut the president's remarks came too late for Frazier, who resigned early Monday.\n\nBy midday, Frazier was joined by a handful of other executives as a voice of dissent in the business community, which has particular sway of the president, himself a businessman.\n\nLloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, posted a cryptic message on Twitter, quoting Abraham Lincoln.\n\n\"Lincoln: 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together,\" Blankfein wrote.\n\nTim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, also posted a statement opposing white supremacy and racism.\n\n\"We've seen the terror of white supremacy & racist violence before. It's a moral issue -- an affront to America. We must all stand against it,\" Cook wrote.\n\nAnd at least one other chief executive -- albeit of a foreign company -- came to Frazier's defense. Paul Polman, the chief executive of Unilever, signaled his support for the Merck boss on Twitter.\n\n\"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is,\" Polman wrote.\n\nGeneral Electric said in a statement that it \"has no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism,\" but added that its chairman and recently-retired chief executive, Jeff Immelt, will remain on the manufacturing council from which Frazier resigned.\n\nKevin Plank, Under Armour's chief executive, who is also on one of the president's advisory councils, issued a statement denouncing racism and discrimination. He stopped short of criticizing the president or his comments about Frazier.\n\nWith the exception of Frazier, no other major business leaders were explicitly distancing themselves from the president's advisory councils, or criticizing his response to the events in Charlottesville. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers criticized the president's response, which some viewed as muted and equivocal.\n\nTom Glocer, the former chief executive of Thomson Reuters, offered his support for Frazier on Twitter and called for other chief executives to step down from the president's advisory councils. \"Ken has stood up for true American values,\" he said.\n\nThis is not the first time the president's actions have caused a chief executive to walk away from a seat on one of his advisory councils.\n\nIn February, as Trump began to implement stringent new immigration rules, Travis Kalanick, then the chief executive of Uber Technologies, left the president's economic advisory council.\n\nAnd after Trump said he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, Elon Musk, Tesla's chief, and Robert Iger, Disney's chief, stepped down from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum.\n\nEven after Musk and Iger walked away in the wake of the president's withdrawal from the Paris agreement, most other chief executives stuck with Trump.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "20:50:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl":

That is about half as large as the increase in its retail prices.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media on Monday, with many people lauding Mr Frazier and blasting the president.\n\nOther corporate executives aired support for Mr Frazier as well.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter: \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nMr Frazier, who grew up in a poor neighbuorhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nMr Frazier and his siblings were raised by their caretaker father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nMr Frazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Mr Trump.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Company chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the president's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Mr Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Mr Frazier and Mr Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he could not \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Mr Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Mr Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Mr Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "19:10:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "19:10:00", "title": "Donald Trump slams drug firm CEO following resignation from advisory council", "date": "2017-08-14", "uri": "709399558", "image": "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/article36030463.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/PANews%20BT_P-b5743587-88d6-4828-a537-4bf77ac4e4f6_I1.jpg", "source": {"title": "Belfast Telegraph", "uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "id": "226"}, "id": "9145816", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals/Pharmaceuticals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals/Pharmaceuticals", "wgt": 100, "id": 239}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 258}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100, "id": 289}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 100, "id": 768}], "concepts": []}

Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein weighed in on Twitter, appearing to criticise the White House. Citing former US president Abraham Lincoln, who led the country during the Civil War, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs tweeted: \"Lincoln: 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.\"\n\nPaul Polman, the chief executive of Unilever, welcomed Mr Frazier's decision. The 61-year-old Dutch national, who has spent much of his career in the US and has an American wife, tweeted: \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nMr Frazier is not the first big business leader to resign from the White House advisory bodies set up by Mr Trump. In June, Tesla founder Elon Musk and Disney's chief executive Bob Iger quit over the president's decision to take the US out of the Paris climate accord.\n\nEarlier this year, the president hit out at the pharmaceutical industry over the high prices of drugs, accusing the sector of \"getting away with murder\". Mr Trump is expected to sign an executive order targeting drug pricing at some point this year, although the industry has been anticipating it would be more benign than feared.", "location": null,

That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices.\n\nThe exchange lit up social media on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president.\n\nOther corporate executives aired support for Frazier as well.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman wrote on Twitter, \"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between White supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council in June, and two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs council had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced, or, as with Frazier and Musk, resign.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak in Washington

Fred Katayama reports.\n\nMerck's chief executive, Kenneth Frazier, quit president Donald Trump's American Manufacturing Council Monday. He took that action over Trump's response to a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. Frazier wrote in a post on Merck's Twitter account: \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\" During the rally, a Nazi sympathizer drove a car into a crowd, killing one person and injuring 19 others. Overall, more than 30 people were injured in separate incidents. Two state police officers died in a helicopter crash after helping quell the unrest. Frazier's departure added to the many voices from both parties, Democrats and Republicans, saying that Trump waited too long to address the violence. They also blasted him for not condemning white-supremacist marchers widely seen as responsible for brutality. Trump responded to Frazier's resignation tweet on the same medium an hour later. He said: \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\" Under pressure to take a stronger stand against right-wing extremists, the White House issued a statement on Sunday. It said Trump condemns \"all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred, and, of course, that includes white supremacists, Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "19:23:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "19:23:00", "title": "Merck CEO pulls out of Trump panel", "date": "2017-08-14", "uri": "709404589", "image": "https://yospace-cds1.reuters.com/u/resize~ad1~1200/0/f/~image_jpeg~9999-1/1/m/d/h/q/1/vc38/reuters04?videoId=131591785", "source": {"title": "Reuters", "uri": "reuters.com", "id": "8"}, "id": "9147514", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100, "id": 393}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100, "id": 1241}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "id": "233", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "id": "200134", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "id": "242096", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "label": {"eng": "Police"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302532", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "type": "org", "id": "302546", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302677", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302718", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302813", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "type": "person", "id": "302942", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "type": "org", "id": "302944", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303051", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303910", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "type": "org", "id": "304050", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304262", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305969", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry", "label": {"eng": "Bigotry"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310173", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}, "type": "person", "id": "314090", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_&_Co.", "label": {"eng": "Merck & Co."}, "type": "org", "id": "321096", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "394340", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Frazier", "label": {"eng": "Kenneth Frazier"}, "type": "person", "id": "961781", "score": 5}]}

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2017\n\nIn the wake of Saturday's deadly rally in Charlottesville, Va., many critics, including Republicans, have criticized President Trump for not chastising the hundreds of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and Ku Klux Klan members whose views fueled the violence that left a counterprotester dead and indirectly resulted in the helicopter crash that killed two state troopers on protest duty.\n\n\"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence on many sides. On many sides,\" Trump said during a Saturday press conference from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J.\n\nRepublicans leaders, such as Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, strongly denounced white supremacy and called the views behind the gathering \"repugnant.\"\n\n\"Their tiki torches may be fueled by citronella but their ideas are fueled by hate, and have no place in civil society,\" said Sen. Orin Hatch (R., Utah). \"We should call evil by its name. My brother didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home.\"\n\nOn Sunday, a White House spokesperson clarified President Trump's comments in a statement that read, \"Of course\" the president condemns violence by \"white supremacists, KKK Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.\" On Sunday night, Vice President Mike Pence defended Trump's comments and called out the media for reporting on the widespread criticism of Trump's remarks.\n\n\"I take issue with the fact that many in the national media spent more time criticizing the president's words than they did criticizing those that perpetuated the violence to begin with,\" Pence said during a press conference in Cartagena, Colombia, according to a White House press pool report.\n\nA Penn State graduate, Frazier served as the chairman of a Penn State board of trustees' that hired Louis Freeh to lead the investigation of a pedophilia scandal involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. The commission found that Penn State administrators failed to take action to stop Sandusky.\n\nDespite his position atop the world's largest drug manufacturers, Frazier came from humble roots in North Philadelphia. He is the son of a Philadelphia janitor and graduated from Northeast High School. My colleague Chris Hepp wrote a profile of Frazier back in 2010 when he was first named to lead Merck, which is based in Kenilworth, New Jersey.\n\n\"Yes, by the accident of geography, my father's house was at 18th and Diamond Streets,\" Frazier said. \"But the standards of my father's house were universal in that he believed in hard work and the importance of education.\"\n\nRead more by Rob Tornoe Published: August 14, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 9:35 AM EDT | Updated: August 14, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 10:13 AM EDT\n\nThanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

(by Posted on Twitter)\n\nIn yet another fallout of the white racist actions in Charlottesville, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier resigned today from President Trump's American Manufacturing Council, citing a corporate and personal responsibility to speak against racism. Trump quickly responded with an angry Tweet against \"RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nThe news has an Austin connection, in that Merck & Co. recently announced it will create an IT hub in Austin, in partnership with the Dell Medical School and potentially located on the recently vacated site of University Medical Center-Brackenridge (replaced by Dell Seton Medical Center). Merck received economic incentives from the city of Austin and the Texas Enterprise Fund to encourage and support the move.\n\nIn a statement of resignation from the Council posted to Twitter, Frazier - one of few African-American CEOs among Fortune 500 companies - did not mention Trump directly, but wrote: \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry, and group supremacy.\"\n\nHe continued, \"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\nTrump, who hadn't yet denounced the explicitly racist nature of the Charlottesville demonstrations and violence (only criticizing violence \"on many sides\"), initially responded to Frazier's statement only by angrily tweeting that Frazier would now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\" Pressured by public response and his advisors, he eventually issued a statement saying, \"Racism is evil,\" and denouncing the \"white supremacist ... criminals and thugs\" who initiated the Charlottesville violence.\n\nFrazier and Merck will likely be applauded in Austin for the CEO's response. The company had taken some heat for requesting an incentive package, with the state's $6 million TEF contribution contingent upon City Council's approval of a 10-year, $856,000 performance-based incentive, dependent upon the creation of 600 high-wage jobs by 2026.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "17:18:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "00:55:00", "title": "Merck CEO Dumps Trump", "date": "2017-08-14", "uri": "709516173", "image": "http://www.austinchronicle.com/imager/b/original/2018980/7e44/MerckCEOStatement.jpg", "source": {"title": "Austin Chronicle", "uri": "austinchronicle.com", "id": "2577"}, "id": "9187554", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "wgt": 100, "id": 121}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100, "id": 232}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100, "id": 289}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 100, "id": 768}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100, "id": 1241}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "id": "233", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "id": "197616", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austin"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Austin"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "id": "200134", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "type": "org", "id": "302546", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302718", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "label": {"eng": "Crime"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302901", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302940", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence", "label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302966", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303097", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American", "label": {"eng": "African American"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304393", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive", "label": {"eng": "Incentive"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305379", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305969", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry", "label": {"eng": "Bigotry"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310173", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "label": {"eng": "Dell"}, "type": "org", "id": "311731", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500", "label": {"eng": "Fortune 500"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313132", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience", "label": {"eng": "Conscience"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313284", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_&_Co.", "label": {"eng": "Merck & Co."}, "type": "org", "id": "321096", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership", "label": {"eng": "Partnership"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "327605", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Enterprise_Fund", "label": {"eng": "Texas Enterprise Fund"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "643738", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seton_Medical_Center", "label": {"eng": "Seton Medical Center"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "864652", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Frazier", "label": {"eng": "Kenneth Frazier"}, "type": "person", "id": "961781", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Medical_School", "label": {"eng": "Dell Medical School"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1318728", "score": 3}]}

The move by Frazier -- the latest CEO to quit the groups -- comes after a weekend of violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, that resulted in one death.\n\nTrump, over the weekend, said \"many sides\" bore blame for the violence, though has so far not directly criticized the supremacist groups that were protesting the removal of a statue of the confederate war general Robert E. Lee. On Saturday, Aug. 12, a man drove a Dodge Challenger into a group of counter-demonstrators, killing a woman.\n\nFrazier is a black CEO -- a rarity in large American corporations -- and Merck has in the past taken stands on social issues. In 2012, the Kenilworth, N.J.-based company's foundation ended funding for the Boy Scouts of America over the group's exclusion of gays from its leadership ranks. Frazier is a registered Democrat, according to Pennsylvania voter records.\n\nTrump created two CEO advisory groups early in his presidency. Blackstone Group CEO Steve Schwarzman leads one described as a strategy and policy forum, and Dow Chemical Co.'s Andrew Liveris organized a manufacturing initiative. After an initial burst of activity and press attention, the councils have fizzled with neither meeting since April.\n\nOther chief executives have also stepped down from the various business-advisory groups. Earlier this year, Elon Musk of Tesla Inc. and Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger quit the strategy and policy panel after Trump withdrew from the Paris climate pact. Former Uber Technologies Inc.

He initially returned to Washington to meet with top administration officials and sign a presidential memorandum directing his US Trade Representative to determine whether an investigation is needed into China's laws and policies related to trade and intellectual property. This was the White House's latest attempt to clarify Trump's comments from Saturday. An unnamed White House official said Sunday that \"of course\" the President condemns \"white supremacists, KKK, neo-nazi and all extremist groups,\" but declined to explain why the President wasn't saying it himself. Trump also remained mum on Twitter, declining to send a single tweet of his own Sunday, only the fourth in his 207 days as president that Trump has gone a full day without tweeting a message of his own. Trump did, however, use Twitter on Monday to push his political message and settle a score: He slammed Ken Frazier, the CEO of Merck Pharma, who resigned from Trump's manufacturing council over his failure to condemn white supremacists. \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! -- Donald J.

Trump has since spoken about the events in Charlottesville and finally said the magic line: \"Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"freq": 3, "textStart": 542, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-14", "textEnd": 549, "amb": false}], "time": "16:40:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "19:45:00", "title": "Trump Immediately Calls Out a Black CEO, but Took 3 Days to Say \"Racism Is Evil\"", "date": "2017-08-14", "uri": "709412941", "image": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/DHjtaGzmyhfHjLavDda-kapopOY/fit-in/728xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/08/14/783/n/38761221/0f81fa625991e250c95b41.97060079_edit_img_twitter_post_image_file_16516765_1502728839.jpg", "source": {"title": "POPSUGAR Fashion", "uri": "popsugar.com", "id": "1481"}, "id": "9150789", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 258}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "id": "200134", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "type": "org", "id": "302546", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302718", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302940", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "type": "person", "id": "302942", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton", "label": {"eng": "Hillary Rodham Clinton"}, "type": "person", "id": "302951", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304262", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305262", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305969", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}, "type": "person", "id": "307368", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_&_Co.", "label": {"eng": "Merck & Co."}, "type": "org", "id": "321096", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "323517", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Frazier", "label": {"eng": "Kenneth Frazier"}, "type": "person", "id": "961781", "score": 3}]}

Trump's original statement on the chaos Saturday blamed \"hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,\" but did not call out white supremacists or neo-Nazis.\n\nEarly Monday, Frazier resigned from the presidential council in protest, and Trump almost immediately took to Twitter, saying, \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nBy criticizing Frazier, Trump made the Merck CEO's resignation from his council a much more visible act. (Several hours after the tweet, Trump made a second statement in which he criticized \"the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\")\n\nHere are seven things you probably didn't know about Frazier.\n\nThis is one of those facts that makes you stop and check a calendar--but yes, the CEO of a Fortune 500 company in the United States was the grandson of a slave.\n\nFrazier was born in 1954; his father had been born in 1900, and his grandfather in turn had been \"born into slavery\" in South Carolina, prior to the Emancipation Proclamation and end of the U.S. Civil War, Frazier explained in an interview.\n\nFrazier's story truly is that of a self-made man. His father had only a \"third grade education or what passed for a third grade education for an African American child in the state of South Carolina between 1906 and 1909,\" Frazier explained in the same interview.\n\nFrazier's mother died when he was 12, so his father, who worked as a janitor, \"had to play both roles.\"\n\nFrazier applied to and was accepted at the United States Military Academy, at the height of the Vietnam War. At the last minute however, he says an academy official realized that Frazier had skipped two grades in school, and was therefore graduating from high school at 16.\n\nThat meant he was still too young to be a West Point cadet. Given a choice between attending the academy's prep school or going straight to college at Penn State, he chose college.\n\nPerhaps not surprising to learn, given his family's modest means, but Frazier grew up in a tough inner-city neighborhood in Philadelphia in the 1960s before attending Penn State.\n\n\"I remember the first time I got off the Greyhound bus in State College,\" where Penn State is located. I knew I was some place very different and it literally changed my life,\" he said, adding, \"I remember the first time I left to come home ... for the Thanksgiving break. ... My concept of what the world was like [in terms of] possibility had completely transformed in just about six or eight weeks.\"\n\nFrazier went straight from Penn State to Harvard Law School, where he says he was one of the few people in his class who had gone to a state university (as opposed to an Ivy League university or one of the more elite private colleges.)\n\nAfter becoming an attorney, Frazier practiced with the Philadelphia law firm of Dinkler, Biddle & Reath, where Merck & Co. was one of his clients.\n\nFrazier \"went in-house,\" as lawyers call it, joining the general counsel's office at Merck & Co. in 1992, and ultimately becoming the company's senior general counsel.\n\nHe's credited with pursuing a litigation strategy over the company's Vioxx pain relief medicine that saved the company between $15 billion and $45 billion against what analysts had predicted it would cost.\n\nUnder Frazier's leadership, Merck has been \"plunging ahead\" with tens of millions of dollars to find a drug that could slow or cure Alzheimer's disease, even as \"most drugmakers\" have halted research or at least scaled in back in the face of research setbacks, according to Fox News.\n\nFrazier said part of his motivation here is the fact that he watched his father struggle with and ultimately succumb to the disease. It's a lucrative business however; as CEO, he's among the top tier of pharmaceutical company leaders, with a total package of about $25 million.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time":

One woman was killed and 19 injured.\n\nIn an appearance Saturday at his golf resort in New Jersey, Trump faulted \"many sides\" for the violence but made no specific mention of the white extremists involved in the melee, some of whom wore Trump hats and T-shirts.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions -- who was to meet Trump on Monday along with new FBI Director Christopher Wray -- said the car attack \"does meet the definition of domestic terrorism.\"\n\n\"We are pursuing it in the Department of Justice in every way that we can make a case,\" Sessions said in an interview on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" program.\n\n\"You can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation towards the most serious charges that can be brought because this is unequivocally an unacceptable, evil attack,\" he told ABC.\n\nThe Justice Department has launched a civil rights inquiry in connection with the incident, and the driver, a 20-year-old Ohio man who was said to have had a history of neo-Nazi beliefs, has been charged with second-degree murder.\n\nOn Monday, a judge denied bail for the suspected attacker, James Fields.\n\nFollowing the meeting with Sessions and Wray, Trump was expected to address the Charlottesville situation at the White House at 3:00 pm (1900 GMT), when he is to sign a memorandum on trade with China.\n\n- Backlash mounts -\n\nAfter a weekend of criticism of Trump from both sides of the political aisle, a prominent African-American businessman quit a presidential advisory body Monday to protest what he deemed an insufficient response.\n\nMerck CEO Kenneth Frazier (R) left Donald Trump's American Manufacturing Council on Monday over the president's response to the violence in Charlottesville\n\n\"Our country's strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations and political beliefs,\" Ken Frazier, chief executive of Merck Pharmaceutical, said in announcing his resignation from Trump's American Manufacturing Council.\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said.\n\n\"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\nTrump -- while still mum on the actual events in Charlottesville -- was quick to lash out at Frazier's move.\n\n\"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\" Trump said on Twitter.\n\n- 'Dangerous fringe groups' -\n\nAlready on Sunday, the White House and top administration officials strove to defend the president.\n\n\"The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred,\" the White House said in a statement. \"Of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.\"\n\n\"These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms,\" Vice President Mike Pence said at a news conference in Cartagena, Colombia.\n\nPeople hold a vigil in front of the White House following the death of an anti-racism protestor in an attack in Charlottesville\n\nBut Pence also defended Trump, saying the president \"clearly and unambiguously condemned the bigotry, violence and hatred\" on display in Charlottesville.\n\nThe Charlottesville mayor, Michael Signer, a Democrat, laid much of the blame for the violence directly at the president's feet, however, saying on CBS that Trump had created an atmosphere of \"coarseness, cynicism (and) bullying.\"\n\nOf the 19 people injured on Saturday, 10 remained hospitalized in good condition and nine had been released, the University of Virginia Health System said.\n\nTwo state police officers involved in the law enforcement deployment for the rally also died Saturday in a helicopter crash.\n\nTrump faced criticism during last year's presidential campaign for failing to quickly reject a vow of support from a former Ku Klux Klan leader, David Duke, though he eventually did so. Duke attended Saturday's rally.\n\nThe president has long had a following among white supremacist groups attracted to his nationalist rhetoric on immigration and other hot-button issues.", "location":

He chose, instead, to blame \"many sides\" for deadly incidents that left three people dead. The White House madly tried to spin Trump's words into some message of inclusion while arguing that he meant to condemn these groups (even though he didn't). One person who isn't buying this dance of evasion is Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, the only black member of Trump's American Manufacturing Council, who has chosen to resign with a (very) public statement:\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal. As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\nAnd almost as soon as the news broke, Trump -- who is still refusing to specifically denounce the aforementioned extremist groups -- paused whatever presidential business was at hand to lash out at Frazier: \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nIt is, of course, bad form to criticize the business practices of a member of one's manufacturing council, but Trump's gonna Trump. And he's gonna criticize a black CEO for resigning from a council but won't call out Nazis, which is a telling distinction.\n\nTrump's scheduled to address the press today at 3:00pm EST today while signing a memorandum on Chinese IP laws, and one can anticipate that the subject of Charlottesville will arise. Over the weekend, one Trump surrogate attempted to claim the president simply didn't want to \"dignify\" Nazis/white supremacists with a mention, but many people suspect that he simply doesn't want to alienate part of his fanbase.\n\nIndeed, the Daily Stormer site was thrilled that Trump did not forsake them: \"[Trump] refused to answer a question about White Nationalists supporting him. No condemnation at all. When asked to condemn, he just walked out of the room. Really, really good.

The company's former CEO, Dan DiMicco, served as a Trump trade adviser during the campaign and worked on the White House transition team.\n\nNucor's current CEO, John Ferriola, was listed as one of the 28 initial business leaders assisting with the White House's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.\n\n\"At Nucor, we condemn the violence that occurred this past weekend in Charlottesville and reject the hate, bigotry, and racism expressed at the demonstration,\" Nucor said in its statement Monday.\n\n\"As North America's largest steel producer, Nucor has engaged with several administrations to work on policies that help strengthen the U.S. manufacturing sector and provide opportunities for American workers. We believe a strong manufacturing sector is the backbone of a strong economy, and we will continue to serve as a member of the White House Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.\"\n\nMerck's CEO wrote on Twitter Monday that \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which runs counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\"\n\nFrazier is one of the few African-Americans to head a Fortune 500 company.\n\nTrump mocked the executive almost immediately following the resignation, saying on Twitter that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nDrugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them.\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nIn January, Merck reported that its average net prices - the amount the company receives after discounts and other rebates - increased in the years since 2010 in a range between 3.4 percent and 6.2 percent. That's about half as large as the increase in its retail prices.\n\nOther corporate executives aired support for Frazier as well.\n\nUnilever CEO Paul Polman took to Twitter to thank Frazier \"for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nFrazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters.\n\nFrazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump.

The forum is an advisory group. The two resignations from the business advisory group come after the president said he was withdrawing from the climate accord of Paris. Musk left the manufacturing council as well.\n\nFormer CEO at Uber Technologies Travis Kalanick quit an advisory council during February amidst pressure from employees and activists who opposed the immigration policies of the administration.\n\nEarlier this summer, Trump spoke about presidential action he might take on the pricing of drugs to address the high costs of prescriptions drugs that have increased over the past few years.\n\nTrump announced at the time that today's drug makers were getting away with murder. His comments came in January during one of his news conferences.\n\nNo word has been released if other CEOs of private businesses that sit on one of the president's councils have decided to resign in protest of his comments made Saturday.\n\nGet Analysts' Upgrades and Downgrades Daily -

Kelly, pressed Trump to issue a more forceful rebuke after his comment on Saturday that the violence in Charlottesville was initiated by \"many sides,\" prompting nearly universal criticism.\n\nThat pressure appeared to reach the boiling point early Monday after the president attacked the head of the pharmaceuticals company Merck, who is black, for quitting an advisory board over the president's initial failure to criticize white nationalists.\n\nEven after a wave of disapproval that encompassed a majority of Senate Republicans -- and stronger statements delivered by allies including Vice President Mike Pence and the president's own daughter Ivanka -- Donald Trump seemed reluctant to tackle the issue head-on when he appeared before the cameras on Monday.\n\nHe first offered a lengthy and seemingly out-of-place recitation of his accomplishments on the economy, trade and job creation. When he did address the violence in Charlottesville, he did not apologize, but presented his corrective as an update on the Department of Justice civil rights investigation into the death of a woman who was allegedly hit by a car driven by an Ohio protester with ties to neo-Nazi groups.\n\n\"To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered,\" he said.\n\nAs Trump was delivering the kind of statement his critics had demanded over the weekend, Fox News reported that the president is considering pardoning former Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a political ally accused of federal civil rights violations for allegedly mistreating prisoners, many of them black and Hispanic.\n\n\"I am seriously considering a pardon for Sheriff Arpaio,\" the president said in an interview Sunday -- at the height of the controversy over Charlottesville -- speaking to the network at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey. \"He has done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration. He's a great American patriot, and I hate to see what has happened to him.\"\n\nTrump has had a career-long pattern of delaying and muting his criticism of white nationalism. During the 2016 campaign, he refused to immediately denounce David Duke, a former Klansman who supported his candidacy.\n\nSome human rights activists, skeptical that his remarks represent a change in approach on the issue, called for him to fire the nationalists working in the West Wing, a group of hard-right populists led by Stephen K. Bannon, the White House chief strategist.\n\n\"The president should make sure that no one on his staff has ties to white supremacists,\" Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a telephone briefing on Monday afternoon, adding, \"nor should they be on the payroll of the American people.\"\n\nHe said that the Department of Justice and the Office of Government Ethics should \"do an investigation and make that determination\" if anyone in the White House had ties to hate groups.\n\nTrump and his staff have consistently denied any connection to such organizations, and the president called for racial harmony in his remarks on Monday.\n\n\"As I have said many times before, no matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws,\" he said. \"We all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence.\"\n\nTwo themes -- uniting the country while defending himself -- collided on Trump's Twitter feed earlier Monday.\n\nMerck's chief executive, Kenneth C. Frazier, resigned from the president's American Manufacturing Council, saying he objected to the president's statement on Saturday blaming violence that left one woman dead on \"many sides.\"\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said in a tweet announcing he was stepping down from the panel. Frazier is one of just a handful of black chief executives of a Fortune 500 company.\n\nLess than hour later, Trump responded on social media as he departed his golf resort in Bedminster for a day trip back to Washington.\n\nNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nPaul Polman, the chief executive of Unilever, wrote on Twitter:\n\nThanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is pic.twitter.com/ckabeobZBL -- Paul Polman (@PaulPolman)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nIt is not unusual for Trump to attack, via Twitter, any public figure who ridicules, criticizes or even mildly questions his actions. But his decision to take on Frazier, a self-made multimillionaire who rose from a modest childhood in Philadelphia to attend Harvard Law School, was extraordinary given the wide-ranging criticism he has faced from both parties for not forcefully denouncing the neo-Nazis and Klan sympathizers who rampaged in Charlottesville.\n\nFrazier appeared next to Trump at the White House last month to announce an agreement among drugmakers that would create 1,000 jobs.\n\nHe is only the second African-American executive to lead a major pharmaceutical firm and rose to prominence as Merck's general counsel when he successfully defended the company against class-action lawsuits stemming from complications involving the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx.\n\nKeith Boykin, a former aide to President Bill Clinton who comments on politics and race for CNN, wrote in a tweet:\n\nIt took Trump 54 minutes to condemn Merck CEO Ken Frazier, but after several days he still has not condemned murdering white supremacists. https://t.co/ps9AVUTTH7 -- Keith Boykin (@keithboykin)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nFrazier's exit from the business council marks a miniexodus of business leaders, resulting from the president's stances on social issues and the environment.

Justice will be delivered,\" Trump added.\n\nHis statement was a hastily arranged do-over that implicitly acknowledged the need to staunch the self-inflicted damage his first reaction had caused him and his administration. Criticism and outrage had continued to build, including among Republicans, to Trump's Saturday remarks blaming \"many sides\" -- in effect lumping together the anti-racism counter-protesters with the gun-wielding white supremacy groups Trump declined to name.\n\nAdding to the pressure for the White House, just ahead of the president's scripted comments, a Virginia judge in Charlottesville declined to set bail for the 20-year-old Nazi sympathizer, James Alex Fields Jr. of Ohio, who is charged with murdering a woman and injuring 20 others when his car plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters and pedestrians Saturday.\n\nEven before he belatedly spoke against the white nationalists, however, Trump drew more criticism for a tweet early Monday in which he attacked the African American chief executive of the pharmaceutical company Merck, Kenneth C. Frazier, within an hour of Frazier's resignation from a White House manufacturing council to protest Trump's initial failure to explicitly condemn the racists in Charlottesville.\n\nThe president had told reporters on Friday that he'd hold a \"pretty big press conference on Monday,\" but after the weekend's events no press conference was on his official Monday schedule. Instead, by mid-morning the White House circulated word that Trump would make a statement on Charlottesville.\n\nOnce he came to the lectern with the presidential seal, the president first took some time to extol his administration as he often does for various economic gains. After segueing to roughly two minutes of remarks denouncing the hate groups, Trump pivoted and left, ignoring reporters' shouted questions as he had Saturday, including several asking if he regretted his delay in specifically blaming the racists.\n\nWhite House aides declined to respond to requests for information, including about why the president's promised press conference was canceled.\n\nPrior to his public statement, Trump met privately with Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions and new FBI Director Christopher A. Wray to discuss the civil rights investigation of the two days of chaos in Charlottesville that the Justice Department announced late Saturday.\n\nAfter his Saturday statement, Trump continued to tweet through the weekend and into Monday, mostly on other subjects; those referring to Charlottesville did not denounce or even refer to white nationalists.\n\nYet on Monday the president quickly attacked Merck's chief executive after the company announced that Frazier had resigned from the president's advisory council on manufacturing. Its statement said, \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy.\"\n\nFrazier said he felt \"a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\nTrump responded on Twitter less than an hour after Merck posted Frazier's statement: \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nOn social media, many critics noted the contrast between Trump's quick condemnation of Frazier and his failure -- to that point -- to denounce racist groups by name. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said that Trump \"proves again he's capable of immediate and personal condemnation. Why not for white supremacists?\"\n\nnoah.bierman@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @noahbierman", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "19:57:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {},

He makes that kind of statement because it's the right thing to do, and should have been done the first time.\n\nUpdate: ABC News has the part of the speech in which Trump specifically calls out white supremacists:\n\nUpdate: I'm not sure if this would have improved even if Trump had said it on Saturday:\n\nNAACP official just said on MSNBC that it didn't matter what Trump said because she wouldn't have believed him anyway.\n\n-- Brent Scher (@BrentScher) August 14, 2017\n\nUpdate: Trump ends this short statement with no follow-up questions allowed after declaring racism in all forms as \"evil\" and antithetical to the American spirit.\n\nUpdate: Offers prayers for Heather Heyer and the two Virginia law enforcement officers, and says all three embodied the true character of the American people.\n\nUpdate: Specifically calls out \"neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the KKK\" as \"repugnant.\"\n\nUpdate: \"No matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws.\"\n\nUpdate: Trump leads off with a mention about his economic policy, but then shifts quickly to Charlottesville.

The White House Youtube channel has been prepared for a live statement, which can be streamed here:\n\nI'll live blog the statement as it unfolds, in reverse chronological order.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2017\n\nMerck & Co Inc Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier resigned from U.S. President Donald Trump's American Manufacturing Council on Monday, saying he was taking a stand against intolerance and extremism. ...\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier, who is African-American, said in a statement announcing his resignation.\n\n\"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\" he said.\n\nIf Trump gets more specific and condemnatory, will Frazier return? Probably not, given Trump's reaction to his statement, but the strategy here will probably be to stanch the bleeding rather than return to status quo ante.\n\nIt's interesting to note that this statement follows a meeting between Sessions, Trump, and new FBI Director Christopher Wray as the Department of Justice was announcing a domestic-terrorism arrest in Oklahoma.

He initially returned to Washington to meet with top administration officials and sign a presidential memorandum directing his US Trade Representative to determine whether an investigation is needed into China's laws and policies related to trade and intellectual property.\n\nThis was the White House's latest attempt to clarify Trump's comments from Saturday.\n\nAn unnamed White House official said Sunday that \"of course\" the President condemns \"white supremacists, KKK, neo-nazi and all extremist groups,\" but declined to explain why the President wasn't saying it himself.\n\nTrump also remained mum on Twitter, declining to send a single tweet of his own Sunday, only the fourth in his 207 days as president that Trump has gone a full day without tweeting a message of his own.\n\nTrump did, however, use Twitter on Monday to push his political message and settle a score: He slammed Ken Frazier, the CEO of Merck Pharma, who resigned from Trump's manufacturing council over his failure to condemn white supremacists.\n\n\"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES,\" Trump

He initially returned to Washington to meet with top administration officials and sign a presidential memorandum directing his US Trade Representative to determine whether an investigation is needed into China's laws and policies related to trade and intellectual property.\n\nThis was the White House's latest attempt to clarify Trump's comments from Saturday.\n\nAn unnamed White House official said Sunday that \"of course\" the President condemns \"white supremacists, KKK, neo-nazi and all extremist groups,\" but declined to explain why the President wasn't saying it himself.\n\nTrump also remained mum on Twitter, declining to send a single tweet of his own Sunday, only the fourth in his 207 days as president that Trump has gone a full day without tweeting a message of his own.\n\nTrump did, however, use Twitter on Monday to push his political message and settle a score: He slammed Ken Frazier, the CEO of Merck Pharma, who resigned from Trump's manufacturing council over his failure to condemn white supremacists.\n\n\"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nFrazier, one of the nation's top African-American CEOs, has spent considerable time at the White House with Trump before he resigned his position.\n\nRelated Items Donald Trump,

We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans,\" Trump said.\n\nSeveral of the president's top advisers, including his new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, pressed Trump to issue a more forceful rebuke after his comment Saturday that the violence in Charlottesville was initiated by \"many sides,\" prompting nearly universal criticism.\n\nThat pressure reached a boiling point early Monday after the president attacked the head of Merck pharmaceuticals, chief executive Kenneth C. Frazier, who is black, for quitting an advisory board over his failure to call out white nationalists.\n\nLess than an hour later, Trump responded on social media as he departed his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, for a day trip back to Washington.\n\n\"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\" the president wrote.\n\nIt's not unusual for Trump to attack, via Twitter, any public figure who ridicules, criticizes or even mildly questions his actions.\n\nBut his decision to take on Frazier, a self-made multimillionaire who rose from a modest childhood in Philadelphia to attend Harvard Law School, was extraordinary given the wide-ranging criticism he has faced from both parties for not forcefully denouncing the neo-Nazis and Klan sympathizers who rampaged in Charlottesville.\n\nFrazier is only the second African-American executive to lead a major pharmaceutical firm and rose in prominence as Merck's general counsel when he successfully defended the company against class-action lawsuits stemming from complications involving the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx.\n\n\"It took Trump 54 minutes to condemn Merck CEO Ken Frazier, but after several days he still has not condemned murdering white supremacists,\" Keith Boykin, a former aide to President Bill Clinton who comments on politics and race for CNN, wrote in a tweet before Trump's statement Monday afternoon.\n\nFrazier's exit from the business council marks a mini-exodus of business leaders, resulting from the president's stances on social issues and the environment.

The president has not proposed policies to lower drug prices, but has rather suggested further deregulation of industry generally, as well as weakening purchasing pools like Medicare that could potentially negotiate better prices with the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nMeanwhile Frazier's words represent a stand by a leader in the health-care industry whose moral mission is being tested, and which could inspire or pressure others to do the same.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "13:41:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {"liCnt": 365, "gpCnt": 3}, "timeCrawl": "22:17:00", "title": "Trump Finds Someone He Can Condemn", "date": "2017-08-14", "uri": "709470312", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/08/AP_17201734743968/facebook.jpg?1502722830", "source": {"title": "The Atlantic", "uri": "theatlantic.com", "id": "2057"}, "id": "9170852", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals", "wgt": 100, "id": 238}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals/Pharmaceuticals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals/Pharmaceuticals", "wgt": 100, "id": 239}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "id": "233", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "id": "200134", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302718", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics", "label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302948", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303051", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug", "label": {"eng": "Pharmaceutical drug"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303456", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "label": {"eng": "Employment"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303732", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304262", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304550", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305969", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing", "label": {"eng": "Manufacturing"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307067", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug", "label": {"eng": "Drug"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307433", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation", "label": {"eng": "Deregulation"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310106", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry", "label": {"eng": "Bigotry"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310173", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)", "label": {"eng": "Medicare (United States)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313208", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream", "label": {"eng": "American Dream"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313957", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_&_Co.", "label": {"eng": "Merck & Co."}, "type": "org", "id": "321096", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain", "label": {"eng": "Eminent domain"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "324837", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_costs", "label": {"eng": "Prescription costs"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "398123", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal", "label": {"eng": "All men are created equal"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "423535", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Frazier", "label": {"eng": "Kenneth Frazier"}, "type": "person", "id": "961781", "score": 4}]}

Americans expect their political leaders to denounce white supremacists by name.\"\n\nLloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs who has called the President's decision to bail on the climate-change deal a set back, tweeted: \"Lincoln: 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.\"\n\nSince Mr. Trump won the presidency, companies have been trying not to anger Mr. Trump while ensuring that their brands are not tarnished on social media.\n\nCompanies such as Carrier Corp. and Ford Motor Co appeared to manipulate Mr. Trump by announcing plans to keep certain manufacturing jobs in the U.S.\n\nApart from Mr. Frazier's resignation, this latest crisis has not inspired many business leaders to speak out.\n\n\"I suspect that corporate executives are hopeful that the Republican Party can pass tax cuts soon ... and they believe criticism of Trump undercuts the chance those goals are achieved,\" said Jeff Hauser,\n\nwho runs the Revolving Door Project, which examines corporate influence in the executive branch.\n\n\"American headquartered companies increasingly spend more branding themselves progressive via advertising and public relations while exhibiting conscientious corporate behaviour with declining frequency,\" he said.\n\nTrump vs. Corporate America\n\nA selection of the President's tweets taking aim at U.S. businesses\n\nNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! -- Donald J.

outburst from Donald Trump.\n\nNeo-Nazis have been filmed waving swastika flags and chanting homophobic and fascist slogans including \"f**k you faggots\" at the Unite the Right marches.\n\nCivil rights activist Heather Heyer was killed at the weekend when a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters in Virginia.\n\nThe images have prompted condemnation from many, including former Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who has called out \"the incitement of hatred that got us here\".\n\nPresident Donald Trump's statement on Charlottesville has been criticised for pandering to the far-right groups who sparked the violence, where rather than explicitly call out white supremacism he instead criticised hatred, bigotry, and violence \"on many sides - on many sides\".\n\nFollowing this response, Merck chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth C Frazier today announced his resignation from the President's American Manufacturing Council.\n\n\"Our country's strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations and political beliefs,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"America's leaders must honour our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\n\n\"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\nTrump responded to the announcement within an hour of it being made public.\n\n\"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\" said the President.\n\nPresident Trump announced his manufacturing jobs initiative in January as part of his much-touted job creation agenda.\n\n\"President Trump plans to continually seek information and perspectives from a diverse range of business leaders, including those listed below and others, on how best to promote job growth and get Americans back to work again,\" read the announcement at the time.\n\nAt that time, the full

Self-proclaimed white nationalist James Alex Fields was arrested Saturday (Aug. 12) for driving his car into a counter protest of the Nazi rally and killing Heather Heyer. Over 20 others were injured, including Deandre Harris, who was attacked by a group of KKK members. Two state troopers; Lt. H. Jay Cullen and trooper-pilot Berke M.M. Bates died in a helicopter crash as they tried to monitor the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\n\"Racism is evil,\" Trump said. \"And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\"\n\nREAD Charlamagne Tha God Makes Charlottesville Marchers Donkey Of The Day\n\nMeanwhile, unrest has continued across the country with a protests in Georgia. As many came together to mourn Heyer, another group marched to Piedmont Park and spray painted the park's \"Peace\" Confederate statue, the Atlanta-Journal Constitution reports.\n\nCreated in 1911, the monument was meant to be an image of peace between the north and south after the Civil War. The statue which features a confederate solider and an angel, has been seen as a symbol of good will and to some, a symbol of the state's confederate past.\n\nTrump's debatable double-down against the incidents Saturday nearly went unnoticed due to his feud with Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier. Early Monday, Frazier resigned from Trump's American Manufacturing Council in response of the president's silence against the weekend rally. \"Our country's strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, faces, sexual orientations and political beliefs. America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier, who is black, said in a statement. Trump was the center of backlash on Saturday for suggesting that \"all sides\" were to blame for the violence.\n\npic.twitter.com/a1PNQZism5\n\n-- Merck (@Merck) August 14, 2017\n\nTrump tweeted about Frazier's departure shortly after.\n\nNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2017\n\nThe rest of Trump's manufacturing council released statements of their own, condemning the violence. \"GE has no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism, and we strongly condemn the violent extremism in Charlottesville over the weekend. GE, whose Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Immelt is on the council said, via NBC News. GE is a proudly inclusive company with employees who represent all religions, nationalities, sexual orientations and races.\" Dow Chemcial CEO Andrew Liveris added, \"I condemn the violence this weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, and my thoughts and prayers are with those who lost loved ones and with the people of Virginia.\"\n\nREAD This Twitter Account Is Blasting Nazis And White

And sure enough, Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. Frazier on Twitter less than an hour later.\n\n\"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\" he wrote.\n\nEven after the president's taunting, members of the Merck board said they supported Mr. Frazier's decision.\n\n\"Any time someone stands up and does something brave, rather than wimping out, sure, there is a risk,\" said Thomas R. Cech, a board member who was among the people that Mr. Frazier contacted Sunday night. \"You put your name and your company's name in the spotlight, and people who don't like what you did can find ways to try to retaliate.\"\n\nBut Mr. Frazier emerged as a lonely voice on Monday. While other top executives made statements denouncing racism and bigotry generally, none directly criticized Mr. Trump or lent their support to Mr. Frazier.\n\n\"Bigotry, hatred and extremism are an affront to core American values and have no place in this country,\" said Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of Blackstone and one of the president's closest advisers in the business community. \"I am deeply saddened and troubled by the tragic events in Charlottesville.\"\n\nAnd even as Republican senators and others in Mr. Trump's own party criticized him for his initial response to the violence on Sunday, other members of Mr. Trump's manufacturing council declined to follow Mr. Frazier's lead.\n\nMichael Dell, chief executive of Dell Technologies, will remain on the White House manufacturing advisory council, the company said. In an email, Dave Farmer, a Dell spokesman, said there was \"no change in Dell engaging with the Trump administration\" to \"share our perspective on policy issues that affect our company, our customers and our employees.\"\n\nGeneral Electric said in a statement that it had \"no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism,\" but added that Jeff Immelt, the company's chairman and recently retired chief executive, would also continue on the council.\n\nAnd after drawing fire for his initial reaction to the violence in Charlottesville, Mr. Trump on Monday explicitly condemned hate groups including neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan, offering the kind of sharp denunciation of racism that many critics believed was lacking over the weekend.\n\nThis is not the first time the president's actions have caused a chief executive to walk away from a seat on one of his advisory groups. In February, as Mr. Trump began to implement stringent new immigration rules, Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber at the time, quit the president's economic advisory council.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "20:50:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {"liCnt": 18}, "timeCrawl": "20:50:00", "title": "Merck's Frazier Is Lonely C.E.O.

Council, following what he described as the US president's failure to unequivocally condemn far right violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, West Virginia.\n\nAnti-fascist and far right protestors clashed in the town on Saturday (12 August).\n\nA female protestor was subsequently killed and 19 others injured when a car intentionally rammed into a crowd protesting against white supremacists.\n\nJames Alex Fields, 20, is under custody for being the alleged driver of the vehicle.\n\nFollowing the death, Trump took to the airwaves condemning violence on \"all sides\" but was severely criticised for not specifically denouncing the far right.\n\nVigils and demonstrations have been held in several US cities in support of Charlottesville.\n\nFollowing his resignation, Frazier, one US' most known African-American industry captains, tweeted: \"I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\n\n\"America's leaders must honour our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\"\n\nNever one shy away from a response, Trump tweeted that Frazier would now have \"more time to lower rip off drug prices\".\n\nThe episode comes after the White House rejected criticism of Trump's response to the violence.", "location": null,

Neither man said whether they would stay on board.\n\nPepsi CEO Indra Nooyi, a member of another Trump economic advisory group, tweeted Sunday that she was \"heartbroken by the violence in #Charlottesville.\"\n\n\"Hate and intolerance are a betrayal of what we stand for as Americans,\" she said.\n\n-CNNMoney's Ahiza Garcia and Shen Lu contributed to this story.", "location": null,

CEO Ken Frazier is the only one to resign in the wake of Mr. Trump's response to the weekend's deadly white supremacist protests in Charlottesville.\n\nCBS News reached out to the more than 40 members of two outside advisory panels: the White House Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum, asking if they planned to stay on board. Many of them condemned the violence, while others obliquely criticized the president's reluctance to initially condemn the group of protestors that included neo-Nazis, KKK members and white nationalists. At least one company simply declined to comment.\n\nAFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who serves with his deputy chief of staff Thea Lee on the manufacturing council, said they are \"assessing our role\" with the panel. \"The AFL-CIO has unequivocally denounced the actions of bigoted domestic terrorists in Charlottesville and called on the president to do the same,\" Trumka said in a statement.\n\nIn a statement, Dow Chairman and CEO Andrew Liveris offered his thoughts and prayers to those \"who lost oved ones and the people of Virginia.\"\n\n\"In Dow there is no room for hatred, racism or bigotry. Dow will continue to support policies that support manufacturing and rebuild the workforce including contributing to the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative,\" he said.\n\nA spokesman for Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Technologies, told CBS News \"While we wouldn't comment on any member's personal decision, there's no change in Dell engaging with the Trump administration and governments around the world to share our perspective on policy issues that affect our company, customers and employees.\"\n\n\"Thanks for checking in. We don't have a comment,\" said a spokesman for Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson.\n\nA spokesman for Bill Brown, CEO of Harris Corporation said \"I'm not able to get a response for you, sorry.\"\n\nJeffrey Immelt, the Chairman of General Electric who headed President Barack Obama's business council, is staying put. A spokesman said \"GE has no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism and we strongly condemn the violent extremism in Charlottesville over the weekend....With more than 100,000 employees in the United States, it is important for GE to participate in the discussion on how to drive growth and productivity in the U.S., therefore, Jeff Immelt will remain on the Presidential Committee on American Manufacturing while he is the Chairman of GE.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi referred us to her August 12 tweet where she wrote \"Heartbroken by the violence in #Charlottesville. Hate and intolerance are a betrayal of what we stand for as Americans.\"\n\nThe responses are a sampling of those received by CBS News.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Frazier resigned. \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" he said in a statement. \"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\nFour minutes later, President Trump shot back, tweeting \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nSpokesmen for Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank have not yet responded to requests for comment. Krzanich appeared to criticize Mr. Trump on Twitter, without calling him out by name, writing: \"There should be no hesitation in condemning hate speech or white supremacy by name. #Intel asks all our countries leadership to do the same.\"\n\nPlank also tweeted, \"There is no place for racism or discrimination in this world.\"\n\nBlackstone Chairman and CEO Stephen Schwarzman, who heads Mr. Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, said he was \"deeply troubled by the tragic events in Charlottesville.\"\n\n\"Bigotry, hatred and extremism are an affront to core American values and have no place in this country,\" Schwarzman said. \"As the president said today, I believe we need to find a path forward to heal the wounds left by this tragedy and address its underlying causes. Encouraging tolerance and understanding must be a core national imperative and I will work to further that goal.\"\n\nElon Musk, who served on both councils, resigned in June over the president's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord, as did Disney CEO Bob Iger.\n\nMr. Trump was roundly criticized for his response to the protests, which at first blamed \"both sides\" for the violence. On Monday morning, however, Mr. Trump delivered more pointed remarks, saying that \"those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textEnd": 2661, "textStart": 2652, "amb": false, "date":

(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)\n\nPresident Trump's jaw-dropping failure of leadership in connection with the white supremacists' violence in Charlottesville, Va., has now set him up for a much broader debate about his message and his moral authority.\n\nCNN reports:\n\nOne of America's most prominent black CEOs quit President Trump's manufacturing council on Monday over Trump's failure to condemn white supremacists. Kenneth Frazier of Merck said in a statement: \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy.\" Within minutes, Trump attacked him on Twitter, saying Frazier's resignation will give him \"more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nFrazier did not mention the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in his statement, but he did say that \"as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\" ... Frazier is one of the country's most prominent black corporate executives and was the only black male CEO named to the council in January.\n\nAside from demonstrating Trump's intolerance of anyone who doesn't show personal loyalty to him, the incident raises a broader issue: Why are the rest of the CEOs still there? Elon Musk of Tesla departed after Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement. Now would be the perfect time for the rest of them -- CEOs of companies that espouse a commitment to nondiscrimination, diversity and inclusion -- to depart, not only in solidarity with Frazier but also in an act of civic-minded devotion to the country. What's Trump going to do to their companies -- especially if they all leave together?\n\nBusiness leaders, like other individuals, have to make a decision whether to engage with and assist this administration or to refuse to bestow on Trump an aura of normalcy. This case isn't a hard one. It's far from clear that Trump listens to anyone outside his inner circle (and sometimes not even them) on issues such as climate change, infrastructure, trade, etc. So what are they actually accomplishing other than providing Trump with emotional gratification and political respectability?\n\nMoreover, it is only a matter of time before activists start demanding that the CEOs end their affiliations with the White House. It would be far better for them to get ahead of the curve and leave now, thereby avoiding protests, boycotts and the like.\n\nWe've seen the moral void in the White House when it comes to matters of race (among other things). To their credit, many Republicans have stepped forward to partially fill that leadership vacuum. (Nothing, however, makes up for the absence of presidential leadership.) Given where we are as a country and given business leaders' desire for a prosperous, peaceful and cohesive society, it surely is in their companies' interest to reaffirm our civic values. Their departure may not persuade or influence the White House, but like Ivanka Trump, they should give up the pretense that their seat at the table is beneficial. They, like Ivanka Trump, are props in Trump's show. They nod their heads and hold their tongues as he rampages through American democratic institutions and societal norms. If they leave, at least their consciences will be clear and they can sleep at night knowing that they stayed true to their corporate and personal values.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null,

Robert E. Lee turned violent Saturday when counterprotesters showed up. A woman was killed and at least 19 people injured when a man drove a car into the crowd of counterprotesters. Two Virginia state troopers also were killed when their helicopter crashed while overlooking the scene.\n\n\"These hateful acts must be responded to in a way that is becoming of the ideals of the United States of America,\" wrote Fitzpatrick, R-8, of Middletown. \"Expanding this investigation into domestic terrorism is necessary and called for in this instance.\"\n\nSessions announced Sunday that the Department of Justice will conduct a civil rights investigation into the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer and the injuries to the others struck by a car allegedly driven by James Alex Fields Jr., a 20-year-old Ohio man charged with second-degree murder.\n\nFitzpatrick, a former FBI special agent, also called on the White House to make a strong response denouncing the violent actions. Trump faced heavy criticism Saturday and Sunday for what many considered a tepid response to the racist rhetoric and deadly actions.\n\n\"How we respond to this incident as a nation is critical,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"The United States of America must have zero tolerance for hatred, bigotry and violence. The United States of America is better than that. The Administration and the Department of Justice must denounce the events of Charlottesville, and the individuals and groups involved, in the strongest possible terms, and those words must be put into action by the Department of Justice through a comprehensive domestic terrorism investigation.\"\n\nTrump's comments over the weekend condemned hatred, bigotry and violence on \"many sides,\" grouping the \"Unite the Right\" rally organizers with counterprotesters, some of whom were members of the aggressive antifascism (Antifa) movement.\n\nBucks County resident and Merck CEO Ken Frazier resigned from Trump's American Manufacturing Council early Monday morning in response to the president's comments.\n\nTrump swiftly tweeted an attack on Frazier, posting, \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nTrump later Monday made additional remarks at the White House about the Charlottesville violence and explicitly denounced racist groups.\n\nStatement by President Trump: https://t.co/4OXYGkWWgA -- The White House (@WhiteHouse)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\n\"Racism is evil,\" President Trump said. \"And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\"\n\nEnjoying our content?

Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.\"\n\nTheir statements came after white supremacist and alt-right groups descended on Charlottesville, Virginia and clashed with counter-protesters.\n\nBut the most drastic action from a business leader came early Monday, when Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, one of the country's most prominent black corporate executives, quit President Trump's manufacturing council.\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy,\" Frazier said.\n\nTrump on Saturday spoke against bigotry and violence \"on many sides\" but did not specifically condemn white supremacists. It wasn't until Monday afternoon that he bluntly called \"KKK, neo-Nazis, White Supremacists, and other hate groups ... repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\"\n\nHours before Trump made that speech, he bashed Frazier on Twitter. About an hour after Frazier left the council, Trump tweeted that the executive \"will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nPaul Polman, CEO of Unilever, tweeted his thanks to Frazier \"for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is.\"\n\nAnd General Electric released a statement saying the company has \"no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism.\"\n\n\"We strongly condemn the violent extremism in Charlottesville over the weekend,\" the company said.\n\nIt added that GE chairman Jeff Immelt will remain on Trump's manufacturing group, citing an importance for GE to \"participate in the discussion on how to drive growth and productivity in the U.S.\"\n\nUnder Armour CEO Kevin Plank said through his company's Twitter account that the company supports \"love and unity.\"\n\n\"We are saddened by #Charlottesville,\" Plank's statement read. \"There is no place for racism or discrimination in this world.\"\n\nIntel CEO Brian Krzanich tweeted that \"there should be no hesitation in condemning hate speech or white supremacy by name. #Intel asks all our country's leadership to do the same.\"\n\nRichard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, said Sunday that leaders, starting with the president, should acknowledge Charlottesville for what it was: \"domestic terrorism rooted in bigotry.\"\n\nAnd Dow Chemical Chairman and CEO Andrew Liveris said there is \"no room for hatred, racism or bigotry\" at his company.\n\nPlank, Krzanich, Trumka and Liveris are also on the president's manufacturing council. None said whether they would stay on.\n\nStephen Schwarzman, the chairman, CEO and co-founder of Blackstone, said \"Bigotry, hatred and extremism are an affront to core American values and have no place in this country.\"\n\nSchwartzman chairs the White House's Strategy and Policy Forum, a group of business executives who were tapped to advise Trump on the economy. He did not address his involvement in his statement, but cited Trump's newest remarks about Charlottesville on Monday.\n\n\"As the President said today, I believe we need to find a path forward to heal the wounds left by this tragedy and address its underlying causes,\" he said.\n\nPepsi CEO Indra Nooyi, a member of Trump's economic advisory group, tweeted Sunday that she was \"heartbroken by the violence in #Charlottesville.\"\n\n\"Hate and intolerance are a betrayal of what we stand for as Americans,\" she said.\n\n--CNNMoney's Ahiza Garcia, Shen Lu and Tom Foster contributed to this

Many of those comments came hours after Frazier issued his statement at 8 a.m. ET.\n\n\"GE has no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism, and we strongly condemn the violent extremism in Charlottesville over the weekend,\" the company said in a statement. \"With more than 100,000 employees in the United States, it is important for GE to participate in the discussion on how to drive growth and productivity in the U.S., therefore, Jeff Immelt will remain on the Presidential Committee on American Manufacturing while he is the Chairman of GE.\"\n\nImmelt recently stepped down as CEO of GE, but he is expected to remain the company's chairman until the end of the year.\n\nLater Monday, Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris also issued a statement.\n\n\"In Dow there is no room for hatred, racism, or bigotry,\" Liveris said. \"Dow will continue to work to strengthen the social and economic fabric of the communities where it operates -- including supporting policies that help create employment opportunities in manufacturing and rebuild the American workforce.\"\n\nDow Chemical will remain on the council as will Whirlpool.\n\nThe appliance manufacturer said it wants to continue to work on the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, and \"to provide input and advice on ways to create jobs and strengthen U.S. manufacturing competitiveness.\" But added that it supports a \" open and inclusive culture that respects people of all races and backgrounds.\"\n\nJohn Ferriola, CEO of Nucor, said the company condemns the violence over the weekend and he will continue to serve on the council, saying in a statement, \"We believe a strong manufacturing sector is the backbone of a strong economy.\"\n\nInternational Paper spokesperson Tom Ryan echoed the response from Ferriola condemning the violence over the weekend and adding the company \"fosters an inclusive workforce.\"\n\nCampbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison will remain on the council to \"have a voice and provide input\" on matters concerning the company, Campbell Soup said in a statement. Dell also indicated no change in engagement with the administration for its CEO, Michael Dell.\n\nSeveral executives have already left the president's advisory groups for other reasons, including former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who resigned in February over the administration's immigration policies, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney's Bob Iger, who both left in June after Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\n\nIn addition, several executives are no longer part of the council since they are no longer CEOs. They include: Mark Fields, of Ford; Klaus Kleinfeld, of Arconic; and Mario Longhi, of U.S. Steel.\n\nTimes like these can be \"a real test of leadership character\" for executives, said management expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld on CNBC's \"Squawk Alley.\" \"There's no blueprint here and we can see which CEOs are passing the exam on this one and which ones are failing,\" he said.\n\nSeveral other CEOs who weren't part to the manufacturing council did comment on Frazier's resignation.\n\nMeg Whitman, Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO, said she supported Frazier's decision.\n\n\"I'm thankful we have business leaders such as Ken to remind America of its better angels,\" Whitman continued.\n\n@MegWhitman: \"I support Ken Frazier's decision. I'm thankful we have business leaders such as Ken to remind America of its better angels.\"\n\nPaul Polman, CEO of Unilever, also supported the decision, saying it showed \"strong leadership.\"\n\n@PaulPolman: Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is\n\nAt PepsiCo, CEO Indra Nooyi said she was \"heartbroken\" by the violence from the weekend, but she did not make any reference to Frazier's resignation.\n\n@IndraNooyi: Heartbroken by the violence in #Charlottesville. Hate and intolerance are a betrayal of what we stand for as Americans.\n\nMeanwhile, former Merck CEO Roy Vagelos said in a statement he supports his protegee's decision.\n\n\"He is always smart, always ethical and repeatedly makes the right decisions,\" Vagelos said in the statement. \"I applaud his decision to step down from the Council this morning. Ken is driven by a strong sense of morality in everything he does and he continues to make me proud,\" the statement read.\n\nFrazier \"is truly the American dream,\" said Sonnenfeld, noting his rise from poverty to C-suite executive and his leadership on combating abuses in drug pricing. \"How could you pick on a worse target to fire back on than the president picking on Ken Frazier?\"\n\nSonnenfeld was referring to the response Trump gave Monday morning, that said Frazier's resignation would give him more time to focus on lowering \"ripoff\" drug prices.\n\n@realDonaldTrump: Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\n\nDespite the harshness of the comments, which recalled Trump statements earlier this year that he planned to work to lower drug prices, Merck shares were trading mostly flat to higher Monday.\n\nThat's a much different response from the early days of the administration, when the president's negative tweets about companies usually sent shares tumbling and inspired pieces like FTI's \"If POTUS Tweets @ Your Company: Six Steps.\"\n\nThe list included advice like consider laying low, address misinformation and be proactive on social media. FTI also advised engaging with Trump offline, in person, to allow for a more substantive response.\n\nReflecting on the discussion, former McDonald's CEO, Ed Rensi, told CNBC's \"Squawk Alley\" Monday that Trump needs to watch out.\n\n\"He'll become irrelevant if he doesn't' change his behavior,\" Rensi said.\n\nThe president was roundly criticized Saturday for suggesting \"many sides\" were to blame for the deadly violence at the rally in Charlottesville. Members of both parties lambasted Trump, saying his comments failed to single out white nationalists.\n\nOn Monday,speaking at the White House, Trump was more specific, saying, \"Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\"\n\nWhile Sonnenfeld said many executives had contacted him privately bemoaning the situation, he urged them take their comments public.\n\n\"Is...[former Starbucks CEO] Howard Schultz sipping on his cappuccino and thinking of more clever things to write on coffee cups? Why not get out there and say something?\" Sonnenfeld said.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "20:37:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "20:37:00", "title": "We asked the CEOs on Trump's manufacturing council about Merck's CEO quitting.

Frazier, resigned from the president's American Manufacturing Council on Monday, saying he objected to the president's statement Saturday blaming violence that left one woman dead on \"many sides.\"\n\n\"America's leaders must honour our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Mr Frazier said in a tweet announcing he was stepping down from the panel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Frazier is one of just a handful of black chief executives of a Fortune 500 company.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nLess than an hour later, Mr Trump responded on social media as he departed his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, for a day trip back to Washington.\n\n\"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\" the president wrote.\n\nMr Trump's shot at one of the country's best-known black executives prompted an immediate outpouring of support for Frazier from major figures in business, media and politics.\n\n\"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is,\" Paul Polman, the chief executive of Unilever, wrote on Twitter.\n\nIt's not unusual for Mr Trump to attack, via Twitter, any public figure who ridicules, criticises or even mildly questions his actions. But his decision to take on Mr Frazier, a self-made multimillionaire who rose from a modest childhood in Philadelphia to attend Harvard Law School, was extraordinary given the wide-ranging criticism he has faced from both parties for not forcefully denouncing the neo-Nazis and Klan sympathisers who rampaged in Charlottesville.\n\nMr Frazier appeared next to Mr Trump at the White House last month to announce an agreement among drugmakers that would create 1,000 jobs.\n\nHe is only the second African-American executive to lead a major pharmaceutical firm and rose in prominence as Merck's general counsel when he successfully defended the company against class-action lawsuits stemming from complications involving the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx.\n\n\"It took Trump 54 minutes to condemn Merck CEO Ken Frazier, but after several days he still has not condemned murdering white supremacists,\" Keith Boykin, a former aide to President Bill Clinton who comments on politics and race for CNN, wrote in a tweet.\n\nMr Frazier's exit from the business council marks a mini-exodus of business leaders, resulting from the president's stances on social issues and the environment. His recent decision to leave the Paris climate accord prompted Elon Musk of Tesla to resign, as did the chief executive of Disney, Bob Iger, and Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs.\n\nCar attack suspect refused bail\n\nA Virginia judge on Monday declined to set bail for James Alex Fields jnr, the 20-year-old Ohio man accused of second-degree murder and other charges after authorities said he ploughed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters near the scene of the white supremacist rally.\n\nThat means Fields, whom news reports have described as fascinated by Nazism, will remain jailed at least until he has an attorney.\n\nJames Alex Fields jnr, second from left, holds a black shield at the rally in Charlottesville. Photo: AP\n\nThe local public defenders' office informed the court it could not represent him because of a potential conflict of interest - someone in the office has a relative who was hurt during Saturday's violence in Charlottesville.\n\nA local attorney will be appointed to represent Fields and could request bail before the next scheduled hearing, August 25.\n\nFields, clad in a black-and-white striped uniform, appeared via video link for the hearing. He briefly responded to questions from Judge Robert Downer, replying \"No, sir,\" when asked if he had any ties to the Charlottesville community.\n\nSaturday's car rampage killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was among the crowd of counter-protesters responding to the rally by white nationalists and others who oppose a plan to remove from a Charlottesville park of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Fields was taken into custody soon afterward.\n\nNew York Times, McClatchy", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textEnd": 7131, "textStart": 7122, "amb": false, "date":

A gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in the town of Charlottesville took a deadly turn on Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters and killed at least one person.\n\nWithin an hour after the statement was first issued, Mr Trump tweeted his response. \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nMr Frazier's resignation followed an outcry by critics about how President Trump had responded to the protests that were led by white supremacist groups. Many questioned why Mr Trump had not explicitly named neo-Nazi, Ku Klux Klan or white nationalist groups when he said \"we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,\" repeating \"on many sides\" for emphasis.\n\nA spokesman for Merck said the company had no further comment about Mr Frazier's decision, his tweet or the president's response. An email to spokespersons for the White House was not immediately returned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, following the eruption of violence in Charlottesville that morning, Mr Trump first made a general statement about the violence, tweeting that \"We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!\" Later Saturday, he read a statement that included his condemnation of \"hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.\" Critics, including Republicans in his own party, said he should directly condemn the groups by name.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nSenator Cory Gardner, tweeted, \"Mr President - we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism.\"\n\nMr Trump's swift response - and his willingness to go after an American CEO but not specifically name white supremacists in Charlottesville - was noted by a number of observers Monday on social media.\n\nMr Frazier is not the first corporate chieftain to resign in protest from one of the president's advisory councils. In June, following the president's announcement that he planned to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, both Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney CEO Robert Iger resigned from White House advisory councils.\n\nLowering drug prices was a major campaign promise for Mr Trump, and throughout the early part of the year, Mr Trump made threatening and vague statements about the prices of drugs being too high. In the midst of one of the drug industry's biggest conferences in January, Mr Trump accused the pharmaceutical industry of \"getting away with murder,\" fueling speculation that he might take action on drug prices that the industry has long fought - such as allowing the government to bid on prices in the Medicare program.\n\nBut in the intervening months, industry leaders have grown increasingly confident that any governmental actions won't harm their business models. Pharmaceutical chief executives, including Mr Frazier, met with Mr Trump in January and came away from the meeting with the impression that they would not face a serious effort from the White House to lower drug prices through government negotiation on Medicare drug prices.\n\nKey leaders from across government have been meeting to discuss the issue of pricing, but based on leaked documents that have been circulating, including a potential draft executive order on drug pricing, Wall Street analysts have noted that some of the actions being proposed could actually help the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nWashington Post, Reuters", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "15:16:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "15:16:00", "title": "Donald Trump fires back

The president's attack carried particularly ominous implications for Frazier since Trump campaigned against pharmaceutical industry practices, and the White House is expected to soon release its long-promised executive order to rein in drug prices.\n\nFrazier's decision and his subsequent tongue-lashing on Twitter illustrate the tricky balancing act for America's CEOs: Avoid Trump and run the risk of being his target -- or get close to this White House at your peril.\n\nMore than two dozen CEOs and other leaders were invited to serve on Trump's councils, a somewhat symbolic role that gives business executives a chance to bend the ear of the president and potentially win favorable treatment. A number of those leaders, like General Electric's Jeff Immelt, served on similar advisory councils for former President Barack Obama.\n\nUnlike Frazier, most business leaders have stayed quiet and appear to be remaining on the councils -- even if their endorsements are tepid at best.\n\n\"GE has no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism, and we strongly condemn the violent extremism in Charlottesville over the weekend,\" a company spokesperson said Monday, but added, \"With more than 100,000 employees in the United States, it is important for GE to participate in the discussion on how to drive growth and productivity in the U.S., therefore, Jeff Immelt will remain on the Presidential Committee on American Manufacturing.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, offered a similar justification for his continued involvement. \"There's no change in Dell engaging with the Trump administration and governments around the world to share our perspective on policy issues that affect our company, customers and employees,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nSpokespersons for more than 10 other council members, including the CEOs of Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, IBM and Under Armour, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThere's considerable benefit to being in the good graces of the White House. Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell Soup, serves on one of Trump's councils, and the president and the White House have repeatedly celebrated the company. Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris, who serves on one council, met privately with Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt about three weeks before the EPA rolled back an Obama administration ban on a Dow pesticide. (Dow also donated about $1 million to Trump's inauguration.)\n\nBut there's also heightened risk as social protests over White House policies mount. Travis Kalanick, then-CEO of Uber, was pressured into leaving a Trump advisory council in February after the administration pushed its travel ban on immigration from Muslim-majority countries and hundreds of thousands of Uber users reportedly deleted their applications in protest. Some critics of Kalanick, who was ultimately forced out of Uber this summer, pointed to his \"coziness\" with Trump as one reason that he had to go.\n\nExecutives also have gotten less time with the president as the councils sputtered after other prominent CEOs defected -- Elon Musk of Tesla and Bob Iger of Disney resigned their council positions across the spring -- and scheduling conflicts forced postponements. While Trump had suggested that the councils could convene every two months or quarterly, one council hasn't met since February and another hasn't met since April.\n\nMeanwhile, business leaders who engage with the White House continue to take chaff for the president's controversial remarks, and the pressures on those CEOs have been renewed in the wake of the Charlottesville riots. \"Ken Frazier resigned because the President of the United States refused to condemn white supremacists,\" former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted on Monday, with a link to a list of council members. \"What are the rest of you waiting for?\"\n\n\"The councils can provide a valuable tool for business leaders to raise issues ... at the highest levels of the administration,\" said Michael Steel of Hamilton Place Strategies, which has advised clients on working with the White House. But the CEOs are \"also exposed to criticism based on political concerns -- and that is a particularly acute concern given the unprecedented divisiveness and unpopularity of President Trump.\"\n\nCleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove, who serves on one of Trump's advisory councils, has seen both the benefits and frustrations of being in the same circles with the White House. The Ohio surgeon was interviewed by Trump to be Veterans Affairs secretary -- a role that Cosgrove declined. But in recent months, his hospital has faced repeated protests for its decision to hold an upcoming fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's resort in Florida. On Monday, a clinic spokesperson said it would continue to keep its event at the Trump resort -- but clarified it has \"not yet signed a contract for it.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates":

Trump has been vocal about the rising price of prescription drugs, though he has been largely quiet on the topic in the past few months apart from a reported draft drug pricing executive order.\n\nTrump said in a tweet that now Frazier has resigned, \"he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nMerck, which known for its cancer immunotherapy drug Keytruda and its vaccines business, has not been among the pharmaceutical companies that have been called out for hiking the prices of prescription drugs. That's unlike the makers of the emergency allergy medication EpiPen, companies that make a life-saving diabetes medication, and, perhaps the most infamous, the company that raised the price of a decades-old drug to treat a parasitic infection by 5,000%.\n\nHere's Merck's track record with drug pricingIn January, Merck published a report that outlined the company's average list price increases for its products. Merck was one of only a handful of big pharmaceutical companies to disclose, alongside the list price, the net prices -- or the amount Merck actually receives after factoring in rebates and other discounts that drugmakers payout. In 2016, Merck raised prices by an average of 9.6%. But after factoring in rebates, that was just 5.5% (a rate that's still higher than the rate of inflation). \"We've taken a close look at our pricing practices - and we believe we have a good track record,\" Adam Schechter, president of global human health at Merck wrote in an accompanying post in January. \"Since 2010, Merck's average net price increase across our portfolio each year has been in the low to mid-single digits: specifically, 3.4 percent to 6.2 percent.\"Frazier has also been quick to distance himself from companies and individuals like former pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli that jack up the price of prescription drugs.\"He is not us,\" Frazier said at a 2015 industry conference.Which isn't to say Merck isn't a profitable corporation. In the second quarter of 2017, Keytruda, Merck's blockbuster cancer immunotherapy drug that first hit the market in 2014, generated $881 million in sales. A treatment course of cancer immunotherapy can cost more than $100,000, depending on how long patients stay on the drug.Some drug companies have committed to only single-digit list price increases, or other caps on the list price. Merck hasn't been among the companies that have made such promises.\n\nNOW WATCH: Fidelity sector expert: Reports of a stock bubble are exaggerated\n\nMore From Business Insider\n\nHere's what was in

Trump's advisory jobs panel after another CEO resigned in protest.\n\nEarlier Monday, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier said he was leaving the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative committee, citing the president's failure to explicitly denounce those groups that marched in the rally.\n\n\"I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\" said Frazier, calling on America's leaders -- including Trump -- to clearly reject \"expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy.\"\n\nIn January, Frazier and Plank were named to the 28-member panel established by the White House to promote job growth.\n\nIn resigning, Frazier was responding to Trump's slowness in clearly denouncing groups who rallied over the weekend in Charlottesville.\n\nAppearing later Monday, Trump labeled members of the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists who participate in violence as \"criminals and thugs.\"\n\nNineteen people were injured and a woman was killed when a car plowed into counter-protesters. Another dozen or so people were injured in clashes between white nationalists and counter-protesters and two state troopers were killed when their helicopter, which was monitoring the rally, crashed.\n\n\"We are saddened by #Charlottesville,\" Plank said on Under Armour's Twitter account. \"There is no place for racism or discrimination in this world. We choose love & unity.\"\n\nSpokespersons for Plank and Under Armour did not return calls or messages on whether the CEO would remain on the panel.\n\nBy mid-afternoon on Monday, a few hundred people had responded to Plank's message on Twitter, many of them urging him to quit the advisory group.\n\n\"Please keep us loyal to your brand by resigning from Trump's board,\" wrote one.\n\n\"Our family's long loyalty to UA ends today,\" wrote another.\n\nThe social media debate echoed one Under Armour faced in February after Plank was asked about Trump during a televised interview. Plank, who has contributed in the past both to Republican and Democratic elected officials in federal and state posts, told CNBC that having \"such a pro-business president is something that's a real asset to this country.\"\n\nA number of celebrity Under Armour endorsers -- including basketball star Stephen Curry and ballerina Misty Copeland -- released statements saying they did not agree with Plank's assessment.\n\n\"We engage in policy, not politics,\" Under Armour said at the time.\n\nTrump was quick to rebuke Frazier on Monday, lashing out on Twitter that the pharmaceuticals company CEO will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nWith the barb, Trump appeared to attack an industry executive who has tried to make drug pricing somewhat more transparent by revealing his company's overall drug price changes.\n\nFrazier is one of the few African Americans to head a Fortune 500 company.\n\nOthers on the White House manufacturing council include top executives from Boeing, Dell Technologies, Dow Chemical and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nLike Plank, the other CEOs faced calls on social media Monday to resign, but none did.\n\nDow CEO Andrew Liveris issued a statement condemning the violence in Charlottesville and saying the company \"will continue to work to strengthen the social and economic fabric of the communities where it operates -- including supporting policies that help create employment opportunities in manufacturing and rebuild the American workforce.\"\n\nAnother panel member, Brian Krzanich of Intel, tweeted: \"There should be no hesitation in condemning hate speech or white supremacy by name.\"\n\nIn February, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick left the advisory group and said his participation had not meant that he favored the president's policies.\n\nElon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, resigned from the council and two other presidential advisory groups in June after Trump vowed to exit the Paris climate agreement. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned for the same reason from the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, which Trump established to advise him on how government policy impacts economic growth and job creation.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he couldn't \"think of a parallel example\" of any president responding as viciously as Trump did to a CEO departing an advisory council.\n\n\"Usually, certain niceties are observed to smooth over a rupture,\" said Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We've learned that as president, Mr. Trump is behaving exactly as he did as a candidate,\" Galston said. \"He knows only one mode: When attacked, hit back harder.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\njebarker@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/sunjeffbarker", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "21:56:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "21:56:00", "title":

Instead, Trump gave a vague response saying there were \"many sides\" to blame, while the only two sides on display were neo-Nazis and those who stood against their hatred and violence. After his speech, when reporters asked about the white supremacists who supported his candidacy, Trump sauntered away from the podium, ignoring their questions.\n\nTrump has a history of specifically calling out those who oppose him on Twitter, but for two days he remained completely silent on the KKK, \"alt-right,\" neo-Nazis, and white supremacists who gathered in Charlottesville. Although the White House did release a statement that said \"of course\" Trump's condemnation included \"white supremacists, KKK Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups,\" the statement was attributed to an unnamed spokesperson.\n\nTrump's inaction prompted Merck CEO Ken Frazier to step down from the president's council on manufacturing. He released a statement through Merck's Twitter page saying his decision is \"a matter of personal conscience\" and \"to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\" Frazier is the second African-American to lead a major pharmaceutical company and has a history of working for social justice as an attorney.\n\nWhile Trump had yet to condemn white supremacists, he wasted no time going after Frazier on Twitter.\n\nTrump's decision to criticize an African-American man standing up against intolerance before attacking the perpetrators of racist violence shows a someone with a broken -- if not completely nonexistent -- moral compass. On Monday, Trump finally condemned white supremacists, saying, \"Racism is evil -- and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\" But coming from a man who rose to political power perpetrating the \"birther\" conspiracy, calling Mexicans \"rapists,\" and scapegoating Muslims, his worlds couldn't ring more hollow.\n\nFrazier isn't the only big-business executive to quit one of Trump's advisory councils. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk quit three of President Trump's business advisory councils after he pulled out of the Paris climate agreement in June. \"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" Musk said. Disney CEO Bob Iger followed suit and left an advisory council for the same reason, calling it \"a matter of principle.\" Trump refrained from attacking them on Twitter.", "location": null,

Frazier resigned from Donald Trump's American Manufacturing Council on Monday.\n\nOne woman, Heather Heyer, was killed when a terrorist slammed his car into a group of counter-protestors. Nineteen others sustained injuries in the crash. Additionally, two state troopers perished in a helicopter crash now considered to be a part of the events in Charlottesville, because Lt. H. Jay Cullen and Trooper Berke M. M. Bates were monitoring the violence from above.\n\nNotably, the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, blamed white supremacists and Nazis for every death and injury over the weekend, saying, \"Go home. You are not wanted in this great commonwealth. You pretend that you are patriots, but you are anything but patriots,\" during a press conference.\n\nTrump's lack of specific criticism towards or disavowing of literal Nazis provoked bipartisan outrage. Politicians like Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Marco Rubio and even fucking Jeff Sessions all denounced the violence perpetrated by white nationalists in Charlottesville as acts of domestic terrorism.\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy,\" Frazier said in a statement explaining his resignation.\n\nPredictably, Trump lashed out against Frazier after Frazier announced his departure via Twitter.\n\nThis is not the first time that Trump's conduct has repulsed those who serve on his advisory councils, and is unlikely the last time either.\n\nSix members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS also resigned in June, after it became clear that \"the policies promoted by this administration, including the substantial Medicaid budget cuts, are grossly antagonistic to the health of people with HIV,\" according to Dr. Ada Adimora, a doctor who actually stayed on the council.\n\nElon Musk and Disney CEO Robert Iger both quit White House business advisory councils in June following Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe president clarified his initial comments in a six-minute statement on Monday, condemning violence in \"the strongest possible terms\" and calling racism \"evil,\" but maintained his refusal to call the acts terrorism,

Trump criticised over Charlottesville response\n\nAs US authorities begin to investigate the deadly violence stemming from a white nationalist rally in Virginia, many are attacking the Presidents' comments for being too tame.\n\nMore videos Rally organiser mobbed by protesters\n\n'Unite the Right' march organiser, Jason Kessler, ran for his life after an angry crowd stormed a news conference in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nSeveral of the president's top advisers, including his new chief of staff, John Kelly, pressed Mr Trump to issue a more forceful rebuke after his comment Saturday that the violence in Charlottesville was initiated by \"many sides,\" prompting nearly universal criticism.\n\nThat pressure reached a boiling point early Monday after the president attacked the head of Merck pharmaceuticals, who is black, for quitting an advisory board over his failure to call out white nationalists.\n\nRelated Articles Trump fires back after CEO resigns over Virginia violence After violence in Charlottesville, vigils for peace and healing\n\nMerck's chief executive, Kenneth C. Frazier, resigned from the president's American Manufacturing Council on Monday, saying he objected to the president's statement Saturday blaming violence that left one woman dead on \"many sides.\"\n\n\"America's leaders must honour our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Mr Frazier said in a tweet announcing he was stepping down from the panel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Frazier is one of just a handful of black chief executives of a Fortune 500 company.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nLess than an hour later, Mr Trump responded on social media as he departed his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, for a day trip back to Washington.\n\n\"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\" the president wrote.\n\nMr Trump's shot at one of the country's best-known black executives prompted an immediate outpouring of support for Frazier from major figures in business, media and politics.\n\n\"Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is,\" Paul Polman, the chief executive of Unilever, wrote on Twitter.\n\nIt's not unusual for Mr Trump to attack, via Twitter, any public figure who ridicules, criticises or even mildly questions his actions. But his decision to take on Mr Frazier, a self-made multimillionaire who rose from a modest childhood in Philadelphia to attend Harvard Law School, was extraordinary given the wide-ranging criticism he has faced from both parties for not forcefully denouncing the neo-Nazis and Klan sympathisers who rampaged in Charlottesville.\n\nMr Frazier appeared next to Mr Trump at the White House last month to announce an agreement among drugmakers that would create 1,000 jobs.\n\nHe is only the second African-American executive to lead a major pharmaceutical firm and rose in prominence as Merck's general counsel when he successfully defended the company against class-action lawsuits stemming from complications involving the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx.\n\n\"It took Trump 54 minutes to condemn Merck CEO Ken Frazier, but after several days he still has not condemned murdering white supremacists,\" Keith Boykin, a former aide to President Bill Clinton who comments on politics and race for CNN, wrote in a tweet.\n\nMr Frazier's exit from the business council marks a mini-exodus of business leaders, resulting from the president's stances on social issues and the environment. His recent decision to leave the Paris climate accord prompted Elon Musk of Tesla to resign, as did the chief executive of Disney, Bob Iger, and Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs.\n\nCar attack suspect refused bail\n\nA Virginia judge on Monday declined to set bail for James Alex Fields jnr, the 20-year-old Ohio man accused of second-degree murder and other charges after authorities said he ploughed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters near the scene of the white supremacist rally.\n\nThat means Fields, whom news reports have described as fascinated by Nazism, will remain jailed at least until he has an attorney.\n\nJames Alex Fields jnr, second from left, holds a black shield at the rally in Charlottesville. Photo: AP\n\nThe local public defenders' office informed the court it could not represent him because of a potential conflict of interest - someone in the office has a relative who was hurt during Saturday's violence in Charlottesville.\n\nA local attorney will be appointed to represent Fields and could request bail before the next scheduled hearing, August 25.\n\nFields, clad in a black-and-white striped uniform, appeared via video link for the hearing. He briefly responded to questions from Judge Robert Downer, replying \"No, sir,\" when asked if he had any ties to the Charlottesville community.\n\nSaturday's car rampage killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was among the crowd of counter-protesters responding to the rally by white nationalists and others who oppose a plan to remove from a Charlottesville park of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Fields was taken into custody soon afterward.\n\nNew York Times, McClatchy", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textEnd": 7227, "textStart": 7218, "amb": false, "date":

His concern: The president did not explicitly condemn the actions of white supremacists.\n\nFrazier, who is African American and has been photographed sitting next to Trump at White House meetings, said in a tweet on Monday that U.S. leaders must \"honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy.\"\n\nPresident Trump lashed back on Twitter within the hour, saying that because of his resignation, Fraizer \"will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES.\"\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry has come under scrutiny for its pricing practices. Merck, however, has not been set upon by lawmakers. And if the company's rising stock price is any indication, Trump's tweet has been written off by investors: At a recent $62.91, shares of Merck rose nearly 1%, almost in line with the S&P 500's 1.05% gain. The iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (IHE) inched 0.6% higher to $149.07 a share and the iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF (IBB) rose 1.1% today to $309.88 a share.\n\nThis is certainly not the first time that President Trump has let loose about drug prices. Yet as a hot button topics go, it no longer seems to deliver the same punch it did earlier this year. It is especially ineffective against Merck because the company voluntarily released information about drug-pricing practices earlier this year. In fact, today's debate has instead focused on Trump's attack on Frazier.\n\nFrazier is not the first CEO to exit such a position. Both Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co. (DIS) CEO Robert Iger walked away from advisory panels in June after President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement.\n\nGranted, 2017 has been a benign year for Merck's stock. Up almost 7% since Dec. 31, the shares have lagged the broader market, as it recovers from a recent cyberattack. Still, Merck's immunotherapy drug Keytruda has been a big success for the company. Add to that, an experimental cholesterol-lowering drug and other pipeline prospects, and there are strong catalysts capable of lifting Merck's share price higher over the next year.\n\nJust ask Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan and his team. The analysts regard Merck as their top pick among big-cap drug makers.\n\nMRK remains our Top Pick with ESMO, KN-189 data upcoming. We continue to see MRK as a top pick in US Pharma as Keytruda gains traction both in 1st line non-small cell lung cancer (both in monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy) and various other indications. ESMO will be a relatively quieter meeting for MRK this year from a data perspective but we expect continued discussion around the potential uses of Keytruda while awaiting the topline data from the confirmatory KEYNOTE-189 study in the Sept/Oct timeframe, which we expect to be positive. The need to recover from the recent cyber-attack will likely take away some of the potential near-term earnings upside but, on a fundamental level, we see MRK as the best positioned company in our space for 2H 2017.", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2303, "textStart": 2296, "amb": false, "date": "-12-31"}], "time": "14:05:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {},

Nearly all of Merck's drugs are \"approved\" by the FDA through an utterly fraudulent process of fake science, cherry-picked clinical trials and regulatory corruption and fraud. Remember, Merck is the same company whose own virologists filed a False Claims Act with the federal government, explaining they were ordered by Merck management to fake vaccine trial results in order to \"trick\" the FDA. Merck's entire mumps vaccine operation is a complete and total fraud.\n\nMerck has also been caught committing widespread scientific fraud by disguising its in-house propagandists as \"independent science\" authors for medical science papers that were published in mainstream science journals. Merck is to medicine, in other words, what Monsanto is to the food industry: They're both steeped in evil, scientific fraud and deep deception.\n\nThe number of deaths in Charlottesville absolutely pales in comparison to the number of Americans killed each year by Merck and other pharmaceutical giants. As PharmaDeathClock.com documents in real time, chemotherapy drugs have killed 17.6 million people since the year 2000. SSRI drugs have killed over 700,000 people, and the generic category of \"prescription drugs\" shows at least 400,000 deaths. Merck's share of these deaths is substantial. So why aren't millions of Americans marching in the streets to demand Ken Frazier's scalp? (The answer, of course, is that public outrage is entirely manipulated by George Soros and the mainstream media to be directed at their political targets. It has nothing at all to do with the truth about which corporations or people are actually doing the most killing of innocents...)\n\nMerck is also heavily involved in profiting off the opioid addiction epidemic that's now ravaging America while generating record profits for companies like Merck. If anyone is committing mass violence against America, it's people like Merck CEO Ken Frazier, a person who belongs behind bars for his continued sacrificing of human beings for corporate profits. The violence in Charlottesville is nothing at all compared to the violence carried out by Merck's vaccine division alone, not to mention its other drugs.\n\nIn response to Ken Frazier's leaving the President's manufacturing council, President Trump tweeted a sharp response:\n\nNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\n\nAnd he's right about that: Merck, Pfizer, GSK and other drug giants have all ripped off America for decades with sky-high, monopoly-enforced drug prices that are bankrupting this nation (while poisoning people to death). Big Pharma is the primary reason why health care is so unaffordable in America, and it's companies like Merck that are routinely caught bribing doctors, price fixing drugs, defrauding Medicare, faking drug trials, corrupting regulators and buying off media outlets to push more pro-drug propaganda. Just search Natural News for \"Merck\" to see dozens of articles document all these crimes and violations over the years.\n\nIn all, the violence witnessed in Charlottesville doesn't even register compared to the chemical violence committed against millions of Americans every year by Merck and other drug giants. Yet have you noticed how the bought-off mainstream media never covers prescription drug violence? That's because they're all prostitutes for the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nIn a truly just society, people like Ken Frazier would be arrested, indicted for widespread fraud and corruption, and spend the rest of their lives behind bars. Instead, he's probably paid a $100 million salary to keep poisoning America while claiming Trump is somehow responsible for violence in America. Ever notice how powerful corporate CEOs never go to jail in this country? No, according to the fake news media, poisoning children with mercury in vaccines is \"loving\" and good, but trying to dismantle the Big Pharma price monopolies and make medicine more affordable is \"bad\" and evil.\n\nCEOs whose products murder millions of people are \"good people,\" we're told, while President Trump is somehow a \"racist\" even though he had nothing at all to do with the events in Charlottesville. That's how twisted things have become in this country. And of course, there's zero media coverage of this anti-Trump activist who just shot his neighbor in the head at point blank range. When Leftists shoot Trump supporters, the left-wing media pretends it never happened.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "18:00:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {"liCnt": 7,

Reuters\n\nTo the CEOs who joined President Trump's manufacturing council in the hope of advising the president about what's good for America's private sector I have one thing to say.\n\nStop playing yourselves. Now is the time.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Trump has proven that he not only doesn't care about the values of the American workplace, but also that he doesn't respect your opinion about what those values should be.\n\nI'm sure you're all aware of the heinous events that transpired in Charlottesville, Virginia this weekend when white supremacists and fascists of various strains descended on the city to put their violence and bigotry on display for the world to see. An American died there, and all Trump had for her were a few pithy words about how there was blame to go around on all sides.\n\nAnd then on Monday when Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, one of the few black CEO's on the council, resigned over Trump's absurd response to what transpired, Trump did what he is known to do. He went on a Twitter rampage.\n\n\"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES,\" he tweeted.\n\nLet's put aside the fact that Merck is one of the most transparent drug companies around.\n\nAnd we'll even put aside that Frazier is black, and the fact that none of the white CEO's on the manufacturing council have followed him out the door speaks volumes.\n\nWhat's more important to focus on for our purposes is that a number of CEO's said they joined this manufacturing council to help the president make better decisions about American business. That obviously isn't happening.\n\nBusiness leaders will tell you that discrimination creates a hostile work environment, so any business minded politician should care about that. They should care that people qualified and ready to work feel safe when they do so. This has become a value, a norm in American business.\n\nThat is why you see some of the people who participated in the Charlottesville protests getting fired from their jobs. In America, we have decided that no one has a right to make anyone else feel uncomfortable in their place of business because of their race or religion, and that business owners have a right to make sure of that.\n\nThis shouldn't have to be articulated to the President of the United States.\n\nBut if you think you can articulate it, you're playing yourself. Trump isn't really taking the advice of the CEO's who he's surrounded himself with in these photo ops.\n\nWe've already seen some examples of this. Tesla CEO Elon Musk left the council after he said the US would back out of the Paris climate accord. Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick left after the controversial immigration \"ban.\"\n\nBoth men tried to argue that they joined because thought they could advise the President.\n\nHis decisions made it obvious that that was not the case. Their advice never mattered. They couldn't change Trump's mind about a policy once it was set. Think about it: His closest advisors barely can move him, let alone people outside the White House. Remember how he steamrolled them (and business leaders) with his decision to leave the Paris Climate Accord.\n\nSo CEOs: save the \"But I'm helping him\" excuses for someone else.\n\nNow maybe you, a millionaire CEO, are afraid of a tweet from Trump. That is the impression at least one cowardly CEO gave the New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin:\n\nWhen I asked one chief executive Monday morning why he had remained publicly silent, he told me: \"Just look at what he did to Ken. I'm not sticking my head up.\" Which, of course, is the reason he said I could not quote him by name.\n\nWow.\n\nOne of the scariest things about American capitalism is that CEOs can sometimes rule like kings (watch a board try to unseat JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and see what happens) while presidents get elected every four years. Think about that for a second.\n\nOr maybe you're on the council because you think you can play Trump's game. Frazier, perhaps, thought it would be better to have a seat at the table as Trump talked drug pricing and health care.\n\nMaybe you think that, like Boeing, you can petition the President to move against your foreign rivals (in Boeing's case, Bombardier) for the benefit of your company.\n\nIt's a cynical trick, but at least it makes sense.\n\nIt's not worth it. Trump's trade policy has been nothing but disarray so far, just like the rest of his policies. If you play this game maybe you'll get a nice tariff or some tough talk against your competitors, but none of that lasts forever.\n\nYou know what does? Photos of you sitting around a table with a President who doesn't care what you say. Photos of you looking like a sycophant wasting your shareholders', employees', and customers' time.", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 215, "textStart": 198, "amb": false, "date":

America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.

The high prices charged by pharmaceutical companies have long been a burden on millions of Americans -- one that likely would have been made worse under Trumpcare if it had passed the Senate, though I would be shocked if the president was aware of that. He is famously not detail-oriented about health care legislation.\n\nBut that is beside the point. Trump is hearing from all across the political spectrum that his response to the weekend's events in Charlottesville, culminating in the death of an activist allegedly at the hands of a white supremacist, was completely tone-deaf and inadequate.\n\nIt is one thing to hear it from the media. But to have that criticism come from a millionaire business executive, the kind of person whose approval Trump craves? That obviously stings. So he defaults to his go-to move: lashing out on Twitter.\n\nHe might have felt better for a minute after sending that tweet.

But companies may worry about what weighing in on an emotionally charged issue will mean for the bottom line.\n\nYet some say that when a corporate leader takes a position that appears to be grounded in principle, it can actually burnish a company's image.\n\n\"There are always concerns that business leaders have about the consequences of taking a moral stand,'' says Katherine Phillips, who teaches leadership at Columbia Business School. \"But oftentimes I think those leaders recognize that the moral stand they take could be good for business.\"\n\nFrazier's decision came In the wake of a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. on Saturday that left three people dead, and dozens more injured.\n\nPresident Trump gave an initial statement that did not specifically denounce the KKK, neo-Nazis and other racist groups who engaged in the violence. Lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle, and others condemned what they viewed as a tepid and inadequate response.\n\nFrazier has been by Trump's side in the past several months, during a round table talk with pharmaceutical company executives, as well as an event where Merck and Pfizer said they would work with Corning to produce more jobs and create sturdier glass vials.\n\nBut on Monday, Frazier said that he would be leaving Trump's manufacturing business council, tweeting that \"as CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\n\"I think it could encourage other business leaders to speak out and to recognize that their reputations are influenced by who they're affiliated with,'' Phillips says.\n\nBut wading into the roiling waters of race relations and other hot button topics can backfire. In 2015, for instance, the first phase of an initiative by Starbucks, in which baristas were given the choice of penning the words \"Race Together'' on customers cups, was largely met with scorn and derision by critics who said the idea was simplistic.\n\nMore: Merck's CEO quits Trump's council over Charlottesville, the president claps back\n\nMore: Trump bestows moral equivalency\n\nMore: President Trump condemns white supremacists after Charlottesville violence\n\nBut not speaking out could also hurt a company's reputation, particularly if the issue is one that it has professed to take an interest in, such as LGBT rights, diversity or criminal justice reform, says Rashad Robinson, executive director of the civil rights group Color of Change.\n\n\"There are other CEOs that are still part of this Trump business council,\" says Robinson who called Frazier's stance \"powerful.''\n\n\"These companies need to tell us what side of history do they want to be on,'' he continued. \"It's not just Charlottesville. (There are) attacks on a whole set of issues many of these companies say publicly they care about. Attacks on diversity and fairness . . . The hypocrisy is clear, and hopefully this statement from Merck will be a step in the right direction.\"\n\nMany took to Twitter to praise Frazier's decision.\n\n\"Mr. Frazier has a conscience,'' tweeted Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money on CNBC. \"That's America.''\n\n566564001 View Live Authoring TypeEmbedCredit / BylineNot setCreated By:cjonesSourceNot setClassificationNot setInitial Publish08/14/17 4:58:44 PMEmbargo DateNot embargoedTotal ViewsCurrently unavailableTotal Social RefersCurrently unavailableembed: Twitter\n\nListen--free speech is a two-way street and i get that..

Dell said in a statement Monday that it would continue engaging with theTrump administration .\n\nBut some civil rights advocates say that so far, outside advisers do not appear to have had much of a mitigating effect on Trump's policies or pronouncements.\n\n\"Right after the election we heard a lot of CEOs and even people in the Democratic party talk about . .. 'if we just get inside the room and share our opinions, then somehow Donald Trump will back away from some of these actions,' '' Robinson says, saying that has not been the case. \" People who do want change have to recognize that those who tell us that simply being at the table is going to make things better have to prove that to be true.''\n\nFrazier was the only African American member of the manufacturing advisory council, and Phillips said that some observers might unfortunately assign less significance to his stance because he is black.\n\n\"I think in some ways, when African American people stand up . . . . for what they're expected to stand up for, it can have less influence,'' she says. \"I hope that a white leader also does the same because I do think it may speak even louder than what Mr. Frazier does.''\n\nBut Cornell Brooks, former president of the NAACP and a long-time civil rights lawyer says that Frazier's stature and reputation give his decision great weight, regardless of race.\n\n\"He is a very well-respected CEO, a well respected attorney and a pioneering African American corporate leader,'' Brooks says. He \"leads one of America's largest and most prominent companies. I think most people will regard his act as one of personal conviction.''\n\nListen--free speech is a two-way street and i get that..

By Monday morning, it appeared the network had found the group to point its collective finger at for the continued racism, violence and polarization in America: not the Nazis, the KKK, white supremacists or the \"alt-right,\" but the mainstream media.\n\nAs graphic images of white men carrying tiki torches and attacking counterprotesters flooded timelines across the nation, hosts of the right-wing morning talk show Fox & Friends blamed the left and the media for wanting to \"run with their narrative\" about the latest developments.\n\nRelated: Fox News Was Attacking Obama For Using Mustard At This Point In His Presidency\n\nDaily Emails and Alerts - Get the best of Newsweek delivered to your inbox\n\nFox News hosts Abby Huntsman and Pete Hegseth slammed news outlets for their coverage of President Donald Trump's statement on the rally, in which he failed to directly condemn white supremacists and the alt-right movement, instead stating that hate had come \"from all sides.\"\n\n\"It seems like an open door now for them to run with their narrative, when the president didn't come out and call it for what it was,\" Huntsman said Monday morning. \"In their minds, and a lot of them, they say this can, we can associate the president with these groups, and that fits a lot of the narrative on the left, a lot of the media, and that is very problematic for, for, society.\"\n\n\"Of course, because so much of the left sees this world not through America first but through racial identity politics first,\" Hegseth said.\n\nTrump's favorite news outlet was one of the only networks to praise his response to Charlottesville. Others criticized the president's statement as falling short of an outright rejection of white supremacy.\n\nRebuke of Trump's statement didn't come solely from the media, however. Ken Frazier, CEO of the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co., resigned from the president's manufacturing council Monday. \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy,\" Frazier wrote in a statement announcing his departure. His resignation seemed to anger the president, who tweeted in response: \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nSeveral former presidents spoke out about the events over the weekend, including Bill Clinton, who stated, \"Even as we protect free speech and assembly, we must condemn the hatred, violence and white supremacy on display in Charlottesville.\"\n\nBarack Obama quoted Nelson Mandela on Twitter, writing, \"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion,\" along with a photo of him greeting multiracial children during his tenure in the White House.\n\nVice President Mike Pence also directly condemned white supremacy in a statement, saying, \"We have no tolerance for hate and violence from white supremacists, neo-Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\nBut according to Fox News, it was the media, not Trump or the racists in Charlottesville, who should be judged after one woman was killed and at least 19 others were injured at the weekend rally.\n\n\"Look for the press to keep pressing him no matter what,\" Hegseth quipped. \"In their mind, nothing is ever good enough.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "13:12:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl":

It was a classic bounce-back from a week where reports from North Korea pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average down from its 22,200 high to the Friday close of 21,858. The early rise of 140 Dow points retraced about half those losses.\n\nThen, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) CEO Kenneth Frazier resigned from a federal manufacturing council over the weekend's events, and President Donald Trump reacted with a tweet that left analysts in shock, because it attacked both Frazier and the pharmaceutical industry over high prices.\n\nIn response, prices were not shaken. But will the economy be stirred?\n\nFrazier is a Democrat and his company's political action committee contributed close to equally to both parties last cycle.\n\nHis decision to serve the Trump administration was comparable to former General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) CEO Jeff Immelt's service to the Obama administration. Immelt is a lifelong Republican who came under severe criticism from conservatives over that decision. Frazier, who is African-American, was seated next to Trump in pictures of the council.\n\nNone of this should matter. MRK stock should be a buy, having delivered $3.5 billion in net income on $19.4 billion in revenue for the first six months, along with $3.8 billion in operating cash flow. Merck has done this while keeping its price increases to the mid-single digits when discounts are included in the calculation.\n\nThere are \"bad actors\" among drug companies, in terms of pricing, but Merck is not one of them. The attack by the president was personal.\n\nFrazier is not alone. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger previously left Trump boards, troubled by the direction of policy.\n\nA president's power is proportional to their popularity and performance. If Trump's popularity means his power is declining, that could be bullish for stocks.\n\nBut stupid policy also yields stupid results.\n\nInvestors are desperate for something to invest in, the price of Bitcoin having tripled this year, up another 5% early on Aug. 14. Speculation is spilling outside the real economy, and the dollar index is down, meaning international investors are having their U.S. market gains wiped out when they try to bring them home.", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"freq": 2, "textStart": 89, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-14", "textEnd": 96, "amb": false}], "time": "14:37:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "16:13:00", "title": "Trump Lashes Out at Merck & Co., Inc.

Frazier, one of the few African American CEOs in the Fortune 500, said, \"I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism\" and touted the power of diversity. \"Our country's strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations and political beliefs.\"\n\nWithin an hour after the statement was first issued, Trump tweeted his initial response. \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nJust to be clear, Trump will do nothing to lower drug prices.\n\n* Jana Winter reports that the government saw something like Charlottesville coming:\n\nThe FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in May warned that white supremacist groups had already carried out more attacks than any other domestic extremist group over the past 16 years and were likely to carry out more attacks over the next year, according to an intelligence bulletin obtained by Foreign Policy.\n\nEven as President Donald Trump continues to resist calling out white supremacists for violence, federal law enforcement has made clear that it sees these types of domestic extremists as a severe threat. The report, dated May 10, says the FBI and DHS believe that members of the white supremacist movement \"likely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year.\"\n\nWe should also note that less than two weeks after Trump took office, his administration moved to revamp a program called Countering Extremist Violence so that it would no longer address white supremacists and would focus solely on Muslims.\n\n* An Oklahoma man has been arrested by the FBI on charges that he tried to detonate what he thought was a 1,000 pound bomb, driven by admiration for Timothy McVeigh and anti-government \"Three Percenter\" ideology.\n\n* Here's a transcript of the remarks President Trump made today in which he made clear that he does in fact oppose the KKK and neo-Nazis.\n\n* Greg Jarrett reports that President Trump says \"I am seriously considering pardoning Sheriff [Joe] Arpaio,\" who was convicted of blatantly ignoring judicial orders to stop randomly harassing Hispanic people.\n\n* Jonathan Cohn argues that despite Trump's tantrums, the core Republican dilemma on health care remains unresolved.\n\n* Francis Wilkinson argues that too many Bernie Sanders supporters are still in sway to the idea that everything is rigged against them, and explains what that means for the Democratic Party going forward.\n\n* Jennifer Rubin has some ideas on what Republicans can do if they really want to distance themselves from white supremacists and atone for Trump.\n\n* Mark Muro reports that industrial robots are significantly more common in red states than blue states, which may help explain economic anxiety (that's actual economic anxiety, as opposed to \"economic anxiety\") in those places.\n\n* Harold Pollack argues that universal coverage, not \"single payer,\" should be the litmus test for Democratic ideas on health care from this point forward.\n\n* At the American Prospect, I examined the \"many sides\" of Trump's moral rot -- and that of the Republicans who are complicit with him.\n\n* And Trump is down to 34 percent approval in the latest Gallup poll.", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1811, "textStart": 1805, "amb": false, "date":

killed on Saturday when a car rammed into a crowd protesting against a white supremacist rally.\n\nFollowing the death, Mr Trump was criticised for not specifically denouncing the far right.\n\nKen Frazier tweeted: \"I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\n\"America's leaders must honour our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\"\n\nIn response, Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Frazier would now have \"more time to lower rip off drug prices\".\n\nIn January, Mr Trump called on pharmaceutical companies to cut \"astronomical\" drug prices.\n\nIn a meeting at the Oval Office, the president met Mr Frazier and other executives from companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly, and told them prices for drugs must come down.\n\nHe said if they brought production back to the US, the administration would lower regulations and speed up approval for new medicines.\n\nAnalysis: Anthony Zurcher, Senior North America Reporter\n\nOne of only a handful of black heads of Fortune 500 companies resigns from a White House advisory board in protest at Donald Trump's tepid response to the Charlottesville attacks, and the president cannot resist kicking the man on the way out of the door.\n\nWhile it is a move that is in keeping with Mr Trump's reputation as someone who responds aggressively to any perceived slight, his tweet is politically risky.\n\nPressure will mount on other corporate leaders to follow suit, lest they be viewed as being soft on racism.\n\nLeaders such as Thea Lee of the AFL-CIO, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo and Mark Fields of Ford Motor Company are sure to feel the heat from members and shareholders.\n\nThe White House has been scrambling since Saturday night to control the damage caused by Mr Trump's \"both sides\" comment, when ascribing blame for the Charlottesville violence.\n\nThe president has faced sharp criticism from the left and the right, as conservative members of Congress show newfound willingness to distance themselves from Mr Trump on this matter.\n\nOnce again, a Trump tweet complicates the press team's job.\n\nWhile they are busy bailing out the ship, the president is poking more holes in the hull.\n\nThe White House has rejected criticism of President Trump's response to the violence at the weekend.\n\nDemonstrations and vigils have been held in cities across the United States in support of Charlottesville.\n\nOther company heads have also previously stepped down from presidential advisory councils in protest at Mr Trump's policies.\n\nFormer Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick left the business advisory council in February over the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nTesla's chief executive Elon Musk and Walt Disney's chief executive Robert Iger left the President's Strategic and Policy Forum in June, after Mr Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "11:46:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl":

By Monday morning, it appeared the network had found the group to point its collective finger at for the continued racism, violence and polarization in America: not the Nazis, the KKK, white supremacists or the \"alt-right,\" but the mainstream media.\n\nAs graphic images of white men carrying tiki torches and attacking counterprotesters flooded timelines across the nation, hosts of the right-wing morning talk show Fox & Friends blamed the left and the media for wanting to \"run with their narrative\" about the latest developments.\n\nRelated: Fox News Was Attacking Obama For Using Mustard At This Point In His Presidency\n\nTrending: Plague: Fleas in Arizona Test Positive for Easily Spread and Fatal Disease\n\nFox News hosts Abby Huntsman and Pete Hegseth slammed news outlets for their coverage of President Donald Trump's statement on the rally, in which he failed to directly condemn white supremacists and the alt-right movement, instead stating that hate had come \"from all sides.\"\n\n\"It seems like an open door now for them to run with their narrative, when the president didn't come out and call it for what it was,\" Huntsman said Monday morning. \"In their minds, and a lot of them, they say this can, we can associate the president with these groups, and that fits a lot of the narrative on the left, a lot of the media, and that is very problematic for, for, society.\"\n\n\"Of course, because so much of the left sees this world not through America first but through racial identity politics first,\" Hegseth said.\n\nDon't miss: Trump's Approval Rating Is Just 10 Points Higher Than Richard Nixon's Before He Resigned\n\nTrump's favorite news outlet was one of the only networks to praise his response to Charlottesville. Others criticized the president's statement as falling short of an outright rejection of white supremacy.\n\nRebuke of Trump's statement didn't come solely from the media, however. Ken Frazier, CEO of the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co., resigned from the president's manufacturing council Monday. \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy,\" Frazier wrote in a statement announcing his departure. His resignation seemed to anger the president, who tweeted in response: \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nSeveral former presidents spoke out about the events over the weekend, including Bill Clinton, who stated, \"Even as we protect free speech and assembly, we must condemn the hatred, violence and white supremacy on display in Charlottesville.\"\n\nMost popular: Trump Told White Supremacists to Attack Protesters, So They Did\n\nBarack Obama quoted Nelson Mandela on Twitter, writing, \"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion,\" along with a photo of him greeting multiracial children during his tenure in the White House.\n\nVice President Mike Pence also directly condemned white supremacy in a statement, saying, \"We have no tolerance for hate and violence from white supremacists, neo-Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\nBut according to Fox News, it was the media, not Trump or the racists in Charlottesville, who should be judged after one woman was killed and at least 19 others were injured at the weekend rally.\n\n\"Look for the press to keep pressing him no matter what,\" Hegseth quipped. \"In their mind, nothing is ever good enough.\"\n\nMore from Newsweek\n\nFox News Was Attacking Barack Obama for Using Dijon Mustard at This Point in His

We will continue to build our companies around the principles of respect, trust and equal opportunity to all our employees,\" the statement said.\n\nEarlier Monday, Merck (MRK) CEO Kenneth Frazier, one of the most prominent African-American business executives, resigned from Trump's business council, in apparent protest of the president's response to violent clashes in Virginia, saying he was doing so \"as a matter of personal conscience\" and that he felt \"a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\npic.twitter.com/a1PNQZism5 -- Merck (@Merck)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nThe vicious attacks that took place on Saturday by members of white nationalist, Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups, left three dead, including a young woman who was killed when a Dodge Challenger plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nMuilenburg is one of a handful of other CEOs who have not resigned from Trump's advisory groups after the president failed to mention white nationalist groups specifically in his remarks following the incidents in Charlottesville.\n\nSteve Schwarzman, CEO of private equity group Blackstone and leader of Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, condemned the events in Charlottesville but said he would remain on the forum.\n\n\"As the president said today, I believe we need to find a path to heal the wounds left by this tragedy and address its underlying causes. Encouraging tolerance and understanding must be a core national imperative and I will work to further that goal,\" Schwarzman said in a statement.\n\nJeff Immelt, current chairman of General Electric, will stay on the Manufacturing Council, even though his company said in a statement they have \"no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism.\"\n\nTwo days after the incidents in Charlottesville, Trump issued another statement, this time singling out the groups by name.\n\n\"Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists,\" Trump said.\n\nWhile Muilenburg may be staying on board, Trump and the Boeing CEO also have a muddied history of their own. In December, then President-elect Trump, publicly attacked Boeing in a tweet for what he called \"out of control\" costs.\n\n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion.

This time, with help of a Teleprompter, the President grasped his way to the right platitudes.\n\nTwo days too late, Trump read the words \"racism is evil\" and identified among its practitioners \"neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists\" such as those whose torch-filled march in support of Charlottesville's Robert E. Lee statue had precipitated the violence.\n\nHis script continued: \"Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America.\"\n\nThe man speaking those very welcome words was not the real Donald Trump.\n\nThe real Donald Trump immediately launches his Twitter app in a lather of fury against individuals he perceives to diminish his rule, be it North Korea's Kim Jong Un, MSNBC's Joe and Mika or one of the top black executives in America.\n\nThe real Donald Trump doesn't wait for 48 hours to find the correct words; he knows innately what to do and say.\n\nThe other one plays President on TV.\n\nSend a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "21:16:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "21:16:00", "title": "The real Donald Trump plays 'Donald Trump' on TV", "date": "2017-08-14", "uri": "709447571", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3411158.1502743913!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/trump.jpg", "source": {"title": "Daily News", "uri": "nydailynews.com", "id": "422"}, "id": "9163186", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 100, "id": 285}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity", "wgt": 100, "id": 298}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "wgt": 100, "id": 757}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "id": "120", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "id": "233", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "id": "113913", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "id": "200134", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "type": "org", "id": "302546", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302718", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302813", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302940", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "type": "person", "id": "302942", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303051", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry", "label": {"eng": "Pharmaceutical industry"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303802", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304262", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American", "label": {"eng": "African American"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304393", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305262", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}, "type": "person", "id": "305547", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}, "type": "person", "id": "305922", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305969", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}, "type": "org", "id": "306254", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Christie", "label": {"eng": "Chris Christie"}, "type": "person", "id": "309069", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un", "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong-un"}, "type": "person", "id": "312664", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500", "label": {"eng": "Fortune 500"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313132", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan", "label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "318256", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_&_Co.", "label": {"eng": "Merck & Co."}, "type": "org", "id": "321096", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Chairman Jeffrey Immelt will not follow Merck & Co. CEO Kenneth Frazier's exit from President Donald Trump's American Manufacturing Council.\n\nFrazier resigned Monday, and said in a statement that Trump didn't come out strongly enough against the white nationalist rallies in Charlottesville, Va., that led to the death of a anti-racism protester.\n\nGE is one of the Capital Region's largest employers with more than 6,000 workers, most of them in Schenectady County.\n\n\"GE has no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism, and we strongly condemn the violent extremism in Charlottesville over the weekend,\" GE spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman said. \"GE is a proudly inclusive company with employees who represent all religions, nationalities, sexual orientations and races.\"\n\nGE has a long history of supporting diversity in the workplace, and Immelt has been critical of Trump, even as he has served on Trump's council, on the president's views on immigration and inclusiveness.\n\nHowever, Friedman said that Immelt, who stepped down as CEO of GE on Aug. 1 but remains chairman of the company, would stay on the council since the goal is to increase U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing, a strong desire of GE and Immelt.\n\n\"With more than 100,000 employees in the United States, it is important for GE to participate in the discussion on how to drive growth and productivity in the U.S., therefore, Jeff Immelt will remain on the Presidential Committee on American Manufacturing while he is the chairman of GE,\" Friedman said.\n\nImmelt was replaced as CEO by John Flannery. Immelt is scheduled to step down as chairman at the end of this year when Flannery will take the post.\n\nFrazier, the Merck CEO, issued a statement on Twitter explaining that America's leaders must take a stand against hate and racism. He implied Trump did not go far enough to condemn the rallies that led to the death of Heather Heyer, who was killed when a motorist plowed into a group protesting the white nationalist rally.\n\nTrump's initial comments did not mention the KKK or white nationalists, only the violence from both sides of the issues. Frazier and other business and political leaders saw those comments as not strong enough.\n\nAnd in the wake of Frazier's departure from the council, Trump blasted him on Twitter saying:\n\n\"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nSeveral hours later, Trump appeared at the White House to more specifically call out the white nationalist groups who rallied in Charlottesville.", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Albany"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type":

AP\n\nPresident Donald Trump's manufacturing council of business leaders lost a member Monday amid fallout from Trump's handling of the weekend's white-nationalist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nMerck CEO Kenneth Frazier, the only black business leader in the group, resigned from it after Trump failed to explicitly denounce white nationalism in connection to the violence surrounding the protests.\n\nBy the time Trump eventually denounced white nationalists and neo-Nazis in a televised address later Monday, Frazier remained the only one to have stepped down from the council because of the weekend's events.\n\nThe council, which was formed in January, originally had 24 CEOs involved but now has 21. Business Insider contacted the representatives of the remaining members of the council to ask for a statement on Frazier's departure and their own plans for future participation. These were the responses:\n\nSteve Schwarzman, the CEO of private equity giant Blackstone and leader of Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, also condemned the events in Charlottesville and said he would remain as head of the Forum.\n\n\"Bigotry, hatred, and extremism are an affront to core American values and have no place in this country,\" Schwarzman's statement said. \"I am deeply saddened and troubled by the tragic events in Charlottesville. My heartfelt condolences go out to the victims and their families. As the president said today, I believe we need to find a path to heal the wounds left by this tragedy and address its underlying causes. Encouraging tolerance and understanding must be a core national imperative and I will work to further that goal.\n\nThe Strategic and Policy Forum is another group of business executives that includes an array of executive from companies including JPMorgan, PepsiCo, and Walmart.\n\n*Editor's Note: The manufacturing group did hold a meeting in February along with a handful of other business executives, but it is not clear whether Trumka was in attendance.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "20:58:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "20:58:00", "title": "Merck's CEO left Trump's manufacturing council over Charlottesville  --  here's how the rest of the council responded", "date": "2017-08-14", "uri": "709439059", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5991e502b0e0b5712b8b48ff-1190-625/mercks-ceo-left-trumps-manufacturing-council-over-charlottesville--heres-how-the-rest-of-the-council-responded.jpg", "source": {"title": "Business Insider", "uri": "businessinsider.com", "id": "711"}, "id": "9160611", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 258}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "id": "200134", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "id": "235649", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302718", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "label": {"eng": "Business"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302720", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}, "type": "org", "id": "302738", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "type": "person", "id": "302942", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303035", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303051", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304262", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American", "label": {"eng": "African American"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304393", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States", "label": {"eng": "Culture of the United States"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304718", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305262", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_equity", "label": {"eng": "Private equity"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306590", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing", "label": {"eng": "Manufacturing"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307067", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314192", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_officer", "label": {"eng": "Executive officer"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "315543", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_&_Co.", "label": {"eng": "Merck & Co."}, "type": "org", "id": "321096", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "394340", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Schwarzman", "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

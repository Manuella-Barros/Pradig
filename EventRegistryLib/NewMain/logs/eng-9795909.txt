Neither did Bongiovanni ask to be recused from any investigation as a result of that friendship, Kasprzyk said.\n\nAs far as Kasprzyk knew, based on a Bongiovanni report he signed off on, Gerace already had been a confidential source of Bongiovanni's when the strip club owner offered to reveal information about narcotics trafficking in Western New York. After the Pharaoh's raid, Kasprzyk said he instructed Bongiovanni to turn Gerace over to the FBI to help in their investigations into drug trafficking in Western New York.\n\nGerace did not end up helping the FBI or DEA in any drug investigations.\n\nThe case: Bongiovanni, 60, faces 11 charges, including a bribery count alleging that he accepted at least $250,000 from a drug-trafficking organization that he thought was associated with Italian organized crime and shielded its members from arrest and provided them with information about investigations and cooperating sources.\n\nKey witness: Dale Kasprzyk, former supervisor in DEA's Buffalo office.\n\nQuote: \"If you as an agent have identified a suspect of a drug investigation and that suspect is a friend, then you as an agent can't work that investigation.\"\n\nContext: By October 2009, Gerace had come onto the radar of the FBI through dancers who reported Gerace was distributing cocaine. At the time, Gerace was on supervised release following a federal fraud conviction. So FBI agents and U.S. Probation officials searched Pharaoh's on Oct. 31, 2009, leading to a quick but uneventful talk between Gerace and then-FBI agent Thomas Herbst. Gerace also failed a urine test, jeopardizing his release from custody.\n\nBongiovanni wrote a report saying that he received a call Nov. 1 from Gerace, who in the past had acted as a confidential source, offering information about narcotics trafficking in Western New York. Bongiovanni said he met Gerace at DEA offices Nov. 2.\n\nBongiovanni's report indicated Gerace had provided information regarding individuals in past narcotics investigations and that Gerace \"knew significant cocaine traffickers\" of kilo-quantities of cocaine in North Buffalo and South Buffalo.\n\nIn exchange for the information, Gerace wanted a good-faith commitment from probation officials he would receive consideration for his failed drug test.\n\nGiven that FBI agents searched Pharaoh's, Kasprzyk called an FBI supervisor who managed the Safe Streets Task Force and asked if the FBI would be interested in talking to Gerace. The FBI said yes.\n\nSo Kasprzyk told Bongiovanni to refer Gerace to the FBI.\n\nWhy it matters: Prosecutors consider this incident an example of Bongiovanni killing an investigation. Bongiovanni, Gerace and Herbst met, but no real information is shared, prosecutors say. Instead, Herbst interprets the meeting as Bongiovanni essentially telling him that Gerace is Bongiovanni's informant, because Bongiovanni has known Gerace a long time. So what happens? Herbst \"shuts down his investigation of Gerace,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi said earlier this year at Bongiovanni's first trial.\n\nProsecution angle: Gerace's phone records shows \"years and years\" of text messages and calls with Bongiovanni, leading prosecutors to believe the former agent misrepresented his relationship with Gerace with his DEA bosses.\n\nWhat's more, Gerace had not acted as a confidential source for Bongiovanni, prosecutors say.\n\n\"He had duped his old boss, Dale Kasprzyk, by saying Gerace had acted as a confidential source before,\" Tripi said earlier this year.\n\n\"He got one past the goalie on his boss,\" Tripi said. \"A boss who trusted him too much. He lied in that report. He lied because he was covering for Gerace.\"\n\nAnd Bongiovanni \"killed an FBI investigation before it got rolling,\" Tripi said.\n\nAt Bongiovanni's first trial, a Homeland Security Investigations investigator said Bongiovanni told him he recused himself when Gerace offered to cooperate because of their personal relationship.\n\nKasprzyk said Bongiovanni never mentioned recusing himself.\n\nDefense response: At Bongiovanni's first trial, his defense lawyers cast what they called \"a lot of doubt\" about the DEA report and what happened at the Bongiovanni meeting with Gerace and Herbst.\n\nThere's no conclusive evidence that Bongiovanni's report was false, his lawyers said.\n\n\"We learned that Joseph Bongiovanni was directed by his boss to call the FBI, and that happened,\" defense attorney Robert Singer said during his closing argument at the first trial.\n\n\"We learned that there was a meeting that occurred with Peter Gerace to introduce him to Tom Herbst,\" Singer added. \"And thereafter, what do we know? We know the FBI didn't act.\"\n\nHerbst took no notes at the meeting. He filed no report, Singer said.\n\n\"His memory was foggy all over the place,\" Singer said of Herbst's testimony at the first trial.\n\nThe defense theory about why the FBI didn't investigate Gerace: \"The FBI just basically dropped the ball,\" Singer said.", "source": {"uri": "dailyprogress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Progress"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongiovanni_(record_label)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bongiovanni (record label)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Western New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerace", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerace"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gerace"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strip club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Trek: Enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_disqualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judicial disqualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime_in_Italy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime in Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tripi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tripi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Informant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dailyprogress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/39/3397dcf0-2a38-5531-b804-58c87c3a61dc/66b2738bb488c.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795909", "eventUri": "eng-9795909", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2009-10-31", "textStart": 2298, "textEnd": 2311}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-01", "textStart": 2532, "textEnd": 2538}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-02", "textStart": 2720, "textEnd": 2726}, {"amb": false, "date": "2009-10-", "textStart": 2031, "textEnd": 2043}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 252, "relevance": 1}

After the Pharaoh's raid, Kasprzyk said he instructed Bongiovanni to turn Gerace over to the FBI to help in their investigations into drug trafficking in Western New York.\n\nGerace did not end up helping the FBI or DEA in any drug investigations.\n\nThe case: Bongiovanni, 60, faces 11 charges, including a bribery count alleging that he accepted at least $250,000 from a drug-trafficking organization that he thought was associated with Italian organized crime and shielded its members from arrest and provided them with information about investigations and cooperating sources.\n\nKey witness: Dale Kasprzyk, former supervisor in DEA's Buffalo office.\n\nQuote: \"If you as an agent have identified a suspect of a drug investigation and that suspect is a friend, then you as an agent can't work that investigation.\"\n\nContext: By October 2009, Gerace had come onto the radar of the FBI through dancers who reported Gerace was distributing cocaine. At the time, Gerace was on supervised release following a federal fraud conviction. So FBI agents and U.S. Probation officials searched Pharaoh's on Oct. 31, 2009, leading to a quick but uneventful talk between Gerace and then-FBI agent Thomas Herbst. Gerace also failed a urine test, jeopardizing his release from custody.\n\nBongiovanni wrote a report saying that he received a call Nov. 1 from Gerace, who in the past had acted as a confidential source, offering information about narcotics trafficking in Western New York. Bongiovanni said he met Gerace at DEA offices Nov. 2.\n\nBongiovanni's report indicated Gerace had provided information regarding individuals in past narcotics investigations and that Gerace \"knew significant cocaine traffickers\" of kilo-quantities of cocaine in North Buffalo and South Buffalo.\n\nIn exchange for the information, Gerace wanted a good-faith commitment from probation officials he would receive consideration for his failed drug test.\n\nGiven that FBI agents searched Pharaoh's, Kasprzyk called an FBI supervisor who managed the Safe Streets Task Force and asked if the FBI would be interested in talking to Gerace. The FBI said yes.\n\nSo Kasprzyk told Bongiovanni to refer Gerace to the FBI.\n\nWhy it matters: Prosecutors consider this incident an example of Bongiovanni killing an investigation. Bongiovanni, Gerace and Herbst met, but no real information is shared, prosecutors say. Instead, Herbst interprets the meeting as Bongiovanni essentially telling him that Gerace is Bongiovanni's informant, because Bongiovanni has known Gerace a long time. So what happens? Herbst \"shuts down his investigation of Gerace,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi said earlier this year at Bongiovanni's first trial.\n\nProsecution angle: Gerace's phone records shows \"years and years\" of text messages and calls with Bongiovanni, leading prosecutors to believe the former agent misrepresented his relationship with Gerace with his DEA bosses.\n\nWhat's more, Gerace had not acted as a confidential source for Bongiovanni, prosecutors say.\n\n\"He had duped his old boss, Dale Kasprzyk, by saying Gerace had acted as a confidential source before,\" Tripi said earlier this year.\n\n\"He got one past the goalie on his boss,\" Tripi said. \"A boss who trusted him too much. He lied in that report. He lied because he was covering for Gerace.\"\n\nAnd Bongiovanni \"killed an FBI investigation before it got rolling,\" Tripi said.\n\nAt Bongiovanni's first trial, a Homeland Security Investigations investigator said Bongiovanni told him he recused himself when Gerace offered to cooperate because of their personal relationship.\n\nKasprzyk said Bongiovanni never mentioned recusing himself.\n\nDefense response: At Bongiovanni's first trial, his defense lawyers cast what they called \"a lot of doubt\" about the DEA report and what happened at the Bongiovanni meeting with Gerace and Herbst.\n\nThere's no conclusive evidence that Bongiovanni's report was false, his lawyers said.\n\n\"We learned that Joseph Bongiovanni was directed by his boss to call the FBI, and that happened,\" defense attorney Robert Singer said during his closing argument at the first trial.\n\n\"We learned that there was a meeting that occurred with Peter Gerace to introduce him to Tom Herbst,\" Singer added. \"And thereafter, what do we know? We know the FBI didn't act.\"\n\nHerbst took no notes at the meeting.

Neither did Bongiovanni ask to be recused from any investigation as a result of that friendship, Kasprzyk said.\n\nPeople are also reading...

After the Pharaoh's raid, Kasprzyk said he instructed Bongiovanni to turn Gerace over to the FBI to help in their investigations into drug trafficking in Western New York.\n\nGerace did not end up helping the FBI or DEA in any drug investigations.\n\nThe case: Bongiovanni, 60, faces 11 charges, including a bribery count alleging that he accepted at least $250,000 from a drug-trafficking organization that he thought was associated with Italian organized crime and shielded its members from arrest and provided them with information about investigations and cooperating sources.\n\nKey witness: Dale Kasprzyk, former supervisor in DEA's Buffalo office.\n\nQuote: \"If you as an agent have identified a suspect of a drug investigation and that suspect is a friend, then you as an agent can't work that investigation.\"\n\nContext: By October 2009, Gerace had come onto the radar of the FBI through dancers who reported Gerace was distributing cocaine. At the time, Gerace was on supervised release following a federal fraud conviction. So FBI agents and U.S. Probation officials searched Pharaoh's on Oct. 31, 2009, leading to a quick but uneventful talk between Gerace and then-FBI agent Thomas Herbst. Gerace also failed a urine test, jeopardizing his release from custody.\n\nBongiovanni wrote a report saying that he received a call Nov. 1 from Gerace, who in the past had acted as a confidential source, offering information about narcotics trafficking in Western New York. Bongiovanni said he met Gerace at DEA offices Nov. 2.\n\nBongiovanni's report indicated Gerace had provided information regarding individuals in past narcotics investigations and that Gerace \"knew significant cocaine traffickers\" of kilo-quantities of cocaine in North Buffalo and South Buffalo.\n\nIn exchange for the information, Gerace wanted a good-faith commitment from probation officials he would receive consideration for his failed drug test.\n\nGiven that FBI agents searched Pharaoh's, Kasprzyk called an FBI supervisor who managed the Safe Streets Task Force and asked if the FBI would be interested in talking to Gerace. The FBI said yes.\n\nSo Kasprzyk told Bongiovanni to refer Gerace to the FBI.\n\nWhy it matters: Prosecutors consider this incident an example of Bongiovanni killing an investigation. Bongiovanni, Gerace and Herbst met, but no real information is shared, prosecutors say. Instead, Herbst interprets the meeting as Bongiovanni essentially telling him that Gerace is Bongiovanni's informant, because Bongiovanni has known Gerace a long time. So what happens? Herbst \"shuts down his investigation of Gerace,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi said earlier this year at Bongiovanni's first trial.\n\nProsecution angle: Gerace's phone records shows \"years and years\" of text messages and calls with Bongiovanni, leading prosecutors to believe the former agent misrepresented his relationship with Gerace with his DEA bosses.\n\nWhat's more, Gerace had not acted as a confidential source for Bongiovanni, prosecutors say.\n\n\"He had duped his old boss, Dale Kasprzyk, by saying Gerace had acted as a confidential source before,\" Tripi said earlier this year.\n\n\"He got one past the goalie on his boss,\" Tripi said. \"A boss who trusted him too much. He lied in that report. He lied because he was covering for Gerace.\"\n\nAnd Bongiovanni \"killed an FBI investigation before it got rolling,\" Tripi said.\n\nAt Bongiovanni's first trial, a Homeland Security Investigations investigator said Bongiovanni told him he recused himself when Gerace offered to cooperate because of their personal relationship.\n\nKasprzyk said Bongiovanni never mentioned recusing himself.\n\nDefense response: At Bongiovanni's first trial, his defense lawyers cast what they called \"a lot of doubt\" about the DEA report and what happened at the Bongiovanni meeting with Gerace and Herbst.\n\nThere's no conclusive evidence that Bongiovanni's report was false, his lawyers said.\n\n\"We learned that Joseph Bongiovanni was directed by his boss to call the FBI, and that happened,\" defense attorney Robert Singer said during his closing argument at the first trial.\n\n\"We learned that there was a meeting that occurred with Peter Gerace to introduce him to Tom Herbst,\" Singer added. \"And thereafter, what do we know? We know the FBI didn't act.\"\n\nHerbst took no notes at the meeting. He filed no report, Singer said.\n\n\"His memory was foggy all over the place,\" Singer said of Herbst's testimony at the first trial.\n\nThe defense theory about why the FBI didn't investigate

Herbst \"shuts down his investigation of Gerace,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi said earlier this year at Bongiovanni's first trial.\n\nProsecution angle: Gerace's phone records shows \"years and years\" of text messages and calls with Bongiovanni, leading prosecutors to believe the former agent misrepresented his relationship with Gerace with his DEA bosses.\n\nWhat's more, Gerace had not acted as a confidential source for Bongiovanni, prosecutors say.\n\n\"He had duped his old boss, Dale Kasprzyk, by saying Gerace had acted as a confidential source before,\" Tripi said earlier this year.\n\n\"He got one past the goalie on his boss,\" Tripi said. \"A boss who trusted him too much.

He lied because he was covering for Gerace.\"\n\nAnd Bongiovanni \"killed an FBI investigation before it got rolling,\" Tripi said.\n\nAt Bongiovanni's first trial, a Homeland Security Investigations investigator said Bongiovanni told him he recused himself when Gerace offered to cooperate because of their personal relationship.\n\nKasprzyk said Bongiovanni never mentioned recusing himself.\n\nDefense response: At Bongiovanni's first trial, his defense lawyers cast what they called \"a lot of doubt\" about the DEA report and what happened at the Bongiovanni meeting with Gerace and Herbst.\n\nThere's no conclusive evidence that Bongiovanni's report was false, his lawyers said.\n\n\"We learned that Joseph Bongiovanni was directed by his boss to call the FBI, and that happened,\" defense attorney Robert Singer said during his closing argument at the first trial.\n\n\"We learned that there was a meeting that occurred with Peter Gerace to introduce him to Tom Herbst,\" Singer added. \"And thereafter, what do we know?

After the Pharaoh's raid, Kasprzyk said he instructed Bongiovanni to turn Gerace over to the FBI to help in their investigations into drug trafficking in Western New York.\n\nGerace did not end up helping the FBI or DEA in any drug investigations.\n\nThe case: Bongiovanni, 60, faces 11 charges, including a bribery count alleging that he accepted at least $250,000 from a drug-trafficking organization that he thought was associated with Italian organized crime and shielded its members from arrest and provided them with information about investigations and cooperating sources.\n\nKey witness: Dale Kasprzyk, former supervisor in DEA's Buffalo office.\n\nQuote: \"If you as an agent have identified a suspect of a drug investigation and that suspect is a friend, then you as an agent can't work that investigation.\"\n\nContext: By October 2009, Gerace had come onto the radar of the FBI through dancers who reported Gerace was distributing cocaine. At the time, Gerace was on supervised release following a federal fraud conviction. So FBI agents and U.S. Probation officials searched Pharaoh's on Oct. 31, 2009, leading to a quick but uneventful talk between Gerace and then-FBI agent Thomas Herbst. Gerace also failed a urine test, jeopardizing his release from custody.\n\nBongiovanni wrote a report saying that he received a call Nov. 1 from Gerace, who in the past had acted as a confidential source, offering information about narcotics trafficking in Western New York. Bongiovanni said he met Gerace at DEA offices Nov. 2.\n\nBongiovanni's report indicated Gerace had provided information regarding individuals in past narcotics investigations and that Gerace \"knew significant cocaine traffickers\" of kilo-quantities of cocaine in North Buffalo and South Buffalo.\n\nIn exchange for the information, Gerace wanted a good-faith commitment from probation officials he would receive consideration for his failed drug test.\n\nGiven that FBI agents searched Pharaoh's, Kasprzyk called an FBI supervisor who managed the Safe Streets Task Force and asked if the FBI would be interested in talking to Gerace. The FBI said yes.\n\nSo Kasprzyk told Bongiovanni to refer Gerace to the FBI.\n\nWhy it matters: Prosecutors consider this incident an example of Bongiovanni killing an investigation. Bongiovanni, Gerace and Herbst met, but no real information is shared, prosecutors say. Instead, Herbst interprets the meeting as Bongiovanni essentially telling him that Gerace is Bongiovanni's informant, because Bongiovanni has known Gerace a long time. So what happens? Herbst \"shuts down his investigation of Gerace,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi said earlier this year at Bongiovanni's first trial.\n\nProsecution angle: Gerace's phone records shows \"years and years\" of text messages and calls with Bongiovanni, leading prosecutors to believe the former agent misrepresented his relationship with Gerace with his DEA bosses.\n\nWhat's more, Gerace had not acted as a confidential source for Bongiovanni, prosecutors say.\n\n\"He had duped his old boss, Dale Kasprzyk, by saying Gerace had acted as a confidential source before,\" Tripi said earlier this year.\n\n\"He got one past the goalie on his boss,\" Tripi said. \"A boss who trusted him too much.

After the Pharaoh's raid, Kasprzyk said he instructed Bongiovanni to turn Gerace over to the FBI to help in their investigations into drug trafficking in Western New York.\n\nGerace did not end up helping the FBI or DEA in any drug investigations.\n\nThe case: Bongiovanni, 60, faces 11 charges, including a bribery count alleging that he accepted at least $250,000 from a drug-trafficking organization that he thought was associated with Italian organized crime and shielded its members from arrest and provided them with information about investigations and cooperating sources.\n\nKey witness: Dale Kasprzyk, former supervisor in DEA's Buffalo office.\n\nQuote: \"If you as an agent have identified a suspect of a drug investigation and that suspect is a friend, then you as an agent can't work that investigation.\"\n\nContext: By October 2009, Gerace had come onto the radar of the FBI through dancers who reported Gerace was distributing cocaine. At the time, Gerace was on supervised release following a federal fraud conviction. So FBI agents and U.S. Probation officials searched Pharaoh's on Oct. 31, 2009, leading to a quick but uneventful talk between Gerace and then-FBI agent Thomas Herbst. Gerace also failed a urine test, jeopardizing his release from custody.\n\nBongiovanni wrote a report saying that he received a call Nov. 1 from Gerace, who in the past had acted as a confidential source, offering information about narcotics trafficking in Western New York. Bongiovanni said he met Gerace at DEA offices Nov. 2.\n\nBongiovanni's report indicated Gerace had provided information regarding individuals in past narcotics investigations and that Gerace \"knew significant cocaine traffickers\" of kilo-quantities of cocaine in North Buffalo and South Buffalo.\n\nIn exchange for the information, Gerace wanted a good-faith commitment from probation officials he would receive consideration for his failed drug test.\n\nGiven that FBI agents searched Pharaoh's, Kasprzyk called an FBI supervisor who managed the Safe Streets Task Force and asked if the FBI would be interested in talking to Gerace. The FBI said yes.\n\nSo Kasprzyk told Bongiovanni to refer Gerace to the FBI.\n\nWhy it matters: Prosecutors consider this incident an example of Bongiovanni killing an investigation. Bongiovanni, Gerace and Herbst met, but no real information is shared, prosecutors say. Instead, Herbst interprets the meeting as Bongiovanni essentially telling him that Gerace is Bongiovanni's informant, because Bongiovanni has known Gerace a long time. So what happens? Herbst \"shuts down his investigation of Gerace,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi said earlier this year at Bongiovanni's first trial.\n\nProsecution angle: Gerace's phone records shows \"years and years\" of text messages and calls with Bongiovanni, leading prosecutors to believe the former agent misrepresented his relationship with Gerace with his DEA bosses.\n\nWhat's more, Gerace had not acted as a confidential source for Bongiovanni, prosecutors say.\n\n\"He had duped his old boss, Dale Kasprzyk, by saying Gerace had acted as a confidential source before,\" Tripi said earlier this year.\n\n\"He got one past the goalie on his boss,\" Tripi said. \"A boss who trusted him too much. He lied in that report. He lied because he was covering for Gerace.\"\n\nAnd Bongiovanni \"killed an FBI investigation before it got rolling,\" Tripi said.\n\nAt Bongiovanni's first trial, a Homeland Security Investigations investigator said Bongiovanni told him he recused himself when Gerace offered to cooperate because of their personal relationship.\n\nKasprzyk said Bongiovanni never mentioned recusing himself.\n\nDefense response: At Bongiovanni's first trial, his defense lawyers cast what they called \"a lot of doubt\" about the DEA report and what happened at the Bongiovanni meeting with Gerace and Herbst.\n\nThere's no conclusive evidence that Bongiovanni's report was false, his lawyers said.\n\n\"We learned that Joseph Bongiovanni was directed by his boss to call the FBI, and that happened,\" defense attorney Robert Singer said during his closing argument at the first trial.\n\n\"We learned that there was a meeting that occurred with Peter Gerace to introduce him to Tom Herbst,\" Singer added. \"And thereafter, what do we know?

Neither did Bongiovanni ask to be recused from any investigation as a result of that friendship, Kasprzyk said.\n\nInterim superintendent of St. Louis Public Schools left previous job under fire Vatican rejects appeals to save two Catholic parishes in St. Louis A beloved South Grand convenience store employee was killed by customer, witnesses say Michael Siani's injury will throw open range of options in center field: Cardinals Extra Videos show CVPA shooter stalking hallways before police storm the St. Louis school McClellan: Maybe Outsiders aren't the answer for St. Louis Man claims to be editor of St. Louis' Riverfront Times, defends site's OnlyFans content Firm with ties to Indian tech execs made $1.5 million donation to Missouri treasurer Transgender woman's use of locker room at Ellisville gym sparks outcry from conservatives BenFred: Hey, maybe we weren't crazy for thinking Caitlin Clark should have made Team USA St. Louis restaurant openings and closings for July Editorial: Our endorsements in Missouri's GOP and Democratic gubernatorial primaries Target plans another location in St. Louis County St. Louis County overpaid dozens of employees for years. Some had already quit. St. Louis School Board member calls on colleagues to resign for 'lies and coercion'\n\nAs far as Kasprzyk knew, based on a Bongiovanni report he signed off on, Gerace already had been a confidential source of Bongiovanni's when the strip club owner offered to reveal information about narcotics trafficking in Western New York. After the Pharaoh's raid, Kasprzyk said he instructed Bongiovanni to turn Gerace over to the FBI to help in their investigations into drug trafficking in Western New York.\n\nGerace did not end up helping the FBI or DEA in any drug investigations.\n\nThe case: Bongiovanni, 60, faces 11 charges, including a bribery count alleging that he accepted at least $250,000 from a drug-trafficking organization that he thought was associated with Italian organized crime and shielded its members from arrest and provided them with information about investigations and cooperating sources.\n\nKey witness: Dale Kasprzyk, former supervisor in DEA's Buffalo office.\n\nQuote: \"If you as an agent have identified a suspect of a drug investigation and that suspect is a friend, then you as an agent can't work that investigation.\"\n\nContext: By October 2009, Gerace had come onto the radar of the FBI through dancers who reported Gerace was distributing cocaine. At the time, Gerace was on supervised release following a federal fraud conviction. So FBI agents and U.S. Probation officials searched Pharaoh's on Oct. 31, 2009, leading to a quick but uneventful talk between Gerace and then-FBI agent Thomas Herbst. Gerace also failed a urine test, jeopardizing his release from custody.\n\nBongiovanni wrote a report saying that he received a call Nov. 1 from Gerace, who in the past had acted as a confidential source, offering information about narcotics trafficking in Western New York. Bongiovanni said he met Gerace at DEA offices Nov. 2.\n\nBongiovanni's report indicated Gerace had provided information regarding individuals in past narcotics investigations and that Gerace \"knew significant cocaine traffickers\" of kilo-quantities of cocaine in North Buffalo and South Buffalo.\n\nIn exchange for the information, Gerace wanted a good-faith commitment from probation officials he would receive consideration for his failed drug test.\n\nGiven that FBI agents searched Pharaoh's, Kasprzyk called an FBI supervisor who managed the Safe Streets Task Force and asked if the FBI would be interested in talking to Gerace. The FBI said yes.\n\nSo Kasprzyk told Bongiovanni to refer Gerace to the FBI.\n\nWhy it matters: Prosecutors consider this incident an example of Bongiovanni killing an investigation. Bongiovanni, Gerace and Herbst met, but no real information is shared, prosecutors say. Instead, Herbst interprets the meeting as Bongiovanni essentially telling him that Gerace is Bongiovanni's informant, because Bongiovanni has known Gerace a long time. So what happens? Herbst \"shuts down his investigation of Gerace,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi said earlier this year at Bongiovanni's first trial.\n\nProsecution angle: Gerace's phone records shows \"years and years\" of text messages and calls with Bongiovanni, leading prosecutors to believe the former agent misrepresented his relationship with Gerace with his DEA bosses.\n\nWhat's more, Gerace had not acted as a confidential source for Bongiovanni, prosecutors say.\n\n\"He had duped his old boss, Dale Kasprzyk, by saying Gerace had acted as a confidential source before,\" Tripi said earlier this year.\n\n\"He got one past the goalie on his boss,\" Tripi said. \"A boss who trusted him too much. He lied in that report. He lied because he was covering for Gerace.\"\n\nAnd Bongiovanni \"killed an FBI investigation before it got rolling,\" Tripi said.\n\nAt Bongiovanni's first trial, a Homeland Security Investigations investigator said Bongiovanni told him he recused himself when Gerace offered to cooperate because of their personal relationship.\n\nKasprzyk said Bongiovanni never mentioned recusing himself.\n\nDefense response: At Bongiovanni's first trial, his defense lawyers cast what they called \"a lot of doubt\" about the DEA report and what happened at the Bongiovanni meeting with Gerace and Herbst.\n\nThere's no conclusive evidence that Bongiovanni's report was false, his lawyers said.\n\n\"We learned that Joseph Bongiovanni was directed by his boss to call the FBI, and that happened,\" defense attorney Robert Singer said during his closing argument at the first trial.\n\n\"We learned that there was a meeting that occurred with Peter Gerace to introduce him to Tom Herbst,\" Singer added. \"And thereafter, what do we know?

Neither did Bongiovanni ask to be recused from any investigation as a result of that friendship, Kasprzyk said.\n\nPeople are also reading...

After the Pharaoh's raid, Kasprzyk said he instructed Bongiovanni to turn Gerace over to the FBI to help in their investigations into drug trafficking in Western New York.\n\nGerace did not end up helping the FBI or DEA in any drug investigations.\n\nThe case: Bongiovanni, 60, faces 11 charges, including a bribery count alleging that he accepted at least $250,000 from a drug-trafficking organization that he thought was associated with Italian organized crime and shielded its members from arrest and provided them with information about investigations and cooperating sources.\n\nKey witness: Dale Kasprzyk, former supervisor in DEA's Buffalo office.\n\nQuote: \"If you as an agent have identified a suspect of a drug investigation and that suspect is a friend, then you as an agent can't work that investigation.\"\n\nContext: By October 2009, Gerace had come onto the radar of the FBI through dancers who reported Gerace was distributing cocaine. At the time, Gerace was on supervised release following a federal fraud conviction. So FBI agents and U.S. Probation officials searched Pharaoh's on Oct. 31, 2009, leading to a quick but uneventful talk between Gerace and then-FBI agent Thomas Herbst. Gerace also failed a urine test, jeopardizing his release from custody.\n\nBongiovanni wrote a report saying that he received a call Nov. 1 from Gerace, who in the past had acted as a confidential source, offering information about narcotics trafficking in Western New York. Bongiovanni said he met Gerace at DEA offices Nov. 2.\n\nBongiovanni's report indicated Gerace had provided information regarding individuals in past narcotics investigations and that Gerace \"knew significant cocaine traffickers\" of kilo-quantities of cocaine in North Buffalo and South Buffalo.\n\nIn exchange for the information, Gerace wanted a good-faith commitment from probation officials he would receive consideration for his failed drug test.\n\nGiven that FBI agents searched Pharaoh's, Kasprzyk called an FBI supervisor who managed the Safe Streets Task Force and asked if the FBI would be interested in talking to Gerace. The FBI said yes.\n\nSo Kasprzyk told Bongiovanni to refer Gerace to the FBI.\n\nWhy it matters: Prosecutors consider this incident an example of Bongiovanni killing an investigation. Bongiovanni, Gerace and Herbst met, but no real information is shared, prosecutors say. Instead, Herbst interprets the meeting as Bongiovanni essentially telling him that Gerace is Bongiovanni's informant, because Bongiovanni has known Gerace a long time. So what happens? Herbst \"shuts down his investigation of Gerace,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi said earlier this year at Bongiovanni's first trial.\n\nProsecution angle: Gerace's phone records shows \"years and years\" of text messages and calls with Bongiovanni, leading prosecutors to believe the former agent misrepresented his relationship with Gerace with his DEA bosses.\n\nWhat's more, Gerace had not acted as a confidential source for Bongiovanni, prosecutors say.\n\n\"He had duped his old boss, Dale Kasprzyk, by saying Gerace had acted as a confidential source before,\" Tripi said earlier this year.\n\n\"He got one past the goalie on his boss,\" Tripi said. \"A boss who trusted him too much. He lied in that report. He lied because he was covering for Gerace.\"\n\nAnd Bongiovanni \"killed an FBI investigation before it got rolling,\" Tripi said.\n\nAt Bongiovanni's first trial, a Homeland Security Investigations investigator said Bongiovanni told him he recused himself when Gerace offered to cooperate because of their personal relationship.\n\nKasprzyk said Bongiovanni never mentioned recusing himself.\n\nDefense response: At Bongiovanni's first trial, his defense lawyers cast what they called \"a lot of doubt\" about the DEA report and what happened at the Bongiovanni meeting with Gerace and Herbst.\n\nThere's no conclusive evidence that Bongiovanni's report was false, his lawyers said.\n\n\"We learned that Joseph Bongiovanni was directed by his boss to call the FBI, and that happened,\" defense attorney Robert Singer said during his closing argument at the first trial.\n\n\"We learned that there was a meeting that occurred with Peter Gerace to introduce him to Tom Herbst,\" Singer added. \"And thereafter, what do we know? We know the FBI didn't act.\"\n\nHerbst took no notes at the meeting. He filed no report, Singer said.\n\n\"His memory was foggy all over the place,\" Singer said of Herbst's testimony at the first trial.\n\nThe defense theory about why the FBI didn't investigate Gerace: \"The FBI just basically dropped the ball,\" Singer said.\n\nPatrick Lakamp can be reached at plakamp@buffnews.com\n\nIn this Series Complete coverage: The case of ex-DEA agent Joseph

Think again. Galloway Township plane crash pilot faced split-second decision Atlantic City's Good Dog Bar to close; owners cite financial issues, lack of big-ticket AC events\n\nAs far as Kasprzyk knew, based on a Bongiovanni report he signed off on, Gerace already had been a confidential source of Bongiovanni's when the strip club owner offered to reveal information about narcotics trafficking in Western New York. After the Pharaoh's raid, Kasprzyk said he instructed Bongiovanni to turn Gerace over to the FBI to help in their investigations into drug trafficking in Western New York.\n\nGerace did not end up helping the FBI or DEA in any drug investigations.\n\nThe case: Bongiovanni, 60, faces 11 charges, including a bribery count alleging that he accepted at least $250,000 from a drug-trafficking organization that he thought was associated with Italian organized crime and shielded its members from arrest and provided them with information about investigations and cooperating sources.\n\nKey witness: Dale Kasprzyk, former supervisor in DEA's Buffalo office.\n\nQuote: \"If you as an agent have identified a suspect of a drug investigation and that suspect is a friend, then you as an agent can't work that investigation.\"\n\nContext: By October 2009, Gerace had come onto the radar of the FBI through dancers who reported Gerace was distributing cocaine. At the time, Gerace was on supervised release following a federal fraud conviction. So FBI agents and U.S. Probation officials searched Pharaoh's on Oct. 31, 2009, leading to a quick but uneventful talk between Gerace and then-FBI agent Thomas Herbst. Gerace also failed a urine test, jeopardizing his release from custody.\n\nBongiovanni wrote a report saying that he received a call Nov. 1 from Gerace, who in the past had acted as a confidential source, offering information about narcotics trafficking in Western New York. Bongiovanni said he met Gerace at DEA offices Nov. 2.\n\nBongiovanni's report indicated Gerace had provided information regarding individuals in past narcotics investigations and that Gerace \"knew significant cocaine traffickers\" of kilo-quantities of cocaine in North Buffalo and South Buffalo.\n\nIn exchange for the information, Gerace wanted a good-faith commitment from probation officials he would receive consideration for his failed drug test.\n\nGiven that FBI agents searched Pharaoh's, Kasprzyk called an FBI supervisor who managed the Safe Streets Task Force and asked if the FBI would be interested in talking to Gerace. The FBI said yes.\n\nSo Kasprzyk told Bongiovanni to refer Gerace to the FBI.\n\nWhy it matters: Prosecutors consider this incident an example of Bongiovanni killing an investigation. Bongiovanni, Gerace and Herbst met, but no real information is shared, prosecutors say. Instead, Herbst interprets the meeting as Bongiovanni essentially telling him that Gerace is Bongiovanni's informant, because Bongiovanni has known Gerace a long time. So what happens? Herbst \"shuts down his investigation of Gerace,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi said earlier this year at Bongiovanni's first trial.\n\nProsecution angle: Gerace's phone records shows \"years and years\" of text messages and calls with Bongiovanni, leading prosecutors to believe the former agent misrepresented his relationship with Gerace with his DEA bosses.\n\nWhat's more, Gerace had not acted as a confidential source for Bongiovanni, prosecutors say.\n\n\"He had duped his old boss, Dale Kasprzyk, by saying Gerace had acted as a confidential source before,\" Tripi said earlier this year.\n\n\"He got one past the goalie on his boss,\" Tripi said. \"A boss who trusted him too much. He lied in that report. He lied because he was covering for Gerace.\"\n\nAnd Bongiovanni \"killed an FBI investigation before it got rolling,\" Tripi said.\n\nAt Bongiovanni's first trial, a Homeland Security Investigations investigator said Bongiovanni told him he recused himself when Gerace offered to cooperate because of their personal relationship.\n\nKasprzyk said Bongiovanni never mentioned recusing himself.\n\nDefense response: At Bongiovanni's first trial, his defense lawyers cast what they called \"a lot of doubt\" about the DEA report and what happened at the Bongiovanni meeting with Gerace and Herbst.\n\nThere's no conclusive evidence that Bongiovanni's report was false, his lawyers said.\n\n\"We learned that Joseph Bongiovanni was directed by his boss to call the FBI, and that happened,\" defense attorney Robert Singer said during his closing argument at the first trial.\n\n\"We learned that there was a meeting that occurred with Peter Gerace to introduce him to Tom Herbst,\" Singer added. \"And thereafter, what do we know? We know the FBI didn't act.\"\n\nHerbst took no notes at the meeting. He filed no report, Singer said.\n\n\"His memory was foggy all over the place,\" Singer said of Herbst's testimony at the first trial.\n\nThe defense theory about why the FBI didn't investigate Gerace: \"The FBI just basically dropped the ball,\" Singer said.\n\nPatrick Lakamp can be reached at plakamp@buffnews.com\n\nIn this Series Complete coverage: The case of ex-DEA agent Joseph

Bongiovanni said he met Gerace at DEA offices Nov. 2.\n\nBongiovanni's report indicated Gerace had provided information regarding individuals in past narcotics investigations and that Gerace \"knew significant cocaine traffickers\" of kilo-quantities of cocaine in North Buffalo and South Buffalo.\n\nIn exchange for the information, Gerace wanted a good-faith commitment from probation officials he would receive consideration for his failed drug test.\n\nGiven that FBI agents searched Pharaoh's, Kasprzyk called an FBI supervisor who managed the Safe Streets Task Force and asked if the FBI would be interested in talking to Gerace. The FBI said yes.\n\nSo Kasprzyk told Bongiovanni to refer Gerace to the FBI.\n\nWhy it matters: Prosecutors consider this incident an example of Bongiovanni killing an investigation. Bongiovanni, Gerace and Herbst met, but no real information is shared, prosecutors say. Instead, Herbst interprets the meeting as Bongiovanni essentially telling him that Gerace is Bongiovanni's informant, because Bongiovanni has known Gerace a long time. So what happens? Herbst \"shuts down his investigation of Gerace,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi said earlier this year at Bongiovanni's first trial.\n\nProsecution angle: Gerace's phone records shows \"years and years\" of text messages and calls with Bongiovanni, leading prosecutors to believe the former agent misrepresented his relationship with Gerace with his DEA bosses.\n\nWhat's more, Gerace had not acted as a confidential source for Bongiovanni, prosecutors say.\n\n\"He had duped his old boss, Dale Kasprzyk, by saying Gerace had acted as a confidential source before,\" Tripi said earlier this year.\n\n\"He got one past the goalie on his boss,\" Tripi said. \"A boss who trusted him too much. He lied in that report. He lied because he was covering for Gerace.\"\n\nAnd Bongiovanni \"killed an FBI investigation before it got rolling,\" Tripi said.\n\nAt Bongiovanni's first trial, a Homeland Security Investigations investigator said Bongiovanni told him he recused himself when Gerace offered to cooperate because of their personal relationship.\n\nKasprzyk said Bongiovanni never mentioned recusing himself.\n\nDefense response: At Bongiovanni's first trial, his defense lawyers cast what they called \"a lot of doubt\" about the DEA report and what happened at the Bongiovanni meeting with Gerace and Herbst.\n\nThere's no conclusive evidence that Bongiovanni's report was false, his lawyers said.\n\n\"We learned that Joseph Bongiovanni was directed by his boss to call the FBI, and that happened,\" defense attorney Robert Singer said during his closing argument at the first trial.\n\n\"We learned that there was a meeting that occurred with Peter Gerace to introduce him to Tom Herbst,\" Singer added. \"And thereafter, what do we know? We know the FBI didn't act.\"\n\nHerbst took no notes at the meeting. He filed no report, Singer said.\n\n\"His memory was foggy all over the place,\" Singer said of Herbst's testimony at the first trial.\n\nThe defense theory about why the FBI didn't investigate Gerace: \"The FBI just basically dropped the ball,\" Singer said.\n\nIn this Series Complete coverage: The case of ex-DEA agent Joseph Bongiovanni Updated 21 mins ago Deep roots of friendship are intertwined in alleged scheme to bribe DEA agent Updated 20 mins ago Prosecutor: DEA agent Bongiovanni became 'a double agent' for drug traffickers in WNY Updated May 7, 2024 Jury selected in bribery trial for ex-DEA agent 49 updates Previous Sign up for our Crime & Courts newsletter\n\nGet the latest in local public safety news with this weekly email.\n\nSign up!

So FBI agents and U.S. Probation officials searched Pharaoh's on Oct. 31, 2009, leading to a quick but uneventful talk between Gerace and then-FBI agent Thomas Herbst. Gerace also failed a urine test, jeopardizing his release from custody.\n\nBongiovanni wrote a report saying that he received a call Nov. 1 from Gerace, who in the past had acted as a confidential source, offering information about narcotics trafficking in Western New York. Bongiovanni said he met Gerace at DEA offices Nov. 2.\n\nBongiovanni's report indicated Gerace had provided information regarding individuals in past narcotics investigations and that Gerace \"knew significant cocaine traffickers\" of kilo-quantities of cocaine in North Buffalo and South Buffalo.\n\nIn exchange for the information, Gerace wanted a good-faith commitment from probation officials he would receive consideration for his failed drug test.\n\nGiven that FBI agents searched Pharaoh's, Kasprzyk called an FBI supervisor who managed the Safe Streets Task Force and asked if the FBI would be interested in talking to Gerace. The FBI said yes.\n\nSo Kasprzyk told Bongiovanni to refer Gerace to the FBI.\n\nWhy it matters: Prosecutors consider this incident an example of Bongiovanni killing an investigation. Bongiovanni, Gerace and Herbst met, but no real information is shared, prosecutors say. Instead, Herbst interprets the meeting as Bongiovanni essentially telling him that Gerace is Bongiovanni's informant, because Bongiovanni has known Gerace a long time. So what happens? Herbst \"shuts down his investigation of Gerace,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi said earlier this year at Bongiovanni's first trial.\n\nProsecution angle: Gerace's phone records shows \"years and years\" of text messages and calls with Bongiovanni, leading prosecutors to believe the former agent misrepresented his relationship with Gerace with his DEA bosses.\n\nWhat's more, Gerace had not acted as a confidential source for Bongiovanni, prosecutors say.\n\n\"He had duped his old boss, Dale Kasprzyk, by saying Gerace had acted as a confidential source before,\" Tripi said earlier this year.\n\n\"He got one past the goalie on his boss,\" Tripi said. \"A boss who trusted him too much. He lied in that report. He lied because he was covering for Gerace.\"\n\nAnd Bongiovanni \"killed an FBI investigation before it got rolling,\" Tripi said.\n\nAt Bongiovanni's first trial, a Homeland Security Investigations investigator said Bongiovanni told him he recused himself when Gerace offered to cooperate because of their personal relationship.\n\nKasprzyk said Bongiovanni never mentioned recusing himself.\n\nDefense response: At Bongiovanni's first trial, his defense lawyers cast what they called \"a lot of doubt\" about the DEA report and what happened at the Bongiovanni meeting with Gerace and Herbst.\n\nThere's no conclusive evidence that Bongiovanni's report was false, his lawyers said.\n\n\"We learned that Joseph Bongiovanni was directed by his boss to call the FBI, and that happened,\" defense attorney Robert Singer said during his closing argument at the first trial.\n\n\"We learned that there was a meeting that occurred with Peter Gerace to introduce him to Tom Herbst,\" Singer added. \"And thereafter, what do we know? We know the FBI didn't act.\"\n\nHerbst took no notes at the meeting. He filed no report, Singer said.\n\n\"His memory was foggy all over the place,\" Singer said of Herbst's testimony at the first trial.\n\nThe defense theory about why the FBI didn't investigate Gerace: \"The FBI just basically dropped the ball,\" Singer said.\n\nPatrick Lakamp can be reached at plakamp@buffnews.com\n\nIn this Series Complete coverage: The case of ex-DEA agent Joseph

Neither did Bongiovanni ask to be recused from any investigation as a result of that friendship, Kasprzyk said.\n\nAs far as Kasprzyk knew, based on a Bongiovanni report he signed off on, Gerace already had been a confidential source of Bongiovanni's when the strip club owner offered to reveal information about narcotics trafficking in Western New York. After the Pharaoh's raid, Kasprzyk said he instructed Bongiovanni to turn Gerace over to the FBI to help in their investigations into drug trafficking in Western New York.\n\nPeople are also reading...

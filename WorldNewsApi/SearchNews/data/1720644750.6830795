The 59-year-old journalist - who presents his talk show 'Piers Morgan Uncensored' on YouTube - posted a rare black and white photo of his mum Gabrielle Georgina Sybille during her younger years, as she adoringly holds a baby Piers in the air. The edited image also showed a more recent picture of the pair in the shape of a heart, with them both smiling at the camera. Piers is seen posing for a picture in a smart navy suit and red tie while a ginger-haired Gabrielle rocks a bold bottle green dress. Piers paid tribute to his doting mother in a heartfelt message, writing: \"Happy 80th birthday to my fabulous mother. My biggest and most loyal supporter, my most astute critic, and my greatest inspiration and role model. Quite simply, the finest and most selfless person I have ever known.\" The loud-mouthed talk show host took to his page on Saturday to post the loving picture of her, and fans were quick to react. One of his followers wrote: \"Love this ! What a pretty lady too.\" Another wrote: \"Mums and Sons are special \" The TV star was born in March 1965 in Surrey to his father Vincent Eamonn O'Mear and mother Gabrielle Georgina Sybille and has three siblings: his two brothers Rupert and Jeremy, and his sister Charlotte. Piers' father tragically passed away when his was only 11 months old, with his mum eventually marrying Glynne Pughe-Morgan. In his personal life, the controversial star is married to his wife Celia Walden, with whom he has a daughter. He also has three sons from his previous marriage to Marion Shalloe. In 2010, Piers and Celia got married in Swinbrook, Oxfordshire, in a private ceremony. A year later they welcomed their first child together, Elise Pughe-Morgan. During an appearance on Lorraine in 2022, she opened up about the pair\u2019s six-week marriage sabbatical. \"It was very good for both of us,\u201d she said. \"We didn\u2019t have any problems before, it was nothing like that, but it\u2019s been a long pandemic hasn\u2019t it. I described it in the piece as like rebooting your computer, where sometimes, it\u2019s not that there\u2019s anything in particular that\u2019s wrong, but it grinds to a bit of a halt, and you reboot it and suddenly it comes back to life. \u201cWe had just over five weeks apart over the summer, and to be fair, it was sort of work-necessitated because Piers was interviewing serial killers, which he found preferable to being married to me, and I was working in LA, so he was all over.\u201d Piers was a presenter for TalkTV before he began hosting his own show, Piers Morgan Uncensored in 2022. He was previously an editor at The Daily Mirror and began his career as a freelancer for The Sun.

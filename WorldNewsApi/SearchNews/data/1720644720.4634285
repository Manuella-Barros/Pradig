{"id": 231258414, "title": "College football transfer portal 2024: Net ratings and player totals for every Power Four team", "text": "Texas lost its top five receivers from last season's run to the College Football Playoff but added veteran Alabama receiver Isaiah Bond, the Iron Bowl hero who caught the game-winning touchdown against Auburn. Bond (98) was rated as 247Sports' fourth-best player in the portal. The Longhorns also added Oregon State's Silas Bolden (90) and Houston's Matthew Golden to go along with Alabama tight end Amari Niblack (93), who steps in for Ja'Tavion Sanders. Most of Tennessee's departures were backups, thus the gigantic uptick in quality score. How good and deep is Georgia? Twenty of the 24 departures in the portal landed at power programs and yet the Bulldogs' quality actually jumped in the ratings department with 10 additions. Running back Trevor Etienne jumping from Florida was a fascinating transaction. Perhaps the Gators actually improved the roster via the portal this offseason? Six of the 15 additions are blue-chips, though USC offensive tackle Jason Zandamela is likely a year away from development. Colorado transfer Cormani McClain will grab headlines, and if he can come close to the hype out of high school he'll be worth the risk. No SEC school experienced more attrition in the portal than Alabama, and that wasn't a surprise after Nick Saban's shocking retirement. The Tide countered 40 portal departures with 15 newcomers, and though Kalen DeBoer owns the SEC's only negative net rating in the portal, he added several stars that will immediately help in the secondary \u2013 and also lost and regained the second-best player in the portal, Kadyn Proctor.", "summary": "How many players each Power Four team gained and lost in the 2024 college football transfer portal", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-transfer-portal-2024-net-ratings-and-player-totals-for-every-power-four-team/", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/08/41f2711d-15d7-4cd1-88ba-5ccdf28bc012/thumbnail/1200x675/e6f5aaf74ede7b3e3d1c744d96190b68/trevoretienne.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:51:29", "author": "Brandon Marcello", "authors": ["Brandon Marcello"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.055}

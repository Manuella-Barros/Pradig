She worries that many households won\u2019t be able to keep up with their payments and that the government won\u2019t bail them out. That means if you have debt, Orman says you\u2019ll need to take matters into your own hands to stay financially solvent. You\u2019ll learn how to do that below.

Learn how to copy them. A Financial Pandemic Many Americans increased their savings during COVID-19 through stimulus checks and less spending. But since then, about 80% of households have run out of their pandemic savings. This is the starting point for Orman\u2019s prediction of a pending financial pandemic. The popular financial adviser notes that credit card debt is going up while savings continue to decline. She fears this will lead to a wave of bankruptcies and foreclosures as it becomes increasingly difficult for households to make their payments. However, Orman doesn\u2019t expect the government to come to the rescue as it did during COVID-19. She says American households will need to make their own \u201cfinancial vaccines\u201d to come out unscathed. Find Out: 10 Expenses Most Likely To Drain Your Checking Account Each Month Orman\u2019s Tips for Preparing We may be heading for a financial pandemic, but you don\u2019t have to let it derail your goals. Orman offers three tips to get yourself ready for whatever the future may bring. Build Emergency Savings Automatically With Your Employer If Possible In her interview on this subject with CNN, Orman says people should start by seeing if their employer has any programs in place for supporting saving. She says some companies will automatically set aside the same amount of money from every paycheck and put it into a savings account for you. But this may not be an option for you. Save 8-12 Months of Expenses in a Separate Account Next, Orman recommends setting aside eight to 12 months of expenses in a separate savings account. This is a bit more than the average recommendation, which says to save between three and six months of expenses. Orman is probably recommending accumulating extra savings because of the financial pandemic she expects. However, the exact amount of emergency funds you reserve can vary based on how much you have available to save. Contribute to Your Retirement To Earn Employer Matching Finally, Orman says you should always contribute enough to your retirement account to qualify for the maximum amount of matching your employer offers. Failing to do this is like passing up free money, she said. Other Strategies for Improving Your Financial Wellness In the interview, Orman doesn\u2019t share every strategy that can help you prepare for the financial pandemic she predicts. But anything that improves your financial wellness can be helpful. Here are some strategies to consider. Track Your Spending There\u2019s a common saying that you need to track something before you can improve it. That\u2019s absolutely true for your financial situation, which is why any plan for moving forward should include tracking your spending. You can do that by going through your transaction history and grouping purchases into different categories like food and housing. Or, it may be easier to just download a budgeting app that can do it for you after you connect your bank account digitally. Create a Realistic Monthly Budget It\u2019s also important to have a monthly budget in place. Yours should include all of your major expense categories and the dollar amount you expect to spend on them each month. The total should add up to no more than your monthly income and hopefully less so you have room to save. Pay Your Bills on Time If you\u2019re not in a good financial position, don\u2019t let yourself fall behind on present-day obligations. You\u2019ll need to spend as much of your budget as it takes to pay your bills. Otherwise, it\u2019ll just become harder and harder to get yourself out of the hole. If you don\u2019t have enough income to pay your bills, reach out to the companies you owe money to. Some may be willing to pause or reduce your payments due to financial difficulty. Pay in Cash When Possible Next, put a stop to new debt by paying cash whenever you can. It\u2019s OK if that means you can\u2019t save as much or make as much progress on existing debt. If Orman\u2019s financial pandemic comes, you\u2019ll want to be spending as little on debt and interest payments per month as possible. This strategy helps you do that. If paying cash isn\u2019t an option, consider choosing a shorter loan term. This will at least get the debt paid off faster so that it stops taking up room in your monthly budget. Follow an Investment Strategy Finally, you may still have extra cash available after building an emergency fund and taking care of your monthly obligations. If so, use that capital to follow an investment strategy for your future. You can put money in a retirement account like an IRA, purchase certificates of deposit or save through a high-yield savings account for an important upcoming purchase, like a home. Just know that some account types restrict when you can withdraw the money you put in them. For example, IRAs typically charge a 10% withdrawal penalty if you remove money before turning 59 \u00bd. Don\u2019t put money in an account like this if you think you\u2019ll need it sooner than that. The Final Word Orman is predicting a new wave of financial challenges for American households. But she\u2019s not an oracle. The truth is none of us know when the next difficult financial times will arrive. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to always be thinking about how to use your money more effectively.

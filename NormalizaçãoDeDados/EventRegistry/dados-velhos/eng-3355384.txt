From virtually the day she signed in 2013 up through her departure earlier this month, the 32-year-old California native drew heat that matched her trademark fiery locks. Maybe it was her persona on Total Divas, which betrayed a naivet\u00e9 about the business. Coupled with an apparent primitive skill set, Coyle was red meat for the kinds of fans who still give Roman Reigns grief.\n\nSo, nearly a year to the day after her suspension for violating WWE's wellness policy - which she has contested was triggered by late paperwork disclosing an Adderall prescription - Coyle's come full circle with West Coast ambitions, this time to take over Hollywood. Buoyed by management firm the Garcia Companies -- as in Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson's ex-wife, Dany Garcia - and agency powerhouse WME, the now-former sports entertainer has already appeared alongside Nicholas Cage and Gina Gershon in this summer's Inconceivable (a movie, in keeping with Coyle's crimson motif, aptly written by veteran Red Shoe Diaries producer Chloe King). And extracurricular activities like her NEM Fashion line and related NEM Foundation, not to mention tireless lifestyle-product endorsements across her social-media spectrum, are now at the fore of her future.\n\nA week removed from her exit-stage-left moment with WWE, Coyle caught up with us to look back on the ups and downs of nearly a half a decade in the wrestling biz, and her aspirations to cross over like no man or woman has.\n\nSo does it feel good to live life as just Natalie now and not Eva?\n\n[Laughs] A little bit, especially now that I don't have the red hair. The gimmick has definitely gotten pulled away.\n\nAnd your next movie, Action #1, is a comedy, where Inconceivable is a thriller. Is the goal as an actress to avoid being pigeonholed?\n\nThat is 100-percent correct. I'm going into as many genres as I can. I'm deep into acting classes and vocal coaches and training, because it is so much hard work. Actors and actresses are incredible. I want to be the best I possibly can be onscreen.\n\nIs it fair to say that when you've remarked in recent months about possibly returning to WWE and going after the title, you were just being coy?\n\nI have such a great relationship with Vince [McMahon], Paul [\"Triple H\" Levesque] and Stephanie [McMahon]. They gave me an opportunity to step away and film these two films I have done already, and you never know when that relationship will come back. So I might appear at a SummerSlam or WrestleMania. It just so happens that the wrestling craft, you have to be able to give yourself 110 percent to that. And then with acting, you have to do the same, so we decided together that with the films going back to back. I'm going to put my efforts into acting and growing that way. And then you never know: All Red Everything could come back and snatch that title.\n\nThe McMahons have rarely been ones to close the door on surprise returns.\n\nExactly, and I think that's where it was at. The WWE fanbase is so fantastic. They're so die-hard, and in the last 10 months, they have been asking, \"Where is All Red Everything?\" So both our teams came together and decided we need to definitely let the fans know what's going on.\n\nYou have a degree in Business Management. Maybe taking a break from WWE happened quicker than expected, but did you always have an eye toward focusing on growing your overall brand?\n\nAbsolutely. Especially in this day and age, as a woman it's very smart to be able to expand your brand in multiple facets. My manager, Dany Garcia, is a prime example of somebody I look up to because she not only owns her own business but she's doing multiple different things. She's an athlete herself. Going into WWE after I graduated college, it's just in me to do the same. Sky's the limit.\n\nAnd you never had the same legacy attached to wrestling as, say, Charlotte or Natalya. Did that make it easier to reconcile seizing outside opportunities?\n\nYes, sure. But my ultimate goal too is to be with WWE for the next 20-plus years. So, just like the Rock does, the name of the game is to be able to take your brand and strategically plan it. And that's why I'm grateful that WWE allowed me to step away and pursue this acting career.\n\nDid you and your team identify that a female wrestler has yet to cross over as The Rock or John Cena has? That maybe this is that moment?\n\nOne hundred percent. I like to break barriers. As soon as I walked into WWE's door, I was already thinking ahead of the game. There has not been one female to make that crossover and go back and forth and merge the two together. I want to bring the WWE universe with me into Hollywood as well as creating a new fanbase in Hollywood and bringing them back into WWE and having the two worlds collide just like The Rock. That was the game plan for sure.\n\nAll of this may surprise fans that inferred animus between yourself and WWE. Have people been reading too much into things?\n\nI think so. It's hard for people to understand a good relationship, especially a good working one. WWE could have ultimately said, \"We're not going to give Eva Marie the time off to film these films,\" and they signed off on it and were so supportive. And I went from All Red Everything to All Black Everything. That's a big deal, because I had worked on my gimmick for quite some time. If anything, our relationship is tighter than a golf ball.\n\nHave you heard whispers about how closely Lana and Tamina's current SmackDown storyline resembles yours and Nia Jax's from NXT?\n\n[Laughs] I have been getting tweets [about] the resemblance, but I have not been able to pay too much attention to the programming. However, if they are doing that, WWE is extremely smart. Everybody loves to hate somebody. Look at Game of Thrones, the Cersei character. So I feel like, bravo if you're trying to duplicate my character.\n\nIn retrospect, were you put in front of the cameras on Total Divas too soon, at the expense of developing under the radar?\n\nYou know what? Yes. For sure, the inner athlete and perfectionist in me wishes I was able to train the multiple years these wrestlers are able to before they get on TV. However, if that opportunity never came up, then I would not have been put in front of the WWE universe, dyed my hair, been put in front of my [management] team. Everything happens for a reason. For me, it all played out pretty damn good.", "timeCrawl": "13:10:00", "sim": 0.7450980544090271, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8620876", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "id": 8, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "id": 189, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "id": 192, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "id": 210, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "id": 426, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "id": 576, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "id": 1055, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "id": 1184, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"gpCnt": 3}}

As soon as I walked into WWE's door, I was already thinking ahead of the game. There has not been one female to make that crossover and go back and forth and merge the two together. I want to bring the WWE universe with me into Hollywood as well as creating a new fanbase in Hollywood and bringing them back into WWE and having the two worlds collide just like The Rock. That was the game plan for sure.\"\n\nEva is even working with Rock's management team, the same team who leaned into his relationship with WWE by having him work three straight WrestleMania main events, including two matches, all in service of helping him become the most bankable actor in the world.\n\nThe thing about that is The Rock was a legitimate star in WWE before ever leaving for Hollywood.\n\nEva just got booed a lot.\n\nThe Rock accomplished pretty much everything there was to accomplish in his pro wrestling career before he even attempted to take on Tinseltown.\n\nCan you remember even one Eva match?\n\nStill, the strategy of playing the two off each other could work, as long as you adjust the scale. It's safe to say it's unlikely she'll come anywhere near The Rock's status or stature but that doesn't mean she shouldn't attempt to do so if the opportunity is presenting itself.\n\nWe'll see how it works out.\n\nJust know it's clear she'll be back in WWE at some point.", "timeCrawl": "13:37:00", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8799540", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "id": 63, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Related_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Related Merchandise", "id": 351, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "id": 947, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "id": 1055, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "id": 1184, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing", "id": 1300, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Guides_and_Schools", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Guides and Schools", "id": 1301, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Indoor", "id": 1348, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

impression?\n\nTHIS week marks 18 years since Chris Jericho made his surprise WWE debut - one of the all- time great WWE moments.\n\nTo celebrate, Sun Sports counts down the 12 greatest ever superstar debuts.\n\nNOT PICKED YOUR FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM YET? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?\n\nRaw - March 18, 2002\n\nThe future 'Beast' made his debut the night after WrestleMania X-8 - jumping the barricade and annihilating Al Snow, Maven and Spike Dudley.\n\nWith Paul Heyman at his side, the 24-year- old 'next big thing' looked like an absolute monster - an aura he's maintained to this day.\n\nThough her relationship with WWE is uncertain at the moment, the company had high hopes for the British superstar in 2014.\n\nIt's little wonder - Paige had already revolutionised women's wrestling over on NXT and was about to lay the groundwork for the \"women's evolution\" on the main roster.\n\nShe debuted on the \"Raw after 'Mania\" - famous for its big surprises and debuts - and defeated AJ Lee to become dual NXT and Divas Champion.\n\nA landmark moment in WWE's \"Ruthless Aggression Era\", Cena answered an open challenge from Kurt Angle and hit the Olympic champ with a thunderous slap.\n\nThough Angle got the victory, it was a star-making moment for Cena - putting him on track to becoming the biggest name of his generation.\n\nBack when NXT was a reality TV-style contest, the entire class of new recruits - led by Wade Barrett - invaded Raw to destroy the set (and to the delight of fans, John Cena).\n\nConsidering most ended up on jobber duty, it doesn't seem that significant now - but it was the freshest thing to happen on Raw in years at the time.\n\nNotable for Nexus member Daniel Bryan getting fired for going un-PG when he choked the ring announcer with his tie.\n\nJimmy Hart claims to pick a random fan from the crowd to sit on Dino Bravo's back as he does push-up to prove how strong he is.\n\nAfter picking out a smiling 400 pounder dubbed \"Big John\", Bravo manages five push-ups - but when Ultimate Warrior attempts it, John crushes him Earthquake-style. A swerve turn before swerve turns were even a thing.\n\nRaw - March 31, 2003\n\nAfter the weak Invasion story - filled mostly with nobody mid-carders from WCW - there was only one man from the rival promotion wanted to see in WWE.\n\nGoldberg arrived the night after WrestleMania XIX, making a huge statement by spearing The Rock.\n\nUnfortunately, in took another 13 years for Goldberg to have a decent run in WWE.\n\nAnother one involving Kurt Angle - but this time when Angle was in his rookie year and still undefeated.\n\nFormer ECW Champion Tazz was Angle's mystery opponents - and stormed to the ring to a huge pop from the Madison Square Garden crowd\n\nHe choked out Angle in just three minutes, which would prove to be the highlight of his in- ring career with WWE.\n\nThe surprise mystery partner of Ted DiBiase's 'million Dollar Team', Undertaker strode out with then-manager Brother Love.\n\nIn his all-black garb and deathly appearance, he was unlike any monster heel WWE fans had seen before - and hit Koko B. Ware with a Tombstone almost immediately.\n\nThough not necessarily an earth-shattering performance - Taker was counted out after nine minutes - it's an important moment in WWE's most legendary career.\n\nThis has been largely cast aside due to the events of the Benoit tragedy, but at the time was a huge event in the WWE v WCW ratings war.\n\nAfter walking out of the declining WCW, the Radicalz - Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko, and Perry Saturn - wasted no time in joining WWE.\n\nAppearing at ringside, they leapt over the barricade to beat down the New Age Outlaws and prove themselves the hottest free agents in wrestling.\n\nThere was a time when Kevin Owens making it to WWE seemed unlikely - and the idea of him laying out the near-invincible John Cena in his debut was simply unthinkable.\n\nBut that's exactly what happened when KO - then NXT champ - gatecrashed Cena's US title mopen challenge, mirroring Cena's debut 12 years earlier.\n\nBest of all was KO's refusal to accept Cena's \"veteran's advice\" (Owens has actually been wrestling for longer) then stamping on Cena's US Championship.\n\nJericho had got over huge in WCW with his hilarious promos and heel work. Who can forget his \"Man of 1,004 holds\" routine?\n\nSo having WCW's top talker debut by interrupt WWE's own microphone master The Rock - following weeks of the \"Y2J Millennium Countdown - was a stroke of genius.\n\nJericho's name flashing on the Titantron is still one of WWE's all-time ever pops - and the moment that all debuts and returns since have tried to replicate.\n\nAfter months of speculation, Taker's not-so- little bro arrived in the closing seconds of the first Hell in a Cell - one of the greatest matches in WWE history.\n\nKane tore the door off the cell and Tombstoned the Deadman - revenge from Taker burning him as a child and leaving him (supposedly) hideously scarred.\n\nIt was an epic moment that developed the stories of each man in the ring - Taker, Kane, and Shawn Michaels - and started an incredible monster push for the 'Big Red Machine'.\n\nIf the answer is no you need to take a long, hard look at yourself.\n\nBecause the Dream Team game - the UK's biggest fantasy football game - is back and better than ever this season.\n\nYou've got a \u00a350m budget to pick 11 players, with all the biggest new signings ready and raring to go ahead of a mouthwatering new Premier League campaign.", "timeCrawl": "17:30:00", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2002-03-18", "textStart": 406, "amb": false, "textEnd": 420}, {"date": "2003-03-31", "textStart": 2223, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2237}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8671020", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "id": 69, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "id": 244, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "id": 246, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "id": 1055, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "id": 1056, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "id": 1184, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science", "id": 1351, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

With her UFC career appearing to be over, it makes sense that Rousey, who has already appeared in the ring at a 2015 WrestleMania event, might look into a stint with the WWE.\n\nThat could be exactly the plan for the former UFC champion and Olympic judo bronze medalist, as a website devoted to MMA and wrestling recently reported that Rousey has gone \"as far as to learn some of the basics\" of pro wrestling. According to Fightful.com, which cited WWE sources, the company \"referred Rousey . . . to current superstar Brian Kendrick for training purposes in Southern California.\"\n\nRousey, who has been known as a major fan of pro wrestling, was spotted speaking with WWE executive Triple H at a taping for the Mae Young Classic, the company's all-female tournament. She was ostensibly on hand to cheer for her friend Shayna Baszler, a former UFC fighter competing in the tournament, but her presence sparked renewed speculation that she herself might be close to joining the action.\n\n\"There was also buzz backstage at the tournament - mainly among WWE employees and contractors - that Rousey's training would start soon,\" Fightful reported. \"She's taken some basic bumps among other things thus far.\"\n\nAdding to the drumbeat, WWE announcer Jim Ross said last week that he thought it was \"inevitable\" that Rousey would be \"a big star\" for his company. \"I see her in a WrestleMania someday,\" he told TMZ Sports. \"It's too great an opportunity for her to pass up and WWE to pass up - it's a match made in heaven.\"\n\nRousey herself has said in the past that she would \"love to have the chance to be the Divas world champion,\" referring to the WWE's female wrestlers. She has most recently been seen on ABC's \"Battle of the Network Stars,\" but a spate of WWE-centric Twitter follows in June had some wondering if she might turn up at SummerSlam later this month.\n\nThere has long been crossover between pro wrestling and MMA, and we recently saw Jon Jones, shortly before winning the UFC light heavyweight crown, call out WWE star and former UFC heavyweight king Brock Lesnar. In addition, UFC featherweight champ Cris \"Cyborg\" Justino has been carrying on a public feud with WWE star Becky Lynch and calling for their own SummerSlam showdown.\n\nUFC fans never got a chance to see Rousey square off with Cyborg, a longtime antagonist, in the Octagon, but could it happen in a WWE ring?

His return resulted in a huge US Title change as AJ Styles reclaimed after pinning Jericho in a Triple Threat Match. Kevin Owens lost his championship without being pinned, which will give him a huge opportunity for another rematch at WWE Summerslam. Jericho returned to WWE for one night and had a dramatic impact on the US Title picture.\n\nThe WWE Universe wasn't expecting Y2J to appear on WWE programming for the rest of the year. His tour schedule with Fozzy is rumored to take up most of his time for the rest of 2017, but his surprise appearance on SmackDown Live has made the fans hopeful because he could make another appearance at any time for the rest of the year. Unfortunately, the WWE Universe shouldn't hold their breath for another appearance.\n\nIt's being reported that the reason why Chris Jericho returned to SmackDown Live a few weeks ago was the result of all the stars aligning between himself and WWE. During his latest edition of \"Talk is Jericho,\" Y2J revealed that he was already in Richmond, Virginia to record an episode with Breezango for his podcast as well as film some new material for the Southpaw Regional Wrestling show. WWE officials asked him for an appearance on SmackDown Live to get involved with the Owens vs. Styles rivalry, which he agreed to do.\n\nThe WWE Universe remains hopeful that Jericho will return to WWE television full-time soon, but there a single appearance may be the most they can get for the rest of the year. It's likely that he will be involved in some WWE live events every so often. However, Chris Jericho's focus appears to be away from the ring and on his commitments to Fozzy for the rest of 2017. The WWE Royal Rumble is still a possibility as of now.\n\nThere is still unfinished business between Kevin Owens and Chris Jericho. The latter's return for one night caused Owens to lose his United States Championship. WWE officials were clever to continue to book Y2J as the thorn in Owens' side despite being on an extended hiatus for the foreseeable future.

On SmackDown Live, there has been a lot of tension between McMahon and Owens as of late, but Shane will serve as the Special Guest Referee during Owens' rematch for the United States Title against AJ Styles at WWE Summerslam.\n\nThe expectation is Kevin Owens will fail to reclaim the US Championship from Styles at the biggest party of the summer. More importantly, Owens will blame his misfortune on Shane McMahon. Many fans believe it will be a set up for a one on one match between the two men to take place down the line. While that may be the plan, it's being reported that creative plans for their feud will take the fans into WWE Survivor Series.\n\nThe latest rumors are claiming that the conflict between Shane McMahon and Kevin Owens will eventually lead to huge \"Team McMahon vs. Team Owens\" match at WWE Survivor Series in November. The fans are expecting both men to act as captains for their respective teams and both men will wrestle in the match. It's likely that McMahon and Owens may be the final competitors in the bout to end their feud once and for all.\n\nOn paper, Shane McMahon and Kevin Owens have a strong babyface and heel dynamic that the WWE fans would respond to in a feud The WWE Universe would appreciate the storyline, especially since it could be a very important rivalry for Owens on SmackDown Live. If WWE officials could keep the momentum of their feud going strong into over the next three months, it may do a great deal to further establish Kevin Owens.\n\nIt's also being reported that WWE officials are planning to make the WWE Survivor Series PPV this year a much bigger event than it was last year. The powers that be want to keep the Raw vs SmackDown Live vibe alive for the PPV, but they are looking to have more singles matches instead of having more than one five on five traditional Survivor Series matches. If that's the case, Owens vs. McMahon could be the only match of its kind on the card, which means WWE officials will push it as the top gimmick match during the PPV.", "timeCrawl": "08:30:00", "sim": 0.5490196347236633, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8890525", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Men", "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Men", "id": 211, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "id": 228, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "id": 229, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "id": 393, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "id": 661, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Design", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Design", "id": 662, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "id": 1055, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "id": 1184, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The event will take place on Sunday, August 20, 2017, at the Barclays Centre in Brooklyn. The match card is nearly complete with superstars from both RAW and SmackDown Live poised to battle it out at the grandest event of summer.\n\nIt is rumored the WWE could be planning a few surprises to deal with the falling ratings. Even though the ratings have stabilized, the numbers have dwindled in past few months. It is speculated that WWE will try and win back audiences by leveraging the Summerslam 2017. The current match card indicates that WWE is going all guns blazing to put up a great show.\n\nTo ensure the audiences do not fall out after Summerslam, WWE could plan some shocking surprises to awe the WWE Universe and create new intriguing storylines. The officials have done it in the past and it likely that they will do it this year too. Here is a list of possible surprises that the company could plant to shock the WWE Universe.\n\nNikki Bella Returns\n\nReturn of past wrestlers or superstars on a break is the best method to shock the viewers and make the event a great success. It is speculated that the same technique could be used in Summerslam 2017.\n\nAfter her short hiatus, Nikki Bella is rumored to return at Summerslam 2017, as reported by SportsKeeda. She was last seen at WrestleMania 33, where she along with John Cena had defeated Miz and Maryse. The return was possibly hinted in a twitter battle between Nikki Bella and Baron Corbin.\n\nAnd I can't wait to sit front row and see him slap that mouth right off your face!????????????????No one gives & inspires as much as that man does. N\n\n-- Nikki & Brie (@BellaTwins) August 9, 2017\n\nWWE rumors indicate that Eric Rowan and Luke Harper could also return at the upcoming PPV. Their singles career are not going anywhere and teaming up could give them a new lease of life. They have not been seen on TV for quite some time and to bring them back out of nowhere will leave the fans shocked.\n\nJinder Mahal Retains WWE Championship\n\nShinsuke Nakamura beat John Cena to become the No.1 contender for WWE Championship and challenge Jinder Mahal at Summerslam. The predictable outcome of the match is for Nakamura to win the match and for Baron Corbin to cash in his Money in the Banks contract.\n\nHowever, such an outcome would be a disaster for Jinder Mahal. Notably, he has been a champion for only under three months. He has turned around his career by reinventing himself, both physically and with in-ring performance. Losing now will ensure he loses legitimacy and any possible shot at the championship in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, Shinsuke Nakamura is someone who is an acclaimed superstar since his days at New Japan Pro-Wrestling. Fans expect his first title win to come against more renowned superstar and at the grandest PPV.\n\nDean Ambrose and Seth Rollins Reunite\n\nThe partial Shield reunion is something that has sent fans into a frenzy quite a few times in the past few weeks. WWE has teased the partial reunion with both the superstars coming to each other's aid more than once.\n\nDean Ambrose, who seemed reluctant to trust Seth Rollins, finally offered the Shield fist bump on the last episode of RAW, as reported by PW Mania. It is rumored that a RAW Tag Team Championship match is being setup with Dean Ambrose & Seth Rollins challenging Cesaro & Sheamus at Summerslam 2017.\n\nWWE fans, do you think that a partial Shield reunion will occur at Summerslam 2017?

impression?\n\nTHIS week marks 18 years since Chris Jericho made his surprise WWE debut - one of the all- time great WWE moments.\n\nTo celebrate, Sun Sports counts down the 12 greatest ever superstar debuts.\n\nNOT PICKED YOUR FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM YET? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?\n\nRaw - March 18, 2002\n\nThe future 'Beast' made his debut the night after WrestleMania X-8 - jumping the barricade and annihilating Al Snow, Maven and Spike Dudley.\n\nWith Paul Heyman at his side, the 24-year- old 'next big thing' looked like an absolute monster - an aura he's maintained to this day.\n\nRaw - April 7, 2014\n\nThough her relationship with WWE is uncertain at the moment, the company had high hopes for the British superstar in 2014.\n\nIt's little wonder - Paige had already revolutionised women's wrestling over on NXT and was about to lay the groundwork for the \"women's evolution\" on the main roster.\n\nShe debuted on the \"Raw after 'Mania\" - famous for its big surprises and debuts - and defeated AJ Lee to become dual NXT and Divas Champion.\n\nSmackDown - June 27, 2002\n\nA landmark moment in WWE's \"Ruthless Aggression Era\", Cena answered an open challenge from Kurt Angle and hit the Olympic champ with a thunderous slap.\n\nThough Angle got the victory, it was a star-making moment for Cena - putting him on track to becoming the biggest name of his generation.\n\nRaw - June 7, 2010\n\nBack when NXT was a reality TV-style contest, the entire class of new recruits - led by Wade Barrett - invaded Raw to destroy the set (and to the delight of fans, John Cena).\n\nConsidering most ended up on jobber duty, it doesn't seem that significant now - but it was the freshest thing to happen on Raw in years at the time.\n\nNotable for Nexus member Daniel Bryan getting fired for going un-PG when he choked the ring announcer with his tie.\n\nSuperstars - October 2, 1989\n\nJimmy Hart claims to pick a random fan from the crowd to sit on Dino Bravo's back as he does push-up to prove how strong he is.\n\nAfter picking out a smiling 400 pounder dubbed \"Big John\", Bravo manages five push-ups - but when Ultimate Warrior attempts it, John crushes him Earthquake-style. A swerve turn before swerve turns were even a thing.\n\nRaw - March 31, 2003\n\nAfter the weak Invasion story - filled mostly with nobody mid-carders from WCW - there was only one man from the rival promotion wanted to see in WWE.\n\nGoldberg arrived the night after WrestleMania XIX, making a huge statement by spearing The Rock.\n\nUnfortunately, in took another 13 years for Goldberg to have a decent run in WWE.\n\nRoyal Rumble - January 23, 2000\n\nAnother one involving Kurt Angle - but this time when Angle was in his rookie year and still undefeated.\n\nFormer ECW Champion Tazz was Angle's mystery opponents - and stormed to the ring to a huge pop from the Madison Square Garden crowd\n\nHe choked out Angle in just three minutes, which would prove to be the highlight of his in- ring career with WWE.\n\nThe surprise mystery partner of Ted DiBiase's 'million Dollar Team', Undertaker strode out with then-manager Brother Love.\n\nIn his all-black garb and deathly appearance, he was unlike any monster heel WWE fans had seen before - and hit Koko B. Ware with a Tombstone almost immediately.\n\nThough not necessarily an earth-shattering performance - Taker was counted out after nine minutes - it's an important moment in WWE's most legendary career.\n\nRaw - 31, January 2000\n\nThis has been largely cast aside due to the events of the Benoit tragedy, but at the time was a huge event in the WWE v WCW ratings war.\n\nAfter walking out of the declining WCW, the Radicalz - Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko, and Perry Saturn - wasted no time in joining WWE.\n\nAppearing at ringside, they leapt over the barricade to beat down the New Age Outlaws and prove themselves the hottest free agents in wrestling.\n\nRaw - May 18, 2015\n\nThere was a time when Kevin Owens making it to WWE seemed unlikely - and the idea of him laying out the near-invincible John Cena in his debut was simply unthinkable.\n\nBut that's exactly what happened when KO - then NXT champ - gatecrashed Cena's US title mopen challenge, mirroring Cena's debut 12 years earlier.\n\nBest of all was KO's refusal to accept Cena's \"veteran's advice\" (Owens has actually been wrestling for longer) then stamping on Cena's US Championship.\n\nJericho had got over huge in WCW with his hilarious promos and heel work. Who can forget his \"Man of 1,004 holds\" routine?\n\nSo having WCW's top talker debut by interrupt WWE's own microphone master The Rock - following weeks of the \"Y2J Millennium Countdown - was a stroke of genius.\n\nJericho's name flashing on the Titantron is still one of WWE's all-time ever pops - and the moment that all debuts and returns since have tried to replicate.\n\nBadd Blood - October 5, 1997\n\nAfter months of speculation, Taker's not-so- little bro arrived in the closing seconds of the first Hell in a Cell - one of the greatest matches in WWE history.\n\nKane tore the door off the cell and Tombstoned the Deadman - revenge from Taker burning him as a child and leaving him (supposedly) hideously scarred.\n\nIt was an epic moment that developed the stories of each man in the ring - Taker, Kane, and Shawn Michaels - and started an incredible monster push for the 'Big Red Machine'.\n\nIf the answer is no you need to take a long, hard look at yourself.\n\nBecause the Dream Team game - the UK's biggest fantasy football game - is back and better than ever this season.\n\nYou've got a \u00a350m budget to pick 11 players, with all the biggest new signings ready and raring to go ahead of a mouthwatering new Premier League campaign.", "timeCrawl": "17:29:00", "sim": 0.5176470875740051, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2002-03-18", "textStart": 406, "amb": false, "textEnd": 420}, {"date": "2014-04-07", "textStart": 706, "amb": false, "textEnd": 719}, {"date": "2002-06-27", "textStart": 1168, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1181}, {"date": "2010-06-07", "textStart": 1481, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1493}, {"date": "2003-03-31", "textStart": 2321, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2335}, {"date": "2000-01-23", "textStart": 2685, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2701}, {"date": "2015-05-18", "textStart": 3966, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3978}, {"date": "1997-10-05", "textStart": 4906, "amb": false, "textEnd": 4921}, {"date": "2000-01-", "textStart": 3512, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3524}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8670815", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "id": 69, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "id": 244, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "id": 1055, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "id": 1056, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "id": 1184, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

These guys are the real deal, they are superstars and I think people want to see that.\n\n\"Personally, myself like you guys do want to see a regular show from the UK.

The exact role of the UK talent is not currently known.\n\nIn addition to WWE's growth in the United Kingdom, Andy Shepherd has had the chance to work alongside Triple H, William Regal and Michael Cole. Here's what he told Cult of Whatever about what that's been like:\n\n\"Absolutely incredible,\" said Shepherd. \"Michael Cole had been amazing to me throughout this entire process, he helped me through everything; I can't say enough good things about him. The same goes for all of the guys backstage, William Regal, the word legend doesn't sum that guy up, the stories he can tell and he is so nice to everyone and will always make time for you, until you see it with your own eyes it is hard to describe.\n\n\"Hunter is really helping push so many different avenues of this business forward and the talks he gives you before the show starts and when the show finishes are so inspirational. It's little things when William or Paul will come up to you shake hands and say well done, it means so much.\"\n\nShepherd put over the WWE brass as extremely supportive, something he reiterated in his comments.\n\n\"All of the guys that came over from the States I can't say enough good things about them, how supportive they were to everyone throughout the roster.\"\n\nPlans for the United Kingdom WWE Network show have been on hold, which has been obvious due to the fact the first taping was set for June and nothing has been announced. The company continues to expand their brand internationally as they look to grow the WWE Network.

Ron DeSantis says the ban on lab-grown meat not only protects the state's cattle farmers, but also thwarts the 'authoritarian goals' of the global elite to make us eat 'fake meat.'\n\nFlorida has become the first state to outlaw the manufacture and distribution of lab-grown meat. But other states including Alabama, Arizona and Tennessee have similar measures cooking.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday, May 1, signed into law the bill, which would ban lab-grown meat, also called \"cultivated\" meat because it's grown from animal stem cells. \"Take your fake lab-grown meat elsewhere,\" he said. \"We're not doing that in the state of Florida.\"\n\nThe ban - it does not include Impossible meat, which is made from plant-based ingredients - is meant to protect cattle ranchers and the \"integrity of American agriculture,\" DeSantis said.\n\nBut critics call the move misguided for several reasons. For starters, the first cultivated meat regulatory approvals in the U.S. came through less than a year ago.\n\n\"No one in the field has yet scaled up to the levels you need to produce food for supermarkets,\" David Kaplan, a biomolecular engineer focusing on cellular agriculture at Tufts University, told Scientific American. \"There's not even an industry yet. It's just fledgling!\"\n\nMany meat-alternative companies and supporters consider lab-grown meat as a way to address the environmental and ethical concerns tied to traditional mass-production of meat. Initially, lab-grown meat will cost more than three times as much to produce as natural beef, a 2021 analysis found.\n\nCinco de Mayo 2024:Food and drink specials include deals at Taco Bell, Chipotle, TGI Fridays, more\n\nHowever, non-profit think tank Good Food Institute has cited research published in The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment forecasting cultivated meat to eventually be nearly three times more efficient than conventional beef production, with the potential to reduce the carbon footprint by 92%, land use by 90%, and water use by 66%.\n\nWhy did Gov. DeSantis ban lab-grown meat?\n\nWith the ban, Florida \"is fighting back against the global elite's plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals,\" DeSantis said in a statement. \"Our administration will continue to focus on investing in our local farmers and ranchers, and we will save our beef.\"\n\nBeef is pretty big business in Florida. In 2024, the state ranked ninth for beef cattle production with 862,000. Beef cattle sales and sales of breeding stock generate a total economic impact of more than $900 million annually, according to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.\n\nDeSantis made fun of liberals advocating for \"fake meat\" as a way to combat climate change - and chided global leaders such as those at The World Economic Forum, which has advocated for insects as an alternative edible protein source (they are considered delicacies in certain cultures).\n\nNot all lawmakers were on board. When the bill was being debated in the Florida House in March, Rep. Christine Hunschofsky, D-Parkland, said the \"food fight\" part of the bill \"sends a bad message\" to researchers and investors about cultivated meat, according to the News Service of Florida.\n\n\"I think it will deter future manufacturers from coming to Florida because they don't know what day of the week that the Legislature will be OK with them being in the state of Florida,\" Hunschofsky said.\n\nThe Alabama bill, which originated in the state Senate, would \"prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution of food products made from cultured animal cells.\" The state House passed it April 30, but an amendment requires it goes back to the Senate before being sent to Gov. Kay Ivy, Food Safety magazine reported.\n\nThe approved bill, similar to the Florida law, removed a research ban that could affect NASA and the space industry, which is looking at cultivated meat for long-term space missions.\n\nIn the Arizona legislature, two different bills passed the House - one banning lab-grown meat and another for tougher meat labeling - but neither made it out of the Senate, Food Safety News reported.\n\nThe Tennessee bill, which would ban the sale of cultured meat and impose fines of up to $1 million, was not considered by either house before the General Assembly session ended. But the bill \"would be the death knell for (cultured meat),\" said its sponsor state senator Frank Niceley, a farmer, The Daily Mail reported. \"And in the long run, we'd be a lot better off.\"\n\nWashington Post columnist Catherine Rampell disagrees, arguing that the industry's prospects \"offer huge potential benefits.\"\n\n\"To be clear, this is not about a left-wing nanny state forcing the sale or consumption of lab-grown meats,\" she wrote recently. \"It's about a conservative nanny state prohibiting the voluntary consumption and sale of these products (which again, mostly don't yet exist). ... These bans are partly about, well, throwing red meat to the base.\"\n\nWhy shouldn't we eat lab-grown meat? Is it safe?\n\nEven though the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 said it is safe to eat lab-grown meat and the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave its approval in 2023, there remain questions about the health effects of lab-grown meat.\n\nNo animals are slaughtered to make cultured meat. However, scientists can take cells from slaughtered livestock to make the meat. A CNN article from 2023 suggests those with religious or ethical reasons for not eating meat look deeper into where their lab-grown burger came from before trying it out.\n\nCan vegans eat lab-grown meat?\n\nCultured meat is still taken from animal cells, so it's not considered vegan. But an article from VegNews said a poll from the dating app Veggly found 24% of vegans surveyed would be open to eating lab-grown meat since it does not involve slaughter.\n\nDoes lab-grown meat taste like real meat?\n\nReviews for cultured chicken from Upside Foods, which was among the first two companies approved, have been largely positive, with one reviewer from the MIT Technology Review saying, \"while the bites I slowly chewed and considered were still softer than a chicken breast, they were definitely more chicken-like than other alternatives I've tried.\" An Associated Press

According to the Good Food Institute, it uses the same cell types that can be arranged in the same or similar structure as animal tissues, thus replicating the sensory and nutritional profiles of conventional meat.\n\nGCF Global further explains the cells are then placed in petri dishes with amino acids and carbohydrates to help the muscle cells multiply and grow. Once enough muscle fibers have grown, the result is a \"meat that resembles ground beef,\" or whatever meat you are trying to replicate.\n\nGuide to cultivated meat: What is lab-grown meat, and why did Governor Ron DeSantis ban it in Florida?\n\nUSA Today reported the first cultivated beef was eaten in 2013, and the industry has since expanded to about 60 startups around the world focused on making the meat in 2023.\n\nWhat are vegan meat substitutes made out of?\n\nAccording to Healthline, these are some of the most common vegan substitutes found in grocery stores and served in dining establishments:\n\nAs for popular brands, Impossible Foods is one of the most known meat-free alternative brands, launching its products in retailers and in restaurants. Their product is made from wheat, corn, soy, coconut and potatoes, and flavored with heme, the molecule that gives meat its characteristic flavor.\n\nIs cultivated meat vegan?\n\nNot exactly. While some longtime vegan, as well as animal and environmental advocates, are encouraging the production of cultivated meat, many are still hesitant on whether to refer to it as a \"vegan\" option.\n\nVegNews said because it is taken from real animal cells, it's not technically vegan.\n\nDoes SB 1084 also ban vegan meat substitutes?\n\nSB 1084 will not target any plant-based vegan meat substitutes, only those being derived from animal cells.\n\nAre you still vegan if you eat lab-grown meat?\n\nNo, cultured meat is still taken from animal stem cells, so it can't be considered vegan.\n\nHowever, VegNews said a poll from the dating app Veggly found 24% of vegans it asked would be open to eating lab-grown meat since it does not involve slaughter.", "source": {"uri": "news-press.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultured_meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cultured meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Veganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_alternative", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meat alternative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_dish", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petri dish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skeletal muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Food_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Good Food Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amino acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ground beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stem cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbohydrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tissue (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant-based_diet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plant-based diet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Impossible Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VegNews", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "VegNews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heme"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Meat", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Meat", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Veganism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Veganism", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Meat_Substitutes", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Meat Substitutes", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Vegetarian", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Vegetarian", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d8d0774057d19139d16e6ede624d76e89947662d/c=1-0-1365-767/local/-/media/2022/01/14/USATODAY/usatsports/imageForEntry11-4c5.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540650", "eventUri": "eng-9540650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

The process is expensive and the widespread availability of so-called lab-grown meat is years away. Beef and poultry associations, as well as some conservatives, have opposed the industry, calling it antifarmer.\n\nIn a news release announcing that he had signed the ban, Gov. Rick DeSantis said his administration was committed to investing in local farmers and ranchers. \"We will save our beef,\" he said.\n\nHe also cast the ban as pushback against \"global elites\" who have a \"plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals.\" The news release linked to a 2021 article on the World Economic Forum website discussing global food shortages and lamenting that insects are often overlooked as a source of protein.\n\nTo create and cultivate the meat, cells are removed from live animals and then water, salt and nutrients such as amino acids, minerals and vitamins are added to the cells, which multiply in large tanks. The resulting meat product can be shaped into patties or sausage forms.\n\nGroups concerned about the environmental effects of raising animals for meat had lobbied against Florida's restrictions, as did many companies that are spending millions of dollars to create laboratory-grown meat.\n\nGeopolitics even entered the debate after opponents of the ban raised a recent report, published on a state-owned Chinese news site that said the Florida ban \"strengthens China's dominant position in this field.\" Government officials in China have prioritized the development of cultivated meat.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Agriculture Department approved the production and sale of cultivated chicken meat by two California companies. Proponents of cultivated meat point to the approval as proof that meat grown in a lab is safe.\n\nSan Francisco-based Wildtype, which is working on lab-grown salmon, on its website called the ban \"a short-sighted decision driven by politics.\"\n\nTactics aimed at growing food in environmentally conscious ways have become enmeshed in America's culture wars. Some studies and polls have shown that food choices are sometimes split along party lines, with veganism for instance identified with liberalism while conservatives eat more meat than others.\n\nRemarks by DeSantis, at a ceremony in the Hardee County Cattleman's Arena in Wauchula, Florida, acknowledged the political divide. DeSantis, a Republican, said he was protecting the meat industry \"against acts of man, against an ideological agenda that wants to finger agriculture as the problem, that views things like raising cattle as destroying our climate,\" he said at the ceremony.\n\nIn his wide-ranging remarks, DeSantis called the meat \"fake\" and said supporters of the technology wanted to eliminate meat, cattle and chickens. (The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations advocates eating less meat, and some environmentalists support diets that don't include meat.)\n\nThe governor highlighted several other measures aimed at protecting farmland and otherwise benefiting the agriculture industry. \"These will be people who will lecture the rest of us about things like global warming. They will say that, you know, you can't drive an internal combustion engine vehicle, they'll say that agriculture is bad,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, they're flying to Davos in their private jets,\" a reference to the World Economic Forum, an annual meeting in Switzerland that attracts prominent businesspeople and politicians from around the world.\n\nFlorida's ban would punish anyone who makes or sells lab-grown meat with up to 60 days in jail. A half-dozen other states have considered measures this legislative session to restrict the sale of meat grown in a laboratory.\n\nBesides environmentalists, other opponents of restrictions include companies adjacent to the space industry that want to sell cultivated meat for space travel. Elon Musk's company SpaceX has partnered with Aleph Farms, an Israel-based company, to research lab-grown meat on a Space X flight to the International Space Station that launched from Florida.",

The end product is genetically indistinguishable from traditionally produced meat.\n\nLikewise studies have suggested that eating cultivated meat can cut carbon emissions and water usage, and free up land for nature, compared to eating traditionally produced meat.\n\nThe World Economic Forum, an international non-governmental organization in Switzerland, has for years touted lab-grown meat as an efficient and environmentally-friendly way to produce food, and feed a rapidly growing global population. It has also promoted insect farming as a \"credible and alternative protein source\".\n\nLobbyists for edible insects have launched a campaign asking the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to add mealworms, crickets protein powder and other insect products to the agency's database of safe ingredients.\n\nBut Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has banned lab-grown meat, saying he will \"save our beef\" from the \"global elite\" and its \"authoritarian plans\".\n\n\"Florida is fighting back against the global elite's plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs,\" Mr DeSantis said in a statement.

We stand with the cattle ranchers,\" he said.\n\nFlorida's commissioner of agriculture Wilton Simpson applauded the legislation as a \"tremendous step in the right direction\".", "source": {"uri": "en.mercopress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MercoPress"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultured_meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cultured meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nutrient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sugar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insects_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insects as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insect farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealworm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mealworm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(insect)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket (insect)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Commissioner_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Commissioner of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilton_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilton Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_husbandry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animal husbandry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Special_Diets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Special Diets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Produce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Produce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Vegetarian", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Vegetarian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Health_Food", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Health Food", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "http://en.mercopress.com/data/cache/noticias/99510/600x315/ron-de-santis.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540650", "eventUri": "eng-9540650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Ron DeSantis signed a new bill in an effort to save Florida's agriculture and cattle industry, and possibly a boost to the leisure and hospitality sector as well. S.B. 1084 will prohibit companies attempting to \"manufacture for sale, sell, hold or offer for sale, or distribute\" lab-grown meat throughout Florida.\n\nUS food standards are already extremely low as the USDA wants to keep you sick. Washington passed a bill in 2023 permitting companies to supply Americans with fully lab-grown \"meat\" products. The meat is made from pre-cancerous animal cells as they're the most likely to replicate. They then shape this lab-grown unknown product into whatever shape they need so that it looks like real meat.\n\nThis is indeed part of the ESG agenda. Schwab and his World Economic Forum has pushed for the consumption of bugs as a viable protein option. Domesticated cattle have been destroying the climate, in their eyes, as it produces too much CO2. Major food producers like Tyson have also stated that they would begin using insects in their food, in addition to efforts to push lab-grown meat. Best of all, the FDA is currently NOT REQUIRED to label whether the meat is derived from an animal. The Food Safety and Inspection Service has not determined how they will label these products; therefore, you may be eating pre-cancerous fake meat cells without your knowledge in the near future.\n\nItaly has passed a similar ban on lab-grown meat. While Florida is not known for its cuisine, this is a tourist destination and a state that is dependent (growing less dependent) on tourism. Restaurants on a federal level need not report what they are serving the consumer. This ban benefits not only Florida farmers and consumers but also the overall economy.\n\nSome are complaining that the consumer should have the right to choose and that if there is demand, DeSantis should not prohibit companies from entering that new field. The problem becomes the underlying agenda to force the public to ingest unknown substances. No one knows the health consequences of lab-grown meat on public health. They are simply pushing out this lab-grown method to meet ESG rubrics and climate change standards at the expense of the population.\n\nThe cultivated fake meat industry was valued at around $247 million in 2022 and it is expected to spike to $25 billion by 2030 - right on time for Agenda 2030.\n\nAgain, state rights are now essential for maintaining our freedoms. The federal government has been bought and paid for by the globalists and has not acted in the interest of the American public in four years. Other states are looking to follow this ban as red and blue states become further distinguishable by rule of law, or lack thereof.", "source": {"uri": "armstrongeconomics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArmstrongEconomics"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hospitality industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cell (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Safety_and_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food Safety and Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meat industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order_(conspiracy_theory)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New World Order (conspiracy theory)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red states and blue states"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

This technology involves growing meat from animal cells within a bioreactor, bypassing traditional livestock farming and its associated environmental and ethical concerns. Worldwide, the cultivated meat industry has garnered significant interest for its potential to slash pollution, drastically reduce land and water usage, improve animal welfare, and eliminate the need for antibiotics, hormones, and chemicals often prevalent in conventional meat production processes.\n\nTo date, three countries have granted approval for the commercial sale of cultivated meat - Singapore (2020), the United States (2023) and Israel (2024). As the process becomes ever more cost-effective and technologically mature, many other nations are expected to follow suit.\n\nThe benefits are numerous and potentially world-changing - up to 96% lower greenhouse gas emissions, 96% lower water use, and 99% lower land use than conventional meat, according to one study.\n\nMeanwhile, billions of animals could be saved from slaughter each year, including chickens (58,110,000,000), ducks (2,817,000,000), pigs (1,383,000,000), turkeys (654,000,000), geese and guineafowl (649,000,000), sheep (517,000,000), goats (430,000,000), cattle (296,000,000) and bison (24,000,000), a total of almost 65 billion, or more than 2,000 per second.\n\nIf adopted globally, vast areas of land, as well as the oceans, could be restored to their natural, pre-industrial state. Disease risks from bacterial contamination, antibiotic resistance, and zoonotic diseases, which are often associated with conventional animal farming and meat processing, would be substantially reduced.\n\nWith its many advantages, massive growth potential, and improved choice for consumers, this is surely a technology worth pursuing, right? Not according to Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\nWhile the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the commercial sale of cultivated meat in June 2023, Florida is now taking its own measures at the state level. Governor DeSantis has signed off Senate Bill 1084 (SB 1084), aimed at \"prohibiting the manufacture for sale, sale, holding or offering for sale, or distribution of cultivated meat in this state.\"\n\nIn a statement from his press office, the DeSantis administration rails against the World Economic Forum (WEF) and claims it has a goal of \"forcing\" the world to eat lab\u2011grown meat and insects. In addition to the ban, several measures will be enacted to provide government support to the state's existing agriculture and meat industry, such as the protection of 36,000 acres of farmland, and more than $2.8 billion going into the Framework for Freedom Budget.\n\n\"Today, Florida is fighting back against the global elite's plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals,\" said Mr. DeSantis. \"Our administration will continue to focus on investing in our local farmers and ranchers, and we will save our beef.\"\n\n\"Florida is taking a tremendous step in the right direction by signing first-in-the-nation legislation banning lab-grown meat,\" said Wilton Simpson, the Florida Commissioner of Agriculture. \"We must protect our incredible farmers and the integrity of American agriculture. Lab-grown meat is a disgraceful attempt to undermine our proud traditions and prosperity, and is in direct opposition to authentic agriculture. I applaud Governor DeSantis, Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, House Speaker Paul Renner, Senator Jay Collins, and Representative Danny Alvarez for standing up for Florida's farmers and consumers. Together, we will keep Florida's agricultural industry strong and thriving.\"\n\nGood Meat, the world's first company to sell lab-grown meat, expressed disappointment via X, stating: \"In a state that purportedly prides itself on being a land of freedom and individual liberty, its government is now telling consumers what meat they can or cannot purchase.\"\n\nWhile many Republicans may be celebrating, this legislation now positions Florida at the forefront of another culture war and could trigger a national debate over the future of food technology, raising questions about the balance between innovation and regulation. Similar efforts are already underway in the states of Alabama, Arizona, and Tennessee, highlighting the broader implications of this issue across the country.\n\nWhat do you think about Governor Ron DeSantis' decision to ban lab-grown meat in Florida?

This is despite the fact that those products are not currently readily available to the average consumer -- and is occurring even as questions grow around the safety and hygiene of America's current meat and dairy supply amid spikes in bird flu cases\n\nFor instance, on May 2, Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman came out in support of DeSantis' ban. \"Pains me deeply to agree with Crash-and-Burn Ron, but I co-sign this,\" Fetterman said on social media.\n\nHe continued: \"As a member of @SenateAgDems and as some dude who would never serve that slop to my kids, I stand with our American ranchers and farmers.\"\n\nFetterman's statement actually encapsulates two of the most common motivations politicians cite when it comes to entertaining the idea of banning lab-grown meat: the idea that its introduction to the mass-market would damage farmers' livelihoods, and the perception that lab-grown meat is hyper-processed \"slop\" that shouldn't be offered to their constituents.\n\nTo understand these arguments, it's important to understand what exactly lab-grown or \"cultured\" meat is. According to Nature, the products begin with a small sample of animal cells, typically muscle cells, which are cultured in a controlled environment like a bioreactor. Provided with nutrients and a scaffold for support, these cells multiply and differentiate into muscle tissue over the course of several weeks. Once enough tissue is grown, it's harvested and processed to resemble conventional meat products, offering a sustainable and potentially more ethical alternative to traditional animal agriculture by mitigating environmental impact and animal welfare concerns.\n\nAs reported by WIRED, while two fine dining restaurants, Bar Crenn and China Chilcano, partnered with lab-grown meat companies for limited-run menus last year, lab-grown meat from the two companies that have so-far received regulatory approval, Upside Foods and Good Meat, is not currently served or available for purchase in the United States. Both companies indicated to the publication they planned to relaunch sales sometime this year.\n\nHowever, as pointed out in a recent United Kingdom-based study, while there have been many academic papers about the opportunities for lab-grown meat, comparatively little academic work has been done to assess how its introduction to the market might affect farming.\n\n\"Cultured Meat & Farmers\" is a two-year study published in the journal \"Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems\" that looked at UK farmers' attitudes about cultured meat and its potential opportunities and risks. One of the chief concerns cited by those interviewed were how its sale would impact small farms and rural communities, in particular. In the interviews, there is also an undercurrent of distrust towards the quality of the product, a fear shared shared by many farmers and ranchers in the United States (and, as indicated by the \"slop\" comment, by American politicians as well). In an interview with KOAA News5 in Colorado, Garrett Balsick, the owner of BK Ranch, raised questions about lab-grown meat's quality in comparison to natural beef.\n\n\"It doesn't even make sense to me why someone would want to eat that,\" Balsick said. \"For us as humans to think that we can make a product better than God can is interesting.\"\n\nIs a lab-grown steak more dangerous to American consumers than a caffeine-packed soda spiked with artificial sweeteners and \"forever chemicals\"? Are nuggets made with lab-grown chicken a more questionable choice than, say, milk from a cow that's been fed ground-up chicken waste, a common practice which experts say may be contributing to the spread of bird flu? And, even if so, is Big Government infringing on the freedom of American citizens by telling them they can't toss a lab-grown burger on the grill?\n\nThese are the questions the growing calls to \"protect meat\" raise and they deserve real, nuanced answers -- something a blunt-force ban, even one that enjoys bipartisan support, doesn't seem to provide.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com",

It's bad economics.", "body": "Actually, it's been a bad decade for libertarianism. \"No, it's been a bad century,\" a devout libertarian might counter, accurately enough.\n\nStill, things seem to be going especially badly when the Libertarian Party excitedly announces as a guest speaker at its upcoming convention a guy who relishes tariffs, resents immigration and has taken to chattering lately about deploying the U.S. military domestically if he's elected president again.\n\nThe Libertarian Party has often been a poor servant to thoughtful libertarianism. It's always had trouble resisting the temptation to ally itself with candidates who aren't very libertarian in practice in hopes of gaining a wider audience. It's also always had a major kook problem, one that's gotten worse over the last few years as alt-righters have gained influence within the organization. Inviting Donald Trump to the convention feels like the culmination of both trends simultaneously.\n\nThat wasn't the worst moment for libertarianism last week, though.\n\nThe worst moment came on Wednesday when the second-most popular populist in the GOP made an exciting announcement of his own. No more will the scourge of meat grown in labs trouble the Sunshine State, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared. Henceforth, producing or selling the stuff is an honest-to-goodness crime punishable by up to 60 days in jail.\n\nIf you want to make a living peddling meat in Florida, you had better be hacking off pieces of a cow, pig or chicken. Which made it not just a grim week for libertarians in the GOP but an unusually grim one for animals as well.\n\nRFK Jr. can't win. But he and Cornel West could put Trump back in the White House.\n\nI often write about the excesses of populism and that's what Florida's new law demonstrates, in spades. With unusual efficiency, it combines the most loathsome elements of the sort of New Right politics that DeSantis has embraced to get ahead in his party. It's imperious, protectionist, deeply corrupt and panders to the paranoia that animates so much of the GOP's crankish base.\n\nAmid the crimes, coup attempts and general amorality, it's a nice reminder that populism is terrible for mundane policy reasons as well.\n\nEvery conservative will have the same intuition about Florida's dumb law. If there are people willing to try lab-grown meat (and there assuredly are) and there are people willing to sell it to them, by what right does the government interfere in that transaction?\n\nIn the \"free state of Florida,\" why shouldn't residents be free to participate in a market for \"fake meat\"?\n\nThe only good answer I can think of would involve safety concerns with the product. But there aren't any. Even if there were, those concerns might plausibly be addressed by regulating production rather than criminalizing it.\n\nNor is DeSantis seriously arguing that lab-grown meat poses a grave public health risk: How could he when just two companies have received Food and Drug Administration approval to produce the stuff, and neither one has stock available for purchase anywhere in the United States?\n\nFlorida's law is a solution in search of a problem, as bad legislation often is.\n\nThe pre-Trump \"Tea Party\" version of DeSantis would agree with all of that emphatically, I suspect. The post-Trump populist version not only sees no problem with state paternalism in this matter, he reveled in it with authoritarian bombast at Wednesday's news conference.\n\n\"Take your fake lab-grown meat elsewhere. We're not doing that in the state of Florida,\" the governor crowed at one point. At another, he compared eating the meat to eating insects and sneered that \"Florida has heard enough on that.\"\n\nIndividual Floridians could decide for themselves whether they've \"heard enough.\" Why does DeSantis Augustus feel obliged to decide for them?\n\nThis episode reveals an ideological fault line between the two factions of the right. Conservatives believe that the government should override individual agency when a compelling public interest requires it to do so. Populists seem to believe that advancing a right-wing cultural agenda is always a compelling interest - even in cases like this one where the specific interest in question is anything but compelling.\n\nNeedless to say, that populist license to behave imperiously runs only one way. If President Joe Biden signed a law passed by a Democratic Congress banning meat and declared that \"we\" Americans have \"heard enough\" about eating animals, the New Right's indignation at his contempt for individual agency would erupt like Krakatoa.\n\nDeSantis' own remarks illustrate the point. Compare his disdain for the fact that the World Economic Forum recommends eating insects to reduce carbon emissions with his obliviousness to his own petty authoritarianism in banning lab-grown meat. At least the WEF is offering you a choice. In Florida, the governor chooses for you.\n\nIt would be bad enough if the \"fake meat\" ban were merely pointless and authoritarian, but it's also terrible economic policy. It will be terrible for Florida and it might be terrible for America, depending on how many other red states are foolish enough to follow DeSantis' lead. But it's terrible any way you slice it.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is that other Republicans emulate Florida and start banning the production and sale of \"fake meat\" in their own backyards.\n\n\"This bill sends a terrible message to the investors, scientists, and entrepreneurs that have built America's global leadership in alternative proteins,\" one executive at a company producing lab-grown meat told Green Queen, a website focusing on decarbonizing food systems.\n\nThe fact that the United States isn't aggressively producing cultivated meat won't stop global competitors like China from doing so, and so jobs and dollars will flow there instead.\n\nEventually, we'll either be dependent on imports to meet domestic demand, or U.S. legislative efforts to choke off the global supply will succeed well enough to kill a promising industry in its crib. Thank Ron DeSantis and the Florida Legislature if it happens: The \"free state of Florida,\" forever boasting of its dynamism, will have led the way.\n\nBut wait. It gets worse.\n\nFlorida's \"fake meat\" ban is actually a grotesquely brazen case of rent-seeking lightly disguised in culture-war trappings to make it more palatable to populist suckers.\n\nThere's nothing more high-minded behind the ban than shielding the state's 15,000 cattle ranchers from competitive pressure, and DeSantis' administration isn't straining to pretend otherwise.\n\n\"We must protect our incredible farmers and the integrity of American agriculture,\" Florida's agriculture commissioner said in a news release. \"Lab-grown meat is a disgraceful attempt to undermine our proud traditions and prosperity, and is in direct opposition to authentic agriculture.\"\n\nThe governor himself was explicit about the ban's protectionist intentions. \"What we're protecting here is the (cattle) industry against acts of man, against an ideological agenda that wants to finger agriculture as the problem, that views things like raising cattle as destroying our climate,\" DeSantis said at his news conference, reminding the audience that Florida has \"one of the top cattle industries in the country.\"\n\nExactly why that industry should be \"protected\" from a competitor that potentially might produce more jobs, more wealth, fewer hungry people and a better environment is unclear except for the fact that Big Ag has vastly more money and political influence than the nascent \"fake meat\" industry does.\n\nTo grasp how grim the state of the GOP is under the leadership of Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, meditate on the fact that the following quote came from a Democrat rather than a Republican: \"I don't think the state of Florida should be choosing winners and losers and allow corporate capture to take place, where we're basically bending laws to benefit specific industries,\" state Rep. Anna Eskamani said in March about banning lab-grown meat.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app? Download it for free from your app store.\n\nStill, even a politician as popular and powerful as DeSantis will struggle to sell a policy to his base if he can't find a justification more stirring than \"I've been bought and sold by a special interest.\"\n\nTrump understands that, too, per his recent flip-flop on banning TikTok. He claimed that his newfound opposition to the ban is a matter of not wanting the dastardly Big Tech progressives at Facebook to benefit from having one of their chief competitors go dark in America, but the likely truth about his reversal is far more mundane. Culture war is a wonderful fig leaf for financial motives. Ask any populist demagogue with a presence online.\n\nI confess to being biased about all of this.\n\nNot in the sense that I dislike DeSantis and his brand of politics, although I do. And not in the sense that I love animals and would greatly prefer to see fewer of them killed for my dinner, although that's also true.\n\nI'm biased because I live in Texas. And increasingly, novel-ish technologies that were traditionally championed by the left and scoffed at by the right are keeping me and other Texans alive.\n\nHate Texas? Get over it. Why so many people are moving to the Lone Star State.\n\nIf the power grid in this state ever goes down during one of our infernal summers, many people will die. The heat is indescribable, routinely above 100 degrees for months on end. And with Americans moving here in droves every year, the odds of that grid failure happening are theoretically rising. More people means more demand for electricity means more stress on the grid.\n\nBut it hasn't happened yet. And the reason it hasn't happened is because green energy - wind and solar - is meeting the rising demand and then some.\n\nTexas, America's paradigmatic red state, is now one of the country's most robust producers of wind and solar energy. That surge in production kept the grid stable last summer as the state melted under relentless heat and power demand reached record levels.\n\nIf Republican lawmakers in Texas had treated green energy the way DeSantis is treating \"fake meat,\" demagoguing it on populist grounds as some sort of hippie cultural affront to \"tradition\" or whatever, the state would be unlivable for months each year.

Jay Collins (R-Tampa), the sponsor of the bill, told The Epoch Times that \"it feels good\" to know the bill will soon take effect.\n\nHe noted that proponents of lab-grown meat cannot conclusively prove that the product is safe to consume and ignore evidence that its more harmful to the environment than the cows they want to eliminate.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's not cost ineffective. The ethical dilemmas, the food safety dilemmas, and the long-term efficacy and health safety for our people, it's just not worth it,\" he said.\n\nNow that Florida has taken the first step to ban the controversial meat substitute, he believes other states will follow.\n\n\"When you shine a light on this, it doesn't matter if you're a Democrat of a Republican. Almost everybody has the same thought when you talk about this. 'That's creepy. It's gross. I don't want to feed my family this. Is this safe?' That's a problem,\" Rep. Collins suggested.\n\n\"This is a really big deal,\" he told The Epoch Times.\n\nFood establishments that manufacture, distribute, or sell lab-grown meat found to be in violation of the law can be shut down and the owners can be fined and suffer jail time.\n\nIn addition, restaurants, stores or any other businesses caught selling fake meat will be subject to an \"immediate stop-sale order\" and could lose their operating license upon conviction.\n\n\"This is your state government standing up and saying, 'If you want to come in and have access to our citizens, you've got to prove to us that this completely novel concept doesn't have any significant or long-term safety issues for our people, and if we're going to allow you to do that, we're going to make sure we're putting our people in front of your profit,\" he said.\n\nHe described how the pressure he was subjected to by both individuals and highly paid lobbyists in the pro-cultured meat camp \"was borderline disgusting.\"\n\nRequests to provide evidence that the product is safe for human consumption was met with that it was approved by the federal government.\n\nRep. Alvarez noted that this same federal government approved the COVID-19 vaccines and said smoking, saccharin, and Vioxx were safe.\n\nHe is also convinced that the push for fake meat has nothing to do with mitigating climate change.\n\n\"This is absolutely profit driven because they have a new product on the market that they're cornering. Good for them,\" he said. \"But to believe that climate change or animal safety are the drivers behind this you would have to be absurdly uninformed.\"\n\n\"It's not a panacea,\" he explained, and while it might be possible to reduce the environmental impact of lab-grown meat production in the future, Mr. Spang said it will \"require significant technical advancement to simultaneously increase the performance and decrease the cost of the cell culture media.\"\n\nAccording to Rep. Alvarez, more research is need.\n\nIn an interview with The Epoch Times, Florida Agricultural Commissioner Wilton Simpson said that knowing the law will take effect very soon is \"very encouraging for our farmers.\"\n\nAs Mr. Simpson explained, the main goal is not only to protect Florida's farmers, but to maintain the state's supply chain to make sure that Florida can provide the \"the most safe, abundant, and affordable food anywhere in the world.\"\n\n\"This bill helps us obtain those goals,\" he said.\n\nHe, too, believes the push for synthetic meat is about profit, not about protecting the environment, explaining that the more someone researches the push for lab-grown meat the more they realize the supporters behind the effort are \"very wealthy businesspeople trying to corner the market on a product and sell it through an ideology.\"\n\nBill Gates has been a major investor in Upside Foods since its launch in 2017.\n\nMr. Simpson also suggested that the pressure put on Florida's farmers by national politics and Environmental, Social and Governance policies is almost overwhelming.\n\n\"There is a delicate balance and a tipping point where your [state agriculture] can no longer survive the regulations put out by the federal government,\" he said.\n\nMr. Simpson said he isn't surprised that Florida's cattle herd has shrunk. What does surprise him is that there are people who believe eating a piece of synthetic meat grown from a biomass and served from a 3-D printer is safer than eating traditionally farmed meat.\n\nDecimating Florida's cattle herd to make way for fake meat would be \"a terrible mistake,\" which he believes would be regretted later.\n\nJust as it will take many years for Florida's citrus industry to recover from greening, he said, it would take many years to overcome such a profound deficit in the state's cattle herd.\n\n\"In Florida, we're not going to allow the disruption of our net supply chain,\" Mr. Simpson asserted. \"We're not going to be guinea pigs for the leftist-ideas of net-zero, and yesterday we went a long way to prove that, and everybody knows it.\"", "source":

With that in mind, the campaign calls on consumers to \"solve the meat problem with more meat\" -- namely, the plant-based alternatives that the company sells.\n\n\"We see this campaign as a way to let meat eaters know Impossible meat is the best way to keep eating meat you love, just without a lot of the problems associated with animal meat. Whether you're a vegan, hardcore meat eater or somewhere in between, we have you covered. The more believers we bring on board, the better the planet will be,\" said Leslie Sims, Impossible's chief marketing and creative officer, in a press release.\n\nThe campaign's 30-second hero spot, \"The Walk,\" follows a stereotypically mid-century all-American man as he makes Impossible's pitch while knocking burgers out of hands and food off of tables, replacing meat with plant-based alternatives. After walking through a backyard barbecue, a hot dog eating contest and a suburban home, the man encourages consumers to \"punch cholesterol in the face\" before getting on a motorbike and bursting through a wall.\n\nThe hero spot will debut today (May 6) during the \"Live from E!: Met Gala\" telecast. The campaign also includes product-focused 15- and 6-second ads that feature the brand's burgers, hot dogs, meatballs, nuggets and sausage patties. One spot features the same character as the hero spot manning a grill, explaining that Impossible made meat out of plants \"because we aren't quitters.\"\n\nImpossible over the next several months will integrate the campaign across consumer touchpoints and channels, including creator partnerships, in-store marketing, shoppable recipes and digital out-of-home in New York, Los Angeles and Atlanta. The effort is a collaboration between the brand's in-house team and creative agency Erich and Kallman, with a full-funnel media strategy by Horizon Media.\n\nThe campaign is the first effort under a new brand identity launched in March that keys in on the \"craveability of meat\" and uses bold red packaging to engage meat eaters with plant-based products. The refresh was created with branding agency Jones Knowles Ritchie, the agency behind several recent refreshes in the CPG space.\n\nImpossible Foods and rivals like Beyond Meat saw increased popularity during the pandemic, but have faced slumping sales as consumers have sought cheaper options.

Beyond Meat's stock shot up 163% on the day it went public in May 2019, marking the biggest one-day performance for a major American firm in almost two decades.\n\nThe Los Angeles-based company, along with its Californian neighbor Impossible Foods, had positioned itself at the forefront of a new protein market, giving the once-niche world of meat substitutes a Silicon Valley halo.

According to Barclays, the market would reach $140 billion by 2030, while the Boston Consulting Group made an even bolder prediction, estimating $290 billion by 2035.\n\nDespite the rise in popularity in the past few years, alternative sources of \"meat\" are not new. In fact, they date back to the early 1900s, when Kellogg controlled a food company that marketed Protose, a soy, peanut, and wheat gluten alternative for meat. Protose was discontinued by Kellogg in 2000 but the company is still credited with being well ahead of its time.\n\nProtose, like Beyond and Impossible, is an example of a 'second-generation' plant-based meat substitute, whereas traditional foods such as tofu and tempeh are considered 'first-generation.' While 'first-generation' alternatives are high in protein, they don't have much in common with meat. Conversely, 'second generation' alternatives are made to resemble meat in terms of appearance, texture, and flavor.\n\nThe intention of the alternatives' likeness to real meat was to appeal to omnivores and 'flexitarians,' or those who eat meat but wish to reduce their intake for health or environmental reasons.\n\nSo, what spiked the recent infatuation with these \"second-generation\" alternatives? Plant-based meat companies like Impossible, Beyond Meat, and Gardein saw a 45% increase in sales in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and at-home isolation, when many consumers experimented with new foods and recipes.\n\nAdditionally, rising concern about climate change signaled the beginning of a new era in plant-based meat eating, and it appeared as if everyone would soon be consuming steaks, chicken fingers, and hamburgers made entirely out of veggies.\n\nThere is no denying the benefits that plant-based meat alternatives have on the environment. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, livestock production accounts for 11% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, two-thirds of which come from cattle. In fact, producing 100 grams of protein from beef releases about 25 kg of greenhouse gasses into the environment, whereas producing the same quantity of tofu releases just 1.6 kg.\n\nOverall, plant-based meats produce 40-90% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than traditional meats. But every journey has its bumps, and plant-based meat encountered its first in 2021, when sales reached a plateau and began to decline. In the last 18 months, the price of Beyond Meat's shares has dropped by about 80% while Impossible has been laying off staff. Thus, the plant-based meat category isn't doing as well as anticipated, despite growing environmental concerns and the nearly 25% of Americans who say they have reduced their meat consumption.\n\nIn our view, plant-based proteins still have a lot of room to expand, even though consumer excitement for vegan meat substitutes appears to be waning. However, it's evident that consumers, especially those outside of the US, are still willing to adopt more plant-based diets if given some encouragement from governments, even with the industry's hype-boom-bust cycle.\n\nAt Rethink Food, we believe there are four interrelated factors driving the category's lackluster performance:\n\nWords have meaning but names have power, and we would argue that 'plant-based meats' does not accomplish that for the category. This appears to be a classic case of marketing being left out of the process early. The scientists and entrepreneurs filled the void, and all of a sudden the category was named in a way that Marketing 101 students are taught never to do - naming the category after what it is, and not for the consumer benefit it provides.\n\nThe consequence is that if you're a died-in-the-wool meat eater, something called 'plant-based' is always going to feel less than. It's no different than the 'diet' soft drink trend of the 1980s which now represents the steepest declining sub-category of soft drinks. 'Plant-based' is not compelling to meat eaters because it intrinsically communicates that they are making a compromise; with meat eaters representing 89% of the US population, this is who the category desperately needs to convert to have any real environmental impact.\n\nInversely, for vegans or vegetarians, while the 'plant-based' prefix is music to their ears, the 'meat' part isn't, further illustrating the disconnect with the main target\n\naudience.\n\nIt may be too late, but we think the category needs a new lexicon, something like 'sustainable proteins,' that appeals to both audiences.\n\nThere's a simple factor that all new foods must adhere to in order to be successful - it must taste good. Consumers are prepared to compromise on many things (calories, cost, packaging) but taste is not one of them. The taste of existing plant-based meat products hasn't quite developed to the point where consumers crave it.\n\nThe Good Food Institute's research demonstrates that when it comes to alternative meats, customers are most concerned about taste. Consumer studies show that 53% of consumers agree that plant-based meat products \"should taste just like meat.\"\n\nThis taste gap was widened by the industry's desire to start with meat apologues like the burger, one of the most iconic and widely consumed menu items in American culture. Consumers have habituated to what the taste, texture, and appearance of a standard hamburger has been over decades. So, why did the industry choose a burger as the starting point? Why not create a new form factor to excite consumers and begin the journey to beefless meats?\n\nTake for example the chicken nugget or the sandwich wrap. Someone once invented these form factors and consumers trialed them with little expectation of taste and experience because they had nothing to compare them to. It's our view that a way to reignite the plant-based protein category is to move away from meat analogs and begin creating a range of new food form factors that consumers have no existing expectations for.\n\nWhile the shift may require some time, we believe it will ultimately be a more successful approach. Then, after the technology has been refined, the industry can move on to trying to replicate burgers, sausages, bacon, etc.\n\nAlthough plant-based meats do avoid some of the drawbacks of eating real meat, claiming that it's significantly healthier is a long bow to draw. While the industry didn't make misleading claims about plant-based meats being healthier per se, it also didn't correct the erroneous reports and internet myths that it was.\n\nA lot of substitute meats have a lengthy ingredient list, especially those that are pre-made to resemble bacon, sausages, or burgers. In fact, some experts would argue that plant-based meats belong to the class of 'ultra-processed' foods, which a lot of people link to health issues and weight gain. This notion puts the stereotypical plant-based meat customer in a tricky situation - in addition to wanting more environmentally conscious options, those who seek out plant-based options are also inclined to desire healthy meals made of basic ingredients.\n\nA study by Deloitte found that when given the option, consumers often choose health over sustainability. Thus, new technologies, improved manufacturing techniques, and cleaner labels will ultimately be required for plant-based foods to reach mass adoption. At Rethink Food, we are actively searching for solutions to provide these technical unlocks.\n\nThe Good Food Institute reports that the cost of plant-based meat is still far higher than that of conventional beef. While this is to be expected in any new category until it reaches sufficient scale, cost combined with the aforementioned factors will continue to be a barrier for the trial and adoption of plant-based meats across the broader market.\n\nThe current state of the alternative meat sector is not without its issues. It costs more than ordinary meat and falls short on the factors described above. Consumers still believe meat to be better than alternative meats in practically every way, including flavor and appearance. But it will take some time to iron out those issues, just like with any emerging technology.\n\nThe Good Food Institute founder and president, Bruce Friedrich, compares giving up on alternative proteins to \"abandoning solar in 1986 or electric vehicles in 2003.\" With time for research and development, alternative proteins are expected to improve in terms of taste and affordability. It will take time to change the millennia-old eating habits of humans. It will also take the major industry players making a mind shift from having \"competitors\" to having \"frenemies\" - working together to build the category, rather than suing each other. A rising tide lifts all boats. They can fight about market share once there is a market.\n\nAs Fast Company pointed out, the reality is that the plant-based meat industry is still in its infancy, but in the short time it has existed, it has achieved a great deal. Plant-based meats have entered national chains like CVS and Costco, partnered with some of the most well-known restaurants in the world like Burger King and KFC, and (perhaps most impressive of all) convinced meat lovers who have always eaten meat to give it a try.\n\nIf not for anything else, we should all support the success of plant-based meat for its positive environmental impact. The evidence is apparent: compared to a typical beef burger, the production of an Impossible Burger requires 75% less water and 87% fewer greenhouse emissions, and the Beyond Burger requires 93% less land. In our view, the environmental impact alone should continue to anchor our enthusiasm and support for technological innovation in the sector.", "source": {"uri": "agfundernews.com", "dataType": "news",

The institute \"works alongside scientists, businesses and policymakers to make alternative proteins as delicious, affordable and accessible as conventional meat.\" But based on its report, the GFI is seemingly failing to achieve its stated goal.\n\nIt found that six in 10 American families bought at least one plant-based alternative product in 2023. Eighty-one percent of that cohort were repeat customers, proving that those who bought plant-based substitutes in previous years continued to do so.\n\nDespite this, plant-based meat companies failed to entice new customers. \"Household penetration\" rates fell across the sector, indicating that new customers are less interested in trying plant-based proteins. Plant-based meat, for example, was only able to penetrate 14 percent of households in 2023 - five points lower than the 19 percent of households penetrated in 2022.\n\nAccording to GFI, unit sales were down nine percent in 2023. Meanwhile, dollar sales fell by two percent in the same year. This ultimately translated to a loss of value for the American plant-based food market, dropping from $8.2 billion in 2022 to $8.1 billion in 2023.\n\n\"Plant-based meat sales declined more sharply than plant-based food sales overall, and surveys of lapsed customers showed that plant-based meat products are largely not meeting consumer expectations - particularly regarding taste, texture and price,\" wrote the report's editors Caroline Bushnell, Liz Specht and Jessica Almy.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

People are voting with their wallets when it comes to fake meat, ignoring such products in groceries.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, major companies in the fake meat sector such as Beyond Meat have seen a rapid decline in value since the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Shares of the Los Angeles-based Beyond Meat once sold at $186.83 per share in 2021. But as of April 29, 2024, its stock was only trading at $6.72. (Related: Fake meat firms collapsing due to lower sales, anti-woke backlash.)\n\nThis sentiment against fake meat has been going on for some time - and for good reasons. According to Herculean Strength, \"the supposedly healthier plant-based alternatives ... [fail] to provide even a fraction of the nutritional value of [real] meat.\" Worse, the fake versions \"are loaded with phytoestrogens and metabolically toxic vegetable oils.\"\n\n\"Much of the anti-meat agenda isn't presenting its case in good faith. Correspondingly, meat alternatives such as soy, 3D printed steaks and bugs are furiously promoted to serve a greater agenda.\"\n\nBack in May 2021, the non-profit No Meat May polled 1,000 Australians about their attitudes toward meat. It found that 73 percent of male respondents - almost three-fourths - would rather shave off 10 years from their lives than give up meat.\n\nMeanwhile, another study from the same period found that consumers were not switching to plant-based alternatives without massive social pressure. Herculean Strength noted that the powers that be are building up this pressure on fake meat skeptics, remarking that \"the media has barraged readers with guilt-tripping articles on why meat should be eliminated.\"\n\nCheck out FakeMeat.news for more stories about plant-based meats and other products being pushed to replace real food.\n\nWatch Jefferey Jaxen and Del Bigtree discussing the free fall

The campaign -- which comes as grilling season heats up -- features a backyard barbeque, hot dog eating contest and a burger joint to push the notion that \"plants can be meat.\"\n\n\"People know that they should eat less meat but they want that emotional reaction,\" said Leslie Sims, Impossible Foods' chief marketing officer. \"We are not a meat replacement, we're meat too, just made from plants and we like to challenge that convention.\"\n\nThe ads are narrated from the perspective of a male meat eater, who presents a call to action for meat eaters to eat more burgers, hot dogs and meatballs, just made from plants.\n\nThe brand earlier this year changed its packaging from teal green to red as a way to blend into the meat aisle and associate the brand with red meatiness.\n\nThe creative\n\nThe spots, from Erich and Kallman, have an Americana feel, with one scene showing a family-style meal of a big bowl of spaghetti and meatballs. The campaign also has several 15-second spots that feature different Impossible products, including chicken nuggets, burgers, hot dogs and sausage patties.\n\n\"Meat lovers don't have to be meat quitters,\" Eric Kallman, co-founder and chief creative officer at Erich and Kallman, said in a statement. To showcase the products' similar attributes \"we presented Impossible meat being devoured in the same ways -- with the same enjoyment -- as traditional meat, challenging preconceived notions of what makes meat 'meat' and giving them a reason to try it themselves.\"\n\nThe insight\n\nThe campaign's tone is built on messaging lessons learned from Impossible Foods' last campaign, \"Making Meat History,\" a 90-second musical spot about the history of meat from Terry Crews' agency Super Serious that ran during last year's Tony Awards. Part of that campaign featured side-by-side comparisons of a real burger and an Impossible one.\n\nThe comparison ads resonated more with meat eaters, and the brand realized it could do more to highlight the similarities between traditional and plant-based meat.\n\n\"We took everything from last year and did rigorous message testing, and our takeaway was that meat-eaters, in a consistent way, knew we were talking to them, and that we could lean on that message more,\" said Sims. \"For this latest campaign, we wanted to have a clear value proposition for them -- you love meat, so why not try us and be better for the planet?\"\n\nIn the lead ad, the environmental message is very understated, with the lead male character merely acknowledging that \"meat has problems.\" The health messaging is more apparent -- he urges people to \"punch cholesterol in the face.\"\n\n\"The tone is supposed to have a light tongue-in-cheek humor,\" Sims said. \"We are talking to hard-core meat eaters, but we don't want to be preachy.\"\n\nMedia strategy\n\nThe campaign will run on linear and streaming TV, digital, social media and billboards in New York, Atlanta and Los Angeles. Media buys for the campaign were handled by Horizon Media.\n\nThe campaign will debut during E!'s Met Gala red carpet show tonight -- the Gala over-indexes with Impossible customers, according to the brand.\n\n\"We will run ads during the red carpet and will have a presence on the ground at the Mark Hotel,\" said Sims. \"The Met theme this year is the 'garden of time,' so we will have the 'garden of meat.'\"\n\nThe brand will serve Impossible sliders with brie and truffle aioli, and passion fruit barbecue Impossible chicken nuggets.\n\nBusiness climate\n\nSales of plant-based meats have remained hampered in the last few years by consumers reverting to pre-pandemic eating habits, higher prices and continued skepticism around taste and texture, according to Mintel's 2023 U.S. plant-based proteins market report. There may be potential for growth as inflation cools and if plant-based alternatives appeal to health-conscious consumers.\n\nAccording to Sims, Impossible will track by how much the campaign increases household penetration and the brand's unaided awareness score.\n\n\"We are at around 7% household penetration and 22% on our unaided awareness score,\" she said. \"We still have a lot of upside there, so while the primary focus is sales, we want to increase those other numbers.\"\n\nAccording to CEO Peter McGuinness, privately-held Impossible Foods is considering an IPO or selling to another company in the next few years.

This technology involves growing meat from animal cells within a bioreactor, bypassing traditional livestock farming and its associated environmental and ethical concerns. Worldwide, the cultivated meat industry has garnered significant interest for its potential to slash pollution, drastically reduce land and water usage, improve animal welfare, and eliminate the need for antibiotics, hormones, and chemicals often prevalent in conventional meat production processes.\n\nTo date, three countries have granted approval for the commercial sale of cultivated meat - Singapore (2020), the United States (2023) and Israel (2024). As the process becomes ever more cost-effective and technologically mature, many other nations are expected to follow suit.\n\nThe benefits are numerous and potentially world-changing - up to 96% lower greenhouse gas emissions, 96% lower water use, and 99% lower land use than conventional meat, according to one study.\n\nMeanwhile, billions of animals could be saved from slaughter each year, including chickens (58,110,000,000), ducks (2,817,000,000), pigs (1,383,000,000), turkeys (654,000,000), geese and guineafowl (649,000,000), sheep (517,000,000), goats (430,000,000), cattle (296,000,000) and bison (24,000,000), a total of almost 65 billion, or more than 2,000 per second.\n\nIf adopted globally, vast areas of land, as well as the oceans, could be restored to their natural, pre-industrial state. Disease risks from bacterial contamination, antibiotic resistance, and zoonotic diseases, which are often associated with conventional animal farming and meat processing, would be substantially reduced.\n\nWith its many advantages, massive growth potential, and improved choice for consumers, this is surely a technology worth pursuing, right? Not according to Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\nWhile the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the commercial sale of cultivated meat in June 2023, Florida is now taking its own measures at the state level. Governor DeSantis has signed off Senate Bill 1084 (SB 1084), aimed at \"prohibiting the manufacture for sale, sale, holding or offering for sale, or distribution of cultivated meat in this state.\"\n\nIn a statement from his press office, the DeSantis administration rails against the World Economic Forum (WEF) and claims it has a goal of \"forcing\" the world to eat lab\u2011grown meat and insects. In addition to the ban, several measures will be enacted to provide government support to the state's existing agriculture and meat industry, such as the protection of 36,000 acres of farmland, and more than $2.8 billion going into the Framework for Freedom Budget.\n\n\"Today, Florida is fighting back against the global elite's plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals,\" said Mr. DeSantis. \"Our administration will continue to focus on investing in our local farmers and ranchers, and we will save our beef.\"\n\n\"Florida is taking a tremendous step in the right direction by signing first-in-the-nation legislation banning lab-grown meat,\" said Wilton Simpson, the Florida Commissioner of Agriculture. \"We must protect our incredible farmers and the integrity of American agriculture. Lab-grown meat is a disgraceful attempt to undermine our proud traditions and prosperity, and is in direct opposition to authentic agriculture. I applaud Governor DeSantis, Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, House Speaker Paul Renner, Senator Jay Collins, and Representative Danny Alvarez for standing up for Florida's farmers and consumers. Together, we will keep Florida's agricultural industry strong and thriving.\"\n\nGood Meat, the world's first company to sell lab-grown meat, expressed disappointment via X, stating: \"In a state that purportedly prides itself on being a land of freedom and individual liberty, its government is now telling consumers what meat they can or cannot purchase.\"\n\nWhile many Republicans may be celebrating, this legislation now positions Florida at the forefront of another culture war and could trigger a national debate over the future of food technology, raising questions about the balance between innovation and regulation. Similar efforts are already underway in the states of Alabama, Arizona, and Tennessee, highlighting the broader implications of this issue across the country.\n\nWhat do you think about Governor Ron DeSantis' decision to ban lab-grown meat in Florida?

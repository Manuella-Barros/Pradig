Scheffler, who finished last week's major tournament at 8-over par, detailed some of the issues he encountered at Pinehurst.\n\nHe said he didn't have his \"best stuff\" in the competition and struggled with course management due to the nature of the grass. Scheffler considered the event a \"great test of golf.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScheffler tied for 41st at the U.S. Open, marking his worst outing of a dominant 2024 campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It challenged us in all the right ways. You had to hit great shots in order to hold the greens. Around the greens you always had some sort of shot because you're playing out of the short grass,\" Scheffler said. \"So I think sometimes when the rough is really heavy you see guys playing the same shot over and over again. And a ball that runs through the green goes the same distance over the green as a ball that barely trickles.

In fact, Scheffler didn't even finish in the top 10, like he had in his previous 11 starts entering the week (five of which were wins).\n\nNow he's in Cromwell, Conn., for the Travelers Championship at TPC River Highlands, a Signature Event this year. That means a better field and a bigger purse. It also means a different style of golf course than what we saw at Pinehurst No. 2. And Scheffler, based on what he said last week and on Wednesday at the Travelers, is OK with that.\n\nThree days removed from his final round of the U.S. Open, Scheffler was asked how he'd characterize his week. He smiled, before admitting: \"long.\"\n\n\"Just a long week,\" he continued. \"I would say it's a tough week. I didn't have my best stuff and that's a pretty difficult golf course to try and make a lot of birdies and play some good golf around when you don't have your best stuff. I think that's how I would characterize it.\"\n\nSpeaking to the media on Sunday, Scheffler said playing the Memorial at a style of course like Muirfield Village \"probably was not the best prep work for me coming into another really challenging event.\" (Despite him winning it.) He struggled on Pinehurst's difficult, crowned Donald Ross greens all week.\n\nHe ranked 70th in Strokes Gained: Putting and never made more than 65-feet worth of putts in any round.\n\n\"When we come back here in a few years [in 2029], I'll probably try to do a lot more work getting things going on the greens,\" Scheffler said Sunday. \"I felt like I did a lot of my work around the greens this week, and maybe I needed to do more -- the practice greens weren't the same speed as the course, and it was hard to find something similar.\"\n\nAnother element that set Pinehurst apart from other typical PGA Tour or major courses was its pesky wire grass that dotted the sandy areas off the fairways. If players entered there, sometimes it was manageable. Other times, it was not.\n\n\"When I'm not playing my best I feel like one of my skills is kind of managing my way around the golf course knowing where the misses are. When you have pretty much a coin flip on whether or not you're going to have a swing or not there's not really a side of the fairway to miss it on, there's not really areas you can play to, you just have to hit great golf shots,\" Scheffler said Wednesday. \"And when you're not hitting it great, you know, I feel like that's why I'm usually able to compete when I don't have my best stuff is the way I kind of manage my way around the golf course, and last week you're just not able to do that, just with the nature of the grass. Because you could hit it a foot off the fairway and be in a bush, and you could hit it 20 yards off the fairway and have a perfect lie that you're -- and it plays like you're in the fairway.\n\n\"So that part of the course I didn't love, but fairway to greens, I thought it was fantastic. I thought it was a great test of golf,\" he continued. \"It challenged us in all the right ways. You had to hit great shots in order to hold the greens. Around the greens you always had some sort of shot because you're playing out of the short grass. So I think sometimes when the rough is really heavy you see guys playing the same shot over and over again. And a ball that runs through the green goes the same distance over the green as a ball that barely trickles. And when it's all runoff areas that are tightly mown you pay bigger penalty for a bigger miss, which I think as players that's all we're looking for is to have good shots rewarded and have bad shots punished accordingly to how bad they are.\"\n\nScheffler's T41 finish was his worst since he was T45 at the 2022 CJ Cup, which was nearly 50 tournaments ago.\n\nBut now he's moved on to the Travelers, the last Signature Event of the season; he's already won three of them. And although Scheffler has yet to win at TPC River Highlands, his caddie has. Three times. Ted Scott was on the bag for all three of Bubba Watson's Travelers wins.\n\n\"He always reminds me of that,\" Scheffler joked.\n\nScheffler is paired with Max Homa for the first two rounds of the Travelers.

Quite a few things, though, line up to make him a favorite to add this trophy to his crowded case.\n\nFor one, he's the favorite everywhere he steps off a cart these days. For another, his his caddy, Ted Scott, guided Bubba Watson to three victories at the TPC River Highlands.\n\n\"He always reminds me of that,\" Scheffler said, laughing it up as he finished his 9-hole Pro Am on Wednesday.\n\n\"... I lean pretty heavily on Ted week-to-week. This is a golf course that he's had a lot of success on, so if there's a difference of opinion I'm probably going to lean towards him a little bit more than myself, just because I haven't had the success on this golf course specifically. A different tournament I may lean more to what I feel and think, whereas out here he really does a good job of managing around this golf course. \"\n\nXander Schauffele tests new-look TPC, puts himself in Rory McIlroy's shoes at Travelers Championship\n\nScott, a caddy for 24 years, has long been a champions' whisperer, working with Paul Azinger for a Ryder Cup victory, then with Watson for 15 years. When they parted company, Scott was going to retire from caddying and focus on coaching, but he hooked up with the fiery, talented Scheffler in 2021. Between Watson and Scheffler, Scott has caddied for four Masters victories. He and Scheffler have been an insanely successful duo, as Scheffler rose to No. 1 early in 2022 and has won 14 times.\n\n\"I think of another place, Augusta is kind of like that, where whatever he says seems to kind of go for me in my head,\" Scheffler said, \"just because he's had the success, he has the pedigree, he knows where to put the ball and where not to put the ball. And especially when it comes to a lot of course management stuff. Clubs to choose off the tees, what areas to play into, just because, like you said, he has seen Bubba win here numerous times and he knows exactly I think how to kind of get me there, if that make sense.\"\n\nScheffler, 27, missed the cut at the Travelers in 2020, then tied for 47th, tied for 14th and tied for fourth the last three years. Though he has cooled off in May and June, he has feasted on the talent-rich Signature Events in 2024, part of a record $24 million in earnings, and no one can be considered a more formidable golfer chasing the $3.6-million winner's prize here this week on the new-look course.\n\nAt one point this season, Scheffler, averaging 5.22 birdies per round, shot 41 consecutive rounds of par or under, a streak that ended at the PGA Championship at Valhalla in Louisville, where he had the unfortunate misunderstanding with police, all charges later dropped, on his way past an accident scene into the course. He has been over par each of his last five rounds, that includes the U.S. Open at Pinehurst, with its high degree of difficulty, where he shot 8-over.\n\nCBS analyst Frank Nobilo dishes on Bryson DeChambeau, state of golf and the Travelers Championship field\n\n\"I didn't really think about it very much when I was shooting under par,\" he said, \"so I'm probably not going to think about it too much when I'm shooting over par. Just one of those deals. Like, I was playing good and I was able to survive kind of the harder golf courses.\"\n\nScheffler, a Jersey native, grew up in Texas and played for the Longhorns, so the intense heat expected in central Connecticut this week does not concern him. He has spent 92 weeks atop the world rankings since March 2022, when he rose to the top with three Tour wins in a seven-week span.\n\nThe Travelers is the last of the eight Signature Events, with their loaded fields and large purses, and these events have proven to be made for Scheffler, who has played in six of the first seven and finished in the top 10 each time, the top five four times and came out the winner at The Memorial, the RBC Heritage and the Arnold Palmer Invitational.\n\n\"As far as playing in the events, I think it's a great experience for the players,\" Scheffler said. \"Being able to play twosomes for the week is really nice, it's great for pace of play. Being able to play twosomes and playing a golf course like, this I'm sure we'll be definitely able to get in in under four hours. As far as playing multiple weeks in a row, having the ability to play twosomes makes it a lot easier to get guys around the golf course, especially if we're going to be asked to play numerous weeks in a row with these events. As far as the actual on-course product goes I think it's great to have the best players together as often as you can on our Tour, and how do you make that happen I think is an, it is the biggest question to ask, and how can we make that product the best for the fans.\"\n\nRecord-breaking US heat wave scorches the Midwest and Northeast, bringing safety measures\n\nNext stop for Scheffler will be the Olympics, where he will join Xander Schauffele, Wyndam Clark and Collin Morikawa on the U.S. team. Scheffler missed one Signature tournament for the birth of his son, Bennett. He has been able to have his wife, Meredith, and son close by as he has traveled the country living his best golfing life, winning, winning and winning some more.\n\n\"Fatherhood has been great,\" he said. \"It's really special to see him develop basically daily. It's so funny how excited you get. I actually realized when we about were going to dinner (Tuesday). We were riding in the car, dinner was about a half hour away, and I swear every minute I was like, 'Mare, look what he's doing, look at him.' It's like, after 15 minutes, it's like, all right you can probably stop telling your wife to look at her son, it's like not that big of a deal. But life's a lot different, but it's different in a great way and it's been a ton of fun.\"", "source": {"uri": "courant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hartfort Courant"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The wholesome sight was a stark contrast to the rattled World No. 1 who toiled away at Pinehurst just a week ago.\n\nSurreal scenes swept the US Open as Scheffler fell victim to the Pinehurst 'torture chamber' last week but as he strolled off the 18th green at The Travelers Championship Thursday, his North Carolina nightmare was nothing but a distant memory.\n\nUnlike Rory McIlroy, who withdrew from the final signature event of the season following his US Open collapse - likely in order to address the soap opera of his personal life - Scheffler brushed off his own implosion.\n\nFollowing the opening round at TPC River Highlands, it was clear that the US Open was a mere blip. For Scheffler, it was business as usual.\n\nAnd it's a business Scheffler knows all too well. The World No. 1 has won three of the seven PGA Tour's signature events so far this season and after the opening round of the latest, the chance of adding another to his trophy cabinet was in sight.\n\nScottie Scheffler was back to business at The Travelers Championship on Thursday\n\nThe World No. 1 brushed off his US Open nightmare at Pinehurst No. 2 last week\n\nAfter flirting with an early exit last week, Scheffler would have been grateful for the lack of a cut at the signature event. Not that the risk of repeat will be keeping him up Thursday night - that will likely be left to baby Bennett.\n\nFollowing his opening five-under 65, Scheffler was back in familiar territory, three shots off Tom Kim at the top of the leaderboard.\n\nHe rattled off a trio of birdies through the second, third and fourth to swiftly brush off the cobwebs left behind by Pinehurst. Yet old wounds looked set to be reopened, when he made the trip from bunker to bunker at the sixth, leaving a bogey blemish on his card.\n\nBut, just like his US Open catastrophe, it was a mere blip - one that was long forgotten by the 13th. Scheffler soared back up into contention with an eagle at the par-five, firing a rocket of a second shot 256 yards onto the green and sinking the seven-footer.\n\nThe birdie that followed at 14 sealed a share of sixth at five-under. Will he be ruing a few missed opportunities? Perhaps. But more likely, he'll be relieved to find himself back in the red - something he's not experienced since the third round of the Memorial.\n\nAfter shooting an opening 65, Scheffler was three shots off the top of the leaderboard\n\nThe American soared back up into contention with an eagle at the par-five 13th\n\nEarly risers, Akshay Bhatia, Rickie Fowler and Kurt Kitayama took advantage of the cooler morning to watch their rivals grind through the grueling heat from the safety of the air-conditioned clubhouse at six-under.\n\nAs temperatures soared to highs of 94 degrees, they were joined by Will Zalatoris, who, if not for a dropped shot at the par-three 16th, would have snatched the outright lead.\n\nInstead, it was Kim who leads alone after round one courtesy of a birdie-birdie flourish to finish his eight-under 62.\n\nScheffler was joined by PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele and Tony Finau among those five shots off Kim's pace.\n\nScheffler admitted Wednesday that the brutal setup of Pinehurst No. 2 had messed with his head last week, while mental fatigue was beginning to creep in amid the relentless schedule and high temperatures.\n\nBut in the New England furnace, the cool and collected Scheffler returned. A group of fans lined the first fairway dressed in shirts with his Louisville mugshot splashed across the front. It has become a familiar sight since his prison break at the US Open. As has the echo of calls to 'Free Scottie' - despite all charges against him long dropped.\n\nTom Kim leads The Travelers Championship after an opening round of eight-under\n\nYet, they didn't permeate his placid existence. Nor did the shouts of encouragement. Nor the jokes to be wary of the Cromwell cops walking with him and Max Homa. Not even the Boston Celtics fan taking aim at his beloved Dallas Mavericks seemed to rattle him. Under the baking heat, Scheffler kept his cool.\n\n'I wasn't chilly this morning, I'm definitely not chilly now,' he said of the heat. 'But it's different, because where I live - I looked at the weather for next week - it basically doesn't get below 80 degrees.\n\n'Here when you wake up there's a little bit of a break in the morning where it still feels cool. But, yeah, during the rest of the day it was definitely still pretty warm out there.'\n\nHe may say 'warm', others may say feverish but all debates aside, as the sun baked down on the greens of TPC River Highlands, one thing was indisputable - just like the sliver of cool morning air amid the Connecticut heat, the US Open was merely a reprieve for the rest of the field. Scheffler is back, and he's turning on the heat.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kim", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Kim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Kitayama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Kitayama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rickie Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Zalatoris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Zalatoris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Articles", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/20/21/86385325-0-image-m-15_1718916165289.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665528", "eventUri": "eng-9665528", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

He tied for 41st place and finished 14 strokes behind US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau last week at Pinehurst, North Carolina, snapping his streak of 11 straight top-10 finishes. His top-10 streak began at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am from Feb. 1-3 and included a Masters championship and four other wins.\n\nBut, it seems like the New Jersey native has suffered a dip in form ever since he was charged with second-degree assault of a police offer, which is a felony, and three misdemeanors - third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding traffic signal from a offer directing traffic - on May 17.\n\nScottie Scheffler arrived at the Travelers wit his wife - Meredith - and son - Bennet - on Thurs.\n\nThose charges were later dropped after an internal investigation by Louisville Police.\n\nRead MoreBREAKING NEWS Scottie Scheffler was prepared to take legal action against Louisville cops over May 17 arrest\n\n'Just a long week,' Scheffler said of his result at Pinehurst No. 2. 'I didn't have my best stuff and that's a pretty difficult golf course to try and make a lot of birdies and play some good golf around when you don't have your best stuff.'\n\nAfter putting together 41 straight rounds at par or better throughout this season, Scheffler arrives at the Travelers on a streak of five straight rounds over par.\n\n'Well I didn't really think about it very much when I was shooting under par, so I'm probably not going to think about it too much when I'm shooting over par,' he said. 'Just one of those deals. Like, I was playing good and I was able to survive kind of the harder golf courses.\n\n.'.. It's just kind of those weird little stats. Like, I think I shot over par a couple times at Colonial and I finished second. So it's not like, you know, I played that bad and shot over par. It's kind of one of those deals that just out of sight, out of mind.'\n\nScheffler was arrested at the PGA Championship for disobeying police before charges were dropped\n\nLikewise, Scheffler said he wasn't too concerned about the high temperatures expected this weekend in Connecticut.\n\n'As far as the heat goes, I'm from Texas so it's actually cold up here to me,' he said. 'I was a little chilly this morning when I got out there on the course.'\n\nScheffler's not-so-secret weapon this week is caddie Ted Scott, who was on the bag for Bubba Watson when he won the Travelers in 2010, 2015 and 2018.\n\n'This is a golf course that he's had a lot of success on, so if there's a difference of opinion I'm probably going to lean towards him a little bit more than myself, just because I haven't had the success on this golf course specifically,' Scheffler said.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors":

In fact, he didn't even make it to the Top 10 despite his dominant run in the weeks leading to the contest. Interestingly, the golf course may have been a factor in that.\n\nScheffler admitted as much while speaking to reporters ahead of the Travelers Championship at the TPC River Highlands in Cromwell. The world no. 1 shared that the Pinehurst is a \"pretty difficult golf course to try and make a lot of birdies and play some good golf around,\" via Golf.com.\n\nThe two-time Masters champion added, \"When I'm not playing my best I feel like one of my skills is kind of managing my way around the golf course knowing where the misses are. When you have pretty much a coin flip on whether or not you're going to have a swing or not there's not really a side of the fairway to miss it on, there are not really areas you can play to, you just have to hit great golf shots.\"\n\nScheffler furthered that the \"nature of the grass\" on the course made things really hard for him. He explained, \"Because you could hit it a foot off the fairway and be in a bush, and you could hit it 20 yards off the fairway and have a perfect lie [and] it plays like you're in the fairway.\"\n\n\"So that part of the course I didn't love. But [fairway to greens], I thought it was fantastic.

Coincidentally or not, a schedule change for the Memorial was announced Tuesday, moving it back to two weeks before the U.S. Open.\n\nScheffler has won the Masters and Players this season and feasted on the signature events, winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational, RBC Heritage and Memorial.

He made three straight birdies from the 2nd through 4th holes, eagled the 536-yard par-5 13th by hitting it to within 8 feet in two and added one more birdie at the 14th.\n\nHe was in the top 10 for the day in strokes-gained putting after losing strokes on the greens at Pinehurst.\n\n\"I struggled seeing the break on the greens last week,\" he said Wednesday. \"I had a hard time finding the right line.

He made a 19-footer at the par-4 2nd, a 13-footer at the 3rd, and then, at the challenging par-4 4th, Scheffler drained a birdie try from 16 feet.

I thought it was a great test of golf.\"\n\nHe added: \"It challenged us in all the right ways. You had to hit great shots in order to hold the greens. Around the greens you always had some sort of shot because you're playing out of the short grass.\n\n\"So I think sometimes when the rough is really heavy you see guys playing the same shot over and over again. And a ball that runs through the green goes the same distance over the green as a ball that barely trickles.\n\n\"And when it's all runoff areas that are tightly mown you pay bigger penalty for a bigger miss, which I think as players that's all we're looking for is to have good shots rewarded and have bad shots punished accordingly to how bad they are.\"\n\nBefore looping for the world number one, Scott was best known for his 12-year stint carrying the sticks for two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson.\n\nWatson ditched Scott over fears his career was going to be cut short over a knee injury before he joined LIV Golf.\n\nBut during their time together the duo loved coming to TPC River Highlands.\n\nWatson won the Travelers Championship three times during his PGA Tour career.\n\n\"I lean pretty heavily on Ted week-to-week,\" Scheffler told reporters.\n\n\"This is a golf course that he's had a lot of success on, so if there's a difference of opinion I'm probably going to lean towards him a little bit more than myself, just because I haven't had the success on this golf course specifically.\"\n\nScheffler continued: \"A different tournament I may lean more to what I feel and think, whereas out here he really does a good job of managing around this golf course.\n\n\"I think of another place, Augusta is kind of like that, where whatever he says seems to kind of go for me in my head, just because he's had the success, he has the pedigree, he knows where to put the ball and where not to put the ball.\n\n\"And especially when it comes to a lot of course management stuff clubs to choose off the tees, what areas to play into, just because, like you said, he has seen Bubba win here numerous times and he knows exactly I think how to kind of get me there, if that make sense.\"", "source": {"uri": "golfmagic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfmagic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_smith@golfmagic.com", "name": "Ben Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bubba Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn.golfmagic.com/styles/xl/s3/2024-06/2024-06-15T184450Z_738486311_MT1USATODAY23552426_RTRMADP_3_PGA-U-S-OPEN-THIRD-ROUND_0.JPG?itok=eaMK3lMF", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665528", "eventUri": "eng-9665528", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

In his eight starts leading into the year's third major, Scheffler had earned five wins and had only been beaten by a total of nine players.\n\nIf one had to circle a tournament and course setup that would potentially slow down the 27-year-old, it would be an extremely firm U.S. Open at Pinehurst, and that's exactly what happened. For the first time in 2024, Scheffler actually looked human on a golf course finishing T-41 at eight-over par. It marks the first time Scheffler has finished worse than T-17 in a tournament since August 2023.\n\nWhile Scheffler's putter didn't cooperate, neither did his driver as he hit just 61% of fairways for the week. Missing fairways at Pinehurst No. 2 is not a recipe for success given each one is lined by areas filled with sand, bushes, and dozens of variations of grass.\n\nIt's a crapshoot as to whether you draw a lie that is playable or one that will force you to hit your ball out sideways and swallow your pride, which is the one criticism Scheffler had for last week's U.S. Open venue.\n\n\"When I'm not playing my best I feel like one of my skills is kind of managing my way around the golf course knowing where the misses are. When you have pretty much a coin flip on whether or not you're going to have a swing or not there's not really a side of the fairway to miss it on, there are not really areas you can play to, you just have to hit great golf shots,\" Scheffler told the media ahead of this week's Travelers Championship.\n\n\"And when you're not hitting it great, you know, I feel like that's why I'm usually able to compete when I don't have my best stuff is the way I kind of manage my way around the golf course, and last week you're just not able to do that, just with the nature of the grass. Because you could hit it a foot off the fairway and be in a bush, and you could hit it 20 yards off the fairway and have a perfect lie that you're -- and it plays like you're in the fairway. So that part of the course I didn't love, but tee to green -- fairway -- sorry, I should say fairway to greens, I thought it was fantastic. I thought it was a great test of golf.\"\n\nFrom a player's standpoint, anyone can understand why Scheffler and plenty of other players in the field weren't exactly fans of the coin-flip aspect of missing fairways. From a fan perspective, however, it made the tournament that much more exciting.\n\nEach time a player hit a drive offline you were concerned about what type of lie they may draw. We saw it with Bryson DeChambeau missing nine fairways during Sunday's final round but drawing a great lie far more often than not.\n\nPinehurst was a true test from tee to green. So many other major championship venues only expose one, maybe two aspects of play while Pinehurst forces players to earn every shot from the moment they step on the course until the moment they leave it.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_harris@outkick.com", "name": "Mark Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/06/scheffler-us-open.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665528", "eventUri": "eng-9665528", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

It's the way I manage my way around the golf course and last week you're just not able to do that with the nature of the grass because you can hit it a foot off the fairway and be in a bush or you can hit it 20 yards off the fairway and it plays like you're in the fairway.\"\n\nScheffler finished the U.S. Open at eight-over par and will try to perform much better at the Traveler's Championship this week.\n\nHe'll tee off for the first round at 10:30 a.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nRelated: Scottie Scheffler Furious With Himself At U.S. Open Today", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hunter_hodies@postandcourier.com", "name": "Hunter Hodies", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/7b/e7bc0b2f-ba82-5e43-96cf-eed0c67a09a4/667309bfba494.image.png?crop=1185%2C622%2C7%2C0&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665528", "eventUri": "eng-9665528", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Watson's first victory at this course came in 2010, when the left-hander prevailed in a playoff over Scott Verplank and Corey Pavin.\n\nFive years later, Watson won again, defeating Paul Casey in a two-hole playoff.

He shot 7-under 63s on Thursday and Saturday, but an even-par 70 during Friday's round prevented him from threatening Keegan Bradley, who won at 23-under.\n\nBefore that, Scheffler tied for 13th in 2022 and 47th in 2021 after missing the cut in his debut in 2020. He obviously has had success on this golf course and knows how to play it, but after being \"mentally fatigued\" over the past few weeks, he can rely on his looper to get around and pinpoint certain targets and shots.\n\n\"Whatever he says seems to go for me in my head, just because he's had the success, he has the pedigree, he knows where to put the ball and where not to put the ball,\" Scheffler further explained.\n\n\"Especially when it comes to a lot of course management stuff: clubs to choose off the tees, what areas to play into, just because he has seen Bubba win here numerous times and he knows exactly how to get me there.\"", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Verplank", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scott Verplank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bubba Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Pavin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corey Pavin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Casey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Casey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jae2ex098SzNtA2Y8-rgujaLoMc=/0x396:5161x2977/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25497685/2157570535.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665528", "eventUri": "eng-9665528", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

In all fairness, it is a very hard course to catch fire on. This is especially why Bryson DeChambeau's US Open win is all the more impressive. Even Scottie Scheffler had some issues with the course. This even kept him from winning it all after just having notched the Memorial Open days before.\n\nUsually, someone who catches fire in a previous tournament carries that momentum over into their next battle. Scottie Scheffler was more than expected to perform well. This was especially after he totaled an 8-under at The Memorial. Unfortunately, it just was not the case for the top-ranked golfer in the world. The pressure of the U.S. Open may have gotten into him. Moreover, Pinehurst No. 2 even presented some unique challenges. These prevented him from chasing down Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau down the stretch.\n\nIt is not often that Scottie Scheffler gets bothered by the course he is playing in. But, the wiregrass in Pinehurst's fairways was just hard to maneuver around. He unveiled why this was such a big issue for him during the U.S. Open, via Paul Hodowanic of the PGA Tour.\n\nWhen I'm not playing my best, I feel like one of my skills is managing my way around the golf course, knowing where the misses are. When you have pretty much a coinflip of whether or not you're going to have a swing, there's not really a side of the fairway that you get to miss it on. There are not really areas where you can play through. You just have to hit great golf shots... Last week, I was just not able to do that with the nature of the grass.\n\nScottie Scheffler's qualm with the wiregrass at the U.S. Open\n\nHe then went on to point out the specifics of his swing mechanics which were bothered during the US Open. But, he still appreciated the challenges at Pinehurst which guys like McIlroy and DeChambeau overcame as the weekend went by.\n\nYou could hit it a foot off the fairway and be in a bush, and you could hit it 20 yards off the fairway and have a perfect lie. It plays like you're in the fairway. That part of the course I didn't love, but fairway to greens, I thought it was fantastic. I thought it was a great test of golf. It challenged us in all the right ways. You had to hit great shots in order to hold the greens. Around the greens, you always had some sort of shot because you're playing out of the short grass. So I think sometimes when the rough is really heavy you see guys playing the same shot over and over again.\n\nIt was clear that the wiregrass, something not often seen in most courses he plays in throughout the PGA Tour, bogged down his performance. Scheffler was only 70th in strokes gained. His Friday run at the US Open even saw him go without a birdie which nearly pushed him below the cut line for the first time in two years.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Scottie-Scheffler-gets-100-real-on-his-1-big-issue-at-Pinehurst.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665528", "eventUri": "eng-9665528", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Many such tournaments have been of the no-cut variety, like the Travelers Championship will be, though all of them have offered total purses of $20 million.\n\nIt is certainly a good time to be a professional golfer. It is also a good time to be Scottie Scheffler. With over two months left on the season, Scheffler has already set the PGA Tour's all-time earnings record with just over $24 million picked up so far this year. That breaks his old record set just a year ago when he claimed over $21 million.\n\nFueling that massive $24 million take-home total is Scheffler emerging victorious at three of the first seven signature events, which started back in January. Here are your first seven winners from signature events this season:\n\nThe Sentry: Chris Kirk ($3.6 million)Pebble Beach Pro Am: Wyndham Clark ($3.6 million)Genesis Invitational: Hideki Matsuyama ($4 million)Arnold Palmer Invitational: Scottie Scheffler ($4 million)RBC Heritage: Scottie Scheffler ($3.6 million)\n\nWells Fargo Championship: Rory McIlroy ($3.6 million)The Memorial Tournament: Scottie Scheffler ($4 million)\n\nThis week's $20 million purse will be split between 71 players. There were supposed to be 72 players in the field, but following his heartbreaking loss at the U.S. Open a week ago, Rory McIlroy withdrew from the event early this week. McIlroy will next be seen when he returns to the Scottish Open as the reigning champion this July.\n\nLet's take a look at the payout list for the 71 players who will be in attendance at the 2024 Travelers Championship.\n\n2024 Travelers Championship prize money, purse\n\nTotal purse: $20 million\n\n1st: $3,600,000\n\n2nd: $2,160,000\n\n3rd: $1,360,000\n\n4th: $960,000\n\n5th: $800,000\n\n6th: $720,000\n\n7th: $670,000\n\n8th: $620,000\n\n9th: $580,000\n\n10th: $540,000\n\n11th: $500,000\n\n12th: $460,000\n\n13th: $420,000\n\n14th: $380,000\n\n15th: $360,000\n\n16th: $340,000\n\n17th: $320,000\n\n18th: $300,000\n\n19th: $280,000\n\n20th: $260,000\n\n21st: $240,000\n\n22nd: $223,500\n\n23rd: $207,500\n\n24th: $191,500\n\n25th: $175,500\n\n26th: $159,500\n\n27th: $153,000\n\n28th: $147,000\n\n29th: $141,000\n\n30th: $135,000\n\n31st: $129,000\n\n32nd: $123,000\n\n33rd: $117,000\n\n34th: $112,000\n\n35th: $107,000\n\n36th: $102,000\n\n37th: $97,000\n\n38th: $93,000\n\n39th: $89,000\n\n40th: $85,000\n\n41st: $81,000\n\n42nd: $77,000\n\n43rd: $73,000\n\n44th: $69,000\n\n45th: $65,000\n\n46th: $61,000\n\n47th: $57,000\n\n48th: $53,500\n\n49th: $51,000\n\n50th: $50,000\n\n51st: $49,000\n\n52nd: $48,000\n\n53rd: $47,000\n\n54th: $47,000\n\n55th: $46,000\n\n56th: $45,500\n\n57th: $45,000\n\n58th: $44,500\n\n59th: $44,000\n\n60th: $43,500\n\n61st: $43,000\n\n62nd: $42,500\n\n63rd: $42,000\n\n64th: $41,500\n\n65th: $41,000\n\n66th: $40,500\n\n67th: $40,000\n\n68th: $39,500\n\n69th: $39,000\n\n70th: $38,500\n\n71st: $38,000", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_porter@cbssports.com", "name": "Kyle Porter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Kirk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Kirk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer_Invitational", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer Invitational"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Golf_Links", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Golf Links"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Contests", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Science_Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Science Fiction", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Facilities", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/20/a1e1d9f4-1de1-4f9d-bd15-4ce8309b0b56/thumbnail/1200x675/88668b7ccae084f5620b5a9764147136/travelers-trophy-2023-g.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665528", "eventUri": "eng-9665528", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Well, almost all the best golfers.\n\nRory McIlroy has decided to withdraw from the event, citing the need to prepare for the European swing of the calendar including the British Open. It's hard not to think that allowing the U.S. Open to slip through his grasp this past Sunday also played a significant role in his decision.\n\nRegardless, it's now clear who the two top dogs are at this week's event; Scottie Scheffler and Xander Schauffele.\n\nDraftKings Sportsbook is offering odds on which of the two major champions will finish further up the leaderboard this week. Unsurprisingly, Scheffler is the betting favorite, but is he the right side to back?\n\nAt -160 odd, DraftKings is giving Scheffler an implied probability of 61.54% of beating Schauffele this week.\n\nThe big question surrounding the No. 1 golfer in the world entering this week is whether or not he can bounce back from last week's poor performance at the U.S. Open. He recorded just four birdies all tournament en route to a T41 performance. We should expect him to rebound in a big way this week, but if we look to the women's game we may see a sign of what's to come for Scheffler.\n\nNelly Korda, the No. 1 women's ranked golfer in the world, was on a dominant run that mirrored Scheffler's. She won five times in six starts and looked near invincible heading into the women's U.S. Open. Then, a disastrous performance led to her missing the cut at the major and she followed it up with another missed cut at last week's Meijer LPGA Classic. Not to say the same thing will happen to Scheffler, but it goes to show that even the best in the world can hit a bump in the road.\n\nMeanwhile, Schauffele returns to an event he won just two years ago. Now, he's been playing the best golf of his career and will feel a little bit lighter this time around with the Wanamaker Trophy on his shelf.\n\nLast week at the U.S. Open, he finished second in the field in strokes-gained approach en route to a T7 finish. He has now finished inside the top 10 in seven of his last nine starts.\n\nIt may be blasphemous to bet against Scheffler, but I look at this as an opportunity to bet against a golfer who could potentially be entering a slump.

With a chuckle, he responded: \"Probably not from other golfers. Maybe Keegan, but probably not. I wouldn't expect it out of him. I did get one fan today who asked me to sign a Celtics hat and I told him no, but other than that not much interaction.\"\n\nScheffler's chat did indeed swing back to the fairways of pro golf, with the Masters champion fielding questions on the latest buzz both on and off the green. Notably, Scheffler was probed about any whispers he'd caught regarding the PGA Tour's current talks with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), but he had nothing to spill.\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\n\"[I have] no idea. I'm not really too much a part of it, so I haven't really heard too much, so I don't know if they're going great or if they're going poorly,\" he said. \"Your guess is as good as mine I think at this point. Hopefully, they will continue to progress, but we'll see.\n\n\"But definitely no frustration or anything like that for me. It's out of my control, so I'm not too worried about it. They have got a lot of big business decisions to make, and as far as my opinion goes, I sit on our PAC, but as far as input in the negotiations, I don't really have much to say at all. So the frustration, definitely not, but we'll see how things progress.\"\n\nThese remarks from Scheffler surfaced just a day after commissioner Jay Monahan briefed on the talks, following a pow-wow between the circuit's honchos - Tiger Woods included - and their Saudi counterparts in New York earlier in the month.\n\nMonahan, in a memo to players, confirmed that discussions are still underway but acknowledged there's 'still work to do'. \"During that meeting, we reached consensus on several items, but both parties recognize that there is still work to do to reach a final agreement,\" the commissioner wrote.\n\n\"Our talks are ongoing with the goal of developing a shared vision for the future of professional golf that is pro-competitive and provides players with the best global opportunities. Your player directors have been crucial in the process, their insights and perspectives are steering us towards a positive outcome, they continued, in a remark which will inspire confidence among fans hoping for a resolve to the impasse.

country.\n\n\"Do I have to answer this question?\" Scheffler asked.\n\nHe did say he did not expect to get too much grief over the Celtics' dominating 4-1 victory.\n\n\"Probably not from other golfers -- maybe Keegan [Bradley], but probably not, I wouldn't really expect it out of him.\"\n\nBradley, the Vermont-native who lives near Boston, completely understood Scheffler's desire to avoid the

watch it with my family and my kids -- now my oldest son, Logan, was into it -- and it was really fun to watch him watch the Celtics win,\" said Bradley, who said he impressed by the wisdom coming

(AP) -- Scottie Scheffler and Tom Kim gorged themselves on pizza to get their shared birthday celebration out of the way before turning their focus to golf this week.\n\nWhen they tee it up on the big day, they'll be fighting for the lead at the Travelers Championship.\n\nKim shot an 8-under-par 62 on Thursday in the first round at the TPC River Highlands, good for a two-stroke lead in the final limited field, no-cut signature event on this year's PGA Tour schedule. Scheffler, the world's No. 1 player, was tied for sixth, three shots back.\n\nKim will turn 22 on Friday, and Scheffler is exactly six years older. The Dallas-area residents marked the occasion in advance by heading about 30 miles south to Sally's -- a New Haven institution.\n\n\"I had a lot of pizza,\" Kim said. \"I wouldn't do that in a tournament, but it's my birthday and it's kind of a tradition. Me, Scottie, we have the same birthday, so we had an early birthday celebration.\"\n\nKim birdied the last two holes to separate himself from the four players tied at minus-6 on the 6,835-yard, par-70 course: Rickie Fowler, Akshay Bhatia, Kurt Kitayama and Will Zalatoris.\n\nScheffler was among seven players at 5 under, looking again like the best player in the world a week after finishing tied for 41st at Pinehurst No. 2 -- his worst performance of the year.

On Thursday, with temperatures in the mid-90s and little wind, he had five birdies on the back nine of a bogey-free round.\n\n\"Obviously a tough day on Sunday, but it wasn't like I was playing terrible,\" he said. \"It wasn't a bad week, but a bad round cost me the week. ... That gives me confidence to go out and that actually I am playing well and just trying to keep riding this momentum.\"\n\nKim's slump lasted for a single round. Scheffler's could be over after one week. Fowler is hoping to snap out of a season-long skid.\n\nThe six-time winner on the PGA Tour has just one top-25 finish this year and none in the top 10. But he can console himself with the knowledge that things aren't as bad as they were during a four-year winless drought that ended last year in Detroit.\n\n\"I try not to go back to those times too much,\" Fowler said. \"Definitely not anywhere as bad as it was a few years back, but some similarities there. Having been through that and dealt with that and ultimately coming back to playing well, I can deal with just about anything.\"\n\nFowler saved par after hitting his drive into the rough on the first hole, and he thinks that might have been the kick-start he needed. He followed that up with back-to-back birdies in a bogey-free round.\n\n\"Sometimes I would almost rather (do) that than birdie the first hole, because then it's kind of downhill from there,\" he said. \"So, yeah, got off to a nice start. Started to see some balls go in, and making putts kind of frees up the rest of the game to where you don't feel like you have to be perfect.\"\n\nZalatoris birdied five of the first six holes on the back nine -- and eight in 10 holes making the turn -- to make a brief appearance at 7 under. He bogeyed the 157-yard, par-3 16th, flying the green on his tee shot and then two-putting from 55 feet.\n\nWith an 8-footer for birdie and sole possession of the lead on No. 18, Zalatoris pushed it wide right.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kim", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Kim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rickie Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Haven, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Haven, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Zalatoris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Zalatoris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akshay_Bhatia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Akshay Bhatia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Kitayama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Kitayama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alpine skiing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Men's", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Men's", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/20240620180616-6674aaac86a65799def10713jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665528", "eventUri": "eng-9665528", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

But he can console himself with the knowledge that things aren't as bad as they were during a four-year winless drought that ended last year in Detroit.\n\n\"I try not to go back to those times too much,\" Fowler said. \"Definitely not anywhere as bad as it was a few years back, but some similarities there. Having been through that and dealt with that and ultimately coming back to playing well, I can deal with just about anything.\"\n\nFowler saved par after hitting his drive into the rough on the first hole, and he thinks that might have been the kick-start he needed. He followed that up with back-to-back birdies in a bogey-free round.\n\n\"Sometimes I would almost rather (do) that than birdie the first hole, because then it's kind of downhill from there,\" he said. \"So, yeah, got off to a nice start. Started to see some balls go in, and making putts kind of frees up the rest of the game to where you don't feel like you have to be perfect.\"\n\nZalatoris birdied five of the first six holes on the back nine -- and eight in 10 holes making the turn -- to make a brief appearance at 7 under. He bogeyed the 157-yard, par-3 16th, flying the green on his tee shot and then two-putting from 55 feet.\n\nWith an 8-footer for birdie and sole possession of the lead on No. 18, Zalatoris pushed it wide right.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rickie Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akshay_Bhatia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Akshay Bhatia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Haven, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Haven, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Zalatoris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Zalatoris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Kitayama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Kitayama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alpine skiing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Men's", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Men's", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.daytondailynews.com/resizer/dp2oCigoPOUUKKdwHcj9bIgeuTI=/1200x630/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coxohio/WBCVVRTUNYJBTWKIBGROIKYVE4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665528", "eventUri": "eng-9665528", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 223677710, "title": "Weekly Horoscope: May 26-June 1, Ignite Your Confidence", "text": "It's time to grind! A busy and productive week lies ahead with opportunities to build toward our most important goals. Mars (the planet of passion, drive, sex and desire) has been in the zodiac sign of Aries for the past month, intensifying our hunger to put our plans, our egos and ourselves first. For the first time in two years, this is a key time to launch new projects and endeavors, particularly before June 9. This week, note that May 27 could bring stability and success, so sign a contract or make long-term plans. However, May 31 is likely to bring a fast-paced day with some shocks and surprises. Read on for what this week could mean for you, according to your zodiac sign! Aries (March 21 to April 19) You\u2019ve felt a greater fire coursing through you for weeks, Aries. You\u2019re supercharged in nearly every way. The key to harnessing all of this powerful energy is to focus on the most important personal or professional goals you\u2019d like to tackle, then set forth to accomplish them. The projects, actions and goals that you begin now will be infused with strength and likely reach a successful conclusion. You\u2019re also radiating sexual magnetism even more than usual, so seize control and lure romance to you. If you\u2019re feeling a bit stir crazy or aggressive, get involved in physical activities. Taurus (April 20 to May 20) The past month has turned much of your attention to your private life, Taurus. You may feel a bit more tense and anxious \u2014 or perhaps, you might be working on tackling mental health matters or finding closure from the past. If you do your best to overcome this, you may find better days ahead. Use this energy to become deeply invested in working on projects in solitude or behind the scenes. The plans you are developing now may come to light in June or July, so use this time wisely. Gemini (May 21 to June 20) You're a social butterfly, Gemini! This isn\u2019t just a lifestyle for you, however, it\u2019s a core piece of your personality. You\u2019re currently in a period of socialization, expanding your network and likely engaging with communities. You may find you enjoy what life has to offer through your connections with people, ultimately causing you to thrive, learn and grow as a result. You could also be in hot pursuit of very significant hopes, dreams or goals. By working with a team, you\u2019re likely to reach at least one major one soon. Keep your eyes on the prize and work swiftly! Cancer (June 21 to July 22) You\u2019ve been in the fast lane on professional projects recently and right now you\u2019re in a chariot ready to dominate your path forward, Cancer. You\u2019re in one of the best periods in a two-year cycle to move quickly up the professional ladder and realize your ambitions. Launch projects, court authority figures, reach for public recognition, aim for a promotion or look for a better job. If you focus in and use the energy that is in your favor now, you could set up a two-year trend of success, glory and victory. Go for it now and don\u2019t settle for less! Leo (July 23 to Aug. 22) There\u2019s been a fire burning in your soul recently, Leo. All you want is to soar high above everyone else. You hunger for personal and professional growth and crave to be unlimited. The best part about this? The more you seek to shake it up, try new things and venture into new horizons \u2014 physically, mentally, spiritually and beyond \u2014 the more you will grow and the faster it\u2019ll happen in the next two years. Don\u2019t sit in the shadows and get complacent. Life is about taking action, being confident and showing the world that you\u2019re fearless! Virgo (Aug. 23 to Sept. 22) A deep hunger for closeness and intimacy has been boiling under the surface as of late, Virgo. If you\u2019re in a happy relationship, you could be experiencing more passion, sexuality, closeness and teamwork. If you\u2019re single or have an unhealthy connection, you could be licking your wounds around trust, vulnerability, neediness or past relationship traumas. You may be feeling a bit down on yourself and a little bit lonelier. The best thing to do is to dig deep within to understand your true needs so that you can find more enriching and intimate connections. Libra (Sept. 23 to Oct. 22) Partnership is always important for you, Libra. However, the past few weeks have created an intense need for union. The best thing to do right now? Work with a significant other and embrace teamwork. Setting off solo at this time will make it feel like you\u2019re encountering hurdles at every turn \u2014 but by finding the right personal or professional partner, you will rapidly move toward happiness and your goals. Also, be aware of tension bubbling behind the scenes in a relationship or with a competitor. It could be grating your nerves, so try to find peaceful solutions. Scorpio (Oct. 23 to Nov. 21) Life likely feels like you have a million and one priorities to constantly tackle right now, Scorpio. There\u2019s just so much to handle at this time! Productivity and efficiency are top priorities in order to achieve it all. You may feel like there\u2019s a lot of pressure coming at you from your work place, employment or clients. If you seek to get a lot done, fortunately, you should feel a surplus of energy! Opportunities to find new work, projects or clients may arise as well. Go for them! Sagittarius (Nov. 22 to Dec. 21) There's been a lot of focus on productivity in recent months, Sagittarius. The heavens above have been bringing a vibrant hunger for passion, pleasure and laughter to your heart at the same time. You are in a magnificent period to enjoy life, have fun and indulge in pleasure and hobbies. Romance and sex especially are cosmically aligned now. If you\u2019d like to improve your intimate life \u2014 or if single, find a passionate love affair \u2014 you must put yourself out there and strike quickly. You\u2019re setting up a two-year cycle around love, expression and enjoyment, so make all of this a top priority now! Capricorn (Dec. 22 to Jan. 19) You always have a domestic focus, Capricorn, but it is even more top of mind now. It appears there\u2019s a lot of hustle and bustle around home, family, real estate or domestic matters. It has been building all month and is even more of a focus now. This may appear in the form of moving, renovating, redecorating or handling situations around living experiences. You may also be forced to get involved in some big family matters, like helping a parent or one of your kindred tackle a goal. Channel the energy and allow it to give you strength! Aquarius (Jan. 20 to Feb. 18) Life has been a whirlwind in recent weeks, Aquarius, and it still feels that way! You're likely experiencing a very social period with friends, neighbors or siblings \u2014 in addition to a lot of travel, too. This week would be a great time to visit a nearby destination or even play tourist in your town. The more that you go with the flow and embrace spontaneity, the more fun you\u2019ll have. Also! If you\u2019ve been involved in any big intellectual projects, they will likely see a successful launch if you fine-tune the details now. Pisces (Feb. 19 to March 20) As much as you don\u2019t like to focus on or \u201cworry\u201d about money, Pisces, it appears there\u2019s major attention on your financial life this month, especially now. Maybe you're fighting for clients or a raise \u2014 or perhaps, you're feeling overwhelmed with work projects. You may also be in the middle of some very big expenses, as if the entire universe is making you \u201cpay up\u201d for things that keep being thrown your way. Fortunately, if you use this time now to balance your budget and look for ways to increase your monetization, you could be quite in luck!

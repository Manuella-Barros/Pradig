(Atlanta News First) - On May 9, 2022, 28 suspected gang members were arrested in Buckhead as part of 56-count indictment.\n\nJeffery Williams was one of them. You might know him as Young Thug, one of American music's most acclaimed artists and producers.\n\nTwo years later, Young Thug remains on trial in an Atlanta courtroom in a trial whose jury selection lasted longer than any other in Georgia history, and whose actual witness testimony itself will likely surpass state records. Both records were set by the Atlanta Public Schools teacher scandal and trial of 2014-15. The rapper's trial has been repeatedly plagued by arrests, charges, and disruptions.\n\nDefense attorneys have raised concerns the trial could go years based on the number of witness the state plans to call up.\n\nBrian Steel, one of Young Thug's attorneys, has made repeated requests Williams be freed on bond, all of which have been denied by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville, who is overseeing the trial. Steel has also moved for a mistrial on several occasions, and has even asked Glanville to recuse himself because Steel believes the judge is unfairly hampering his defense and is more favorable to prosecutors.\n\nDespite its slow movement, the nonetheless high-pressure trial has devolved several times into shouting matches between the judge overseeing the proceedings, prosecutors and defense attorneys.\n\nFor weeks, Glanville has admonished both sides in Young Thug's trial to file motions early and collaborate with each other. The judge also repeatedly asked prosecutors and defense attorneys to come to court on time.\n\nThe indictment accuses Williams of being the leader of the Young Slime Life (YSL) gang, also known as YSL Records, and of participating in violent street activities and conspiring to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).\n\nThe charges include possession of drugs with intent to distribute, possession of firearms, and being a person employed by or associated with a criminal street gang. Williams has been tied to accusations of murder, assault, robbery, theft, gun possession, and illegal drug possession around the Atlanta area since 2012.\n\nA total of 18 jurors have been selected, with six of them being alternates. Two jurors have already been excused; one had a medical emergency, the other moved out of Fulton County.\n\nOpening statements began on Nov. 27, 2023.

To say the trial, which is already the longest in Georgia history, has been lengthy and full of complications would be an understatement.\n\nIt's a case that has garnered national attention because its star co-defendant, Jeffery Williams, aka Young Thug, is accused by Fulton County prosecutors of co-founding and leading the gang Young Slime Life. The indictment alleges a number of crimes starting in 2013, just a year before the rapper first entered the Billboard Hot 100 with songs such as \"Stoner\" and \"Lifestyle.\" Thug's charges include conspiracy to violate RICO, participation in criminal street gang activity, violation of the Georgia Controlled Substances Act and possession of a machine gun.\n\nIn addition to Young Thug, several other rappers signed to his record label Young Stoner Life were charged in the indictment. Gunna, whose real name is Sergio Kitchens, and Slimelife Shawty, whose name is Wunnie Lee, were both charged with one count of conspiracy to violate RICO and negotiated plea deals in the case in December 2022. Yak Gotti, whose real name is Deamonte Kendrick, remains on trial alongside Young Thug and is facing a count of murder and conspiracy to violate RICO.\n\nDuring opening arguments last November, Fulton County Chief Deputy District Attorney Adriane Love repeatedly referred to Young Thug as \"King Slime\" and said, \"The evidence will show that the members of YSL knew who their leader was, and they knew the repercussions of not obeying him.\" In an indictment that spans more than 60 counts and 191 overt acts, prosecutors allege that members of Young Slime Life committed a number of crimes ranging from armed robbery to attempted murder and murder.\n\nFrom the early 2010s until today, Young Thug has risen to become one of the most influential rappers of his generation, earning three Billboard Hot 100 No. 1s and one Grammy. The YSL indictment alleges that while the rapper was rising to prominence globally, he was also leading a criminal street gang and authorizing a number of violent crimes.\n\nThug isn't the first rapper to recently be charged in a RICO case. In 2019, 6ix9ine was sentenced to two years after pleading guilty to racketing conspiracy and eight other charges. In 2021, rapper YFN Lucci faced RICO charges in the same Fulton County courthouse as Young Thug before he negotiated a plea deal earlier this year.\n\nThe YSL trial has reignited conversations about the use of rap lyrics in criminal cases. During opening arguments, Love said prosecutors \"chased the murders and found the lyrics,\" not vice versa. She referenced the lyrics \"hundred rounds in a Tahoe,\" alleging that Young Thug was referencing the murder of a rival gang member who was standing next to a Chevy Tahoe. Prosecutors say Thug rented the 2014 Silver Infiniti Q50 sedan that was used in the January 2015 drive-by shooting that killed Donovan \"Nut\" Thomas.\n\nDefense attorneys such as Doug Weinstein, who represents Yak Gotti, have repeatedly argued that the use of lyrics in this way is a harmful practice. \"You have a situation where they're bringing in lyrics, they are using them out of context, they are reading into the lyrics whatever they want to read into them and they're taking them separate and apart from their artistic use. They're assuming whenever they're bringing in these lyrics that everything that any of these guys rap about is autobiographical,\" he tells Billboard. \"It's just outrageous.\"\n\nMusic executives have also been vocal about their support of the rapper as well as their criticisms about the use of lyrics in the case. In addition to creating the Protect Black Art Petition, both 300 Entertainment's Kevin Liles and Atlantic Music Group's Julie Greenwald have visited the Fulton County Courthouse in support of Young Thug. \"If this were country music, rock music...we wouldn't be here,\" Liles told reporters outside of the courtroom before listening to the first day of opening arguments in November.\n\n\"Artists and labels should not underestimate the precedent the Fulton County District Attorney has created by taking the weaponization of lyrics mainstream,\" Liles said in a new statement to Billboard. \"When obviously figurative lyrics like 'ready for war like I'm Russia' are claimed to be 'an overt act in furtherance of conspiracy,' no artist in any genre is safe. This case is a radical assault on creative freedom.\"\n\nThroughout the trial, Young Thug has garnered support from a number of artists, including Drake, Killer Mike and The 1975's Matty Healy. Recently, Chance the Rapper referred to the trial as a \"circus\" on Instagram and said he wished Young Thug was able to receive bond during the lengthy process. \"For my birthday I just wish my brother was home with his family,\" he wrote. The singer Mariah the Scientist, who is dating Young Thug, was a regular in the courtroom before her tour started in February. Quavo also sat in on the trial one day in April.\n\nDespite an already lengthy process, this case is likely to last at least through the remainder of 2024. To date, prosecutors have called more than 60 witnesses to testify to a number of overt acts, but in early April they told Judge Ural Glanville they still had about 150 remaining witnesses on their list. At that time, they estimated they'd need roughly 120 trial days to complete their case, but this didn't account for administrative days or cross examinations by the defense. Testimony in the trial has also notably been delayed several times for a number of reasons, including the behind-bars stabbing of co-defendant Shannon Stillwell in December and, in late April, a juror's medical emergency.\n\n\"From the absence of bond to the extraordinary weaponization of creative expression, this case has always been an outrage. Now as the longest trial in Georgia history and with no end in sight, it's also become a farce,\" Liles said about the ongoing trial. \"I'm looking forward to embracing Jeffery when he is finally granted his freedom.\"\n\n\"I've been practicing for over 25 years, most of that time in federal court. I've been involved in significant civil cases, for example, involving up to a dozen or more [corporate] defendants,\" Weinstein says. \"I've never seen any case like [this]. I've never seen any case drag out for this expected length of time.\" The defense attorney said he believes the state's witness testimony has become \"duplicative\" and \"unnecessary.\" He estimates the state's case is \"going to drag well into 2025.\"\n\n\"And that's before we present our case,\" Weinstein adds, referencing that all six defendants will then be allowed to call their own witnesses.\n\nAnthony Michael Kreis, assistant professor of law at Georgia State University, says retaining the attention of the jury might provide incentive for defendants to make their cases quickly when it's their turn, however. \"I don't think the state, for whatever reason, seems to acknowledge so far that the longer this drags out, the more irritated your jurors are going to be that you brought this case in the first place,\" he says. It took nearly 10 months to select a jury for this trial, after many of the prospective jurors said sitting on a trial for six months to a year would be a hardship. Jurors in this case are paid $25 dollars per day by Fulton County and are unable to work during the trial.\n\nEven beyond the impact the trial has had on the rap community, the prosecution of Thug and the other co-defendants has implications for the rapper's hometown, too. Defense attorney Suri Chadha Jimenez says the trial has \"shut down the entire court system in Georgia,\" noting he's had several instances where a case was delayed because the defendants' attorney was stuck in court for the YSL trial. And Weinstein says this lengthy trial is expensive for taxpayers, too. He estimates the sheriff deputies involved with the case \"easily\" work 60 hours per week due to the time it takes to transport defendants to court and their work providing security within the courtroom. \"You're looking at a lot of overtime,\" he says. \"That's just the deputies. That's not all of the other expenses of this case.\"\n\nThe case has also been seen by many as a litmus test for how the Fulton County RICO case against former president Donald Trump might play out. \"I think there's a lot of lessons that the DA's office is going to have to learn from this case for the Trump case,\" Kreis says. \"If the election trial operates anywhere near as inefficiently and [is] bungled as often as this trial has [been], I think they're going to be very sorry. And there's going to be a lot of political backlash.\"\n\nJimenez was previously a Fulton County prosecutor before he began representing one of the defendants in the YSL trial. Prosecutors dropped the charges against Cordarius Dorsey, aka YSL Polo, before opening arguments began. Still, the defense attorney says trying cases on behalf of the state helped inform his opinion that Georgia's broad RICO statute has allowed for its overuse. \"I think RICO is a weapon of last resort to go after true mob bosses for organized crime that are operating in plain sight and they're doing things that seem legit, but when you put them in context, they are predicate acts of a bigger organization [and] conspiracy. We ain't got that in Atlanta. We don't have any crime bosses. If we do, they're probably developers or politicians. But they're definitely not the guys out here robbing houses and shooting people. That's not organized crime,\" the defense attorney says. \"If you have a murder, prove a f-king murder. It will take you a week [to try] and the person will go away for life.\"\n\nJimenez was working for the district attorney's office during the time in which many of the incidents in this case took place and he prosecuted Walter \"DK\" Murphy for an alleged attempted murder that's listed as an overt act in this indictment. (Murphy had been released from prison on that charge nearly three months before he was arrested and charged with conspiracy to violate RICO in this case. He subsequently accepted a plea deal and was released in December 2022.)\n\nThe attorney believes a part of the reason this trial is taking so long is because prosecutors have long been struggling to prove some of their allegations. \"These are instances that didn't get prosecuted 10 years ago for a reason. They didn't have it,\" he says. \"So now, what they're doing is throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.\"\n\nWith several months left of the prosecution's case alone, it's not yet clear how jurors are processing the evidence they're receiving. Young Thug's bond has been repeatedly denied, however, meaning he'll remain in jail - effectively halting his career - at least until a verdict is reached.", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com",

Judge Ural Glanville introduced some new rules to the court in an effort to speed things up, and Glanville was in a fiery exchange with attorneys.\n\nBack on May 9, 2022, the hip-hop world was jolted with the news that rapper Young Thug - a Grammy winner, trendsetter and Atlanta icon - had been arrested.\n\nIt's been nearly two years now that the artist, whose legal name is Jeffery Williams, has remained behind bars. The central charge against him is that three letters with which his name has become synonymous because of his artistic success in launching the \"Young Stoner Life\" label, YSL, actually signalize a violent gang: Young Slime Life.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis named Williams, among other metro Atlanta rappers and those with ties to the alleged gang, to bring charges against a total of 28 people in a sweeping 88-page indictment. The case alleges that not only is Young Thug among the gang's members, but he is also its kingpin.\n\n\"He is the one they're all afraid of,\" a prosecutor said at a June 2022 hearing. \"He's the one that's King Slime.\"\n\nA long pretrial process passed to an even longer jury selection process, and across this time, the co-defendant list dwindled with plea deals and other circumstances, keeping some of the individuals charged from remaining on the case.\n\nThe trial finally began in earnest in November 2023, already considered the longest in Georgia's history.\n\nNow that it is in full swing, 11Alive is keeping track of key developments in the case and highlighting moments in the courtroom.

The state of Georgia charged Young Thug and five other codefendants of being part of a menacing street gang that committed numerous crimes throughout Atlanta over the past decade. Young Thug, born Jeffery Williams, is accused of being the ringleader. He faces charges of criminal street-gang activity, violation of the Georgia Controlled Substances Act, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, possession of a machine gun and drug crimes. Through it all, his rap peers haven't wavered in their support, shouting him out on tracks and on social media.\n\nYet many of Thug's rap peers were also arrested, including Gunna was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the RICO Act. The rapper negotiated an Alford plea deal in December of 2022, and despite being free is still trying to escape being labeled a snitch two years later. Another prominent YSL signee Yak Gotti, is currently on trial alongside Thug. He's facing a count of murder and conspiracy to violate the RICO Act.\n\nThe case has also called into question the use of rap lyrics in a criminal court, as Thug's own bars are currently being used against him to try and tie him to numerous crimes. For example, prosecutor Adriane Love referenced the lyrics \"hundred rounds in a Tahoe\" in her opening arguments last November. Love claimed those lyrics were in reference to the murder of a rival gang member who got shot while standing next to a Chevy Tahoe.\n\nThroughout it all, Thugga has remained in jail for the entirety of his trial. He's been denied bond five times, and his trial will likely drag into 2027. As the trial has gone on, his support in the rap game has continued to grow, with dozens of rappers calling for Thug's freedom in their songs.\n\nCheck out 24 times rappers have shouted out Thugga in the two years since his arrest below.", "source": {"uri": "xxlmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "XXL Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mackenzie_cummings_grady@xxlmag.com", "name": "Mackenzie Cummings-Grady", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Thug", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Young Thug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YSL_Records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YSL Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Recording_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Recording Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunna_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gunna (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Controlled Substances Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alford_plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alford plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Informant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2024/05/attachment-young-thug-drake-kanye-west-kendrick-lamar.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553347", "eventUri": "eng-9553347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis announced the sweeping indictment in May 2022, accusing Williams of being the kingpin of Young Slime Life (YSL), an Atlanta-based street gang affiliated with the Bloods gang.\n\nOne moment from the courtroom went viral on Wednesday, when footage emerged of the state presenting the music video for Williams' 2015 track \"Halftime,\" which is featured on the musician's 2015 mixtape Barter 6. As of press time, the clip has garnered more than 1.5 million views.\n\nDays before Williams' trial began in November 2023, Judge Ural Glanville ruled that lyrics from 17 tracks could be used against the hip-hop star and his YSL co-defendants during the trial.\n\nCountering the defense's argument that the lyrics were protected by the First Amendment, Glanville said: \"They're not prosecuting your clients because of the songs they wrote. They're using the songs to prove other things your clients may have been involved in. I don't think it's an attack on free speech.\"\n\nWhile the expletive-riddled lyrics rang out in the courtroom, a smiling Williams was seen turning to his defense attorney, Brian Steel, and rhythmically pointing his finger in time with his rap flow.\n\nIn turn, a smiling Steel made eye contact with his client and smiled at him before briefly looking around the courtroom.\n\n\"I done figured this s*** out / If you think you gone bite on my swag it's a virus,\" Williams could be heard rapping in the clip. \"I don my swag and I pull up on b****** dressed in all white like Miley Cyrus / No, I'm not gay, I f*** b***** on b***** / I whip out she suck on my private / Lil n**** play, I'mma catch her I bet I fold 'em like a wallet.\"\n\nFootage of the seconds-long interaction has been circulated on X, formerly Twitter, where a caption of a fan account's upload read: \"Young Thug and his lawyer vibing to his hit song Halftime in court omg.\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted a representative of Williams via email for comment.\n\nElsewhere in the track, Williams raps: \"Hit the streets and tear this b**** up like I'm Willie B / No Tennessee but the chain on my neck is a T / No Memphis Bleek, b**** I own the Roc not Jay Z, ya dig? / War Ready like Tracy T, ya dig?\n\n\"Racks on racks on racks just might pull up in my Spider / All my diamonds black you can motherf*****' knight 'em / All these p**** n***** whack, I'm a murk 'em every night'll / Pull up screamin' blat, got my motor out a Viper.\"\n\nWilliams' trial, which is expected to continue for the next several months, has garnered a wave of media attention over the past several months.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

billion) all-share merger, the Spanish lender said on Monday.\n\nThe country's fourth-largest lender by market value said its board believed BBVA's proposal significantly undervalues the potential of Banco Sabadell and its growth prospects, calling the offer unsolicited.\n\nPropped up by higher interest rates and robust profits, European banks are flush with cash and their shares have hit multi-year highs, boosting speculation of more M&A activity, although clinching deals is far from easy.\n\nLast week, BBVA had offered an exchange ratio of one newly issued BBVA share for every 4.83 Sabadell shares, a premium of 30% over April 29 closing prices.\n\n\"We regret that the board of Sabadell has rejected such an attractive offer,\" a spokesperson for BBVA said on Monday, without elaborating further.\n\nLast week, BBVA said it was ready to \"move forward immediately with the transaction\" and Chairman Carlos Torres in a letter called on Sabadell's board to give its assessment of the proposal as soon as possible.\n\nIn its offer unveiled on Wednesday, BBVA said it aimed to create a lender with more than 100 million customers globally and total assets exceeding 1 trillion euros, second only to its rival Santander among Spanish banks.\n\nIn a statement to the stock market supervisor on Monday, Sabadell said the recent material decline and volatility in the BBVA share price increased the uncertainty around the value of the proposal.\n\nBased on the May 6 closing prices of 9.840 euros for BBVA and 1.8895 euros for Sabadell, shares in Sabadell were well below the 2.2587 euros per share BBVA was offering taking into account the 30% premium against April 29.\n\nSince the indicative offer was announced by BBVA, Sabadell have risen 8.8% while shares in BBVA have fallen 9.7%.\n\nTaking into account Monday's closing share price, the premium would just be equivalent to 7.8%, valuing Sabadell at around 11 billion euros.\n\nAnalysts said the gap between the offer and the current share price of Sabadell indicated there was risk that the deal would not go through.\n\nIn November 2020, Sabadell and BBVA called off merger talks as they did not agree on the terms, including the price tag.\n\nA combination of the two entities would have now a combined market value of over 67.5 billion euros, and the new Spanish banking giant would rank as the third-biggest lender by capitalization in the euro zone.\n\nThe combined entity would also overtake Caixabank as the biggest domestic lender in Spain with over 625 billion euros in assets in the country, compared with Caixabank's just over 574 billion euros.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It would destroy many jobs, cause financial exclusion and more oligopoly,\" Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz wrote on the X social media platform.\n\nThe head of the regional government of Catalonia, Pere Aragones, echoed these concerns, telling Spanish public television the takoever would \"affect many jobs in Catalonia\".\n\nAragones is facing a regional election in Catalonia on Sunday, with polls showing he is trailing.\n\n- 'Undervalues' Sabadell -\n\nBBVA, which also has operations in Mexico, Argentina and Turkey, is Spain's second-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation and has 74.\n\n1 million customers.\n\nSabadell operates in 14 countries and has nearly 20 million customers.\n\nThe bank had said on Monday that the initial offer \"significantly undervalues the potential of Banco Sabadell and its standalone growth prospects\".\n\nIt added that it was \"highly confident in Banco Sabadell's growth strategy and its financial targets\".\n\nSabadell also pointed to the recent \"decline and volatility in the BBVA share price\" which reflected \"the uncertainty around the value of the proposal\".\n\nBBVA then informed Sabadell in a letter that it had \"no room\" to improve its offer, which it considered generous.\n\n- Bank consolidation -\n\nThe two banks had initially announced a plan to merge in November 2020 with the aim of better weathering the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut it was scrapped just 10 days later, with Sabadell saying that BBVA's offer did not reflect the real value of its business.\n\nIn the ensuing months, Sabadell undertook a major restructuring plan to slash costs that resulted in 1,800 redundancies, with BBVA going through a similar process, shedding 3,000 jobs.\n\nBoth have since recovered as has the wider Spanish banking sector which posted record profits in recent months, despite an exceptional windfall tax imposed by Spain's left-wing government to help households cope with soaring consumer prices.\n\nBBVA posted a 19 percent rise in first-quarter net profits to 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion).\n\nSabadell recorded first-quarter net profits of 308 million euros, its highest ever quarterly figure, up 50 percent from a year ago.\n\nSpain's banking sector underwent a first wave of consolidation during the 2008 financial crisis, with the collapse of provincial savings banks which were absorbed by the bigger players.\n\nIt underwent further consolidation in 2021 when Caixabank took over Bankia, creating Spain's third largest banking group, which was followed by Unicaja's acquisition of Liberbank creating Spain's fifth biggest domestic lender.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On this occasion, Sabadell has been the one that has rejected the BBVA merger proposal and opts to continue alone. Thus, they reject the \"unsolicited, indicative and conditional\" proposal.\n\nThe board chaired by Josep Oliu considers that this project \"significantly undervalues\" Banco Sabadell's plan \"and its growth prospects as an independent entity.\" The board of directors announced its decision after a day-long meeting. BBVA states that \"we regret that the board of Banco Sabadell has rejected such an attractive offer.\" Now, it remains to be seen if BBVA improves the offer or gives up taking over the bank.\n\nLast Wednesday, BBVA announced its formal proposal for Sabadell. In it, they proposed an exchange of one newly issued BBVA share for every 4.83 Sabadell shares, with a 30% premium over the value at which Sabadell was listed on Monday, April 29. It was an offer that valued Sabadell at around 11 billion euro, following the price of BBVA's last closing, of 9.84 euro per share. It also meant increasing the value of the share in Sabadell to 2.2 euro, taking into account the 30% premium.\n\nThe possible merger would form an entity with around 400 offices in the Valencian Community and about 2,500 workers in the autonomous community, with 211 offices in the region -61 in Valencia, 132 Alicante and 17 in Castell\u00f3n-, while BBVA accumulates 200.", "source": {"uri": "theleader.info", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Leader Newspaper"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_nolan@theleader.info", "name": "Mark Nolan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_communities_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomous communities of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valencia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Valencia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castell\u00f3n_de_la_Plana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Castell\u00f3n de la Plana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Castell\u00f3n de la Plana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicante", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alicante"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alicante"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencian_Community", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valencian Community"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Valencian Community"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://j6n3r3q2.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sabadell-and-BBVA-Merger-Not-Going-Ahead.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545968", "eventUri": "eng-9545968", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 1135, "textEnd": 1143}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

It would destroy many jobs, cause financial exclusion and more oligopoly,\" Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz wrote on the X social media platform.\n\nThe head of the regional government of Catalonia, Pere Aragones, echoed these concerns, telling Spanish public television the takoever would \"affect many jobs in Catalonia\".\n\nAragones is facing a regional election in Catalonia on Sunday, with polls showing he is trailing.\n\nBBVA, which also has operations in Mexico, Argentina and Turkey, is Spain's second-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation and has 74.1 million customers.\n\nSabadell operates in 14 countries and has nearly 20 million customers.\n\nThe bank had said on Monday that the initial offer \"significantly undervalues the potential of Banco Sabadell and its standalone growth prospects\".\n\nIt added that it was \"highly confident in Banco Sabadell's growth strategy and its financial targets\".\n\nSabadell also pointed to the recent \"decline and volatility in the BBVA share price\" which reflected \"the uncertainty around the value of the proposal\".\n\nBBVA then informed Sabadell in a letter that it had \"no room\" to improve its offer, which it considered generous.\n\nThe two banks had initially announced a plan to merge in November 2020 with the aim of better weathering the economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut it was scrapped just 10 days later, with Sabadell saying that BBVA's offer did not reflect the real value of its business.\n\nIn the ensuing months, Sabadell undertook a major restructuring plan to slash costs that resulted in 1,800 redundancies, with BBVA going through a similar process, shedding 3,000 jobs.\n\nBoth have since recovered as has the wider Spanish banking sector which posted record profits in recent months, despite an exceptional windfall tax imposed by Spain's left-wing government to help households cope with soaring consumer prices.\n\nBBVA posted a 19 per cent rise in first-quarter net profits to 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion).\n\nSabadell recorded first-quarter net profits of 308 million euros, its highest ever quarterly figure, up 50 per cent from a year ago.\n\nSpain's banking sector underwent a first wave of consolidation during the 2008 financial crisis, with the collapse of provincial savings banks which were absorbed by the bigger players.\n\nIt underwent further consolidation in 2021 when Caixabank took over Bankia, creating Spain's third largest banking group, which was followed by Unicaja's acquisition of Liberbank creating Spain's fifth biggest domestic lender.", "source": {"uri": "jordantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jordan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Sabadell", "type":

UrduPoint", "body": "Spain's second-largest bank BBVA announced Thursday a hostile takeover bid for smaller rival Banco Sabadell but the government vowed to block the move, which would create a European giant in the sector\n\nMadrid, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 9th May, 2024) Spain's second-largest bank BBVA announced Thursday a hostile takeover bid for smaller rival Banco Sabadell but the government vowed to block the move, which would create a European giant in the sector.\n\nBBVA's new bid came three days after Sabadell's board of directors rejected a merger proposal, saying it was \"not in the best interest\" of the bank.\n\nThe takeover proposal values Sabadell, Spain's fourth-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation, at nearly 11.5 billion euros ($12.3 billion).\n\n\"The operation will create one of the best banks in Europe,\" BBVA said in a statement.\n\nThe takeover would be carried out under same conditions as the initial approach -- an exchange of one new BBVA share for every 4.83 Sabadell shares, a 30-percent premium over the April 29 closing price of both banks, BBVA said.\n\n\"We are presenting to Banco Sabadell's shareholders an extraordinarily attractive offer to create a bank with greater scale in one of our most important markets,\" BBVA Chair Carlos Torres Vila said in the statement.\n\nA takeover would create a banking powerhouse capable of competing with Santander -- Spain's leading bank -- as well as with European giants such as HSBC and BNP Paribas.\n\nBut Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's leftist government swifty came out against the move, as did the regional government of Catalonia where Sabadell was born and where it has a strong presence.\n\nLabour Minister Yolanda Diaz said it was against Spain's \"interests\" because it \"would destroy many jobs\".\n\nEconomy Minister Carlos Cuerpo warned the government \"will have the last word when it comes to authorising the operation\".\n\nThe head of the regional government of Catalonia, Pere Aragones, echoed these concerns, telling Spanish public television the takoever would \"affect many jobs in Catalonia\".\n\nAragones is facing a regional election in Catalonia on Sunday, with polls showing he is trailing.\n\nBBVA, which also has operations in Mexico, Argentina and Turkey, is Spain's second-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation and has 74.\n\n1 million customers.\n\nSabadell operates in 14 countries and has nearly 20 million customers.\n\nThe bank had said on Monday that the initial offer \"significantly undervalues the potential of Banco Sabadell and its standalone growth prospects\".\n\nIt also pointed to the recent \"decline and volatility in the BBVA share price\" which reflected \"the uncertainty around the value of the proposal\".\n\nBBVA then informed Sabadell in a letter that it had \"no room\" to improve its offer, which it considered generous.\n\nShares in Sabadell were up by around four percent in mid-morning trading, while BBVA fell by nearly six percent.\n\nThe two banks had initially announced a plan to merge in November 2020 with the aim of better weathering the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut it was scrapped just 10 days later, with Sabadell saying that BBVA's offer did not reflect the real value of its business.\n\nIn the ensuing months, Sabadell undertook a major restructuring plan to slash costs that resulted in 1,800 redundancies, with BBVA going through a similar process, shedding 3,000 jobs.\n\nBoth have since recovered as has the wider Spanish banking sector which posted record profits in recent months, despite an exceptional windfall tax imposed by Spain's left-wing government to help households cope with soaring consumer prices.\n\nBBVA posted a 19 percent rise in first-quarter net profits to 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion).\n\nSabadell recorded first-quarter net profits of 308 million euros, its highest ever quarterly figure, up 50 percent from a year ago.\n\nSpain's banking sector underwent a first wave of consolidation during the 2008 global financial crisis, with the collapse of provincial savings banks which were absorbed by the bigger players.\n\nIt underwent further consolidation in 2021 when Caixabank took over Bankia, creating Spain's third largest banking group, which was followed by Unicaja's acquisition of Liberbank creating Spain's fifth biggest domestic lender.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Sabadell posted a record net profit of 308 million euros, up 50 percent.\n\nSpain's banking sector underwent a first wave of consolidation during the 2008 global financial crisis, with the collapse of provincial savings banks, which were absorbed by the bigger players.\n\nIt underwent further consolidation in 2021 when Caixabank took over Bankia, creating Spain's third-largest banking group, which was followed by Unicaja's acquisition of Liberbank creating Spain's fifth-biggest domestic lender.\n\nvab/hmw/bc", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors":

The second in less than four years. Yesterday the bank's board of directors, in an extraordinary meeting held in Madrid, rejected the purchase offer that BBVA had sent it last week by means of a letter. The decision of the bank's governing body - advanced by La Vanguardia - is based on the fact that \"Banco Sabadell's strategy as an independent entity will generate greater value for its shareholders\" than if it were integrated into the entity chaired by Carlos Torres, according to the statement sent to the CNMV.\n\nBBVA's reply, very brief, arrived after a few minutes: \"We regret that the board of Banco Sabadell has rejected such an attractive offer\".\n\nIn 2020, the entity chaired by Josep Oliu gave BBVA a pumpkin after a couple of weeks of negotiations, although they did not agree on the price or governance. On this occasion there were no talks (at least formal) and the council's refusal took place in less than a week. \"The proposal significantly undervalues Banco Sabadell's project and its prospects for growth as an independent entity\", specified Sabadell in its statement. The bank's governing body added that \"the significant drop and volatility in BBVA's share price in recent days generates additional uncertainty about the value of the proposal\". BBVA shares have fallen by almost 10%. According to the council of Sabadell, the rejection of the proposal is \"aligned with the interest of the clients and workers\" of the entity.\n\nFrom now on, it's up to him to move on to BBVA. It could withdraw, submit a new significantly improved offer, or launch a hostile takeover bid. The truth is that in Spain there have hardly been bank purchase operations that were not negotiated. And in this process that began last Tuesday, BBVA has always defended that its intention is to carry out an agreed operation in a friendly manner.\n\nSabadell will also have to explain to the market why its proposal alone is better than the one proposed by BBVA. Yesterday he gave some clues in the statement to the CNMV: \"The board reiterates its commitment to distribute to the shareholders, on a recurring basis, any excess capital above 13%\". And he specified that the money that could be distributed to shareholders in the years 2024 and 2025 is about 2,400 million if the dividends and the aforementioned excess capital are counted.\n\nSince BBVA's interest in Sabadell was made public, the shares of this entity have risen by 8.6%, and those of the Bilbao-based bank have fallen by 9.7%. Yesterday, after Sabadell's rejection was made public, BBVA's shares rose 3% on the New York Stock Exchange, which suggests that they may also rise on the Spanish stock market today. It is possible that in the case of Sabadell the opposite effect will occur and the quotation will adjust downward, since the rebound of the last few days is due to the fact that some investors tried to \"capture\" the premium offered by BBVA to the shareholders if the merger had finally gone ahead.\n\nUnlike what happened in 2020, this time there has been criticism of the operation by the Generalitat, employers and unions. The operation was viewed with reluctance by the Government because it meant the disappearance of an entity with operational headquarters in Catalonia. Sabadell has its headquarters in Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s, although its registered office has been in Alicante since the crisis of the 2017 referendum. Yesterday the Minister of Economy, Nat\u00e0lia Mas, called it a \"good decision\" the path taken by Sabadell. The business sector supported the decision and the unions breathed a sigh of relief that they did not have to face an employment adjustment.\n\nIn November 2020, the operation did not succeed because the entity chaired by Josep Oliu considered BBVA's offer very low, which was speculated to be close to 2.5 billion euros. Today, the capitalization of Banco Sabadell multiplies that number by four.\n\nThe Sabadell share has been revalued by 350% since the failed merger that took place in 2020 precisely because of the plan that the entity put in place to be able to remain independent. Sabadell changed its CEO, Jaume Guardiola, to C\u00e9sar Gonz\u00e1lez-Bueno, who currently manages the entity. At the same time, Oliu left the executive functions. The new team cleaned up the British subsidiary TSB. Although the initial plan was to sell it, now the situation is radically opposite and it is considered one of Banco Sabadell's main assets.\n\nThis time, the proposed merger by absorption proposed by BBVA valued Sabadell at almost 11.5 billion euros. If we take as a reference the stock market quote on Monday of last week, before BBVA's intentions were known, the premium was 30%. The exchange equation was one new BBVA share for every 4.83 Sabadell shares. Apart from the financial offer, BBVA offered Sabadell three positions on the board of directors and a vice-presidency.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press

Sabadell filed the letter to the stock market regulator.\n\n\"I understand that you are evaluating it thoroughly to give us an answer, and in this respect I consider that it is very important that your board of directors knows that BBVA has no room to improve its economic terms,\" Torres told Oliu on Sunday, according to the filing made on Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for BBVA, Spain's second-biggest bank by market value, confirmed Torres' letter but declined to comment on further steps.\n\nBBVA's letter to Sabadell, the country's number four lender, does not prevent the bank from making an improved offer later on under Spanish takeover legislation.\n\nThe bank's options still include sweetening the bid, going hostile or walking away. The BBVA spokesperson declined to comment on when the bank's board will meet.\n\nAnalysts are divided about what BBVA will do next, although the almost 5% fall in Sabadell's share price - including Wednesday's decline of over 4% - since it rejected the offer suggests investors are reluctant to bet on BBVA returning with a new offer that can convince Sabadell's board.\n\nSabadell shares, however, still trade more than 3% above the 1.7375 euros closing price on April 29, a day before BBVA formally announced it had approached Sabadell about a possible merger.\n\nAt 1112 GMT, BBVA shares were 1.2% up.\n\nBanking analyst Nuria Alvarez at Madrid-based brokerage Renta 4 said that Torres' letter had to be seen as being part of negotiations to pressure Sabadell to accept the offer.\n\n\"From a reputational point of view, BBVA should not directly walk away and try to negotiate but it is also true they have little room to improve their offer,\" Alvarez said.\n\nThe all-share offer from BBVA, unveiled last week, valued Sabadell at 12.23 billion euros ($12.9 billion). It represented a 30% premium over Sabadell's price on April 29 and valued Sabadell at 2.25875 euros per share.\n\nIn his letter, Torres said that BBVA had already \"used up all the room we had\".\n\nHe added that since Tuesday, when BBVA confirmed its approach, BBVA's market capitalisation had fallen by more than 6 billion euros until Friday's closing.\n\n\"This situation absolutely prevents us from being able to pay more premium than we are already offering, because if we were to do so it is foreseeable that our value would fall again (even by an amount higher than the premium increase we would make),\" Torres said.\n\nA subsequent rise in Sabadell's share price and a fall in BBVA's meant that by Monday's close, before Sabadell's rejection, the proposed deal valued Sabadell around 11 billion euros.\n\n($1 = 0.9306 euros) (Reporting by Jes\u00fas Aguado and Inti Landauro; additional reporting by Andr\u00e9s Gonz\u00e1lez in London; Editing by Jason Neely and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Aguado", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Aguado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucho_Gonz\u00e1lez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucho Gonz\u00e1lez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545968", "eventUri": "eng-9545968", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 314, "textEnd": 319}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 585, "textEnd": 590}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 1837, "textEnd": 1845, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

The bid was immediately criticized by the Spanish government, which said the deal could increase the risk of instability in Spain's financial system.\n\nEconomy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said in a interview with state television broadcaster TVE that the government has the final say on any deal. The deal could be bad for competition and add uncertainty and volatility to the country's financial sector, he said.\n\nRead More: Spain Says It Has Last Word to Approve BBVA Offer for Sabadell\n\nThe comments come ahead of regional elections in Catalonia on May 12, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists as the frontrunners. Sabadell is a Catalan bank and politicians in the region have raised concerns over its acquisition. The two banks employed around 140,000 people worldwide at the end of March.\n\nEven before the Spanish government's intervention, analysts noted that the offer looked unlikely to succeed. \"At these prices, the offer is not attractive,\" and should be rejected, Renta 4 analyst Nuria Alvarez said.\n\nBBVA shares fell 6% in Madrid while Sabadell rose 3%. The offer proposes an exchange ratio of one newly issued BBVA share for every 4.83 Sabadell shares and values the smaller lender at a premium of about 18% compared to Wednesday's closing price.\n\nSabadell's board abruptly spurned an earlier approach earlier this week, saying the bid \"significantly undervalues the potential of Banco Sabadell and its standalone growth prospects.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Sabadell released a May 5 letter from BBVA Chairman Carlos Torres to Sabadell's Chairman Josep Oliu in which Torres said BBVA could not improve the offer.\n\nIn the letter, Torres said that the drop in BBVA's shares after the original bid became public \"absolutely prevents us from being able to pay more.\"\n\nThe combination would create a new Spanish banking giant with a joint balance sheet of more than \u20ac1 trillion in assets. The combined market capitalization of BBVA and Sabadell would be about \u20ac70 billion, or roughly equal to the valuation of Spain's largest lender, Banco Santander SA.\n\nBBVA, which said the combined lender would have a loan market share of 22% in Spain, pledged to maintain its current shareholder distribution policy and a commitment to distribute any excess capital above 12%.\n\nThe statement from BBVA also estimated that the deal would:\n\nThe latest offer is conditional upon its acceptance by 50.1% of Sabadell shareholders. It is also contingent on various antitrust and regulatory approvals.\n\nThis is the second time BBVA is attempting to acquire Sabadell as both lenders held short-lived negotiations in late 2020 about a deal, before the talks fell apart over the price.\n\nThe latest offer values Sabadell at a price-to-tangible-book-value of close to 1, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Suitors offered a median 0.55 times book value in takeovers of European lenders announced over the past three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nEurope's bank leaders for years have emphasized the need for transformational deals to stand out in a fragmented market that's glutted with thousands of smaller, regional lenders. The lack of common deposit protection across the European Union and cumbersome regulations have stymied such efforts across borders.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nBBVA's new takeover offer for Sabadell hasn't been improved from the rejected one already sent to the prey's board, so is likely to be the last attempt, if it's also unsuccessful. The final consideration is subject to the share-price volatility of both BBVA and Sabadell.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "macarena_munoz@bnnbloomberg.ca", "name": "Macarena Mu\u00f1oz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.A._(corporation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S.A.

The board repeated that position on Thursday.\n\n\"We are presenting to Banco Sabadell's shareholders an extraordinarily attractive offer to create a bank with greater scale in one of our most important markets,\" said BBVA's Executive Chairman Carlos Torres Vila.\n\nHostile takeover bids are rare in European banking.

They called off merger talks in November 2020 after failing to agree on terms, including the price tag.\n\nSabadell has a large retail shareholder base accounting for almost half of its shares, with big institutional owners including BlackRock and Dimensional Fund Advisors.\n\nBuying Sabadell would allow BBVA to diversify from Mexico, its main market, and other developing economies such as Turkey and South America and focus on its domestic market.\n\nBBVA Chief Executive Onur Genc said, \"all stakeholders will benefit from this operation\".\n\n\"Banco Sabadell has done an excellent job, with remarkable progress in recent years, and now its shareholders can join an entity with an unparalleled combination of growth and profitability in Europe,\" Genc said.\n\nThe deal, which BBVA estimates could bring cost savings of 850 million euros before taxes, would give Sabadell shareholders a 16% stake in the combined lender.\n\nThe combined entity would overtake Caixabank as Spain's biggest domestic lender with over 625 billion euros in assets in the country, compared with Caixabank's just over 574 billion euros.\n\nSpain's banking sector has seen a period of consolidation as lenders seek to cut costs and boost scale.

Sabadell posted a record net profit of 308 million euros, up 50 percent.\n\nSpain's banking sector underwent a first wave of consolidation during the 2008 global financial crisis, with the collapse of provincial savings banks, which were absorbed by the bigger players.\n\nIt underwent further consolidation in 2021 when Caixabank took over Bankia, creating Spain's third-largest banking group, which

the bank.\n\nThe takeover proposal values Sabadell, Spain's fourth-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation, at nearly 11.5 billion euros ($12.3 billion).\n\n\"The operation will create one of

proposal\".\n\nBBVA then informed Sabadell in a letter that it had \"no room\" to improve its offer, which it considered generous.\n\nShares in Sabadell were up by around four percent in mid-morning trading, while BBVA fell by nearly six percent.\n\n- Bank consolidation -\n\nThe two banks had initially announced a plan to merge in November 2020 with the aim of better weathering the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut it was scrapped just 10 days later, with Sabadell saying that BBVA's offer did not reflect the real value of its business.\n\nIn the ensuing months,

fourth-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation, at nearly 11.5 billion euros ($12.3 billion).\n\nSabadell on Monday said its board had \"carefully considered the proposal\" but had concluded that it was \"not in the best interest\" of the bank and its shareholders.\n\nBBVA then informed Sabadell in a letter that it had \"no room\" to improve its offer, which it considered generous.\n\nThe two banks had initially announced a plan to merge in November 2020 with the aim of better weathering the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut it was scrapped just 10 days later, with Sabadell saying that BBVA's offer did not reflect the real value of its business.\n\nA merger would have created a banking powerhouse capable of competing with Santander -- Spain's leading bank -- as well as with European giants such as HSBC and BNP Paribas.\n\nBBVA, which also has operations in Mexico, Argentina and Turkey, is Spain's second-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation and has 74.1 million customers.\n\nSabadell operates in 14 countries and has nearly 20 million customers.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [],

Sabadell's shares rose around nine per cent in the days after the offer, while BBVA fell almost 10 per cent.\n\nTorres said: \"This situation absolutely prevents us from being able to pay more premium than we are already offering, because if we were to do so it is foreseeable that our value would fall again (even by an amount higher than the premium increase we would make).\n\n\"The messages received from investors and analysts over the last five days are equally clear in this regard, and therefore agree with our analysis regarding the economic impact of the transaction for BBVA.\"\n\nSabadell and BBVA previously called off merger talks in November 2020 after disagreeing on the terms and price of the deal.\n\nThe breakdown was reportedly triggered in part by a clash over the valuation of TSB, one of Britain's biggest high street banks, which Sabadell bought for \u00a31.7bn in 2015.", "source": {"uri": "cityam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityAM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lars_mucklejohn@cityam.com", "name": "Lars Mucklejohn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSB_Bank_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TSB Bank (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Sabadell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Banco Sabadell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santander,_Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santander, Spain"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santander, Spain"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/002-tsb-branch-1-57ed4cced0b6d-57ed4ccee21e3.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545968", "eventUri": "eng-9545968", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 267, "textEnd": 272}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 1006, "textEnd": 1014, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 2431, "textEnd": 2444}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

The president of BBVA was referring to reality to the entity's solvency ratio, in which good quality capital equals 12.67% of assets. The ECB requires 8.75% and the margin with respect to this requirement is 14,260 million euros. However, anything that is to deteriorate this ratio below 12% is anathema in the banking sector, so BBVA would not force this way. In the Sabadell proposal, the bank had already been very careful in indicating that it would barely reduce the ratio by 0.3 points.\n\nThe experts consulted assume that, to launch a takeover bid for Sabadell, BBVA would have to resort to bond issues and financing formulas. A capital increase would be completely ruled out, due to the penalizing effect of appealing to the shareholders themselves.\n\nThe bank understands that, in the absence of cross-border mergers in Europe, Sabadell is its best fit. In 2020, he sold the business in the United States for 9.7 billion euros and tackled a first merger attempt with the Catalan bank, which was experiencing problems, especially in its British subsidiary TSB. Having failed in that attempt, BBVA obtained the first bank in Turkey, which, added to its position in Mexico, has only increased its dependence on emerging countries. Sabadell's British subsidiary would now give it a base in the United Kingdom that is particularly suitable for balancing the business.\n\nIn the proposed share exchange, BBVA valued the Sabadell share at 2.25 euros, which gives a total of 12,200 million over the bank as a whole. However, the proposal was in shares and barely gave Sabadell 16% of the capital of the resulting group.\n\nSabadell is in an excellent moment on the stock market and on an upward trajectory. TSB is now clean and it is reasonable that its current managers want to continue to develop the project.\n\nThe analysts cited by Bloomberg assign a value of 1.93 euros to the Sabadell share, above the 1.89 euros at which they closed yesterday. Despite the movements, these days Sabadell's and BBVA's quotes have not come close to the proposed change, which suggests that the market had doubts about its success and even about the possibility of an opahostil.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSB_Bank_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TSB Bank (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_706c0.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545968", "eventUri": "eng-9545968", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

If the improvement is modest, it is difficult for Sabadell to change their mind; and if there is a hostile takeover, BBVA's solvency must be measured to the millimeter. All options are open, including of course complete withdrawal or launching into another operation. Analysts today juggle every possibility.\n\nA first clarification is that BBVA's margin is relative, despite having 5.4 billion euros of freely available reserves. \"Our base scenario is an improvement in the offer, but we will have to see to what extent BBVA is willing to deteriorate its profit per share and its capital,\" warns Nuria \u00c1lvarez, from Renta 4. Of course, we would also have to ask \"how much Sabadell needs more,\" he adds.\n\nA report from the US bank Citi published today sees a path forward for an improvement in the proposal in which a cash payment is added, raising Sabadell's share price to 2.6 euros, compared to 2.25 euros in the previous years. is valued in the exchange of shares. It is equivalent to valuing Sabadell at more than 14,000 million, compared to the nearly 12,000 million in the BBVA proposal.\n\nThe operation, he says, makes \"industrial sense\", but adding the cash payment has its cost for BBVA: for every 1.1 billion in cash it pays, its solvency ratio will decline between 0.25 and 0.3 points.\n\nFor Santander analysts, \"it is difficult to imagine additional negotiations between both parties,\" in view of the way in which the Sabadell board rejected the operation yesterday. BBVA's options are now \"limited\" and are reduced to two: launch a hostile takeover bid in search of acceptance of two-thirds of Sabadell's capital to be able to absorb it or, otherwise, \"forget the operation and leave the banking sector.\" Spanish as today.\"\n\nBoth Bankinter and Autonomous analysts see it as \"unlikely that both parties will be able to reach an agreement\", which leads the latter to allude to the possibility of a hostile takeover \"as a way for BBVA to save face\". His message is that BBVA \"does not desperately need Sabadell.\" The bank is also not known for being \"aggressive\" in operations, so you may decide to look elsewhere. He could even try to approach Unicaja, although it may not be entirely strategic, he says.\n\nFrom CaixaBank BPI, the impression is that \"there is still the possibility that BBVA opts for a hostile offer\", given that on the Sabadell board there is only one member elected by shareholders, David Mart\u00ednez. He also believes that the bank chaired by Carlos Torres could return with an improved offer.\n\nAnd what would that second best offer be like? JBCapital believes that BBVA could raise the offer by 10% and even add a \"cash component\", although it does not believe that this will change the opinion of the Sabadell board. \"We think that BBVA should think about looking at alternative options to deploy its excess capital,\" he says, before assigning a \"marginal\" probability to the hostile takeover.\n\nEnrique Reina, banking partner at Accuracy, also believes that \"a hostile takeover would be the worst scenario\" that \"would not interest anyone,\" among other things because it would \"cloud the market\" and generate \"instability.\" BBVA, he recalls, has high liquidity and resources after leaving the United States in 2020.\n\nFrom Alantra, the intuition is that BBVA will not improve the offer or opt for the hostile route, which would disfigure a bank's history characterized by \"financial discipline.\" Its shares have already fallen 10% and it is unlikely that it will push the issue further, as \"a friendly offer and a cash payment might even now seem inconsistent.\"\n\nAntonio Castelo, analyst at iBroker.es, does not rule out any option, but sets a bar for BBVA: 2.3 per share. \"If it is not in cash and is below that, it is difficult for Sabadell shareholders to take it,\" he says.\n\nFor Kepler analysts, a hostile takeover would be \"very risky\" and could be \"a nightmare\" for the ECB. He sees a mixed solution as more feasible, in which, without deteriorating BBVA's solvency, 2.46 euros can be reached according to a mix of shareholders and cash. 87% in titles and 13% in cash.\n\nFrom the credit rating agency Fitch the message is not very risky. The only thing he can specify is that, \"if the operation does not go ahead, we do not see negative effects on either bank.\" A few days ago, S\n\nWhatever happens, you must do it quickly. \"We think that the market expects a quick resolution of this interaction, in one sense or another,\" say Mediobanca analysts.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Solvency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Sabadell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Banco Sabadell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CaixaBank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CaixaBank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_the_Philippine_Islands", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of the Philippine Islands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankinter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankinter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicaja", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unicaja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santander,_Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santander, Spain"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santander, Spain"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitch_Ratings", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fitch Ratings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I\u00f1igo_Mart\u00ednez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "I\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediobanca", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mediobanca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit rating agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_e6b25.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545968", "eventUri": "eng-9545968", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

vows to block BBVA's hostile bid for rival bank", "body": "Spain's second-largest bank BBVA announced Thursday a hostile takeover bid for smaller rival Banco Sabadell but the government vowed to block the move, which would create a European giant in the sector.\n\nBBVA's new bid came three days after Sabadell's board of directors rejected a merger proposal, saying it was \"not in the best interest\" of the bank.\n\nThe takeover proposal values Sabadell, Spain's fourth-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation, at nearly 11.5 billion euros ($12.3 billion).\n\n\"The operation will create one of the best banks in Europe,\" BBVA said in a statement.\n\nThe takeover would be carried out under same conditions as the initial approach -- an exchange of one new BBVA share for every 4.83 Sabadell shares, a 30-percent premium over the April 29 closing price of both banks, BBVA said.\n\n\"We are presenting to Banco Sabadell's shareholders an extraordinarily attractive offer to create a bank with greater scale in one of our most important markets,\" BBVA Chair Carlos Torres Vila said in the statement.\n\nA takeover would create a banking powerhouse capable of competing with Santander -- Spain's leading bank -- as well as with European giants such as HSBC and BNP Paribas.\n\nBut Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's leftist government swifty came out against the move, as did the regional government of Catalonia where Sabadell was born and where it has a strong presence.\n\nLabour Minister Yolanda Diaz said it was against Spain's \"interests\" because it \"would destroy many jobs\".\n\nEconomy Minister Carlos Cuerpo warned the government \"will have the last word when it comes to authorising the operation\".\n\nThe head of the regional government of Catalonia, Pere Aragones, echoed these concerns, telling Spanish public television the takoever would \"affect many jobs in Catalonia\".\n\nAragones is facing a regional election in Catalonia on Sunday, with polls showing he is trailing.\n\n- 'Undervalues' Sabadell -\n\nBBVA, which also has operations in Mexico, Argentina and Turkey, is Spain's second-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation and has 74.1 million customers.\n\nSabadell operates in 14 countries and has nearly 20 million customers.\n\nThe bank had said on Monday that the initial offer \"significantly undervalues the potential of Banco Sabadell and its standalone growth prospects\".\n\nIt also pointed to the recent \"decline and volatility in the BBVA share price\" which reflected \"the uncertainty around the value of the proposal\".\n\nBBVA then informed Sabadell in a letter that it had \"no room\" to improve its offer, which it considered generous.\n\nShares in Sabadell were up by around four percent in mid-morning trading, while BBVA fell by nearly six percent.\n\n- Bank consolidation -\n\nThe two banks had initially announced a plan to merge in November 2020 with the aim of better weathering the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut it was scrapped just 10 days later, with Sabadell saying that BBVA's offer did not reflect the real value of its business.\n\nIn the ensuing months, Sabadell undertook a major restructuring plan to slash costs that resulted in 1,800 redundancies, with BBVA going through a similar process, shedding 3,000 jobs.\n\nBoth have since recovered as has the wider Spanish banking sector which posted record profits in recent months, despite an exceptional windfall tax imposed by Spain's left-wing government to help households cope with soaring consumer prices.\n\nBBVA posted a 19 percent rise in first-quarter net profits to 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion).\n\nSabadell recorded first-quarter net profits of 308 million euros, its highest ever quarterly figure, up 50 percent from a year ago.\n\nSpain's banking sector underwent a first wave of consolidation during the 2008 global financial crisis, with the collapse of provincial savings banks which were absorbed by the bigger players.\n\nIt underwent further consolidation in 2021 when Caixabank took over Bankia, creating Spain's third largest banking group, which was followed by Unicaja's acquisition of Liberbank creating Spain's fifth biggest domestic lender.\n\nvab/ds/lth\n\nMore from this section\n\nIMG Travel Protection Plans Are Now Available Through TravelInsurance.com

to block BBVA's hostile bid for rival bank", "body": "Spain's second-largest bank BBVA announced Thursday a hostile takeover bid for smaller rival Banco Sabadell but the government vowed to block the move, which would create a European giant in the sector.\n\nBBVA's new bid came three days after Sabadell's board of directors rejected a merger proposal, saying it was \"not in the best interest\" of the bank.\n\nThe takeover proposal values Sabadell, Spain's fourth-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation, at nearly 11.5 billion euros ($12.3 billion).\n\n\"The operation will create one of the best banks in Europe,\" BBVA said in a statement.\n\nThe takeover would be carried out under same conditions as the initial approach -- an exchange of one new BBVA share for every 4.83 Sabadell shares, a 30-percent premium over the April 29 closing price of both banks, BBVA said.\n\n\"We are presenting to Banco Sabadell's shareholders an extraordinarily attractive offer to create a bank with greater scale in one of our most important markets,\" BBVA Chair Carlos Torres Vila said in the statement.\n\nA takeover would create a banking powerhouse capable of competing with Santander -- Spain's leading bank -- as well as with European giants such as HSBC and BNP Paribas.\n\nBut Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's leftist government swifty came out against the move, as did the regional government of Catalonia where Sabadell was born and where it has a strong presence.\n\nLabour Minister Yolanda Diaz said it was against Spain's \"interests\" because it \"would destroy many jobs\".\n\nEconomy Minister Carlos Cuerpo warned the government \"will have the last word when it comes to authorising the operation\".\n\nThe head of the regional government of Catalonia, Pere Aragones, echoed these concerns, telling Spanish public television the takoever would \"affect many jobs in Catalonia\".\n\nAragones is facing a regional election in Catalonia on Sunday, with polls showing he is trailing.\n\n- 'Undervalues' Sabadell -\n\nBBVA, which also has operations in Mexico, Argentina and Turkey, is Spain's second-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation and has 74.1 million customers.\n\nSabadell operates in 14 countries and has nearly 20 million customers.\n\nMore from this section Mayor Adams, officials break ground on Battery Coastal Resilience Project to protect Lower Manhattan Big Rise in Emergencies Involving Synthetic Weed Among Kids, Adults Prince Harry suffers brutal snub as Royal Family members join King Charles at Buckingham Palace\n\nThe bank had said on Monday that the initial offer \"significantly undervalues the potential of Banco Sabadell and its standalone growth prospects\".\n\nIt also pointed to the recent \"decline and volatility in the BBVA share price\" which reflected \"the uncertainty around the value of the proposal\".\n\nBBVA then informed Sabadell in a letter that it had \"no room\" to improve its offer, which it considered generous.\n\nShares in Sabadell were up by around four percent in mid-morning trading, while BBVA fell by nearly six percent.\n\n- Bank consolidation -\n\nThe two banks had initially announced a plan to merge in November 2020 with the aim of better weathering the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut it was scrapped just 10 days later, with Sabadell saying that BBVA's offer did not reflect the real value of its business.\n\nIn the ensuing months, Sabadell undertook a major restructuring plan to slash costs that resulted in 1,800 redundancies, with BBVA going through a similar process, shedding 3,000 jobs.\n\nBoth have since recovered as has the wider Spanish banking sector which posted record profits in recent months, despite an exceptional windfall tax imposed by Spain's left-wing government to help households cope with soaring consumer prices.\n\nBBVA posted a 19 percent rise in first-quarter net profits to 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion).\n\nSabadell recorded first-quarter net profits of 308 million euros, its highest ever quarterly figure, up 50 percent from a year ago.\n\nSpain's banking sector underwent a first wave of consolidation during the 2008 global financial crisis, with the collapse of provincial savings banks which were absorbed by the bigger players.\n\nIt underwent further consolidation in 2021 when Caixabank took over Bankia, creating Spain's third largest banking group, which was followed by Unicaja's acquisition of Liberbank creating Spain's fifth biggest domestic lender.\n\nvab/ds/lth",

Spain's number two bank, chaired by Carlos Torres, which tried to buy the fifth largest bank, Banco de Sabadell chaired by Josep Oliu, through a friendly merger proposal which was rebuffed, has now decided to go to the market and present an offer to its shareholders. The board of directors of the Basque-origin BBVA decided this Wednesday afternoon to launch an offer for 100% of the Catalan bank's shares, at the same price as the merger offer it made on April 30th, despite the opposition of the Sabadell board.\n\nAfter days of tense back and forth between the two financial institutions, the move made by the larger bank was expected, and it has not wasted any time in acting. Thus, the Spanish banking sector will once again experience a hostile takeover bid, something that has not happened since the 80s.\n\nBBVA's offer does not improve on last week's, nor does it pay part in cash, which was expected if the bank decided to take this step. The Basque bank is again proposing one BBVA share for 4.83 Sabadell shares, a price which, although it represented a 30% premium when it was announced, was made less attractive for Sabadell shareholders due to the performance of both on the stock market. BBVA will carry out a capital increase for the to provide for the exchange.\n\nIn the letter that Torres sent to Oliu on Sunday night, BBVA already warned that it considered its offer had been generous and had no room to improve it. Thus it has kept the same prices now as it moves to buy 100% of the bank on the market.\n\nBBVA has not given many more details of the offer, since, being hostile, it does not need to negotiate with the Sabadell council. As it informed the CNMV, the bank will publish the offer prospectus, which must include all the details and plans for the entity it is bidding to acquire, within two weeks. The offer, of course, is formulated exclusively on the Spanish market, the only stockmarket on which Sabadell's shares are traded.\n\nThe swap proposed, one BBVA share for 4.83 Sabadell shares, represents a premium of 30% over the closing prices of the two institutions on April 29th and 50% over the weighted 3-month average, the same as it offered to the Catalan bank last week.\n\nTorres continues to state that this is an \"extraordinarily attractive\" offer, as the BBVA chair president argued in a statement in which he emphasized that Sabadell's shareholders will have a 16% stake in the resulting entity.\n\nBBVA communicated this news to the market around 7am this Thursday morning, three days after Sabadell rejected its friendly offer on Monday afternoon. Although it has already advanced that the offer launched today on the market is conditional on obtaining more than 50.01% of Banco Sabadell's share capital, the approval of BBVA's General Shareholders' Meeting and the approval of the National Commission on Markets and Competition (CNMC) and the UK Prudential Regulation Authority.\n\nIt also stated that the operation would be closed in a period between six and eight months, once it receives the necessary authorizations.

The letter arrived just the day before the Sabadell board of directors meeting in which it was decided to reject the proposal.\n\nThe communication was through an email, reports El Mundo. Sabadell has made the content of the letter public through a statement to the CNMV (National Securities Market Commission). At the opening of the session this Wednesday, Sabadell's shares suffered a fall of close to 4%, while those of BBVA started with increases. The fall in Sabadell shares would show that investors have ruled out any possibility of improving the offer.\n\nIn the text the executive acknowledged that \"since last Tuesday the market has also made it clear that there is no further possibility of an increase, since BBVA's market capitalization has decreased in the period by more than 6,000 million. This situation absolutely prevents us from being able to pay more premium than what we already offer, because if we did, it is foreseeable that our value would fall again (even by an amount greater than the increase in premium that we would make).\"\n\nThe president of BBVA indicated that \"the messages received from investors and analysts these five days are equally clear in this sense, and therefore coincide with our analyzes regarding the economic impact of the operation for BBVA.\"\n\nIn the letter, Torres added that \"in our proposal we have already exhausted all the space we had, having maintained a 30% premium despite the great relative rise in your stock from mid-April to the 29th.\" The executive took the opportunity to recall the contents of the offer: \"the proposed exchange ratio (4.83x, equivalent to 2.26 euros per share at the time of making the offer) represents a significant premium of 30% compared to the prices of the April 29. But the premium is 48% compared to the prevailing prices when our Council considered it, in mid-April.\n\nFinancial sources explain that before the presentation of Sabadell's quarterly results, BBVA asked Sabadell to hold a meeting.

The message was published in full by Sabadell on Wednesday.\n\nThe stance may help explain why Sabadell abruptly rejected the BBVA proposal on Monday saying that it \"significantly undervalues the potential of Banco Sabadell and its standalone growth prospects.\" That decision came even though some at Sabadell were said to be initially open to starting talks.\n\nBBVA proposed all-stock deal would have valued the smaller bank at a 30% premium to its closing price on April 29 -- or about \u20ac12 billion ($13 billion) -- and a 48% uplift to its market value in mid-April. The deal would have given Sabadell shareholders a 16% stake in the combined company.\n\nSabadell shares declined 3.5% in Madrid trading, the worst performing European bank Wednesday. BBVA advanced 1.1%.\n\nRead the full message from Torres below:\n\nCommunication from BBVA's chair to Sabadell on May 5\n\n\"I am writing to you as a follow-up to the e-mail I sent you last Tuesday in which I attached our proposal with the terms for a merger. I understand that you are evaluating it thoroughly to give us an answer, and in this respect I consider that it is very important that your Board of Directors knows that BBVA has no room to improve its economic terms.\n\nAs you know, the proposed exchange ratio (4.83x, equivalent to \u20ac2.26 per share at the time of the offer) represents a significant premium of 30% over the prices of April 29. However the premium is 48% compared to the prices prevailing when it was considered by our Board in mid-April, a figure that far exceeds the premium we were considering to offer at that time in order to start negotiations. In other words, in our proposal we have already used up all the room we had, after having maintained a premium of 30% despite the large relative increase of your shares from mid-April to 29 April.\n\nIn addition, since last Tuesday the market has also made it clear that there is no further upside, as BBVA's market capitalization has fallen in the period by more than \u20ac6bn. This situation absolutely prevents us from being able to pay more premium than we are already offering, because if we were to do so it is foreseeable that our value would fall again (even by an amount higher than the premium increase we would make). The messages received from investors and analysts over the last five days are equally clear in this regard, and therefore agree with our analysis regarding the economic impact of the transaction for BBVA.\n\nI am at your disposal for any clarification you may need regarding our proposal.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Sabadell", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Banco Sabadell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.A._(corporation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.A.

create a European banking giant.\n\nThe new bid would be carried out under the same conditions as the merger proposal rejected by Sabadell's board of directors -- an exchange of one new BBVA share for every 4.83 Sabadell shares, BBVA said in a statement sent to the Spanish stock market regulator CNMV.\n\nThis offer values Sabadell, Spain's fourth-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation, at nearly 11.5 billion euros ($12.3 billion).\n\nSabadell had said Monday that its board had \"carefully considered\" the initial offer but concluded that it was \"not in the best interest\" of the bank.\n\n\"The board believes that the proposal significantly undervalues the potential of Banco Sabadell and its standalone growth prospects,\" it explained, saying it was \"highly confident in Banco Sabadell's growth strategy and its financial targets\".\n\nIt also pointed to the recent \"decline and volatility in the BBVA share price\" which reflected \"the uncertainty around the value of the proposal\".\n\nBBVA then informed Sabadell in a letter that it had \"no room\" to improve its offer, which it considered generous.\n\nBBVA president Carlos Torres Vila is scheduled to take part in a press conference on Thursday at noon (1000 GMT) to discuss its hostile takeover bid for Sabadell.\n\nA merger would have created a banking powerhouse capable of competing with Santander -- Spain's leading bank -- as well as with European giants such as HSBC and BNP Paribas.\n\nBBVA, which also has operations in Mexico, Argentina and Turkey, is Spain's second-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation and has 74.1 million customers.\n\nSabadell operates in 14 countries and has nearly 20 million customers.\n\nThe two banks had initially announced a plan to merge in November 2020 with the aim of better weathering the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut it was scrapped just 10 days later, with Sabadell saying that BBVA's offer did not reflect the real value of

The securities are now trading at 1.8 euros, still above the 1.73 euros they were at before BBVA's intentions were published.\n\nSome analyst reports published yesterday, such as that of Autonomus, were along those lines. \"We doubt that BBVA will attempt a hostile offer, which will most likely conclude the second attempt to purchase Sabadell here,\" after the one in November 2020, the report says.\n\nTorres' letter was sent on Sunday, reports El Mundo. It was the day before the Sabadell board of directors meeting in which it was decided to reject the proposal. In it, BBVA maintained that it could not \"pay more premium\" than what was already offered. It was all or nothing.\n\nIn the text, the executive also recognized the erosion suffered by BBVA's share price since the announcement of its merger proposal. \"Since last Tuesday, the market has also made it clear that there is no further possibility of an increase, since BBVA's market capitalization has decreased by more than 6,000 million in the period,\" he pointed out.\n\nFaced with the fall of the Sabadell, the BBVA share is recovering the losses suffered these days in the stock market, with which the positions return, at least partially, to those prior to the announcement of the proposal. Yesterday it rose 0.9%, to 10.29 euros, still below the 10.9 euros on April 29. It is normal that the drop in recent days, which is a consequence of the purchase announcement, is compensated by the disappearance of the merger option.\n\nOliu had already maintained previous initial contacts with his counterparts at the bank of Basque origin and of which they had informed the Bank of Spain before it was communicated to the CNMV, as reported by La Vanguardia. According to sources familiar with the process, BBVA made a first contact with Sabadell in mid-April about the possibility of resuming the rigged merger talks in 2020. The intention was to start a slower process for the operation to mature. However, when the British channel Sky News reported the information on April 30, the CNMV issued a request to BBVA, which had to recognize its plan and prevented opening a negotiation.\n\nSources indicate that BBVA also held a board of directors meeting in mid-April in which this issue was addressed. They also affirm that before the presentation of Sabadell's quarterly results, BBVA asked the Catalan bank to hold a meeting on this matter, without negotiations ever taking place.\n\nSabadell continues with its agenda and yesterday, Wednesday, a round of meetings with analysts and investors began in London to inform them of the results of the first quarter. It is assumed that in these meetings the attention of the investment community will continue to focus at least in part on what has happened these days.\n\nYesterday, both the Minister of Economy, Carlos Body, and the opposition leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, agreed to distance themselves from the BBVA and Sabadell plans. Their messages are about \"respect\" for decisions and attention to the competitive environment, which is one of the elements that has generated the most concern these days among businessmen.\n\nThe president of the National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC), Cani Fern\u00e1ndez, revealed yesterday that BBVA contacted the regulator last week, in the middle of the offer, to report on the effects of the operation. It was, as she said, a \"courtesy contact\" made by \"the parties\" without further implications, since their teams cannot begin to analyze an operation of this nature until there is a binding agreement.\n\nThe CNMC's criteria regarding a possible new concentration operation in the banking sector would be similar to that applied in both the CaixBank and Bankia files and that of Unicaja and Liberbank. The methodology consists of studying market by market and area by area in accordance with the \"necessity and proportionality\" tests. The objective is to know the intensity of the competition in each case, without intending to \"hinder business work.\"", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press

- UrduPoint", "body": "Spain's second-largest bank BBVA on Thursday announced a hostile takeover bid for smaller rival Banco Sabadell but the government vowed to block the move, which would create a European giant in the sector\n\nMadrid, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 9th May, 2024) Spain's second-largest bank BBVA on Thursday announced a hostile takeover bid for smaller rival Banco Sabadell but the government vowed to block the move, which would create a European giant in the sector.\n\nThe move came three days after Sabadell's board of directors rejected a merger proposal from BBVA on the grounds it \"significantly undervalues\" the bank.\n\nBBVA's proposal values Sabadell, Spain's fourth-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation, at nearly 11.5 billion euros ($12.3 billion).\n\nIt would be carried out under the same conditions as the initial approach -- an exchange of one new BBVA share for every 4.83 Sabadell shares, BBVA said.\n\n\"This is an extraordinarily attractive offer,\" BBVA chairman Carlos Torres Vila told a news conference, saying the two lenders were \"complementary\".\n\nA takeover would create a banking powerhouse capable of competing with Santander -- Spain's leading bank -- as well as with European giants such as HSBC and BNP Paribas.\n\nBut Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's left-wing government denounced the move, as did the regional government of Catalonia where Sabadell was founded and has a strong presence.\n\n- 'Potentially damaging' -\n\nLabour Minister Yolanda Diaz said it was against Spain's \"interests\" and \"would destroy many jobs\".\n\nAnd Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said the government would \"have the last word when it comes to authorising the operation\" which he said would be \"potentially damaging\".\n\nBut Torres Vila said he was convinced \"the government and other authorities will come to appreciate the true value of the operation\", which would increase \"lending capacity\" to businesses and individuals.\n\nThe takeover bid will need a green light from the European Central Bank as well as the competition authorities in the countries where both lenders operate, including Spain and Britain.\n\nThe proposal is now in the hands of Sabadell's shareholders.\n\nOn the Madrid stock exchange, shares in Sabadell closed 3.17 percent higher, while BBVA fell by 6.71 percent.\n\nThe hostile takeover bid has also raised the hackles of unions, which fear job losses.\n\nThis move \"could be the first in a new wave of consolidations driven by greed for profits that would increase problems of competition.. and financial exclusion\" in parts of the population, warned the CCOO union in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The bid was immediately criticized by the Spanish government, which said the deal could increase the risk of instability in Spain's financial system.\n\nEconomy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said in an interview with the state television broadcaster TVE that the government has the final say on any deal. The deal could be bad for competition and add uncertainty and volatility to the country's financial sector, he said.\n\nThe comments come ahead of regional elections in Catalonia on May 12, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists as the front-runners. Sabadell is a Catalan bank and politicians in the region have raised concerns over its acquisition. The two banks employed around 140,000 people worldwide at the end of March.\n\nEven before the Spanish government's intervention, analysts noted that the offer looked unlikely to succeed. \"At these prices, the offer is not attractive\" and should be rejected, Renta 4 analyst Nuria Alvarez said.\n\nBBVA shares fell 6% in Madrid while Sabadell rose 3%. The offer proposes an exchange ratio of one newly issued BBVA share for every 4.83 Sabadell shares and values the smaller lender at a premium of about 18% compared to Wednesday's closing price.\n\nSabadell's board abruptly spurned an approach earlier this week, saying the bid \"significantly undervalues the potential of Banco Sabadell and its stand-alone growth prospects.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Sabadell released a May 5 letter from BBVA Chairman Carlos Torres to Sabadell's Chairman Josep Oliu in which Torres said BBVA could not improve the offer.\n\nIn the letter, Torres said that the drop in BBVA's shares after the original bid became public \"absolutely prevents us from being able to pay more.\"\n\nThe combination would create a new Spanish banking giant with a joint balance sheet of more than \u20ac1 trillion of assets. The combined market capitalization of BBVA and Sabadell would be about \u20ac70 billion, or roughly equal to the valuation of Spain's largest lender, Banco Santander SA.\n\nBBVA, which said the combined lender would have a loan market share of 22% in Spain, pledged to maintain its current shareholder distribution policy and a commitment to distribute any excess capital above 12%.\n\nThe statement from BBVA also estimated that the deal would:\n\nThe latest offer is conditional upon its acceptance by 50.1% of Sabadell shareholders. It is also contingent on various antitrust and regulatory approvals.\n\nThis is the second time BBVA is attempting to acquire Sabadell as both lenders held short-lived negotiations in late 2020 about a deal, before the talks fell apart over the price.\n\nThe latest offer values Sabadell at a price-to-tangible-book-value of close to 1, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

plan to merge in November 2020 with the aim of better weathering the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut it was scrapped just 10 days later, with Sabadell saying that BBVA's offer did not reflect the real value of its business.\n\n- Banking sector consolidation -\n\nIn the ensuing months, Sabadell undertook a major restructuring plan to slash costs that resulted in 1,800 redundancies, with BBVA going through a similar process, shedding 3,000 jobs.\n\nBoth have since recovered as has the wider Spanish banking sector which posted record profits in recent months, despite an exceptional windfall tax imposed by Spain's left-wing government to help households cope with soaring consumer prices.\n\nBBVA posted a 19 percent rise in first quarter net profits, which rose to 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), up from 1.84 billion euros in the same period a year earlier.\n\nSabadell recorded first quarter net profits of 308 million euros, its highest ever quarterly figure, up 50 percent on the same period in 2023.\n\nSpain's banking sector underwent a first wave of consolidation during the 2008 financial crisis, with the collapse of provincial savings banks which were absorbed by the bigger players.\n\nIt underwent further consolidation in 2021 when Caixabank took over Bankia, creating Spain's third largest banking group, which was followed by Unicaja's acquisition of Liberbank creating Spain's fifth biggest domestic lender.\n\nvab/ds/lth", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

takeover bid", "body": "MADRID, May 9 -- Spain's second-largest bank BBVA announced Thursday a hostile takeover bid for its smaller rival Sabadell, three days after an earlier approach which would create a European banking giant was rejected.\n\nThe new bid would be carried out under the same conditions as the merger proposal rejected by Sabadell's board of directors -- an exchange of one new BBVA share for every 4.83 Sabadell shares, BBVA said in a statement sent to the Spanish stock market regulator CNMV.\n\nThis offer values Sabadell, Spain's fourth-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation, at nearly \u20ac11.5 billion (US$12.3 billion).\n\nSabadell on Monday said its board had \"carefully considered the proposal\" but had concluded that it was \"not in the best interest\" of the bank and its shareholders.\n\nBBVA then informed Sabadell in a letter that it had \"no room\" to improve its offer, which it considered generous.\n\nThe two banks had initially announced a plan to merge in November 2020 with the aim of better weathering the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut it was scrapped just 10 days later, with Sabadell saying that BBVA's offer did not reflect the real value of its business.\n\nA merger would have created a banking powerhouse capable of competing with Santander -- Spain's leading bank -- as well as with European giants such as HSBC and BNP Paribas.\n\nBBVA, which also has operations in Mexico, Argentina and Turkey, is Spain's second-largest banking group in terms of capitalisation and has 74.1 million customers.\n\nSabadell operates in 14 countries and has nearly 20 million customers. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [],

The shares are now trading at 1.80 euros, still above the 1.73 euros they were at before BBVA's intentions were published.\n\nSome analyst reports that were published yesterday, such as that of Autonomus, were along these lines. \"We doubt that BBVA will attempt a hostile offer, so this is where Sabadell's second purchase attempt will most likely end\", after the attempt in November 2020, says the report.\n\nTorres' letter was sent on Sunday, reports El Mundo. It was the day before the meeting of Sabadell's board of directors in which it was decided to reject the proposal. BBVA stated at the meeting that it could not \"pay more premium\" than what was already offered. It was all or nothing.\n\nIn the text, the executive also acknowledged the wear and tear that BBVA's share price has suffered since the announcement of the merger proposal. \"Since Tuesday, the market has also made it clear that there is no further possibility of an increase, since BBVA's stock market capitalization has fallen in the period by more than 6,000 million\", he pointed out.\n\nFaced with the fall of Sabadell, the BBVA share is recovering the losses it has suffered these days on the stock market, so that the positions return, at least partially, to those prior to the announcement of the proposal. Yesterday it rose by 0.9%, to 10.29 euros, still below the 10.90 euros of April 29. It is normal that the fall of the last few days, which is a consequence of the purchase announcement, is compensated by the disappearance of the merger option.\n\nOliu had already maintained previous initial contacts with his counterparts at the bank of Basque origin and about which they had warned the Bank of Spain before it communicated to the CNMV, as reported by La Vanguardia. According to sources familiar with the process, BBVA made initial contact with Banco Sabadell in mid-April about the possibility of resuming the merger talks called in 2020. The intention was to start a more leisurely process so that the operation matures. However, when the British channel Sky News advanced the information on April 30, the CNMV made a request to BBVA, which had to recognize its plan and prevented it from opening a negotiation.\n\nSources indicate that BBVA also held a board meeting in mid-April in which this issue was addressed. They also claim that before the presentation of Banco Sabadell's quarterly results, BBVA asked the Catalan bank to hold a meeting on this matter, without at any time negotiating.\n\nBanco Sabadell is pushing ahead with the agenda and yesterday a series of meetings with analysts and investors began in London to inform them of the results of the first quarter. It is taken for granted that in these meetings the attention of the investment community will continue to be focused at least in part on what has happened these days.\n\nYesterday both the Minister of Economy, Carlos Cuerpo, and the leader of the opposition, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, agreed to distance themselves from the plans of BBVA and Banco Sabadell. Their messages are about \"respect\" for decisions and attention to the competition environment, which is one of the elements that have generated the most concern these days among employers.\n\nThe president of the National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC), Cani Fern\u00e1ndez, revealed yesterday that BBVA contacted the regulator last week, in full supply, to report the effects of the operation. It was, he said, a \"courtesy contact\" made by \"the parties\" without further implications, since their teams cannot begin to analyze an operation of this nature until there is a binding agreement.\n\nThe criteria of the CNMC in the face of an eventual high concentration operation in the banking sector would be similar to that applied both to the file of CaixBank and Bankia and to that of Unicaja and Liberbank. The methodology consists of studying market by market and zone by zone, as well as the \"necessity and proportionality\" tests. The aim is to know the intensity of the competition in each case, without the intention of \"obstructing the business task\".", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Securities_Market_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Securities Market Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Sabadell", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Sabadell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Vanguardia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Vanguardia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mundo_(Spain)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Mundo (Spain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_(autonomous_community)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basque Country (autonomous community)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Basque Country (autonomous community)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Economy_(Spain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Economy (Spain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberbank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberbank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusto Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cani_(Spanish_footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cani (Spanish footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proportional representation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_N\u00fa\u00f1ez_Feij\u00f3o", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_bf0f8.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545968", "eventUri": "eng-9545968", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 2326, "textEnd": 2334}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 3046, "textEnd": 3054}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 1347, "textEnd": 1360}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

From today everything can change, since many analysts believe that there will be a second assault by the bank chaired by Carlos Torres, but this time offering cash. BBVA remains silent and the market tries to fine-tune its shot while making its speculations.\n\nThe fact that Sabadell remains above the price prior to the offer (8%) may be due to investors trusting the solo strategy or because they are expecting a counteroffer. Analysts do not question that Sabadell can distribute the 2.4 billion euros via dividends to which it committed on Monday after rejecting BBVA's proposal. A report by Alantra estimates that \"Sabadell aims for 1.5 billion euros of net profit per year.\" Jaume Puig, general director of GVC Gaesco Gesti\u00f3n, believes that Sabadell \"has no problem remaining alone\", although he assumes that there will be a counteroffer. A part of the market also expects it because BBVA shares are still 6% below the level prior to the offer.\n\nFor Nuria \u00c1lvarez, from Renta 4, if Sabadell has maintained its grip on the stock market it is because the bank \"has now been valued.\" \"BBVA has done the math\" and, even if it was with a different intention, it has shown that Sabadell was trading below its potential. As for BBVA, investors are \"waiting.\" It rises in the stock market, but it does not recover all the lost value because there is still a probability of new movements.\n\nThis vision is shared by other analysts. Antonio Castelo, from iBroker, thinks that \"Sabadell was trading at a ridiculously low price\" and that \"now the market knows how much it is worth.\" BBVA, on the other hand, \"has put its cards on the table\" and it is already known that \"it wants to gain size in Spain\", so the market awaits news. From XTB, Manuel Pinto assures that \"this is not over yet\" and that \"it is hard to believe that BBVA does not have an ace up its sleeve.\"\n\nThese comments reflect the state the market was in yesterday, dominated by conjectures and assumptions. Meanwhile, BBVA watches over weapons and does not go beyond the brief message published after learning of Sabadell's rejection. He \"regrets\" the refusal and reiterates that his proposal was \"attractive.\" Its president was in Mexico yesterday, at a meeting of regional directors.\n\nThe unknown now is whether BBVA will improve the proposal with a cash payment, if it will launch a hostile takeover bid or if it will withdraw. Of the three hypotheses, the first was very much alive yesterday in the analysts' reports. If there is another approach, it must be generous enough to convince Sabadell, but not so much as to damage BBVA's solvency.\n\nCiti sees a path to an improvement up to 2.6 euros in cash, Santander considers a negotiation between the parties \"difficult\", Autonomous warns of a possible hostile takeover, CaixaBank BPI does not close the door to any option, JBCapital believes that BBVA could raise the offer by 10%, Accuracy warns of the risk of entering into corporate battle and Kepler agrees that an aggressive counterattack is \"very risky.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the governor of the Bank of Spain, Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez de Cos, assured yesterday, after refusing to evaluate the specific operation, that \"it may be a good time to pay attention to what is the optimal level\" of concentration in the banking sector, taking into account taking into account that \"before it was below the European average and now it exceeds it.\" \"It is a question to analyze,\" he added during his appearance in Congress and in response to the ERC spokesperson, In\u00e9s Granollers, who conveyed her concern about the level of competition in Spanish banking.

The proposed all-stock deal valued the smaller bank at a 30% premium to its closing price on April 29 -- or about \u20ac12 billion ($13 billion). It also offered to give Sabadell shareholders a 16% stake in the combined company.\n\nSuch an acquisition would create a behemoth with more than \u20ac1 trillion ($1.1 trillion) of assets and a market value of roughly \u20ac70 billion, rivaling Spain's largest lender, Banco Santander SA.\n\nBBVA shares rose 1.6% as of 10:15 a.m. in Madrid on Tuesday while Sabadell was down 1.9%. Shares of Sabadell are up about 7% since the initial approach on April 30, while BBVA's have slumped around 8%.\n\nBBVA likely has \"some wiggle room on price\" and Sabadell probably has not fully closed the door to future negotiations although the two parties currently seem a long way away from finding middle ground, RBC analyst Benjamin Toms wrote in a note.\n\nIn its statement Monday, Sabadell said the sharp decline in BBVA's stock \"adds uncertainty\" to the proposal.\n\nA spokesperson for BBVA said: \"We regret that the board of Banco Sabadell has rejected such an attractive offer.\"\n\nThe two lenders held short-lived negotiations in late 2020 about a combination before the talks fell apart over the price tag. At the time, Sabadell was in worse shape. It had problems in its UK unit TSB and was facing questions over provisions linked to mortgages and its sprawling small- and medium-enterprises business, one of the largest in Spain, amid the economic collapse caused by the pandemic.\n\nSabadell's valuation has soared since then, and it fixed the UK unit while rising interest rates have boosted the European banking industry as a whole.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Sabadell", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Sabadell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.A._(corporation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S.A.

The decision was adopted at a BBVA board of directors meeting held yesterday and it is a hostile takeover bid.\n\nThe offer is formulated as an exchange and in it the bank would exchange 4.83 shares of the Catalan entity for each of its own securities. According to the current evolution of the shares, it is equivalent to valuing Sabadell's share price at 2.12 euros, or the total capital at 12,376 million euros.\n\nThe hostile takeover is conditional on reaching a level of acceptance of Sabadell's capital of 50.01%, so it is not exclusionary. With this percentage, BBVA could consolidate 100% of Sabadell's results in its accounts.\n\nBBVA maintains the commitment that there is a double operational headquarters, in Madrid and in Sant Cugat, and that the Sabadell brand is maintained in some territories. It will give the current Sabadell shareholders, as already planned, 16% of BBVA's capital.\n\nHis character is hostile when he appears despite the Sabadell board of directors' rejection this Monday of last week's friendly merger proposal.\n\nAfter Sabadell's refusal, BBVA had defended that its proposal was \"attractive.\" On Sunday, one day before Sabadell's decision, the president of BBVA, Carlos Torres, had sent a letter to the Catalan bank, Josep Oliu, in which he told him that there was no room to improve conditions.\n\nBBVA has in its favor that Sabadell's capital is very fragmented and there is no hard core of shareholders with representative holdings capable of opposing it.\n\nSabadell sources do not comment when asked about the offer launched by BBVA. The bank remains in the same position already announced by its board, which said that the offer \"significantly undervalues\" the entity.\n\nBBVA now assures that the proposal is \"exceptionally favorable\" and will have \"very positive financial impacts thanks to relevant synergies and the complementarity and excellence of both entities.\"\n\nIt will give rise, he says, to \"one of the best European banks\", with a loan share close to 22% in Spain. BBVA will maintain its current shareholder remuneration policy and its commitment to distribute any excess capital above 12%. The operation will force BBVA to increase capital, which will require the approval of its shareholders meeting.\n\nThe entire offer is in shares, although since the exchange is not in whole numbers, BBVA will pay the \"peaks\", as indicated to the CNMV, in cash.\n\nThe forecast is that the takeover bid will be presented in \"the first half of the maximum period of one month\" established by the rule, that is, in less than fifteen days. However, non-opposition from the ECB is required, and the CNMV will not authorize it until it is obtained.\n\nBBVA already owns a small portion of Sabadell's capital, just 0.18%, corresponding to derivatives to cover client positions.\n\n\"We present Banco Sabadell shareholders with an extraordinarily attractive offer to create an entity with greater scale in one of our most important markets,\" says the president of BBVA.\n\n\"Together we will have a greater positive impact in the territories in which we operate, with an additional credit granting capacity of 5,000 million euros per year in Spain,\" he adds.\n\nThe resulting economic concentration, tells the CNMV, requires the approval of the CNMC to gauge its effect on competition.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Sabadell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Banco Sabadell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sant_Cugat_del_Vall\u00e8s", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derivative (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_df6bf.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545968", "eventUri": "eng-9545968", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Spanish banking group BBVA has proposed a hostile takeover of smaller peer Banco Sabadell, taking its \u20ac12.2bn offer directly to shareholders after the latter's board rejected an approach earlier this week.\n\nThe deal represents a 30% premium to the closing price of Banco Sabadell as of 29 April - the day before talks began - and a 50% premium to the weighted average share price over the past three months.\n\nSabadell's management has already responded to BBVA's earlier offer, saying it significantly undervalued the bank, prompting BBVA to address its target's shareholders directly with a formal offer.\n\nHowever, according to an interview on Spanish television, Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said the Spanish government - which has the power to block any merger - is opposed to the hostile takeover.\n\nBBVA said the deal would have \"very positive financial impacts\" due to operational synergies and complementary services, creating one of the biggest banks in Europe, holding 22% of the loan market in Spain.\n\nThe merger would result in Sabadell shareholders holding a 16% stake in the combined entity, while giving BBVA shareholders \"clear value creation\" with earnings per share expected to improve by 3.5% once complete.\n\n\"We are presenting to Banco Sabadell's shareholders an extraordinarily attractive offer to create a bank with greater scale in one of our most important markets,\" said BBVA chair Carlos Torres Vila.\n\n\"Together we will have a greater positive impact in the geographies where we operate, with an additional \u20ac5bn loan capacity per year in Spain.\"\n\nThis month's approach follows a collapsed takeover talks back in 2020 after both parties failed to agree on terms.\n\nSabadell shares were up 3.5% at \u20ac1.86 by 1252 in Madrid while BBVA was down 6% at \u20ac9.68.", "source": {"uri": "lse.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "London South East"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Sabadell", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Sabadell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Economy,_Industry_and_Competitiveness_(Spain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (Spain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Torres_Vila_(banker)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Torres Vila (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static.lse.co.uk/images/logo-og.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545968", "eventUri": "eng-9545968", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 307, "textEnd": 315}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

It reiterated this position on Thursday as BBVA took its all-share offer directly to the bank's shareholders.BBVA said its takeover offer has the same financial terms as the merger offered to Sabadell's board. It characterized the proposal -- which would create Spain's second-largest financial institution if successful -- as \"extraordinarily attractive.\"\"We are presenting to Banco Sabadell's shareholders an extraordinarily attractive offer to create a bank with greater scale in one of our most important markets,\" BBVA Chair Carlos Torres Vila said in a statement.\"Together we will have a greater positive impact in the geographies where we operate, with an additional \u20ac5 billion loan capacity per year in Spain.\"Shares of BBVA fell 6% at around midday London time on Thursday, while Sabadell's stock price rose more than 3%.'Not so easy'Hostile takeover bids are not common in the European banking sector and BBVA's decision to proceed in this way has taken many by surprise.Carlo Messina, CEO of Italy's biggest bank Intesa Sanpaolo, told CNBC on Wednesday that there were significant challenges to domestic consolidation within the region's banking sector. He said it was difficult to complete a \"friendly transaction\" in the current market environment, whereas proceeding with a hostile takeover bid was also \"not so easy to do.\"David Benamou, chief investment officer at Axiom, said BBVA's offer for Sabadell was reflective of \"a very strange situation indeed.\"Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Thursday, Benamou said the proposed offer \"makes sense\" from Sabadell shareholders' point of view and, in his opinion, was likely to go through. He cited the fact that BBVA's offer represents a 30% premium over the closing price of both banks as of April 29th.\"It echoes to the recent discussions in Switzerland with the consolidation of Credit Suisse by UBS and all the worries about financial stability,\" he added.\"I think the execution of the transaction might be rather difficult, although you can argue it is the same geography, the culture is theoretically very close as opposed to a cross-border merger.\"Benamou said a burgeoning trend of consolidation among European banks was a logical one, particularly because many regional lenders are \"very small\" compared to their U.S. peers.Signage outside a Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA), right, and a Banco Sabadell SA, left, bank branch in Barcelona, Spain, on Wednesday, May 1, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSpain's Economy Ministry said in a statement that the gov ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Sabadell", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Sabadell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Torres_Vila_(banker)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Torres Vila (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.A._(corporation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.A.

With the offer rejected by the leadership of the entity chaired by Josep Oliu, the ball is now in the court of the shareholders, who have to decide whether or not to accept the proposal to exchange 4.83 shares of the Catalan bank for one of BBVA.\n\nAccording to the current stock market evolution, it is equivalent to valuing Sabadell's share price at 2.12 euros, or the total capital at 12,376 million euros. Sabadell shares rose 3% around mid-session, up to 1.86 euros per share. For its part, BBVA shares fell sharply, 6%, below 10 euros (9.66 euros).\n\nIf all shareholders accept, they will have 16% of BBVA's capital. The hostile takeover is conditional on reaching a level of acceptance of Sabadell's capital of 50.01%, so it is not exclusionary. BBVA maintains the commitment that there is a double operational headquarters, in Madrid and in Sant Cugat, and that the Sabadell brand is maintained in some territories.\n\n\"This movement was something the market did not expect and it indicates to us the conviction that BBVA management has in the synergies that could be generated,\" comments Javier Cabrera, XTB analyst. \"From our point of view, the problems lie in greater market concentration and the regulatory risk of the operation. Not to mention that they also have to reach an acceptance of 50.01%. Therefore, the operation is not yet closed,\" he adds.\n\nFor their part, Bankinter experts are more forceful and do not believe that the operation will go ahead, since the takeover bid presents the same conditions already offered, under the same conditions already known. The entity reaffirms that \"it is unlikely that this takeover bid will go ahead under these terms because it offers a simple exchange of shares that, with yesterday's trading closings, implies a premium of 18.4%.\"\n\nFrom Renta4, their analysts consider that at the proposed price, \"the offer is not attractive,\" and they assure that they would not attend the takeover bid.\n\nLast week's offer already generated a crossroads of opinions among the leaders. Sabadell already said when rejecting the offer that it \"significantly undervalues\" the entity. BBVA, for its part, maintains that the proposal is \"exceptionally favorable.\"\n\nFor their part, Banca March analysts indicate that after the launch of the hostile takeover bid, \"the ball is now in the court of the shareholders of Banco Sabadell, an entity that has a high level of fragmentation.\" In this regard, they assure that the key to the operation could revolve around the position of the large investment funds, where up to 71 of them have simultaneous participations in both entities, among which those of BlackRock, Norges and Vanguard Group stand out. , which have a joint 10.2% in Sabadell and 17.9% in BBVA.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Sabadell", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Sabadell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankinter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankinter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sant_Cugat_del_Vall\u00e8s", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leandro_Cabrera", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leandro Cabrera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investment fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banca_March", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Banca March"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BlackRock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_6f626.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545968", "eventUri": "eng-9545968", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Furthermore, Banco Sabadell shareholders will hold a 16.0 percent stake in the resulting entity, benefiting from the value generated by the deal.\n\nThe transaction also represents a clear value creation for BBVA shareholders. According to BBVA's estimates, this transaction is positive in earnings per share (EPS) from the first year after the subsequent merger of both entities, with an improvement of about 3.5 percent once the savings associated with the merger are materialized, which are estimated at around \u20ac850 million before taxes. Additionally, the tangible book value per share improves around 1 percent on the date of the merger. The operation offers a high return on investment (ROIC\u00b2 close to an incremental 20 percent for BBVA shareholders). All of this, with a limited impact on the CET1 capital ratio, of approximately -30 basis points\u00b3. BBVA will maintain a growing and attractive shareholder distributions' policy, which currently involves distributing between 40 percent and 50 percent of profit, combining cash dividends and buybacks. The bank will also remain committed to distributing any excess capital above 12%\u2074.\n\nThe transaction will also benefit all remaining stakeholders. Customers will have access to a unique value proposition, thanks to the complementarity of the franchises, a greater product offering and the bank's global reach. Employees will benefit from new professional opportunities to grow in a global bank. The creation of a stronger, more profitable institution will also result in more financing for companies and families and a greater contribution via taxes. All of this will translate into greater economic and social progress.\n\n\"All stakeholders will benefit from this operation,\" said BBVA CEO Onur Gen\u00e7. \"Banco Sabadell has done an excellent job, with remarkable progress in recent years, and now its shareholders can join an entity with an unparalleled combination of growth and profitability in Europe.\"\n\nBBVA maintains its commitment in all the markets where it operates and from a position of greater strength, it will increase its support to businesses, as well as cultural, scientific and social sectors through its banking activity and foundations. The new bank will have double operational headquarters in Spain: one in the Banco Sabadell corporate center in Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s (Barcelona) and the other in Ciudad BBVA, in Madrid. BBVA considers that the integration of both entities also increases the potential of Barcelona as a European hub for startups. The use of the Sabadell brand will remain in use together with the BBVA brand in those regions or businesses in which it may have a relevant commercial impact.\n\nFollowing the closing of the deal, BBVA will be Spain's second largest financial institution, one of the most relevant markets for the Group, and with good future prospects. In this sense, expected growth for Spanish GDP stands above that of the average of the eurozone countries (2.1 percent expected growth in 2024 and 2 percent in 2025, compared to an average eurozone growth of 0.7 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively). Furthermore, there has been a significant deleveraging of families and companies since the 2008 crisis, with current debt levels lower than those of the eurozone. All of this, together with an environment in which interest rates, although with an expected decline, will maintain reasonable levels for the banking business, constitute growth levers for the financial system. Spain is also a market with an attractive profitability. BBVA Spain had a profitability\u2075 of 19 percent at the end of 2023.\n\nWith data at the end of 2023, the resulting entity shows a credit investment of \u20ac265 billion and a market share in loans close to 22 percent in the Spanish market (13.8 percent for BBVA and 8.1 percent for Banco Sabadell).\n\nThese are two very complementary banks, both for their geographical diversification and their strengths in customer segments. In Spain, Banco Sabadell is a leader in SMEs, with a share of 12.7 percent versus 11.5 percent for BBVA, while BBVA is stronger in retail banking, with a share of 14.7 percent, compared to 6.3 percent for Banco Sabadell.\n\nOne of BBVA's priorities in this integration is to preserve the best talent of both institutions. All decisions to integrate the workforce will be guided by principles of professional competence and merit, without adopting traumatic measures and with all guarantees. Additionally, BBVA expects the technological integration to take between 12 and 18 months.\n\nThe offer is subject to acquiring more than 50.01 percent of Banco Sabadell, the approval of the Shareholders' General Meeting, and the approvals of the Spanish Market and Competition regulator (CNMC) and the U.K.'s Prudential Regulation Authority. The closing of the operation is expected to take between six to eight months, once regulatory authorizations have been obtained. JP Morgan SE, UBS Europe SE, Rothschild & Co, Garrigues and DWP are BBVA's advisors for the operation.", "source": {"uri": "bbva.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NEWS BBVA"}, "authors": [],

It reiterated this position on Thursday as BBVA took its all-share offer directly to the bank's shareholders.\n\nBBVA said its takeover offer has the same financial terms as the merger offered to Sabadell's board. It characterized the proposal -- which would create Spain's second-largest financial institution if successful -- as \"extraordinarily attractive.\"\n\n\"We are presenting to Banco Sabadell's shareholders an extraordinarily attractive offer to create a bank with greater scale in one of our most important markets,\" BBVA Chair Carlos Torres Vila said in a statement.\n\n\"Together we will have a greater positive impact in the geographies where we operate, with an additional \u20ac5 billion loan capacity per year in Spain.\"\n\nShares of BBVA fell 6% at around midday London time on Thursday, while Sabadell's stock price rose more than 3%.\n\nHostile takeover bids are not common in the European banking sector and BBVA's decision to proceed in this way has taken many by surprise.\n\nCarlo Messina, CEO of Italy's biggest bank Intesa Sanpaolo, told CNBC on Wednesday that there were significant challenges to domestic consolidation within the region's banking sector.\n\nHe said it was difficult to complete a \"friendly transaction\" in the current market environment, whereas proceeding with a hostile takeover bid was also \"not so easy to do.\"\n\nDavid Benamou, chief investment officer at Axiom, said BBVA's offer for Sabadell was reflective of \"a very strange situation indeed.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Thursday, Benamou said the proposed offer \"makes sense\" from Sabadell shareholders' point of view and, in his opinion, was likely to go through. He cited the fact that BBVA's offer represents a 30% premium over the closing price of both banks as of April 29th.\n\n\"It echoes to the recent discussions in Switzerland with the consolidation of Credit Suisse by UBS and all the worries about financial stability,\" he added.\n\n\"I think the execution of the transaction might be rather difficult, although you can argue it is the same geography, the culture is theoretically very close as opposed to a cross-border merger.\"\n\nBenamou said a burgeoning trend of consolidation among European banks was a logical one, particularly because many regional lenders are \"very small\" compared to their U.S. peers.\n\nSpain's Economy Ministry said in a statement that the government rejects BBVA's hostile takeover bid for Sabadell, \"both in form and substance.\"\n\nThe ministry also warned that the proposed deal \"introduces potential harmful effects on the Spanish financial system.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com",

Our priority is to consult with impacted colleagues to ensure they fully supported, maximising redeployment opportunities where we can.\"\n\nAs at the end of 2023, TSB had around 5,400 employees and 211 branches. In February Sabadell confirmed plans to cut jobs and close branches as part of restructuring plan. It did not put a number on either, however.\n\nThe latest update came as it emerged that the chair of Spanish rival BBVA had told Sabadell it had \"no room\" to improve its takeover bid a day before the offer was rejected.\n\nIn an email sent to Sabadell chair Josep Oliu, his counterpart at BBVA, Carlos Torres, wrote: \"I consider that it is very important that your board of directors knows that BBVA has no room to improve its economic terms.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The market has also made it clear that there is no further upside, as BBVA's market capitalisation has fallen in the period by more than \u20ac6bn.\n\n\"This situation absolutely prevents us for being able to pay more premium than we are offering, because if we were to do so it is foreseeable that our value would fall again.\"\n\nBBVA made an all-share offer initially worth \u20ac12bn for Sabadell last week. However, BBVA's share price then fell sharply, undermining the valuation.\n\nSabadell, which acquired TSB in 2015, rejected the bid on Monday, noting at the time that the board was \"highly confident\" about the lender's current growth strategy and financial targets.", "source": {"uri": "lse.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "London South East"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSB_Bank_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TSB Bank (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Sabadell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Banco Sabadell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unite the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static.lse.co.uk/images/logo-og.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545968", "eventUri": "eng-9545968", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

after its merger bid was rejected.\n\nThe Catalan bank's board decided against the \u20ac12.2 billion deal from it's Basque rivals on Monday.\n\nBBVA will now attempt to bypass Sabadell's board and woo its shareholders directly instead.\n\nSabadell's ownership structure is divided between institutional investors (52%) and retail investors (48%), and BBVA will have to convince at least 50% of them to take up their offer.\n\nREAD MORE: Hundreds join protest against controversial solar farm on Spain's Costa Blanca that 'threatens wildlife and 10,000 trees'\n\nThe hostile takeover bid remains unchanged from the one previously rejected by Sabadell's board, with BBVA proposing an exchange ratio of one BBVA share for every 4.83 Sabadell shares.\n\nThe Spanish government, which has signalled its disapproval of BBVA's hostile approach, will provide another obstacle to overcome.\n\nEconomy Minister Carlos Cuerpo pointed out the government has the 'final say' on the matter and the merger must undergo the necessary regulatory approvals.\n\nHowever BBVA have cited the potential benefits of the merger.\n\nThey include increased profitability, cost savings of around \u20ac850 million annually, and a stronger position to compete with the big boys in the European market.\n\nREAD MORE: Toll charges will NOT be removed on the AP-7 on the Costa del Sol: Spain's central government

outlining the offer details and the request for authorization to the Spanish Securities and Exchange Commission (CNMV) within the one-month deadline.\n\nThe bid will have to jump through hoops put up by various regulatory bodies, both in Spain and abroad.\n\nThe Spanish National Competition Commission (CNMC), the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority (due to Sabadell's UK subsidiary TSB), and the BBVA's board, who will have to approve of a capital increase to generate the new shares for the exchange, will all have a say.\n\nThe bank estimates the closing of the transaction to take between six

The comments came shortly after BBVA took its \u20ac11.5 billion ($12.4 billion) bid directly to Sabadell shareholders after having an initial proposal rebuffed by that lender's board earlier this week.\n\nRead More: BBVA Makes $12 Billion Hostile Bid for Sabadell After Snub (2)\n\nEven before the Spanish government's intervention, analysts had noted that the offer, which would create a new Spanish banking giant with a joint balance sheet of more than \u20ac1 trillion in assets, may struggle to sway shareholders. The rebuke from the government lengthens those odds.\n\nBy inserting itself so overtly and controversially at the center of one of Europe's biggest banking takeover deals in years, the government will inevitably invite criticism about how it's putting a thumb on the scale and weighing in on the grounds of domestic politics.\n\nThe political survival of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez hinges on support for his Socialist party from two pro-independence parties and he will be tested this weekend in regional elections that will mark the return of Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan separatist who led a failed secession and was granted an amnesty by Sanchez.\n\nSabadell is a Catalan bank and named after a city near Barcelona. It moved its fiscal domicile to the neighboring region of Valencia in 2017 after hundreds of companies fled Catalonia at the height of a failed independence push.\n\nThe Socialists are poised to come in first but are expected to fall short of a majority -- with the two pro-independence parties in second and third place. The optics will focus on how Sanchez is seeking to curry favor with Catalan voters by rushing to protect a local and vulnerable lender. That is not lost on Puigdemont.\n\n\"For some time, there's been a strategy to kill the Catalan banking industry, and that harms both the customers and the region,\" Puigdemont said in a post on X on Thursday. The hostile offer \"must be responded to with full force, with all the law and with all reason.\"\n\nComplicating matters further, BBVA's fiscal domicile is in the northern Basque Country, where it is one of the biggest tax payers, meaning it also has important relations with the local, nationalist Basque government.\n\nStill, BBVA's Chairman Carlos Torres offered an optimistic interpretation to the government's intervention.\n\n\"We have elections coming up on Sunday and in that sense it's a politically charged environment,\" he told analysts in a call Thursday morning. \"But I am confident that the government will appreciate the value of the transaction.\"\n\nTorres also has work to do to persuade both sets of shareholders of the merits of a deal that Sabadell's board has said \"significantly undervalues the potential of Banco Sabadell and its standalone growth prospects.\"\n\nThe offer, which proposes an exchange ratio of one newly issued BBVA share for every 4.83 Sabadell shares, values Sabadell at a price-to-tangible-book-value of close to 1, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Suitors offered a median 0.55 times book value in takeovers of European lenders announced over the past three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nWhile Sabadell shares rose about 3% to \u20ac1.86 euros a share in Madrid on Thursday that's still below the price of around \u20ac2 a share implied by the offer. BBVA shares were down around 6%.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nBBVA's new takeover offer for Sabadell hasn't been improved from the rejected one already sent to the prey's board, so is likely to be the last attempt, if it's also unsuccessful. The final consideration is subject to the share-price volatility of both BBVA and Sabadell, with our calculations showing it represents a premium of less than 10% to Sabadell's current share price, valuing the target at a price-to-tangible-book-value of close to 1.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Torres has announced that some Sabadell shareholders are interested in selling, he has trusted that the Government will appreciate the movement, he has said that there will be no \"traumatic\" exits, he has not ruled out the appearance of competing offers and has recalled that there is no room to improve it. . The main messages have been the following:\n\nInterest in the Sabadell shareholding. \"There have been investors from Sabadell who have contacted us for an offer like the one we presented,\" said Torres. Some of them are \"relevant\", although their percentage of capital will not be known until the end of the acceptance period.\" In the conference with analysts first thing in the morning, he had assured: \"We have contacted Sabadell shareholders to find out their impression\" and \"we have received expression of interest.\" \"I would congratulate Sabadell shareholders,\" he stated.\n\nThe rejection of the Government and the authorizations. \"I trust that the Government will appreciate the benefits of the operation,\" said Torres. The president of the bank \"respects the opinion\" of the Minister of Economy, Carlos Body, who rejects the takeover bid. The operation \"will support the economy much more\" because \"more taxes will be paid and more credit will be distributed,\" he said.\n\nThe takeover bid requires the approval of the ECB, the CNMV, the CNMC and the UK competition authorities. It would allow BBVA to add more than 50% of Sabadell's capital, receive dividends and consolidate accounts, but not carry out a merger by absorption, which would require the approval of the Ministry of Economy. \"We respect the opinion expressed by the Government and we trust that the Government and the rest of the authorities will end up appreciating the operation.\" The bank has already contacted supervisors such as the ECB or the Bank of Spain.\n\nThe rejection of Sababell. \"The easy thing would have been to abandon the project after Sabadell's rejection, but that is not what they pay us for, so we have the responsibility of defending the shareholders and presenting the proposal to those of Sabadell so that they can decide,\" he said, before. to say that he \"respects\" the opinion of the board of the Catalan bank. \"This is not a plan B, but honoring what we have been doing,\" he had previously commented to analysts.\n\nAbout the \"white knight\" and the room for improvement. Regarding the possibility of a competing offer appearing, he stated that \"it is feasible that there may be other companies with interest in a competing offer.\" In any case, there would be no takeover war because BBVA \"has already said that it sees no room for improvement.\"\n\nFace-to-face contacts in April. Torres has revealed that in mid-April he had a \"face-to-face meeting\" with the president of Sabadell, Josep Oliu, to which he conveyed \"BBVA's interest in a merger.\" \"We were scheduled to deliver the proposal on April 30, but a leak prevented the meeting from taking place and precipitated the events.\"\n\nConditions of the proposal. It has confirmed that \"everything remains\" with respect to the initial proposal, including the double corporate headquarters and the partial use of the Sabadell brand. However, \"this is not the time to talk about corporate governance\", alluding to the proposal to give a vice-presidency and three directors to the Catalan bank.\n\nAbout friendship and hostility. The president of BBVA has said that the approach \"now is different.\" However, he has stated that \"at no time has there been an unfriendly or hostile character.\"\n\nStock price. He has described the takeover bid as \"extraordinarily attractive\" even \"without including a cash component.\" \"I believe that our proposal can give figures higher\" than the 2,400 million euros of excess capital that Sabadell has committed to distributing among its shareholders.\n\nCatalonia: \"It is a decided commitment to Catalonia, to that area of Spain in which we already have a relevant area,\" he assured. \"It would be unintelligent for us to want to grow in that territory if we did not have a positive vision\" and the operational centers would be respected, he stated.\n\nThe Catalan electoral campaign. Torres has acknowledged that this episode \"occurs in the last push of the campaign.\" \"Nothing is further from our intention. The timing has had to do with the leaks and the idea was not absolute that the plan would be so fast,\" he noted.\n\nTemplate cuts. Torres has stated that \"there may be some departures of people in the short term\", but BBVA has \"a lot of experience\" in doing so \"with non-traumatic measures and with programs that usually have enormous acceptance by the staff.\"\n\nThe calendar. The offer brochure, he explained, will be presented in less than two weeks, after which regulatory authorizations will be collected, in a process that could last \"about six months\", in which a BBVA shareholders meeting should be held. to approve a capital increase. At that moment the exchange period will begin, which could last \"a few more months.\" In total, it would be eight months.\n\nDoubts about the competition. Torres has assured that in Spain there is sufficient banking offer and that \"in all market share metrics the resulting group would be below CaixaBank.\" He has assured that \"credit will not be restricted to companies\" because, if that were the case, the operation would not be carried out.\n\nLarger groups. On the other hand, he considers that \"in Europe, larger business sectors are needed, with sufficient scale to compete on a global scale.\" \"This is a step on this path,\" she stated. \"The ECB likes there to be consolidation and larger entities, with cross-border operations and its opinion is on the favorable side,\" he indicated.\n\nAlicante. The headquarters of the future group would be in Bilbao, where BBVA is domiciled. Alicante would lose the headquarters of Sabadell. \"We are aware of the importance of developing activity in this region,\" he said about the Valencian province.\n\nVillarejo Case: \"There is no impact,\" he stated regarding the possibility that an oral trial could be opened against the bank for this matter.\n\nA takeover bid for Unicaja? Could Sabadell counterattack by opposing Unicaja? \"It would be a circumstance that would have a more complicated path to the extent that due to the offer legislation they would have to raise it to their general meeting,\" he noted. \"It's not something we fear.\"", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Economy_(Spain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Economy (Spain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u201322_Primera_Divisi\u00f3n_RFEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021\u201322 Primera Divisi\u00f3n RFEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provinces of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CaixaBank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CaixaBank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baloncesto_M\u00e1laga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baloncesto M\u00e1laga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicante", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alicante"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alicante"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bilbao"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bilbao"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencian_Community", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valencian Community"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Valencian Community"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_728ab.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545968", "eventUri": "eng-9545968", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 3280, "textEnd": 3288}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

If going hostile damaged BBVA's reputation then \"so be it\", he said.\n\nTorres, a 16-year veteran of BBVA and chair since 2018, has been eyeing Sabadell ever since the 2020 attempt failed.\n\nBut he had doubts Oliu would ever agree to sell a bank the 75-year old Catalan has headed since 1999, according to two bankers familiar with Torres' thinking.\n\nTorres said on Thursday that he had met with Oliu in mid-April and was preparing to detail proposed merger terms on April 30 before news of the takeover leaked to the media, scuppering the meeting and forcing his hand.\n\nSince the 2020 takeover talks, Sabadell shares have risen five-fold, while BBVA's have gained more than 160%.\n\nAnalysts said BBVA's ability to offer more and still squeeze out sufficient cost savings was limited.\n\nNEVER EASY\n\nTorres and CEO Onur Gen, also in his role since 2018, have led a surge in growth at BBVA by betting big on Mexico and Turkey. The bank's market cap recently approached long-time rival Santander, a bank with significantly more in assets.\n\nBut analysts and investors have begun to flag an over-reliance on Mexico, where business has boomed, and the appeal of Spain where higher interest rates have swelled bank coffers.\n\nClinching European banking deals has never been easy, with politics often impeding progress even as European Central Bank supervisors have encouraged greater consolidation across Europe's fragmented industry.\n\nThe proposal leaves Sabadell, which has enlisted the help of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as advisers, with limited options.\n\nAnalysts at Berenberg said they were reassured by Torres' comments that he did not see supervisory obstacles to the deal and that political opposition would be short-lived.\n\n\"He (Torres) believes that the transaction creates a bank that can better support the society and makes sense for Spain as a country as well (having stronger banks),\" they said.\n\nSabadell's CEO - in the role since shortly after the aborted 2020 talks - and the bank's CFO cancelled their London meetings on Thursday and were rushing back to Madrid, two sources close to the matter said.\n\nTorres and his team will now be seeking to persuade regulators of the merits of the deal, which the bank said could take six months, before formally going to shareholders.\n\n($1 = 0.9281 euros) (Additional reporting by Emma Pinedo and Charlie Devereux in Madrid.

The operation mirrors the offer that the management of the entity chaired by Josep Oliu had on the table: an exchange of 4.83 shares of the Catalan bank for one of BBVA. As it is an unsolicited operation and already rejected by the board, it is called hostile. In detail, what is a hostile takeover and what will happen now?\n\nA takeover bid is a purchase offer made by one company over another. As the CNMV, the stock market regulator, explains, \"it is an operation by one or more individuals or companies offering all shareholders of a listed company the purchase of their shares (...) in exchange for a price. Although it is usually in cash, this price can also be in shares or mixed (money and shares).\"\n\nBroadly speaking, it can be friendly, which implies that it has been agreed between the offeror and the reference shareholders or managers of the entity that wants to buy; u hostile, an offer that has no prior agreement or has not been supported by management. \"This qualification does not prejudge its possible interest for shareholders,\" says the CNMV.\n\nThe hostile takeover is what happens in this case. Last week, BBVA already tried to agree on a merger with the management of Sabadell, which after meeting on Monday decided to reject the offer. \"Banc Sabadell's strategy as an independent entity will generate greater value for its shareholders,\" defended the entity's leadership. Better alone.\n\nThe current one is, therefore, an unsolicited offer, rejected from the top. BBVA now decides to launch a hostile takeover bid: its proposal is addressed to all Sabadell shareholders, who will be the ones who decide what to do.\n\nInstead of offering a price for the shares, BBVA offers an exchange of securities. If all Sabadell shareholders accept the offer, they will have 16% of the capital of the future entity, as had already been proposed in the first offer from the bank chaired by Carlos Torres.\n\nThe proposed exchange, in accordance with the current evolution of the shares, is equivalent to valuing Sabadell's share price at 2.12 euros, or the entire capital at 12,376 million euros. This Wednesday Sabadell shares closed at 1.80 euros.\n\nThe takeover bid is conditional on a minimum acceptance level of 50.01%.\n\nHostile takeovers in the banking world are unusual in our country. For example, the last major operation, the merger by absorption of CaixaBank and Bankia, was carried out in an agreed manner.\n\nBut that doesn't mean they haven't existed. If you look at newspaper archives, in 1987 the Banco de Bilbao, then the fourth largest Spanish bank, set out to buy Banesto, the second largest. First, a friendly operation was attempted, but the meetings did not prosper and the Board of Directors of Banesto rejected the offer. A couple of weeks later, Banco de Bilbao presented a hostile takeover bid. \"Bilbao's offer for Banesto unleashes an open war between the two banking groups,\" La Vanguardia headlined at the time.\n\nIn this case, Bilbao also offered a share exchange that yielded a 40% premium. The hostile takeover did not go ahead as it was not admitted for processing.\n\nBanco de Bilbao ended up looking for an alternative and acquired Banco de Vizcaya, fifth in importance in the national market.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Sabadell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Banco Sabadell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CaixaBank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CaixaBank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banesto", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Banesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Vanguardia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Vanguardia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bilbao"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bilbao"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_ede0f.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545968", "eventUri": "eng-9545968", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

However, when the British channel Sky News reported the information, the CNMV issued a request to BBVA, which had to recognize its plan. The next day, the bank detailed the proposal in order to provide transparency.\n\nSources indicate that BBVA also held a board of directors meeting in mid-April in which this issue was addressed. They also affirm that before the presentation of Sabadell's quarterly results, BBVA asked the Catalan bank to hold a meeting on this matter, without negotiations ever taking place.\n\nAfter receiving the formal proposal from BBVA on April 30, Sabadell convened its board of directors last week to take a position this Monday. Their conclusion was that BBVA's approach \"significantly undervalues\" the bank. This Wednesday, he also published the message that the president of BBVA, Carlos Torres, sent to Sabadell on Sunday, in which he warned that there will be \"no room to improve the economic terms\" of the offer.\n\nThe National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) revealed today that BBVA contacted the supervisor last week, in the midst of the former's offer for the latter. The president of the organization, Cani Fern\u00e1ndez, pointed out that it was a \"courtesy contact\" by \"the parties\" and added that her teams cannot begin to analyze an operation of this type until there is a binding agreement.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez, who participated in the inauguration of the annual Assembly of the Family Business Institute (IEF), has made it clear that the CNMC will be vigilant if BBVA is interested in acquiring Sabadell again and will apply the same rules to demand that competition be guaranteed. in the banking market. The president of the regulator added that this analysis would be carried out \"market by market\", as was done with the two previous mergers, that of CaixaBank and Bakia and that of Unicaja and Liberbank, which she has cited.\n\n\"We will ensure that it does not harm competition,\" stated the presidency of the CNMC, before clarifying that a bank merger cannot necessarily affect services for clients, since there may be large entities that compete intensely in the markets. current markets. If a binding agreement is reached and if a merger between BBVA and Sabadell imposes competition restrictions, \"we will verify the necessity and proportionality test.\" \"We will carry out the same analysis, with the same intensity, with which previous operations have been carried out,\" Fern\u00e1ndez stated.\n\nThe president recalled that in the case of the merger between CaixaBank and Bankia, the CNMC required the merged company to make specific commitments or divestments in the initial part of the operation with the aim of not delaying it too much.\n\nCani Fern\u00e1ndez has also pointed out that one of the tasks of the CNMC is the control of concentrations, something to which the organization is dedicating a significant effort. In the face of bank mergers, the objective of Competition is to make clear at the beginning of the operation the conditions so as to \"not hinder business work,\" she specified.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez has also announced that the CNMC is carrying out a study on the problems faced by business growth in Spain and has asked family business owners to collaborate in this project.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Sabadell", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Sabadell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comisi\u00f3n_Nacional_de_los_Mercados_y_la_Competencia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Augusto Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansi\u00f3n_(Spanish_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Expansi\u00f3n (Spanish newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cani_(Spanish_footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cani (Spanish footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CaixaBank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CaixaBank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberbank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberbank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_a8db2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545968", "eventUri": "eng-9545968", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1222, "textEnd": 1230}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

This triggered fluctuations in both banks' stock prices. While Sabadell initially gained post-offer, it reversed after rejecting the merger. BBVA suffered significant losses since announcing the offer, prompting concerns about further premium increases.\n\nIt was one of the few options left to BBVA and Carlos Torres and they executed it. Although the market was not contemplating a hostile takeover bid to control Sabadell, the entity surprised this Thursday and informed the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) of a new operation that will only go ahead if more than 50% of the company's shareholders company directed by Josep Oli\u00fa attends the offer.\n\nThe new episode of love-hate between BBVA and Sabadell has meant that the prices of the two Ibex 35 companies have suffered new fluctuations. Specifically, the two entities have presented themselves as the two main protagonists of the day and the entity led by Carlos Torres is the red lantern with drops that exceed 6%. For its part, the Catalan company is recording increases of close to 5%.\n\nAt that time, the entity chaired by Carlos Torres fell sharply, while Banco Sabadell rose. The same movement that the two entities are registering this Thursday. Last Monday, Sabadell announced its rejection of BBVA's \"unsolicited\" offer and the tables turned. That is, BBVA rose strongly and the Catalan entity fell.\n\nIf translated into euros, from the day of the offer until the closing of May 6 (before the rejection of the offer), Sabadell earned more than 800 million euros on the stock market . However, since the rejection of the merger until this Wednesday, the Catalan entity has fallen and has lost 489 million euros.\n\nHowever, this situation has changed with the rise that Sabadell is registering this Thursday. With this recovery, since the rejection the Catalan bank has \"only\" lost 1% and in absolute figures it represents 100 million euros of losses, but if the date on which BBVA launched the offer is taken into account, the profits amount to more of 700 million euros.\n\nAs for BBVA, the entity fell sharply when it announced its offer. From that day until Monday, May 6, he lost 6,188 million euros on the Ibex . A situation that bothered Sabadell, since he reproached him for \"the volatility\" in the statement in which he rejected the merger. But this Thursday's collapse aggravates BBVA's situation on the Ibex 35. Since the day it launched the merger, the entity has fallen more than 12%, which translates into a loss of more than 7,000 million euros.\n\nIt was also a point that Torres took into account in the email he sent to Oliu. This drop is one of the reasons given by the president of BBVA why \"there is no further possibility of an increase.\" \"This situation absolutely prevents us from being able to pay more premium than what we already offer, because if we did, it is foreseeable that our value would fall again (even by an amount greater than the increase in premium that we would make),\" he states emphatically.\n\nSince last May 6, BBVA had been able to recover some of what it lost in those days. Until this Wednesday, the bank rose 4.57% in two sessions, which translates into 2,627 million euros . This improvement in the stock market means that the capitalization loss would have been reduced to 3,561 million euros, almost half of what it previously lost.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This article was written by a third party contributor and does not reflect the opinion of Born2Invest, its management, staff or its associates.

This is because mortgages are essentially contracts with defined terms and conditions, so they could not be modified unilaterally by a bank after a takeover.\n\nThe requirements for interest rates on loans would also stay the same. However, the conditions of linked products (insurance premiums, for example) could theoretically be changed if they aren't outlined in the contract.\n\nWhat will happen to my bank card and account number?\n\nAfter mergers and takeovers, as a general rule, the resulting banks tend to standardise the terms and conditions of their products, as well as their fees. This means that your card or account could gain (or lose) some fees, such as those for issuing a new card or maintaining the account.\n\nThis is not usually an immediate process, but be aware that banks can change the terms and conditions of accounts and cards following a merger or takeover.\n\nIt is likely your conditions will initially remain the same without much change, but the new/resulting bank may change the conditions later down the road.\n\nHowever, banks are always obliged to inform customers months in advance of any changes so you can decide whether to accept the conditions or to change bank.\n\nIn practice, it is most likely that customers of the absorbed bank, in this case Sabadell, will see their IBAN code changed, although this is a procedure that shouldn't really change much as it is the bank itself that does it. You'd just need to update your payment details where necessary.\n\nWhat about investment funds and pensions?\n\nIn the case of investment products such as pensions, customers are likely to be forced to transfer their funds into the products marketed by the new bank, as not all banks market the same investment funds and pension plans on offer.\n\nAs such, doing this may oblige customers to assume the fees of the other bank.", "source": {"uri": "thelocal.es", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Local Spain"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@thelocal.es", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "local_spain@thelocal.es", "name": "Local Spain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Sabadell", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Sabadell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bilbao_Vizcaya_Argentaria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sabadell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Economy,_Industry_and_Competitiveness_(Spain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (Spain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investment fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://apiwp.thelocal.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=webp,width=855,quality=75/https://apiwp.thelocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/watermarks-logo-AFP__20171005__T503F__v1__Preview__SpainCataloniaEconomyBankingIndependance.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545968", "eventUri": "eng-9545968", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Cuerpo said the government considers the combination of the two banks would have potentially harmful effects on the Spanish financial system and would impact jobs and customers.\n\nSpain's government opposes BBVA's hostile takeover bid for its smaller rival Sabadell, Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said on Thursday.\n\nUnder Spanish law, the Economy Ministry has the power to block any merger or acquisition of a bank. The government has six months to decide after consulting with regulators including the Bank of Spain and the securities regulator CNMV. BBVA, Spain's second-largest bank, on Thursday presented a 12.23 billion euro ($13.11 billion) takeover bid directly to Sabadell's shareholders after its target's board earlier this week rejected the proposal on the same terms.\n\nCuerpo said the government considers the combination of the two banks would have potentially harmful effects on the Spanish financial system and would impact jobs and customers. \"We are right now, both in form and substance, rejecting this operation as a consequence of those potential negative effects it could have,\" Cuerpo said in an interview on TVE. \"We have the last word when it comes to authorizing the merger by absorption by BBVA with Sabadell and that is where we would come in, of course, to make this assessment.\"\n\nBBVA Chairman Carlos Torres said on Thursday the combined entity would boost the Spanish economy by generating a higher tax base and creating a stronger player in Europe. \"I am confident that the government will appreciate the value of the transaction,\" Torres said in a call with investors.\n\nCatalonia, the Spanish region that would be most affected by the takeover given a high number of overlapping branches in the region, will hold regional elections on Sunday. Unions and some local parties have already expressed concerns about the impact any merger would have in terms of job losses and branch closures in the region.\n\nLabour union CCOO said a hostile takeover generates more concerns than the previous proposal and called on regulators to apply measures that ensure there is no monopoly. Should the takeover go ahead, CCOO said it would \"demand even more firmly that this operation be carried out with specific labour guarantees agreed in writing, while we call on the supervisors and regulators to move from statements to facts, adopting present and future antitrust measures,\" it said in a statement.\n\nCarles Puigdemont of separatist party Junts, who is running for president of Catalonia, said the takeover must be stopped. \"For some time now there has been a strategy to liquidate the Catalan banking sector, to the detriment of users and the country,\" Puigdemont said on X.\n\nSabadell and CaixaBank, both founded in Catalonia, moved their legal headquarters out of the region in 2017 after a failed attempt led by Puigdemont to separate it from the rest of Spain,

The government has six months to decide after consulting with regulators including the Bank of Spain and the securities regulator CNMV.\n\nBBVA, Spain's second-largest bank, on Thursday presented a \u20ac12.23-billion ($13.11-billion) takeover bid directly to Sabadell's shareholders after its target's board earlier this week rejected the proposal on the same terms.\n\nCuerpo said the government considers the combination of the two banks would have potentially harmful effects on the Spanish financial system and would impact jobs and customers.\n\n\"We are right now, both in form and substance, rejecting this operation as a consequence of those potential negative effects it could have,\" Cuerpo said in an interview on TVE. \"We have the last word when it comes to authorizing the merger by absorption by BBVA with Sabadell and that is where we would come in, of course, to make this assessment.\"\n\nBBVA Chairman Carlos Torres said on Thursday the combined entity would boost the Spanish economy by generating a higher tax base and creating a stronger player in Europe.\n\n\"I am confident that the government will appreciate the value of the transaction,\" Torres said in a call with investors.\n\nCatalonia, the Spanish region that would be most affected by the takeover given a high number of overlapping branches in the region, will hold regional elections on Sunday.\n\nUnions and some local parties have already expressed concerns about the impact any merger would have in terms of job losses and branch closures in the region.\n\nLabour union CCOO said a hostile takeover generates more concerns than the previous proposal and called on regulators to apply measures that ensure there is no monopoly.\n\nShould the takeover go ahead, CCOO said it would \"demand even more firmly that this operation be carried out with specific labor guarantees agreed in writing, while we call on the supervisors and regulators to move from statements to facts, adopting present and future antitrust measures,\" it said in a statement.\n\nCarles Puigdemont of separatist party Junts, who is running for president of Catalonia, said the takeover must be stopped.\n\n\"For some time now there has been a strategy to liquidate the Catalan banking sector, to the detriment of users and the country,\" Puigdemont said on X.\n\nSabadell and CaixaBank, both founded in Catalonia, moved their legal headquarters out of the region in 2017 after a failed attempt led by Puigdemont to separate it from the rest of Spain, fearing the secession drive would leave Catalonia outside the European Union and its protections.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The government has six months to decide after consulting with regulators including the Bank of Spain and the securities regulator CNMV.\n\nBBVA, Spain's second-largest bank on Thursday presented a 12.23 billion euro ($13.11 billion) takeover bid directly to Sabadell's shareholders after its target's board earlier this week rejected the proposal on the same terms.\n\nCuerpo said the government considers the combination of the two banks would have potentially harmful effects on the Spanish financial system and would impact jobs and customers.\n\n\"We are right now, both in form and substance, rejecting this operation as a consequence of those potential negative effects it could have,\" Cuerpo said in an interview on TVE.\n\nBBVA Chairman Carlos Torres said on Thursday the combined entity would boost the Spanish economy by generating a higher tax base and creating a stronger player in Europe.\n\n\"I am confident that the government will appreciate the value of the transaction,\" Torres said in a call with investors.\n\nCatalonia, the Spanish region that would be most affected by the takeover, will hold regional elections on Sunday.\n\nUnions and some local parties have already expressed concerns about the impact any merger would have in terms of job losses and branch closures in the region.\n\nCarles Puigdemont of separatist party Junts, who is running for president of Catalonia, said the takeover must be stopped.\n\n\"For some time now there has been a strategy to liquidate the Catalan banking sector, to the detriment of users and the country,\" Puigdemont said on X.\n\nSabadell and CaixaBank, both founded in Catalonia, moved their legal headquarters out of the region in 2017 after a failed attempt led by Puigdemont to separate it from the rest of Spain, fearing the secession drive would leave Catalonia outside the European Union and its protections.

Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 was flat ahead of the Bank of England's policy decision later in the day. The central bank is expected to hold rates steady and likely take another step towards a rate cut, but will probably be cautious about signalling an imminent move.\n\nEurope's STOXX 600 kick-started May on a positive note, after taking a breather from the record-breaking rally in April, owing to resilient earnings, the European Central Bank's indication of a likely June rate cut and ebbing Middle East tensions. \"The inflation data seem to be forwarding more convincingly in Europe than the U.S. ... We would expect that first rate cut from the ECB to be the start of a rate-cutting cycle,\" said UBS Global Wealth Management multi-asset strategist Kiran Ganesh.\n\nAutomobiles were the worst hit sector, down 1.2%, dragged by a 5.6% drop in Mercedes-Benz as the German automaker's stock was trading ex-dividend. Top executives at BMW and Volkswagen have warned against imposing EU import duties on electric vehicles from Chinese automakers, saying it could upend the bloc's Green Deal plan and harm China-manufactured car-importing automakers.\n\nOther key stocks that were trading ex-dividend and weighing on the STOXX 600 were HSBC and German financial services firm Allianz SE, down 3.7% and 4.6%, respectively. As for major M&A developments, Spanish bank Sabadell jumped 3.8% after rival BBVA presented a 12.23-billion-euro takeover bid directly to shareholders, even though the former's board already rejected the proposal.\n\nWith BBVA shares down 5.8%, Spain's benchmark index lost 1.2% to lag its regional peers. On the earnings front, Belgian drug developer argenx lost 9.2% following its first-quarter earnings.\n\nItalian payments group Nexi jumped nearly 6% after a larger-than-forecast rise in first-quarter core profit. BE Semiconductor Industries climbed 4.7% after announcing it received order for 26 hybrid bonding systems.\n\n\"It's been relatively good so far on the earnings side and some of it seems to be filtering through into a more positive corporate outlook,\" said UBS Global's Ganesh. At least 61% of the STOXX 600 companies that reported their first-quarter earnings have exceeded estimates, versus the typical 54% beat rate, according to LSEG data on Tuesday.\n\n(This story has not

The body was discovered next to an umbrella beneath a fence that runs around the bar on Agia Marina beach on the Greek island, according to officials. His wife confirmed his death this afternoon, paying tribute to her \u201cwonderful, funny, kind and brilliant husband\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to have lost Michael, my wonderful, funny, kind and brilliant husband. \u201cWe had an incredibly lucky life together. We loved each other very much and were so happy together. \u201cI am incredibly proud of our children, their resilience and support over the past days. \u201cMy family and I have been hugely comforted by the outpouring of love from people from around the world. It\u2019s clear that Michael meant a huge amount to so many of you. \u201cWe\u2019re taking comfort in the fact that he so very nearly made it. He did an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn\u2019t be easily seen by the extensive search team. \u201cMichael was an adventurous man, it\u2019s part of what made him so special. \u201cWe are so grateful to the extraordinary people on Symi who have worked tirelessly to help find him. Some of these people on the island, who hadn\u2019t even heard of Michael, worked from dawn till dusk unasked. \u201cWe\u2019re also very grateful to the press who have dealt with us with great respect. \u201cI feel so lucky to have our children and my amazing friends. Most of all, I feel so lucky to have had this life with Michael. \u201cThank you all.\u201d. Dr Mosley was last seen leaving Saint Nikolas beach at 1.30pm when he is believed to have been heading off on the coastal path back to nearby Pedi. CCTV footage, not shared with the media, from a house at the edge of the marina of Pedi showed Dr Mosley entering a treacherous mountainous path at about 2pm on Wednesday. The search effort has been widespread and has included firefighters, dogs, helicopters, drones, local people and officers from Symi and outside the island. Academic and broadcaster Alice Roberts shared three pictures on social media with Mosley, with whom she first worked on her 2009 TV series Human Journey. Prof Roberts wrote: \"The fragility of life is so shocking. \"I've known Michael Mosley for many years - as a TV producer specialising in science and medicine. He was the executive producer of my 2009 series Human Journey. \"When he started presenting as well as producing, we made several science programmes together. \"And we met up at Hay Festival just 2 weeks ago. \"I can't believe he's gone. My thoughts are with his bereaved family.\" Mosley's co-presenter on Trust Me, I'm A Doctor described him as a \"national treasure\" and a \"hugely talented\" man. Speaking to BBC News, Dr Saleyha Ahsan said: \"Michael's a national treasure and he's so personable.\" She recalled how Mosley put her \"to ease\" while she was doing an on-camera audition for the BBC series which looked at health care in Britain. Dr Ahsan said: \"I can now appreciate that's a one-off, not everyone is able to make other people feel so at ease with lights and cameras in front of them. \"But then to forget about all of that and just to focus on the science, on the story, on the message that we're trying to get out, is such a talented man, hugely talented.\" She also praised his \"passion for explaining science to a wider audience\", adding: \"Making it accessible to anyone and everyone, not just a niche scientific crowd, but to everyone.\" Celebrity chef and healthy eating campaigner Jamie Oliver praised the work Mosley had done for public health with his broadcasting and research. Oliver wrote on Instagram: \"What a wonderfully sweet, kind and gentle man he was. He did such a lot of good for public health with his TV shows and research. \"He was a curious investigator, producer and presenter and often changed the conversation around many public health issues for the better. \"He will be sadly missed... love and thoughts to Claire and all of his family.\" Tom Watson, the former deputy leader of the Labour Party, described Mosley who was known for popularising the 5:2 diet as a \"hero\". \"It's hard to describe how upset I am by this news,\" Mr Watson said posting on Twitter, formerly X. \"Through courageous, science-based journalism, Michael Mosley has helped thousands of people get well and healthy. I'm one of them. \"He was a hero to me. He will be deeply missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his family.\" Mr Watson said in an interview after losing around seven stone that Mosley's The Fast Diet book was part of his weight-loss regime. Author, TV writer and former doctor Adam Kay said it was \"desperately sad\" to hear the news. \"My thoughts with his family - may his memory be a blessing,\" Kay wrote on X.

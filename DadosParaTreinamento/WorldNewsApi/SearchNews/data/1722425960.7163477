(AP) \u2014 A Washington state man found guilty of murder for his role in the 2022 death of a police officer who was mistakenly shot by a sheriff\u2019s deputy was sentenced Friday to 29 years in prison. A Clark County Superior Court judge sentenced Julio Segura of Yakima in the death of Vancouver police officer Donald Sahota, The Columbian reported. More than a dozen people gave statements about Sahota in court before the sentencing. A Clark County jury last month convicted Segura, 23, of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, robbery, possession of a stolen vehicle and eluding police. He was acquitted of attempted murder, attempted kidnapping and first-degree burglary. The jury deliberated for eight hours after a trial that lasted several weeks. Sahota, 52, was off duty and at home in the city of Battle Ground on Jan. 29, 2022, the day he was fatally shot. Law enforcement from multiple agencies had chased Segura to Sahota\u2019s neighborhood in connection with an armed robbery at a gas station. Segura stabbed Sahota as the two struggled in Sahota\u2019s driveway. Moments later, Clark County sheriff\u2019s Deputy Jonathan Feller arrived and mistakenly shot Sahota. Coroners said Sahota died from gunshot wounds to the torso. Prosecutors argued that Segura caused Sahota\u2019s death by committing or attempting to commit other crimes, saying he \u201cengaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death to any person.\u201d During Thursday\u2019s hearing, Sahota\u2019s wife, Dawnese Sahota, told Judge Nancy Retsinas of her husband\u2019s resilience and work ethic. She said her 33 years with him were not enough. \u201cThis tragedy that is now my reality has left me brokenhearted,\u201d she said. \u201cShattered.\u201d She said she holds Segura 100% responsible for her husband\u2019s death by creating the confusion that led to his shooting. Vancouver Police Chief Jeff Mori told the judge of Sahota\u2019s compassion as a trainer for the agency and the way he always taught officers to treat the people they encounter as they, too, would want to be treated. Sahota\u2019s mother, Darlene Baun, shared memories of her son\u2019s childhood and their struggle with abuse and homelessness when he was a boy.\u201cI\u2019m so proud of my son. He went through so much, and he always tried to do good,\u201d she said. \u201cHe loved helping people.\u201d Prosecutor Tony Golik asked the judge to sentence Segura at the top of the sentencing range. He called Segura\u2019s actions \u201cdangerous, violent and self-centered.\u201d Segura apologized to the Sahota family at the hearing. \u201cI understand there\u2019s nothing I can say to alleviate all that pain that I caused,\u201d Segura said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can say, except that from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry.\u201d Segura\u2019s defense team submitted about 1,200 pages of records detailing Segura\u2019s tumultuous upbringing with stints in foster care and counseling. They asked the judge to consider a shorter sentence.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2RvbmFsZC1zYWhvdGEtcG9saWNlLW9mZmljZXItdmFuY291dmVyLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tNzMwNjc5Y2Q3NzBmYjY2YWM2OWIzYmFiNzdkMTMyNWHSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Man convicted of murder in death of Washington police officer shot by deputy sentenced to 29 years</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/donald-sahota-police-officer-vancouver-washington-730679cd770fb66ac69b3bab77d1325a", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/d922d79/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1969+0+182/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F03%2Ffc%2Ffaeb657e936de60ae1255c8542ca%2F103d25a4b150498480eb19cee8c1b25b", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:51:25", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.323}

The average quoted price of cover soared by 56.4% across Britain in the first few months of the year, according to figures, but drivers in Scotland faced a whopping annual increase of 61.9% \u2013 second only to record rises clocked up in the UK capital, where motorists experienced hikes of 64.8%. Some parts of the UK, including Wales, the north-east and north-west of England, and Yorkshire and the Humber, actually saw quoted premiums fall slightly over the first three months of 2024, when compared to last year. Higher car insurance premiums The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said the higher premiums quoted in the north are mainly due to there being slightly more generous personal injury pay-outs in Scotland than elsewhere, and that this negatively affects the formula insurers use to set the rate for premiums. Another factor that impacts the price of cover, the ABI said, is that Scotland does not have a claims portal for lower-value road-traffic-accident claims so the legal costs in defending claims are also higher here than in England and Wales. Jonathan Fong, the ABI\u2019s manager of general insurance policy, said: \u201cSeveral factors affect premiums in Scotland differently to the rest of the UK, including the way compensation settlements for road-traffic accidents are -calculated under Scots law.\u201d However, Scottish Labour transport spokesman, Alex Rowley, branded the situation \u201cridiculous\u201d and has vowed to raise the matter with Scottish Transport Minister Fiona Hyslop. \u201cIt is a total rip-off that Scots are paying higher motor insurance premiums than other areas of the UK and there appears to be a lack of transparency around how these figures are being arrived at,\u201d said Rowley, the MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife. \u201cI will be bringing this up in parliament this week, as it is nothing short of ridiculous.\u201d Leading road safety -charity IM RoadSmart has questioned the way premiums for drivers in Scotland are calculated. The motoring organisation pointed out that rates of serious road accidents in Scotland have fallen over the past three years and are now the lowest of the UK nations, according to the most recently available data. RoadSmart\u2019s director of -policy and standards, Nicholas Lyes, said: \u201cFigures show that, in 2022, there was a lower rate of killed or seriously injured on Scotland\u2019s roads compared to the rest of Great Britain when factoring in the overall number of miles travelled. \u201cWhile postcode pricing when calculating car -insurance premiums isn\u2019t unusual, Scots will question why there might be such a difference given the recent lower rate of serious accidents.\u201d Scottish Conservative shadow transport minister Graham Simpson said: \u201cMotorists in Scotland will rightfully question why they are paying more for car insurance than elsewhere in the UK. \u201cDespite there being fewer accidents north of the border, the average price of cover in Scotland has risen dramatically.\u201d \u2018A complex formula\u2019 Jon McNeill, a lecturer in -insurance risk at Glasgow Caledonian University, called for more transparency over the way the rates for premiums in Scotland are calculated. \u201cIt is a complex formula and not easy for customers who buy financial products to understand,\u201d McNeill said. \u201cThe Scottish Government is currently reviewing this formula to ensure a better fit with economic conditions, but it is unlikely the new approach will be any less complex. \u201cGiven the high costs of insurance motorists in Scotland are currently paying, insurers may benefit from greater transparency in explaining how they establish premiums.\u201d In February, drivers across the UK most commonly received a quote between \u00a3500 and \u00a3749, insights firm Consumer Intelligence said. In Scotland, however, last month drivers in the Central Belt saw even bigger increases with prices hitting \u00a3871, on average. Glasgow and Motherwell were the most expensive areas. Average prices are now \u00a3971 and \u00a3879, respectively, following annual increases. The hikes are partly due to a record \u00a39.9 billion being paid out by UK insurers in 2023, the ABI explained, saying this was the highest annual figure since the organisation started collecting data in 2013, with the total up by 18% on the \u00a38.4bn paid in 2022. The overall number of claims -settled, at 2.3 million, also rose by 10% compared with 2022. And the cost of vehicle repairs \u2013 at \u00a36.1bn \u2013 jumped by 31% compared with 2022. This reflected continued -rising costs, with insurers reporting increases for materials and labour, the ABI said. It added that garages also faced rises in their energy costs during 2023. \u201cInsurers are aware of the financial challenges customers are facing and are determined to keep motor insurance as competitively priced as possible,\u201d Fong said. \u201cAs an industry, we\u2019re -committed to supporting customers and finding ways to help tackle the cost of providing motor insurance. Our 10-point roadmap to combat the rising costs encourages greater collaboration with government and relevant stakeholders.\u201d The ABI added that it had also called for a cut to the insurance premium tax, a cost that is levied on insurers but is passed onto consumers through the cost of their policies. Scottish Liberal Democrat transport spokesperson Daniel O\u2019Malley said: \u201cScottish motorists are being ripped off with exorbitant insurance prices, despite being involved in fewer serious accidents. Amid a cost-of-living crisis created by poor government in London and Edinburgh, this is even more unacceptable. \u201cLiberal Democrats are -committed to fairness for drivers, protecting them from unfair insurance prices and punitive fuel costs.\u201d Experts and politicians demand answers as insurance premiums for motorists north of the border now exceed prices paid outside of London \u2013 despite the number of serious accidents on Scotland\u2019s roads falling over the past three years and being the lowest of all UK nations.

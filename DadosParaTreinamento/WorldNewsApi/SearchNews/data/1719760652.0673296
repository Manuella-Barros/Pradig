{"id": 225016698, "title": "California Bill Blocking Local Voter ID Laws Passes Senate", "text": "A proposal that would prohibit local governments in California from enacting voter ID laws cleared the Senate floor May 21 on a 30-8 vote. The author said the bill is needed to create a statewide standard and to prevent cities across the state from enacting their own policies which he believes could create uncertainty and inequality. \u201cSB 1174 would try to address this matter and ensure that local jurisdictions cannot impose their own voter ID requirements to try to engage in culture wars and try to disenfranchise voters,\u201d Mr. Min said on the Senate floor May 21. He suggested the push for voter ID laws in some cities and states across the country are the result of questions lingering from the 2020 presidential election. \u201cThis big lie has been an unfortunate part of a narrative driven by Donald Trump and certain of his supporters to try to cast aspersions on the integrity of elections, even when we have not seen any evidence to show that widespread voter ID is an issue,\u201d Mr. Min said in the bill\u2019s April 2 hearing of the Senate\u2019s Elections and Constitutional Amendments Committee. \u201cAnd yet, nonetheless, we have seen voter ID laws pass in a number of states which harken back to an era of Jim Crow type barriers to voting.\u201d Citing a belief that requiring an ID to vote would disenfranchise voters, he argued that the bill is needed to protect the electoral process. \u201cHealthy democracies rely on robust access to the polls,\u201d Mr. Min said in legislative analyses. \u201cVoter ID laws are discriminatory and only make it harder for seniors, people of color, and other vulnerable groups to participate in our democracy.\u201d First-time voters in California are required to show identification if they did not provide a driver\u2019s license number or the last four digits of their social security number when registering, though the Secretary of State allows student IDs, credit or debit cards, or an ID provided by a commercial establishment for such. Mail-in ballots that do not include appropriate identification are treated as provisional ballots, as per existing state law, and elections officials are advised to request proof before counting them. In the most recent statewide general election in 2022, 660 ballots were rejected due to a lack of positive identification. Voters in the City of Huntington Beach, which is a charter city, approved March 5 during the primary election a stricter voter ID law requiring a government ID to vote. Rob Bonta, California\u2019s attorney general, and Shirley Weber, the secretary of state, sent a joint letter before the measure passed contesting the proposal and claiming it was in violation of state law. They argued existing laws require sworn oaths instead of ID verification and resolve all doubts in the favor of challenged voters and that such is sufficient to secure elections while protecting voters\u2019 rights. \u201cThis framework strikes a careful balance: it guards the ballot box against ineligible and/or fraudulent voters, while at the same time simplifying and facilitating the process of voting so as to avoid suppressing turnout and disenfranchising qualified voters,\u201d the letter read. They also said the Orange County city\u2019s new law works against state requirements and places the burden of proof on voters. \u201cBy requiring additional documentation to establish a voter\u2019s identity and eligibility to vote at the time of voting\u2014a higher standard of proof than set out in the Elections Code\u2014Huntington Beach\u2019s proposal conflicts with state law,\u201d the letter read. \u201cIndeed, the City\u2019s proposal would arguably constitute \u2018mass, indiscriminate, and groundless challenging of voters.\u2019\u201d Supporters of the bill said it will ensure Huntington Beach and other cities are prevented from enacting such measures. \u201cHuntington Beach\u2019s position ignores case law that makes the voter ID measure invalid because, one, voting rights and election integrity are matters of statewide concern, and two, the measure conflicts with state law and burdens voting rights,\u201d Ruth Dawson , legislative attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union California Action, said during the April 2 elections committee hearing. She suggested the city\u2019s initiative will be struck down legally. \u201cHuntington Beach\u2019s measure will no doubt be successfully challenged in court, and in the meantime, SB 1174 will stop any other cities from attempting to pass similar measures that spread misinformation about the integrity of our elections,\u201d Ms. Dawson said. One lawmaker in support of the bill said it is needed to protect voters while doubting that any election malfeasance occurs in California. \u201cAnything that we can do to restore [some] sort of sense and dignity to the electoral process is a good thing, because \u2026 there are no problems with voter fraud in California,\u201d Sen. Josh Newman said during the committee hearing. \u201cThere are problems with politics, but let\u2019s take the politics out of elections.\u201d Critics said the Huntington Beach measure should be allowed to stand and called the bill an attempt to wrest control from local governments. \u201cThis is another attempt to just do away with local government control,\u201d Republican Sen. Janet Nguyen said during the committee hearing. \u201cI encourage my colleagues to join me in standing up for local government and local control, because every day, everything we do [in Sacramento] is just pounding on local cities and not allowing them to do what they do best and what they know is best for their residents.\u201d She also questioned the thought that voter ID laws disenfranchise voters and noted that state IDs are required to access many situations in California\u2014including at the airport, at bars and nightclubs, and to enter the secretary of state\u2019s building in Sacramento, among others. \u201cIt\u2019s a government ID that we all use for everything else we do every day, all day long,\u201d Ms. Nguyen said. \u201cAre you saying that none of these facilities should have any requests?\u201d Having passed the Senate, the bill will next be heard by respective committees in the state\u2019s Assembly in the coming weeks.", "summary": "The measure's author said the aim is to keep cities from setting their own policies, which could create uncertainty and inequality.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/california-bill-blocking-local-voter-id-laws-passes-senate-5658620", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/05/03/id5240663-Dave-Min-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:30:45", "author": "Travis Gillmore", "authors": ["Travis Gillmore"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.22}

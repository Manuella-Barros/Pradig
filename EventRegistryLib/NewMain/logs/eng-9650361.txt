His start Thursday in the U.S. Open was enough to at least wonder if his time is coming next.\n\nCantlay handled Pinehurst No. 2 in the same methodical manner he handles endless PGA Tour board meetings that consume a lot of his time these days. With only one bogey and a pair of birdie putts from the 20-foot range, Cantlay opened with a 5-under 65.\n\nHe had a one-shot lead over Ludvig Aberg of Sweden and set a daunting target for Scottie Scheffler and the rest of the field taking on the notorious domed greens of Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nIn hot weather with barely a breeze, only nine players managed to break par from the morning wave, a list that did not include Tiger Woods or five-time major champion Brooks Koepka.\n\nCompeting in his first U.S. Open since 2020, Woods had five bogeys in a seven-hole stretch around the turn and opened with a 74. Koepka was atop the leaderboard for much of the morning, looking very much like the player who brings his best game to the biggest events, until three bogeys over the last six holes dropped him back to 70.\n\nPhil Mickelson, needing the U.S. Open for the career Grand Slam and at age 53 looking more and more incapable of that, shot 79.\n\nCantlay holed a bunker shot on No. 11, his second hole of the day, and was equally pleased with a collection of par putts that kept his round going.\n\n\"I've been working really hard on my game,\" Cantlay said. \"And usually when you make just a couple changes and you're working really hard, it's just a matter of time.\"\n\nThe timing couldn't have been better. For a player like Cantlay, who has no glaring weakness in his game, his record in the majors has stood out for all the wrong reasons. He has had only one good chance -- the 2019 Masters -- and four top 10s in 26 majors since returning from a severe back injury in 2017.\n\nHis most recent major was a tie for 53rd in the PGA Championship, allowing him to get back home in south Florida in time to watch Xander Schauffele win at Valhalla.\n\n\"We're working on it,\" is all he has said when the topic has come up about his performance in the majors the last two years. Cantlay isn't known to be verbose on many subjects, particularly when it comes to his performance in golf's most important championships.\n\nHe also has rejected notions that his time on the PGA Tour board during the divide with LIV Golf and negotiations with the Saudi backers of the rival league has been a distraction.\n\nWhatever the case, this was a good day of work.\n\nHis 65 matched the lowest start at Pinehurst No. 2 in the previous three U.S. Opens, with Martin Kaymer posting that score in 2014 in soft, wet conditions.\n\nAberg, who a year ago had just graduated from Texas Tech and already is considered among the elite in golf, managed six birdies in his round of 66. Matthieu Pavon of France reached 5 under with an eagle on the par-5 10th only to drop two shots coming in.\n\nPinehurst No. 2 created plenty of stress for so many others.\n\nKoepka was sailing along by using strength to get through the native plants in a sandy area to set up a two-putt birdie on the par-5 fifth, taking on an accessible pin at the sixth hole for a short birdie and dropping a 35-foot birdie putt on the par-5 10th.\n\nAnd then he gave it all back by misjudging the speed and break on a 35-foot putt that went 15 feet by the hole. He missed the green just enough to see it roll off a slope on the 15th, and he got out of position into the sandy landscape on the next hole for another bogey.\n\nColin Morikawa, who has played in the final group at the first two majors of the year, hit what he thought was a good bunker shot on the par-3 ninth, but it rolled by the cup 2 feet and then took a slope and stopped rolling 80 feet away, leading to double bogey.\n\nHe took another double bogey on the par-3 15th when it took two shots -- one from the wiregrass bush, another with his putter -- to get on the green.\n\nHe still managed a 70 by holing a bunker shot on the par-3 17th for birdie and finishing with a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th.\n\nAmong those who broke par was Sergio Garcia, who got in as alternate from his 36-hole qualifying site to keep alive his streak of playing every U.S. Open dating to 2000. He shot 69.\n\nThose 25 straight years playing the toughest test in golf have taught Garcia the value of par, and not to be alarmed by the hot start Cantlay produced.\n\n\"There's always going to be someone that hits the ball great, everything goes his way, makes a couple of bombs, and you can shoot it,\" Garcia said. \"Are we going to see it consistently? If it doesn't rain, I don't think so. You might see someone shooting another 66 or 65 or something like that. I think as the course gets even firmer, even faster, a tiny bit of breeze comes up here and there, it's going to be difficult to shoot those kind of scores.\"", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthieu_Pavon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthieu Pavon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Tech_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Tech University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kaymer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Kaymer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/15/d15629f5-dd73-5796-b750-4b3b9adbb8ca/666b49fdc7d70.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650361", "eventUri": "eng-9650361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

His start Thursday in the U.S. Open was enough to at least wonder if his time is coming next.\n\nCantlay handled Pinehurst No. 2 in the same methodical manner he handles endless PGA Tour board meetings that consume a lot of his time these days. With only one bogey and a pair of birdie putts from the 20-foot range, Cantlay opened with a 5-under 65.\n\nHe had a one-shot lead over Ludvig Aberg of Sweden and set a daunting target for Scottie Scheffler and the rest of the field taking on the notorious domed greens of Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nIn hot weather with barely a breeze, only nine players managed to break par from the morning wave, a list that did not include Tiger Woods or five-time major champion Brooks Koepka.\n\nCompeting in his first U.S. Open since 2020, Woods had five bogeys in a seven-hole stretch around the turn and opened with a 74. Koepka was atop the leaderboard for much of the morning, looking very much like the player who brings his best game to the biggest events, until three bogeys over the last six holes dropped him back to 70.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For a player like Cantlay, who has no glaring weakness in his game, his record in the majors has stood out for all the wrong reasons. He has had only one good chance -- the 2019 Masters -- and four top 10s in 26 majors since returning from a severe back injury in 2017.\n\nHis most recent major was a tie for 53rd in the PGA Championship, allowing him to get back home in south Florida in time to watch Xander Schauffele win at Valhalla.\n\n\"We're working on it,\" is all he has said when the topic has come up about his performance in the majors the last two years. Cantlay isn't known to be verbose on many subjects, particularly when it comes to his performance in golf's most important championships.\n\nHe also has rejected notions that his time on the PGA Tour board during the divide with LIV Golf and negotiations with the Saudi backers of the rival league has been a distraction.\n\nWhatever the case, this was a good day of work.\n\nHis 65 matched the lowest start at Pinehurst No. 2 in the previous three U.S. Opens, with Martin Kaymer posting that score in 2014 in soft, wet conditions.\n\nAberg, who a year ago had just graduated from Texas Tech and already is considered among the elite in golf, managed six birdies in his round of 66. Matthieu Pavon of France reached 5 under with an eagle on the par-5 10th only to drop two shots coming in.\n\nPinehurst No. 2 created plenty of stress for so many others.\n\nKoepka was sailing along by using strength to get through the native plants in a sandy area to set up a two-putt birdie on the par-5 fifth, taking on an accessible pin at the sixth hole for a short birdie and dropping a 35-foot birdie putt on the par-5 10th.\n\nAnd then he gave it all back by misjudging the speed and break on a 35-foot putt that went 15 feet by the hole. He missed the green just enough to see it roll off a slope on the 15th, and he got out of position into the sandy landscape on the next hole for another bogey.\n\nColin Morikawa, who has played in the final group at the first two majors of the year, hit what he thought was a good bunker shot on the par-3 ninth, but it rolled by the cup 2 feet and then took a slope and stopped rolling 80 feet away, leading to double bogey.\n\nHe took another double bogey on the par-3 15th when it took two shots -- one from the wiregrass bush, another with his putter -- to get on the green.\n\nHe still managed a 70 by holing a bunker shot on the par-3 17th for birdie and finishing with a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th.\n\nAmong those who broke par was Sergio Garcia, who got in as alternate from his 36-hole qualifying site to keep alive his streak of playing every U.S. Open dating to 2000. He shot 69.\n\nThose 25 straight years playing the toughest test in golf have taught Garcia the value of par, and not to be alarmed by the hot start Cantlay produced.\n\n\"There's always going to be someone that hits the ball great, everything goes his way, makes a couple of bombs, and you can shoot it,\" Garcia said. \"Are we going to see it consistently? If it doesn't rain, I don't think so. You might see someone shooting another 66 or 65 or something like that. I think as the course gets even firmer, even faster, a tiny bit of breeze comes up here and there, it's going to be difficult to shoot those kind of scores.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0

Ludvig Aberg and Matthieu Pavon trailed closely, while notable players like Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy, and Tiger Woods faced various struggles amidst challenging course conditions.\n\nPatrick Cantlay used a sizzling burst of late birdies to grab a one-shot U.S. Open clubhouse lead over Swede Ludvig Aberg on Thursday at Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina where Scottie Scheffler was struggling to make a move.\n\nCantlay, in pursuit of his maiden major victory, birdied three of his final five holes on a tricky layout en route to a five under-par 65 that matched Martin Kaymer's record for the lowest start at Pinehurst No. 2 during a U.S. Open. \"Played pretty solid most of the way,\" said Cantlay, who needed only 23 putts on the notoriously challenging turtle-shell greens that are one of the course's greatest defence.\n\n\"I thought the golf course played pretty difficult. But drove it well. A lot of balls on the fairway. Left the ball in the right spots, for the most part.\" Aberg, playing in his first U.S. Open, produced a brilliant display of ball-striking and birdied his closing hole, the par-three ninth, to get within one of Cantlay while Frenchman Matthieu Pavon was a further shot back.\n\nPavon made a bit of history while moving into contention as he became the first player with two eagles in a U.S. Open round at Pinehurst. Cantlay, competing in his 30th major, started on the back nine and kick-started his day at the par-four 11th, his second, where he chipped in for birdie from a greenside bunker.\n\nThe 32-year-old American made the turn at one under but covered his final nine holes in a stunning four-under 31. Cantlay had a chance to go even lower but a birdie putt from 19 feet at his final hole shaved the right edge. Sergio Garcia, who only learned on Monday that he was added to the field as an alternate, made the most of his opportunity by carding only the sixth bogey-free round in U.S. Open history at Pinehurst No. 2 to sit four shots back of Cantlay.\n\n\"Obviously to shoot under par in a U.S. Open, which is a championship that I love, it's always great,\" said Garcia. \"To go bogey-free is even greater. It's something that I give a lot of respect to, and I'm very proud of.\" STRUGGLING WOODS\n\nWorld number one Scheffler, who went out with the late starters and in a high-profile group with Xander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy, was struggling for accuracy off the tee and made the turn at one over after mixing two bogeys with a birdie. McIlroy, hoping to end his 10-year major drought this week, was two under and level with Tony Finau (68) while Schauffele, who picked up his first major at last month's PGA Championship, was one over.\n\nBryson DeChambeau, one of 13 LIV Golf players in the 156-player field this week and less than a month removed from his runner-up showing at the PGA Championship with what he later called his \"B\" game, was one under after eight holes. Defending champion Wyndham Clark, eager to jump-start a season in which he has missed the cut at the first two majors, also went out late and was one over after seven holes.\n\nThe opening round of the U.S. Open was played under sunny skies and on a layout sure to test the mental discipline of the players this week given its tricky greens and fairways that bleed into sandy waste areas full of wire grass. Tiger Woods, competing in only his fourth event of the year and who accepted a special exemption to play in the U.S. Open, enjoyed an encouraging start but his putter abandoned him as the round wore on and he opened with a 74.\n\n\"I didn't hit my irons particularly well,\" said Woods, who was one under through six holes before carding five bogeys over a seven-hole stretch around the turn. \"Didn't putt that great. Drove it on the string all day. Unfortunately I just didn't capitalise on it.\"\n\nPhil Mickelson, U.S. Open runner-up a record six times, saw his hopes of completing the career Grand Slam of golf's four majors fade with a 79 in a round that started with four consecutive bogeys.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthieu_Pavon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matthieu Pavon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kaymer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martin Kaymer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/images/sports/golf-3.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650361", "eventUri": "eng-9650361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

His start Thursday in the U.S. Open was enough to at least wonder if his time is coming next.\n\nCantlay handled Pinehurst No. 2 in the same methodical manner he handles endless PGA Tour board meetings that consume a lot of his time these days. With only one bogey and a pair of birdie putts from the 20-foot range, Cantlay opened with a 5-under 65.\n\nHe had a one-shot lead over Ludvig Aberg of Sweden and set a daunting target for Scottie Scheffler and the rest of the field taking on the notorious domed greens of Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nIn hot weather with barely a breeze, only nine players managed to break par from the morning wave, a list that did not include Tiger Woods or five-time major champion Brooks Koepka.\n\nCompeting in his first U.S. Open since 2020, Woods had five bogeys in a seven-hole stretch around the turn and opened with a 74. Koepka was atop the leaderboard for much of the morning, looking very much like the player who brings his best game to the biggest events, until three bogeys over the last six holes dropped him back to 70.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For a player like Cantlay, who has no glaring weakness in his game, his record in the majors has stood out for all the wrong reasons. He has had only one good chance -- the 2019 Masters -- and four top 10s in 26 majors since returning from a severe back injury in 2017.\n\nHis most recent major was a tie for 53rd in the PGA Championship, allowing him to get back home in south Florida in time to watch Xander Schauffele win at Valhalla.\n\n\"We're working on it,\" is all he has said when the topic has come up about his performance in the majors the last two years. Cantlay isn't known to be verbose on many subjects, particularly when it comes to his performance in golf's most important championships.\n\nHe also has rejected notions that his time on the PGA Tour board during the divide with LIV Golf and negotiations with the Saudi backers of the rival league has been a distraction.\n\nWhatever the case, this was a good day of work.\n\nHis 65 matched the lowest start at Pinehurst No. 2 in the previous three U.S. Opens, with Martin Kaymer posting that score in 2014 in soft, wet conditions.\n\nAberg, who a year ago had just graduated from Texas Tech and already is considered among the elite in golf, managed six birdies in his round of 66. Matthieu Pavon of France reached 5 under with an eagle on the par-5 10th only to drop two shots coming in.\n\nPinehurst No. 2 created plenty of stress for so many others.\n\nKoepka was sailing along by using strength to get through the native plants in a sandy area to set up a two-putt birdie on the par-5 fifth, taking on an accessible pin at the sixth hole for a short birdie and dropping a 35-foot birdie putt on the par-5 10th.\n\nAnd then he gave it all back by misjudging the speed and break on a 35-foot putt that went 15 feet by the hole. He missed the green just enough to see it roll off a slope on the 15th, and he got out of position into the sandy landscape on the next hole for another bogey.\n\nColin Morikawa, who has played in the final group at the first two majors of the year, hit what he thought was a good bunker shot on the par-3 ninth, but it rolled by the cup 2 feet and then took a slope and stopped rolling 80 feet away, leading to double bogey.\n\nHe took another double bogey on the par-3 15th when it took two shots -- one from the wiregrass bush, another with his putter -- to get on the green.\n\nHe still managed a 70 by holing a bunker shot on the par-3 17th for birdie and finishing with a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th.\n\nAmong those who broke par was Sergio Garcia, who got in as alternate from his 36-hole qualifying site to keep alive his streak of playing every U.S. Open dating to 2000. He shot 69.\n\nThose 25 straight years playing the toughest test in golf have taught Garcia the value of par, and not to be alarmed by the hot start Cantlay produced.\n\n\"There's always going to be someone that hits the ball great, everything goes his way, makes a couple of bombs, and you can shoot it,\" Garcia said. \"Are we going to see it consistently? If it doesn't rain, I don't think so. You might see someone shooting another 66 or 65 or something like that. I think as the course gets even firmer, even faster, a tiny bit of breeze comes up here and there, it's going to be difficult to shoot those kind of scores.\"\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the

McIlroy missed a seven-foot birdie putt at the ninth.\n\nAmerican Cantlay, seeking his first major triumph, matched the low US Open rounds at Pinehurst, two 65s by Martin Kaymer on his way to victory in 2014.\n\n\"Played pretty solid most of the way,\" Cantlay said.\n\n\"The golf course played pretty difficult. But drove it well. Lot of balls on the fairways. Left the ball in the right spots, for the most part.\"\n\nAberg sank a six-foot birdie putt at the par-3 ninth to finish on 66 with six birdies and two bogeys.\n\n\"Very nice round of golf. Not a lot to complain about,\" Aberg said. \"Made a couple nice putts, hit some really nice shots. Staying very disciplined is important.\"\n\nDomed greens, sandy waste areas and wiregrass was making for a difficult day for most of the field of 156.\n\n\"It's the US Open. It's supposed to be hard,\" Aberg said. \"That's what we're doing here.\"\n\nFrance's Matthieu Pavon, ranked 24th, fired a 67 to stand third, soaring with eagles at the par-5 fifth on an 18-foot putt and on a 27-foot putt at the par-5 10th hole.\n\n\"I made my four best swings of the day on the par-5s and dropped two putts, so it gave me a nice two eagles,\" Pavon said. \"It gave me a little bit of freedom.\"\n\nScheffler has five PGA Tour wins this year, the most by any player at this stage since Tom Watson in 1980.\n\nTwo-time Masters champion Scheffler has 12 top-10 showings in 13 starts this year and could match 15-time major winner Tiger Woods as the only players to win a US Open while atop the world rankings.\n\nSchauffele snapped a two-year win drought last month with his first major triumph.\n\nCantlay, the 2021 PGA Tour playoff champion, has a best major showing of third at the 2019 PGA. He's a contender for a US berth at the Paris Olympics but must finish no worse than second this week to have a chance.\n\n- Garcia's bogey-free day -\n\nCanada's Corey Conners, Spain's Sergio Garcia and South Korean Kim Seong-Hyeon were on 69.\n\nGarcia fired only the sixth bogey-free US Open round at Pinehurst, making birdie at the fifth and 17 pars.\n\n\"To shoot under par in a US Open, which is a championship that I love, it's always great. To go bogey-free is even greater,\" Garcia said.\n\nFive-time major winner Brooks Koepka, chasing a third US Open title after wins in 2017 and 2018, and seventh-ranked Collin Morikawa, a two-time major winner, were among those on 70.\n\nTiger Woods, a 15-time major winner struggling to overcome severe leg injuries from a 2021 car crash, struggled to a 74. He had five bogeys in a seven-hole stretch starting at 16.\n\njs/dj", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_slater@ktbs.com", "name": "Jim Slater", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kaymer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Kaymer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Watson_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Watson (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Feet", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Feet", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/ktbs.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/39/e39bc6cd-48aa-5625-bee2-74509a2ac10c/666b1bab2428f.image.jpg?crop=512%2C269%2C0%2C42&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650361", "eventUri": "eng-9650361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

His start Thursday in the U.S. Open was enough to at least wonder if his time is coming next.\n\nCantlay handled Pinehurst No. 2 in the same methodical manner he handles endless PGA Tour board meetings that consume a lot of his time these days. With only one bogey and a pair of birdie putts from the 20-foot range, Cantlay opened with a 5-under 65.\n\nHe had a one-shot lead over Ludvig Aberg of Sweden and set a daunting target for Scottie Scheffler and the rest of the field taking on the notorious domed greens of Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nIn hot weather with barely a breeze, only nine players managed to break par from the morning wave, a list that did not include Tiger Woods or five-time major champion Brooks Koepka.\n\nCompeting in his first U.S. Open since 2020, Woods had five bogeys in a seven-hole stretch around the turn and opened with a 74. Koepka was atop the leaderboard for much of the morning, looking very much like the player who brings his best game to the biggest events, until three bogeys over the last six holes dropped him back to 70.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For a player like Cantlay, who has no glaring weakness in his game, his record in the majors has stood out for all the wrong reasons. He has had only one good chance -- the 2019 Masters -- and four top 10s in 26 majors since returning from a severe back injury in 2017.\n\nHis most recent major was a tie for 53rd in the PGA Championship, allowing him to get back home in south Florida in time to watch Xander Schauffele win at Valhalla.\n\n\"We're working on it,\" is all he has said when the topic has come up about his performance in the majors the last two years. Cantlay isn't known to be verbose on many subjects, particularly when it comes to his performance in golf's most important championships.\n\nHe also has rejected notions that his time on the PGA Tour board during the divide with LIV Golf and negotiations with the Saudi backers of the rival league has been a distraction.\n\nWhatever the case, this was a good day of work.\n\nHis 65 matched the lowest start at Pinehurst No. 2 in the previous three U.S. Opens, with Martin Kaymer posting that score in 2014 in soft, wet conditions.\n\nAberg, who a year ago had just graduated from Texas Tech and already is considered among the elite in golf, managed six birdies in his round of 66. Matthieu Pavon of France reached 5 under with an eagle on the par-5 10th only to drop two shots coming in.\n\nPinehurst No. 2 created plenty of stress for so many others.\n\nKoepka was sailing along by using strength to get through the native plants in a sandy area to set up a two-putt birdie on the par-5 fifth, taking on an accessible pin at the sixth hole for a short birdie and dropping a 35-foot birdie putt on the par-5 10th.\n\nAnd then he gave it all back by misjudging the speed and break on a 35-foot putt that went 15 feet by the hole. He missed the green just enough to see it roll off a slope on the 15th, and he got out of position into the sandy landscape on the next hole for another bogey.\n\nColin Morikawa, who has played in the final group at the first two majors of the year, hit what he thought was a good bunker shot on the par-3 ninth, but it rolled by the cup 2 feet and then took a slope and stopped rolling 80 feet away, leading to double bogey.\n\nHe took another double bogey on the par-3 15th when it took two shots -- one from the wiregrass bush, another with his putter -- to get on the green.\n\nHe still managed a 70 by holing a bunker shot on the par-3 17th for birdie and finishing with a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th.\n\nAmong those who broke par was Sergio Garcia, who got in as alternate from his 36-hole qualifying site to keep alive his streak of playing every U.S. Open dating to 2000. He shot 69.\n\nThose 25 straight years playing the toughest test in golf have taught Garcia the value of par, and not to be alarmed by the hot start Cantlay produced.\n\n\"There's always going to be someone that hits the ball great, everything goes his way, makes a couple of bombs, and you can shoot it,\" Garcia said. \"Are we going to see it consistently? If it doesn't rain, I don't think so. You might see someone shooting another 66 or 65 or something like that. I think as the course gets even firmer, even faster, a tiny bit of breeze comes up here and there, it's going to be difficult to shoot those kind of scores.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry

His start Thursday in the U.S. Open was enough to at least wonder if his time is coming next.\n\nCantlay handled Pinehurst No. 2 in the same methodical manner he handles endless PGA Tour board meetings that consume a lot of his time these days. With only one bogey and a pair of birdie putts from the 20-foot range, Cantlay opened with a 5-under 65.\n\nHe had a one-shot lead over Ludvig Aberg of Sweden and set a daunting target for Scottie Scheffler and the rest of the field taking on the notorious domed greens of Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nIn hot weather with barely a breeze, only nine players managed to break par from the morning wave, a list that did not include Tiger Woods or five-time major champion Brooks Koepka.\n\nCompeting in his first U.S. Open since 2020, Woods had five bogeys in a seven-hole stretch around the turn and opened with a 74. Koepka was atop the leaderboard for much of the morning, looking very much like the player who brings his best game to the biggest events, until three bogeys over the last six holes dropped him back to 70.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He's 100, she's 96\n\nPhil Mickelson, needing the U.S. Open for the career Grand Slam and at age 53 looking more and more incapable of that, shot 79.\n\nCantlay holed a bunker shot on No. 11, his second hole of the day, and was equally pleased with a collection of par putts that kept his round going.\n\n\"I've been working really hard on my game,\" Cantlay said. \"And usually when you make just a couple changes and you're working really hard, it's just a matter of time.\"\n\nThe timing couldn't have been better. For a player like Cantlay, who has no glaring weakness in his game, his record in the majors has stood out for all the wrong reasons. He has had only one good chance -- the 2019 Masters -- and four top 10s in 26 majors since returning from a severe back injury in 2017.\n\nHis most recent major was a tie for 53rd in the PGA Championship, allowing him to get back home in south Florida in time to watch Xander Schauffele win at Valhalla.\n\n\"We're working on it,\" is all he has said when the topic has come up about his performance in the majors the last two years. Cantlay isn't known to be verbose on many subjects, particularly when it comes to his performance in golf's most important championships.\n\nHe also has rejected notions that his time on the PGA Tour board during the divide with LIV Golf and negotiations with the Saudi backers of the rival league has been a distraction.\n\nWhatever the case, this was a good day of work.\n\nHis 65 matched the lowest start at Pinehurst No. 2 in the previous three U.S. Opens, with Martin Kaymer posting that score in 2014 in soft, wet conditions.\n\nAberg, who a year ago had just graduated from Texas Tech and already is considered among the elite in golf, managed six birdies in his round of 66. Matthieu Pavon of France reached 5 under with an eagle on the par-5 10th only to drop two shots coming in.\n\nPinehurst No. 2 created plenty of stress for so many others.\n\nKoepka was sailing along by using strength to get through the native plants in a sandy area to set up a two-putt birdie on the par-5 fifth, taking on an accessible pin at the sixth hole for a short birdie and dropping a 35-foot birdie putt on the par-5 10th.\n\nAnd then he gave it all back by misjudging the speed and break on a 35-foot putt that went 15 feet by the hole. He missed the green just enough to see it roll off a slope on the 15th, and he got out of position into the sandy landscape on the next hole for another bogey.\n\nColin Morikawa, who has played in the final group at the first two majors of the year, hit what he thought was a good bunker shot on the par-3 ninth, but it rolled by the cup 2 feet and then took a slope and stopped rolling 80 feet away, leading to double bogey.\n\nHe took another double bogey on the par-3 15th when it took two shots -- one from the wiregrass bush, another with his putter -- to get on the green.\n\nHe still managed a 70 by holing a bunker shot on the par-3 17th for birdie and finishing with a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th.\n\nAmong those who broke par was Sergio Garcia, who got in as alternate from his 36-hole qualifying site to keep alive his streak of playing every U.S. Open dating to 2000. He shot 69.\n\nThose 25 straight years playing the toughest test in golf have taught Garcia the value of par, and not to be alarmed by the hot start Cantlay produced.\n\n\"There's always going to be someone that hits the ball great, everything goes his way, makes a couple of bombs, and you can shoot it,\" Garcia said. \"Are we going to see it consistently? If it doesn't rain, I don't think so. You might see someone shooting another 66 or 65 or something like that. I think as the course gets even firmer, even faster, a tiny bit of breeze comes up here and there, it's going to be difficult to shoot those kind of scores.\"\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the

McIlroy missed a seven-foot birdie putt at the ninth.\n\nAmerican Cantlay, seeking his first major triumph, matched the low US Open rounds at Pinehurst, two 65s by Martin Kaymer on his way to victory in 2014.\n\n\"Played pretty solid most of the way,\" Cantlay said.\n\n\"The golf course played pretty difficult. But drove it well. Lot of balls on the fairways. Left the ball in the right spots, for the most part.\"\n\nAberg sank a six-foot birdie putt at the par-3 ninth to finish on 66 with six birdies and two bogeys.\n\n\"Very nice round of golf. Not a lot to complain about,\" Aberg said. \"Made a couple nice putts, hit some really nice shots. Staying very disciplined is important.\"\n\nDomed greens, sandy waste areas and wiregrass was making for a difficult day for most of the field of 156.\n\n\"It's the US Open. It's supposed to be hard,\" Aberg said. \"That's what we're doing here.\"\n\nMore from this section Hong Kong: Dragon Boat Festival 2024 Drone Show 4 Transparent Sleeping Is Here To Stay as Travelers Are Chasing Uniqueness in 2024 PM Modi Spells Out 3 Criteria For Success In His First Speech To PMO Team After Taking Charge\n\nFrance's Matthieu Pavon, ranked 24th, fired a 67 to stand third, soaring with eagles at the par-5 fifth on an 18-foot putt and on a 27-foot putt at the par-5 10th hole.\n\n\"I made my four best swings of the day on the par-5s and dropped two putts, so it gave me a nice two eagles,\" Pavon said. \"It gave me a little bit of freedom.\"\n\nScheffler has five PGA Tour wins this year, the most by any player at this stage since Tom Watson in 1980.\n\nTwo-time Masters champion Scheffler has 12 top-10 showings in 13 starts this year and could match 15-time major winner Tiger Woods as the only players to win a US Open while atop the world rankings.\n\nSchauffele snapped a two-year win drought last month with his first major triumph.\n\nCantlay, the 2021 PGA Tour playoff champion, has a best major showing of third at the 2019 PGA.

To go bogey-free is even greater,\" Garcia said.\n\nFive-time major winner Brooks Koepka, chasing a third US Open title after wins in 2017 and 2018, and seventh-ranked Collin Morikawa, a two-time major winner, were among those on 70.\n\nTiger Woods, a 15-time major winner struggling to overcome severe leg injuries from a 2021 car crash, struggled to a 74.

His start Thursday in the U.S. Open was enough to at least wonder if his time is coming next.\n\nCantlay handled Pinehurst No. 2 in the same methodical manner he handles endless PGA Tour board meetings that consume a lot of his time these days. With only one bogey and a pair of birdie putts from the 20-foot range, Cantlay opened with a 5-under 65.\n\nHe had a one-shot lead over Ludvig Aberg of Sweden and set a daunting target for Scottie Scheffler and the rest of the field taking on the notorious domed greens of Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nIn hot weather with barely a breeze, only nine players managed to break par from the morning wave, a list that did not include Tiger Woods or five-time major champion Brooks Koepka.\n\nCompeting in his first U.S. Open since 2020, Woods had five bogeys in a seven-hole stretch around the turn and opened with a 74. Koepka was atop the leaderboard for much of the morning, looking very much like the player who brings his best game to the biggest events, until three bogeys over the last six holes dropped him back to 70.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For a player like Cantlay, who has no glaring weakness in his game, his record in the majors has stood out for all the wrong reasons. He has had only one good chance -- the 2019 Masters -- and four top 10s in 26 majors since returning from a severe back injury in 2017.\n\nHis most recent major was a tie for 53rd in the PGA Championship, allowing him to get back home in south Florida in time to watch Xander Schauffele win at Valhalla.\n\n\"We're working on it,\" is all he has said when the topic has come up about his performance in the majors the last two years. Cantlay isn't known to be verbose on many subjects, particularly when it comes to his performance in golf's most important championships.\n\nHe also has rejected notions that his time on the PGA Tour board during the divide with LIV Golf and negotiations with the Saudi backers of the rival league has been a distraction.\n\nWhatever the case, this was a good day of work.\n\nHis 65 matched the lowest start at Pinehurst No. 2 in the previous three U.S. Opens, with Martin Kaymer posting that score in 2014 in soft, wet conditions.\n\nAberg, who a year ago had just graduated from Texas Tech and already is considered among the elite in golf, managed six birdies in his round of 66. Matthieu Pavon of France reached 5 under with an eagle on the par-5 10th only to drop two shots coming in.\n\nPinehurst No. 2 created plenty of stress for so many others.\n\nKoepka was sailing along by using strength to get through the native plants in a sandy area to set up a two-putt birdie on the par-5 fifth, taking on an accessible pin at the sixth hole for a short birdie and dropping a 35-foot birdie putt on the par-5 10th.\n\nAnd then he gave it all back by misjudging the speed and break on a 35-foot putt that went 15 feet by the hole. He missed the green just enough to see it roll off a slope on the 15th, and he got out of position into the sandy landscape on the next hole for another bogey.\n\nColin Morikawa, who has played in the final group at the first two majors of the year, hit what he thought was a good bunker shot on the par-3 ninth, but it rolled by the cup 2 feet and then took a slope and stopped rolling 80 feet away, leading to double bogey.\n\nHe took another double bogey on the par-3 15th when it took two shots -- one from the wiregrass bush, another with his putter -- to get on the green.\n\nHe still managed a 70 by holing a bunker shot on the par-3 17th for birdie and finishing with a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th.\n\nAmong those who broke par was Sergio Garcia, who got in as alternate from his 36-hole qualifying site to keep alive his streak of playing every U.S. Open dating to 2000. He shot 69.\n\nThose 25 straight years playing the toughest test in golf have taught Garcia the value of par, and not to be alarmed by the hot start Cantlay produced.\n\n\"There's always going to be someone that hits the ball great, everything goes his way, makes a couple of bombs, and you can shoot it,\" Garcia said. \"Are we going to see it consistently? If it doesn't rain, I don't think so. You might see someone shooting another 66 or 65 or something like that. I think as the course gets even firmer, even faster, a tiny bit of breeze comes up here and there, it's going to be difficult to shoot those kind of scores.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry

But drove it well. A lot of balls on the fairway. Left the ball in the right spots, for the most part.\"\n\nAberg, playing in his first U.S. Open, produced a brilliant display of ball-striking and birdied his closing hole, the par-three ninth, to get within one of Cantlay while Frenchman Matthieu Pavon was a further shot back.\n\nPavon made a bit of history while moving into contention as he became the first player with two eagles in a U.S. Open round at Pinehurst.\n\nCantlay, competing in his 30th major, started on the back nine and kick-started his day at the par-four 11th, his second, where he chipped in for birdie from a greenside bunker.\n\nThe 32-year-old American made the turn at one under but covered his final nine holes in a stunning four-under 31. Cantlay had a chance to go even lower but a birdie putt from 19 feet at his final hole shaved the right edge.\n\nSergio Garcia, who only learned on Monday that he was added to the field as an alternate, made the most of his opportunity by carding only the sixth bogey-free round in U.S. Open history at Pinehurst No. 2 to sit four shots back of Cantlay.\n\n\"Obviously to shoot under par in a U.S. Open, which is a championship that I love, it's always great,\" said Garcia. \"To go bogey-free is even greater. It's something that I give a lot of respect to, and I'm very proud of.\"\n\nWorld number one Scheffler, who went out with the late starters and in a high-profile group with Xander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy, was struggling for accuracy off the tee and made the turn at one over after mixing two bogeys with a birdie.\n\nMcIlroy, hoping to end his 10-year major drought this week, was two under and level with Tony Finau (68) while Schauffele, who picked up his first major at last month's PGA Championship, was one over.\n\nBryson DeChambeau, one of 13 LIV Golf players in the 156-player field this week and less than a month removed from his runner-up showing at the PGA Championship with what he later called his \"B\" game, was one under after eight holes.\n\nDefending champion Wyndham Clark, eager to jump-start a season in which he has missed the cut at the first two majors, also went out late and was one over after seven holes.\n\nThe opening round of the U.S. Open was played under sunny skies and on a layout sure to test the mental discipline of the players this week given its tricky greens and fairways that bleed into sandy waste areas full of wire grass.\n\nTiger Woods, competing in only his fourth event of the year and who accepted a special exemption to play in the U.S. Open, enjoyed an encouraging start but his putter abandoned him as the round wore on and he opened with a 74.\n\n\"I didn't hit my irons particularly well,\" said Woods, who was one under through six holes before carding five bogeys over a seven-hole stretch around the turn.\n\n\"Didn't putt that great. Drove it on the string all day. Unfortunately I just didn't capitalise on it.\"\n\nPhil Mickelson, U.S. Open runner-up a record six times, saw his hopes of completing the career Grand Slam of golf's four majors fade with a 79 in a round that started with four consecutive bogeys.\n\n(Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Toby Davis, Ed Osmond and Ken Ferris)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthieu_Pavon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthieu Pavon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650361", "eventUri": "eng-9650361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The 32-year-old Cantlay took advantage, making six birdies and posting 5-under 65 to grab the early first round lead at the 124th U.S. Open.\n\n\"Played pretty solid most of the way. I thought the golf course played pretty difficult. But drove it well. A lot of balls on the fairway. Left the ball in the right spots, for the most part,\" Cantlay said.\n\nHe got into red figures early by sinking a 35-foot birdie putt at No. 11, but gave a stroke back when he missed the green to the left and failed to get up and down at the par-3 15th. That proved to be his lone bogey of the day and his short game otherwise shined: he was seven of eight in scrambling and topped the field in Strokes Gained: Around the Green.\n\nWith a warm sun beating down on his neck, Cantlay rolled in a 17-foot birdie at 18 to get back into red figures and stuck a short iron to five feet at the first for back-to-back birdies. He followed suit with consecutive birdies again at Nos. 5 and 6, the latter thanks to holing a 20-footer. He was happy to see his putter back in his good graces, highlighting a tricky five-foot save at No. 7.\n\nU.S. Open: Leaderboard | Photos | Hole-by-hole | How to watch\n\n\"Made a bunch of putts inside, eight feet. I think around this golf course, you're going to leave yourself putts inside eight feet. That four- to eight-foot range. It important that you hole out,\" he said. \"I did that well today.\"\n\nThat included at No. 8, where he made his final birdie of the day after sticking his approach from 176 yards to four feet.\n\n\"It was a little left of where I was aiming, but that's why you aim in the right spot,\" he said.\n\nCantlay is making his ninth appearance at the U.S. Open, and recorded his best result in the championship last year, finishing T-13. Ranked ninth in the world, Cantlay is winless in more than a year and is one of four players in the top 10 - along with Viktor Hovland, Ludvig Aberg and Max Homa - seeking that elusive first major. He missed the cut last week at the Memorial, a tournament he has won twice, and has been a non-factor at the first two majors.\n\n\"I've been working really hard on my game, and usually when you make just a couple changes and you're working really hard, it's just a matter of time,\" Cantlay said.\n\nLudvig Aberg reacts on the eleventh hole during the first round of the U.S. Open golf tournament. Mandatory Credit: Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAberg had his driver clicking on all cylinders. He hit all 14 fairways in the first round and played judiciously with his approach shots.\n\n\"Staying very disciplined is important. There's a lot of pins where you don't really think about going for,\" Aberg said.\n\nHe followed his game plan well, carding 4-under 66 to sit alone in second. The 24-year-old Swede is seeking to become the first player from his country to win the U.S. Open and the first to win in his championship debut since Francis Ouimet in 1913. France's Matthieu Pavon eagled both of the par 5s and posted 3-under 67. Tiger Woods scattered six bogeys on his card and shot 4-over 74. He'll be battling the cutline on Friday.\n\n\"I thought I did the one thing I needed to do today, which is drive the ball well,\" he said. \"I did that, I just didn't capitalize on any of it.\"\n\nCantlay, on the other hand, did just that. If his lead stands at the end of the day, it would be Cantlay's sixth 18-hole lead/co-lead in individual stroke-play events on Tour, and perhaps an ominous sign for his chances. He's 0-for-5 converting the victory. But he's pleased that he had the right answers to the questions the famed Donald Ross layout served up in round one and knows that the test is only going to get harder.\n\n\"With the weather cooperating, it being warm, I imagine they can get the golf course as difficult as they want,\" Cantlay said. \"With the Bermuda greens and no rain in the forecast, I expect the golf course to play very difficult in the next few days.\"", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_schupak@golfweek.usatoday.com", "name": "Adam Schupak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthieu_Pavon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthieu Pavon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ouimet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Francis Ouimet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Ross_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Ross (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bermuda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bermuda"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://golfweek.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2024/06/USATSI_23537284.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650361", "eventUri": "eng-9650361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Patrick Cantlay and Ludvig Aberg set the early pace on day one of a challenging US Open at Pinehurst, North Carolina.\n\nAmerican Cantlay shot an excellent five-under 65 to lead by one from Sweden's Aberg with Frenchman Matthieu Pavon a further shot back.\n\nThree-time winner Tiger Woods wobbled around the turn with five bogeys in seven holes and ended at four over par.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler, US PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy are grouped together among the later starters on the notoriously tough Number Two course.\n\nLast autumn, the US defence of the Ryder Cup was spearheaded by Cantlay but the Californian has only managed two top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour this season.\n\nYet to win a major, his round ignited on the back nine when he fired three birdies in his final five holes to jump out in front.\n\nBefore April, Aberg had never even played in a major championship, despite thrilling for Europe in their victory in Rome.\n\nA tie for second on his Masters debut showcased his thrilling talent and three birdies on the front nine catapulted him up the leaderboard again.\n\nTrouble on the par-three sixth (his 15th hole) cost him a shot but an outstanding tee shot at the short ninth set up a birdie and outright second place.\n\nOne behind at three under par is Pavon, who won the Farmers Insurance Open in January, while American Tony Finau blotted his excellent start with a bogey at the last to finish two under.\n\nMeanwhile, it was a mixed day for Cantlay's well-fancied Ryder Cup team-mates Brooks Koepka and Collin Morikawa.\n\nFive-time major winner Koepka briefly led at three under par after 10 holes but gave his shots back in the final eight holes to finish five off the lead at level par.\n\nMorikawa has been in fine form this season, finishing fourth and third at the previous two majors and he tuned up for Pinehurst with a second place at last week's Memorial Championship.\n\nThe 2021 Open champion finished his round in style by holing a bunker shot for birdie at 17 and then holed from 17 feet at the last to match Koepka's 70.\n\nAs usual, thousands of fans followed Woods around the course and, after opening with a birdie, five solid pars anchored him in the top 10.\n\nHis round threatened to unravel around the turn but the 15-time major champion rallied, offering a trademark fist pump when sinking a par at the seventh, his 16th hole.\n\nBut a further bogey at his penultimate hole left him nine shots off the lead.\n\nEarlier this week, he said he expected \"a war of attrition\" on a fast and firm course with upturned saucer greens that repel approach shots.\n\nWhen the US Open was last held here in 2014, Martin Kaymer won by eight shots but was one of only three players to shoot under par for the tournament.\n\nIndeed, prior to day one of this tournament, a mere five of 1,368 US Open rounds played on Pinehurst's Number Two course have been bogey free.\n\nSpain's Sergio Garcia, who only found out he was playing on Monday morning, made that six with one birdie and 17 pars in his 69.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

It's been an area of his game that hasn't been particularly fruitful this season and held him back.\n\n\"I've been working really hard on my game, and usually when you make just a couple changes and you're working really hard, it's just a matter of time,\" he said.\n\n\"I think around this golf course, you're going to leave yourself putts inside eight feet. That 4- to 8-foot range, it's important that you hole out. I did that well today.\"\n\nIt didn't hurt that his first birdie of the day didn't require a putter, as he holed a 35-foot bunker shot on No. 11 to kickstart his day. Other than his lone bogey on the par-3 15th, he added birdies at 18, 1, 5, 6 and 8.\n\n\"Got off to a good start, bunker shot on 11; played pretty solid most of the way,\" he said. \"I thought the golf course played pretty difficult. But drove it well. A lot of balls on the fairway. Left the ball in the right spots, for the most part.\"\n\nSweden's \u00c5berg, who finished runner-up in his major debut at the Masters and missed the cut at the PGA, suffering only two bogeys en route to a 4-under 66. France's Matthieu Pavon eagled both par-5s to get to 5-under through 10 holes but gave a couple back to settle for 3-under 67. Tony Finau bogeyed his last (the par-3 ninth) to shoot 68.\n\n\"Not a lot to complain about,\" said \u00c5berg. \"I felt like those times where I kind of got myself out of position a little bit, you just try to get back into play as easy as you can, give yourself a chance for a par.\"\n\nLIV Golf's Sergio Garcia, who reached his 25th consecutive U.S. Open as an alternate this time, led a contingent of five morning finishers by shoot 1-under 69 - a bogey-free effort with a lone birdie at No. 5.\n\n\"Obviously to shoot under par in a U.S. Open, which is a championship that I love, it's always great,\" Garcia said. \"To go bogey-free is even greater. It's something that I give a lot of respect to, and I'm very proud of. I've had the pleasure of playing this championship 25 years in a row, so not a lot of people get to do that, so I'm very, very happy to be here, and that's why I keep trying to qualify and make it here.\n\n\"Very happy about the way I played, the way I managed my game throughout the whole round, and how patient I stayed all day.\"\n\nBrooks Koepka, with two U.S. Opens among his five major wins, got to 3-under through 10 holes but gave it back with bogeys at 13, 15 and 16 to finish level 70.\n\nWith even hotter weather and continued sunshine expected through the weekend, Thursday is probably as good as it will get for the 156-player field.\n\n\"With the weather cooperating, it being warm, I imagine they can get the golf course as difficult as they want,\" Cantlay said of the USGA setup crew. \"With the Bermuda greens and no rain in the forecast, I expect the golf course to play very difficult in the next few days.\"\n\nPlenty of players found it hard enough on Thursday. Phil Mickelson - a six-time runner-up in the U.S. Open including in 1999 to Payne Stewart at Pinehurst - shot a 9-over 79, which was saved from being dead last in the morning wave by qualifier Charlie Reiter's 80. Two-time PGA champion Justin Thomas shot 77 and Will Zalatoris 75.\n\nDustin Johnson and Tiger Woods both shot 74.\n\n\"I thought I did the one thing I needed to do today, which is drive the ball well. I did that, I just didn't capitalize on any of it,\" said Woods.\n\n\"I think I three-putted, what, two or three times today? If I clean that up, if I get a couple iron shots not as loose as I did, I'm right there at even par. It can go so far the other way here, the wrong way. It's just so hard to get back. This is a golf course that doesn't give up a whole lot of birdies. It gives up a lot of bogeys and higher.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_michaux@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Scott Michaux", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludvig_\u00c5berg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ludvig \u00c5berg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthieu_Pavon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthieu Pavon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Zalatoris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Zalatoris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payne_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payne Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dustin Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8322/4161097_1_articlelarge_GOLF_20US_20PGA_201854585.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650361", "eventUri": "eng-9650361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

He shot a first-round 65 on Thursday, putting him at 5 under par for the tournament.\n\nCantlay, 32, has never been in the top five following the open round of a major, per Justin Ray. His best finish at a major championship was T3 at the 2019 PGA Championship. At the U.S. Open, it was T14 in 2022 and 2023.\n\nCantlay, who played the back nine first, fired a 1-under 34 going out. Coming in, Cantlay recorded a bogey-free 31 with four birdies. He birdied three of his last five holes, ascending up the leaderboard.\n\nCantlay needed just 23 putts on Thursday, his career low in any major round, per Justin Ray.\n\nChasing Cantlay is Ludvig \u00c5berg, who shot a 4-under 66 in his first round. \u00c5berg, 24, was 14-of-14 on fairways and 16-of-18 on greens in regulation in his first round. Per Justin Ray, he's the second player to hit every fairway and 16-plus greens in regulation in a U.S. Open round at Pinehurst. \u00c5berg is playing in just his third ever major championship. His best finish at a major was this year's Masters, finishing runner up to champion Scottie Scheffler.\n\n\u00c5berg and Tony Finau (2 under) also accelerated to the finish to get into the top five. They, like Cantlay and Matthieu Pavon (third place at 3 under), are looking for their first major championships.\n\nTiger Woods, the 15-time major champion, is going to have a heck of a time just to play the weekend. Woods shot a 4-over 74 with two birdies and six bogeys, four of those bogeys on his back nine.\n\nPhil Mickelson can go ahead and make travel arrangements for Friday evening. He shot 9 over par for his first round, tied for last place in the field. Mickelson bogeyed his first four holes, had a 41 on the front nine and did not have a single birdie in his round.\n\nFind the best deals on tickets to the U.S. Open\n\nCantlay's unprecedented first round at Pinehurst No. 2 was built around the course's notoriously tricky greens. He gained 3.77 shots around the green, the best by a large margin in the opening wave. As a result, he needed only 23 putts, making 66 feet worth of them.\n\nThe king of the Sunday backdoor top 10 at a major is now going to watch the afternoon wave and see if his 5-under-par score can hold up. His close was particularly remarkable -- No. 5 has been an attack hole for most today but the pin placement on No. 6 has vexed many guys so far, and Cantlay birdied the hole. He added a birdie on No. 8 to get to 5 under and a 31 on his back nine (front nine on the course). -- Hugh Kellenberger, golf managing editor", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lukas_weese@nytimes.com", "name": "Lukas Weese", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "hugh_kellenberger@nytimes.com", "name": "Hugh Kellenberger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthieu_Pavon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthieu Pavon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/06/13133338/gettyimages-2157469764-594x594-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650361", "eventUri": "eng-9650361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

You have to make plenty of putts, too.\n\nPatrick Cantlay did just that on Thursday, which explains why he carded an impressive opening round 5-under 65. He gained 3.8 strokes around the greens, which ranks first among the field. He also hit plenty of solid iron shots, gaining 2.15 strokes on approach.\n\nHis round got off to a thrilling start at the par-4 11th, where he holed out for birdie from the sand, which provided a huge momentum boost early.\n\nHe then dropped a shot at the par-3 15th, his only bogey of the day, but bounced back with a birdie on the 18th to post a 1-under 34 to start. Having started on 10, he made the turn towards the front, where more opportunities presented themselves.\n\nCantlay birdied the 1st hole, thanks to a spectacular approach that landed five feet away. Two more birdies followed at the par-5 5th and par-3 6th, the latter of which came on one of the most challenging holes on the property. Cantlay drained a 20-footer there for his fifth par-breaker of the day, vaulting himself to 4-under for the tournament.\n\nBut his self-described best moment of the day came at the par-4 7th.\n\n\"I got the ball up and down on 7, made a bunch of putts inside, eight feet,\" Cantlay said.\n\n\"I think around this golf course, you're going to leave yourself putts inside eight feet. That four-to-eight-foot range. It is important that you hole out. I did that well today.\"\n\nAfter missing the fairway right, Cantlay hit his approach just short of the green on 7. He then chipped up to 5-feet away and drained the putt.\n\nThen, on the next hole, the 486-yard par-4 8th, Cantlay hit his second shot to four feet, which set up his fifth -- and final -- birdie of the day.\n\nHe now leads Ludvig \u00c5berg by a stroke at 5-under par on a course that will only get tougher as the championship wears on. Cantlay admitted that he did not have a score in mind this morning but knows the most challenging moments are yet to come.\n\n\"I didn't think much of [the score],\" Cantlay said. I knew going off at 7:40 in the morning, it was going to play maybe the easiest it will play all week, with the lack of wind and probably the softest we will see it.

He's out to a good start to scratch his name off that list.\n\nThe eight-time PGA Tour winner and ninth-ranked player in the world shot 5-under 65 Thursday morning at Pinehurst No. 2 in the opening round of the 124th U.S. Open, leading by one over Ludvig \u00c5berg.\n\nCantlay, a 32-year-old California native who played collegiately at UCLA, is making his 27th major start as a professional. He has never missed a cut in the U.S. Open, with high finishes of T14 the last two years.\n\nXander Schauffele, his closest friend on Tour, won his first major last month at the PGA Championship. Cantlay finished T53 that week at Valhalla Golf Club.\n\nCantlay made six birdies opposite just one bogey at perilous Pinehurst No. 2, whose domed green complexes repel shots in all directions and are the course's primary defense against the game's best players.\n\nTwo-time U.S. Open champion Brooks Koepka, for example, shot 33 on the front nine and got to 3 under through 10 holes but gave all that back with three bogeys in a four-hole stretch and shot even-par 70.\n\n\u00c5berg, a 24-year-old Swede ranked sixth in the world, shot 4-under 66 in his first U.S. Open round. Pavon, a native of France who was a surprise winner earlier this year at Torrey Pines, got it to 5 under through 10 holes with eagles on both of Pinehurst No. 2's par-5s but made two bogeys the rest of the way to shoot 67.\n\nTony Finau is another player in the conversation of best to have not won a major, with six PGA Tour wins. He shot 68.\n\nS.H. Kim, Corey Conners and Sergio Garcia all posted 1-under 69s. Garcia, a player on LIV Golf, is making his 25th consecutive U.S. Open start after making the field as alternate from last week's 36-hole final qualifying. His 69 had 17 pars and one birdie-just the sixth bogey-free round in four U.S. Opens played at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nTiger Woods shot 4-over 74, playing for the first time since missing the cut at last month's PGA Championship. Phil Mickelson, who like Woods played at Pinehurst's first U.S. Open in 1999, shot 9-over 79 with nine bogeys and no birdies.\n\nThis U.S. Open has the highest purse ever for a major championship, at $21.5 million with $4.3 million to the winner.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Patrick Cantlay Shoots 65, Leads Early in Opening Round at U.S. Open.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_schwarb@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "John Schwarb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludvig_\u00c5berg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ludvig \u00c5berg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrey_Pines_Golf_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torrey Pines Golf Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/epf2w1/picture289249500/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/da1ef888-b2ea-4bbc-810f-7deb4da12b21", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650361", "eventUri": "eng-9650361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

They lead the U.S. Open", "body": "PINEHURST, N.C. -- When Xander Schauffele won the PGA Championship last month, he shed one title (Best Player Without A Major) for another (Major Champion). That means the former needs a new owner.\n\nThere are plenty of contenders, but the criteria is subjective. Does it belong to the majorless player with the best current form, regardless of longevity? Or a majorless player who has built the strongest resume over years of success? Good question.\n\nThis is one fantastic grill-room debate, and since everyone is entitled to their own opinion -- including golf writers (like me) -- let's hand out some hardware.\n\nRunner-up for Best Player Without A Major: Viktor Hovland\n\nBest Player Without a Major (Body of Work Division): Patrick Cantlay\n\nBest Player Without a Major (Current Form Division): Ludvig Aberg\n\nAnd here's the kicker: the two co-winners are leading this 124th U.S. Open.\n\nCantlay opened with a five-under 65 on Thursday at Pinehurst No. 2, and in the group behind him Aberg shot a four-under 66. That duo was alone atop the leaderboard after the morning wave finished.\n\nCantlay made just one bogey and closed with birdies on three of his last five holes in a round that was a stark contrast to Aberg's. Players who hit a lot of greens, have strong short games and putt well were thought of as favorites coming in. If you miss greens here, that's where the trouble starts. Cantlay hit just 10 greens but got up and down 7 of 8 times, including both instances he was in a greenside bunker (one of which, on the 11th, he holed for birdie). He leads the field in SG: Around the green.\n\nAberg, on the other hand, was so consistently good he was boring. He didn't miss a fairway and hit 16 of 18 greens -- the final one a dagger to 6 feet on the par-3 9th, his final hole, that led to a closing birdie. Both times he missed the green he made his only bogeys.\n\n\"I think staying very disciplined is important,\" Aberg said. \"There's a lot of pins where you don't really think about going for. So me and Joe [Skovron], my caddie, we have a lot of good conversations about certain areas that you try to hit it on. It's difficult to be very, very precise with the numbers and those things. But try to get a gauge on where to hit it, where to miss it, make sure that we stay disciplined toward things.\"\n\nIn a follow up, Aberg was asked if it was difficult to be disciplined.\n\n\"Yeah, absolutely,\" he said. \"It's the U.S. Open, it's supposed to be hard.\"\n\nThis is Cantlay's 30th major start, but he's only had four top 10s. None of them have been in a U.S. Open, although he's tied for 15th (once) and tied for 14th (twice) in his last three appearances here.\n\nAs for Aberg, this is still just the third major start of his career. In fact, the highly decorated collegiate golfer made an immediate impact on the European Ryder Cup last fall before he even played in a major. Then, when he did play in one of the four big ones, he didn't disappoint. He was in the penultimate pairing alongside Max Homa on Masters Sunday, shot 69 and finished solo second, four shots behind winner Scottie Scheffler but three strokes ahead of the next closest competitors.\n\nHe's been racking up strong finishes all season: T9 at the Farmers, 2nd at Pebble Beach, 8th at the Players, T10 at the RBC Heritage and T5 at the Memorial last week. He was a surprising missed cut at the PGA Championship last month, but at this point that week seems like an outlier.\n\nCantlay and Aberg lead early, but it's still so, so early.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tiger Woods predicted that the low on Thursday might be the winning score come Sunday. Cantlay didn't agree or disagree with that, but he did offer one prediction.\n\n\"I imagine they can get the golf course as difficult as they want,\" Cantlay said. \"With the Bermuda greens and no rain in the forecast, I expect the golf course to play very difficult in the next few days.\"", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_of_Champions_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tournament of Champions (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Golf_Links", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Golf Links"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bermuda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bermuda"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/patrick-cantlay-ludvig-aberg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650361", "eventUri": "eng-9650361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

For all the unknowns at a U.S. Open, the names near the top of the early leader board here were strikingly familiar.\n\nPatrick Cantlay, in pursuit of his first major championship, had a cozy spot atop all of them. He posted four birdies on the back nine and entered the clubhouse with an impressive 5-under-par 65 in Thursday's opening round.\n\n\"I knew going off at 7:40 in the morning, it's going to play maybe the easiest it will play all week, with the lack of wind and probably the softest we will see it,\" Cantlay said. \"I'm really happy with the round I played today.\"\n\nWith much of the field still on the course, Cantlay held a one-stroke lead over Ludvig Aberg, a 24-year-old Swede who finished second at the Masters and is playing in his first U.S. Open. Matthieu Pavon carded a 67, and Tony Finau posted a 68. Aberg didn't miss a fairway on his opening round.\n\n\"He's far from a rookie,\" Finau said of Aberg. \"I mean, he's not even your average first guy playing in a major championship. He's been on some of the biggest stages already and shown he's going to be a world-class player.\"\n\nWhile many of the tournament favorites had afternoon tee times -- including Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau -- the morning rounds hinted that despite the difficult course setup, low scores are possible, at least compared to some past U.S. Opens. There were seven golfers from the morning groups who finished the round under par, with several others on course to do the same.\n\nAt the 2014 U.S. Open on the same course, a total of 15 golfers were under par during round one. Just three players finished that 2014 tournament under par. At the 2005 U.S. Open on the Pinehurst No. 2 course, not one golfer finished under par, and Payne Stewart won the 1999 U.S. Open at 1-under.\n\n\"You might see someone, yeah, shooting another 66 or 65 or something like that, but at the end of the day, I think as the course gets even firmer, even faster, a tiny bit of breeze comes up here and there, it's going to be difficult to shoot those kind of scores,\" said Sergio Garcia, who posted a 1-under 69 Thursday.\n\nGarcia's scorecard was free of any bogeys, a Pinehurst rarity. In the three previous U.S. Opens here -- 1,368 rounds in all -- just five golfers managed a bogey-free round, including one by Martin Kaymer, the 2014 champion.\n\n\"It's something that I give a lot of respect to, and I'm very proud of,\" he said. \"I've had the pleasure of playing this championship 25 years in a row, so not a lot of people get to do that, so I'm very, very happy to be here.\"\n\nSkimming down the leader board reveals plenty of other notable names and past stars hoping for one more championship. Tiger Woods began his round with a birdie and was in great form for much of his opening nine holes. But he bogeyed five holes in a seven-hole stretch and finished the round with a 4-over 74.\n\n\"I'd like to hit a few putts,\" he said. \"My speed was not quite there. I think I three-putted, what, two or three times today. If I clean that up, if I get a couple iron shots not as loose as I did, I'm right there at even par. It can go so far the other way here, the wrong way. It's just so hard to get back. This is a golf course that doesn't give up a whole lot of birdies. It gives up a lot of bogeys and higher.\"\n\nJustin Thomas was 7-over in the opening round, and Phil Mickelson, still seeking a U.S. Open victory to complete a career grand slam, finished at 9-over.\n\nWhile the course and its turtleback greens posed unique challenges from hole to hole, there were still plenty of early heroics here. In posting his 3-under 67, Pavon became the first player to make multiple eagles in a U.S. Open round at Pinehurst No. 2, sinking long putts on the two par 5s, holes Nos. 5 and 10.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_maese@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Rick Maese", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthieu_Pavon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthieu Pavon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payne_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Payne Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kaymer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Kaymer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YTEP3NZDZPWJLX2MOS7MRKCGB4.jpg&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650361", "eventUri": "eng-9650361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Starting on the 10th tee, the American star made his first birdie of the day at the par-four 11th, landing a superb bunker shot from the green-side trap down the left.\n\nHe soon cancelled this out though as three pars were followed by a frustrating bogey at the par-three 15th, as he failed to make up for a wayward tee shot that was pulled down the left of the 206-yard hole.\n\nREAD MORE: Ian Poulter launched explosive, foul-mouthed rant at LIV Golf fan\n\nREAD MORE: US Open chief offers blunt response to LIV Golf stars and addresses possible qualification path\n\nCantlay made sure he got himself back in the red heading to the turn however, making his second birdie of the day by rolling in a lengthy putt on the 18th green. This proved to be a catalyst for the former Fed Ex Cup champion, who leaped into life on the front nine (his second nine).\n\nA second-straight birdie followed at the first hole, before he followed up three-straight pars with back-to-back birdies at the fifth and sixth. Cantlay then played one of the best approaches of the early wave at the par-four eighth, firing in a superb iron shot from the fairway to within four-feet, which he tapped in for another birdie.\n\nHe rounded his day off with a par at the par-three ninth to ensure he was the early man to catch on day one in North Carolina. Speaking in the aftermath, he said: \"Yeah, [I] got off to a good start, bunker shot on 11. Played pretty solid most of the way. I thought the golf course played pretty difficult.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\n\"But drove it well. A lot of balls on the fairway. Left the ball in the right spots, for the most part.\" It was a much-needed performance from Cantlay, who has failed to find his best golf so far in 2024. Away from the course, he has been embroiled in the saga surrounding the PGA Tour and LIV Golf.\n\nCantlay is one of six player directors on the PGA Tour policy board, who are providing a voice for the Tour's membership as negotiations over a peace deal with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) continue. Reports have suggested the American has become one of the most vocal on the board, amid the ongoing talks.\n\nOn the course, Cantlay has broken into the top-20 on just two occasions this season. His outing one week prior was one to forget, after 32-year-old missed the cut at the Memorial Tournament last Friday. He will be hoping he can keep up his hot start in North Carolina on Friday, when he returns for round two at 6:25 p.m. BST alongside Matt Kuchar and Russell Henley.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_lees@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Joshua Lees", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Poulter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ian Poulter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Henley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Henley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Kuchar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Kuchar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33026633.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2157468281.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650361", "eventUri": "eng-9650361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

We have all of the best action from the first round of the 2024 contest in North Carolina right here.\n\nHe may be playing on the LIV Tour now, but the cantankerous Tyrrell Hatton hasn't changed much. On the 213-yard par 3 17th hole, Hatton dropped his club immediately upon impact, then hit it with his feet before looking up and seeing that his ball had landed on the green just a few feet from the pin. The ensuing birdie putt dropped and Hatton, now at 1-under par for the tournament, couldn't help but smile. -- Paolo Uggetti\n\nBetween the 2018 Masters and 2021 PGA Championship, Tony Finau finished in the top 10 in nine of 13 starts in major championships. He was a top-10 machine. In the past 12 starts since then, Finau doesn't have a finish better than a tie for 15th. Finau is right back in the mix again after carding a 2-under 68 in the first round on Thursday. It would be the 34th time since the start of 2015 that Finau was in the top-10 at the end of a round in a major, according to Elias Sports. Only Rory McIlroy (52) and Justin Rose (49) have more such rounds during that stretch. -- Mark Schlabach\n\nIt was a first round to forget for LIV Golf League captain Phil Mickelson on Thursday at the Pinehurst No. 2. A six-time U.S. Open runner-up, Mickelson carded a 9-over 79, which was tied for second worst among golfers in the early wave. Mickelson made nine bogeys -- including on each of the first four holes -- without a birdie. He hit only six of 14 fairways off the tee and three of 18 greens. \"Lefty\" is now 29 over in his past 11 rounds at Pinehurst No. 2. The silver lining for Mickelson: It seems that he'll probably be home for his 54th birthday on Sunday. -- Mark Schlabach\n\nAfter sending his drive into the native areas on the par-5 fifth hole and failing to lay up into the fairway, Rory McIlroy's approach shot landed on the green and rolled off. No problem. The four-time major winner's chip had the perfect touch and dropped into the hole for his second birdie of the day, putting him 2 under through five holes.\n\nFor a golfer that has been considered one of the most talented in the world the past few seasons, Patrick Cantlay's record in major championships hasn't been stellar. The eight-time PGA Tour winner has 14 top-25 finishes in 29 starts but finished in the top five only once -- a tie for third in the 2019 PGA Championship. On Thursday, Cantlay was the early clubhouse leader with a 5 under 65, thanks to accurate iron play and a deft short game. According to data from ESPN Stats & Information, Cantlay has never been inside the top five at the end of an opening round of a major. He has also never led or co-led in any major round. -- Mark Schlabach\n\nAt this point, we probably shouldn't be surprised by anything Sweden's Ludvig \u00c5berg does on the golf course. After finishing second in his first Masters appearance in April, Aberg carded a 4 under 66 on Thursday, his debut round in a U.S. Open. He's 1 stroke behind leader Patrick Cantlay. Aberg is the seventh player in U.S. Open history to post a 66 or better in his first round in the U.S. Open; Matthew Wolff was the most recent with a 4 under 66 at Winged Foot in 2020. -- Mark Schlabach\n\nJon Rahm may be out of the U.S. Open with a foot infection, but he's still keeping tabs on his colleagues.\n\nRemember Neal Shipley, the low amateur at the Masters in April? The Ohio State golfer is back on the leaderboard at a major at 2 under after 12 holes. The \"Ship\" drained an 18\u00bd-footer for birdie on No. 1 and a 33\u00bd-footer on the par-4 12th to move into a tie for fourth. It's a good thing Woods isn't playing him again today; Shipley, runner-up in the 2023 U.S. Amateur, beat Tiger by 4 shots in a Sunday pairing at Augusta National. -- Mark Schlabach\n\nTiger picked up a birdie on the par-5 fifth to end an ugly stretch of 5 over in the previous seven holes. He ripped a 316-yard drive down the right side, then his second shot bounced onto the green before rolling back off. He chipped to about 30 feet and missed the eagle putt. Woods had birdies on both par-5s and needed the second one to get back to 3 over with four holes to play. -- Mark Schlabach\n\nFor all the talk of Pinehurst's difficulty this week, it doesn't seem as if Matthieu Pavon is having much of a problem. The Frenchman made the turn in 2 under, with one eagle already under his belt, and proceeded to add a second one on the par-5 10th hole with a 27-foot putt after reaching the green. It's early, but Pavon's 5 under will now set the pace for the rest of the tournament. -- Paolo Uggetti\n\nPavon carded eagles on both par-5s at Pinehurst No. 2 in the first round Thursday to become the first player to get to 5 under. According to Elias Sports Bureau, he's the first golfer to post two eagles in the same U.S. Open round at Pinehurst No. 2. He's the third player to do it in the U.S. Open at any course in the past 10 years; Jimmy Walker (second round, Shinnecock Hills in 2018) and Tommy Fleetwood (final round, Los Angeles Country Club in 2023) were the others. --Mark Schlabach\n\nStop me if you've heard this before: On a hard major championship golf course, Brooks Koepka is leading the tournament. The four-time major winner got off to an early lead at the U.S. Open by playing the front nine in 2 under and making a birdie on the 10th hole to go to 3 under on the day. Koepka seems to thrive in these kind of setups, and this week should be no different. -- Paolo Uggetti\n\nFifteen-time major champion Tiger Woods is off to a great start Thursday. He began on the second nine and sank a 12-foot birdie putt on the par-5 10th. On the par-4 12th, Woods didn't like his second shot and nearly broke an iron over his knee. His ball ended up in a greenside bunker. He chipped to 10 feet and made the long par save to remain at 1 under. Woods' short game looked rusty at the Masters and PGA Championship, but so far so good at Pinehurst No. 2. -- Mark Schlabach", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title":

Can he break through at Pinehurst?", "body": "PINEHURST, N.C. -- It was going to happen, right? It had to. If he kept playing that well, kept putting himself in the mix, the big wins would come. These guys have to convince themselves of it every day or else they'd go mad. But creeping in the back of their minds, lurking in their anxieties is the fear: What if it doesn't? '\n\nFor the past seven years, Patrick Cantlay has been arguably the most consistent golfer in the world. Everything about him was consistent. He gained strokes on the field in every category. Those statistics remained eerily similar year to year. He'd consistently win one or two tournaments each year, rack up 15 top-20s, eight top-5s and finish the season ranked fourth or fifth overall in the world.\n\nAnd consistently, he'd fail to start well at major championships.\n\nEach year a golfer plays at a top level without major results is another year that fear inches further. Consistency never lasts forever. Everybody has a window.\n\nAnd suddenly this season, for the first time ever, Cantlay became inconsistent. His driving. His ball striking. Putting, too. Right when Cantlay seized power and took on a larger role in PGA Tour decision-making, his game became erratic. He has just two top-10s all year. He's finished outside the top 20 in seven of his last 13. The majors haven't gotten any better. Cantlay just turned 32. He's not old, but he's not young. If not handled correctly, the fear could take over.\n\nBut somehow, it took being inconsistent for Cantlay to finally jump out to lead the U.S. Open.\n\nAt the brutally firm and fast Pinehurst No. 2, Cantlay rode a beautiful day of ball striking and short game play to shoot an opening-round 65 for a one-shot lead at the U.S. Open on Thursday. This is uncharted territory for the Ryder Cup star. He's never even been top-five at a major through 18 holes. He's never been better than T-7, which came at the 2022 Masters where he finished 39th. His lowest first-round score was 68 at the 2018 PGA Championship, a tournament he finished T27. This is just the third time he's even shot under 70.\n\nCantlay had only four career major top-10s, and whether it was fair or not, those were often labeled as invalid backdoor finishes when he wasn't truly in contention. It became almost a bit, the fact that he and Xander Schauffele -- the best man at his wedding, his Ryder Cup partner, the man he won the PGA Tour's team event with in New Orleans -- both played absurdly consistent golf but both failed to close out a major.\n\nThen something funny happened last month. Schauffele, playing some of the best golf of his career, broke through at the PGA Championship in Louisville. And he did it dispelling his biggest critique -- that he wasn't clutch. Tied entering the final hole Schauffele birdied 18 to win his first major, changing the entire narrative surrounding him in one week.\n\nThat left Cantlay, alone, safe to label as the best player over 30 without a major. He finished T53 that week in Louisville. Then, in Cantlay's next start at the Memorial, he missed the cut while losing 1.35 strokes off the tee.\n\nSo where did Thursday come from?\n\nHe put himself in fairways consistently, essential in attacking Pinehurst's daunting turtleback greens leaving any shot that isn't perfect rolling off the edges. He hit only 23 putts all day, because he found a sweet little recipe of either putting his approach close for birdie or missing the green altogether and using his excellent short game to set up an easy putt. He led the field with 3.97 strokes gained around the green.\n\n\"I've been working really hard on my game,\" Cantlay said after his round, \"and usually when you make just a couple changes and you're working really hard, it's just a matter of time.\"\n\nSo he's here. He's made it through the hard part. He is finally starting a major in contention and not trying to make up a deficit. That's just step one. But it's also the step he's struggled with most.\n\nSay what you will about Cantlay, but no one can say that he is not clutch. Far from it. He is arguably most famous for his crunch time putts to beat Rory McIlroy and Matt Fitzpatrick Saturday at the Ryder Cup (leading to hats flying in the air and infamous confrontations). He's never lost a Ryder Cup match, winning five and tying three. His most epic PGA Tour win came in a thrilling six-hole playoff duel over Bryson DeChambeau at the 2021 BMW Championship, going on to win the Tour Championship the next week. Three of his eight PGA Tour wins came via playoff.\n\nIt was just always a bit of a punchline that Cantlay -- a man accused of protesting the Ryder Cup for not being paid by refusing to wear a hat -- had his biggest moments at the gargantuan money tournaments in the FedEx Cup Playoffs.

Apparently, that's also what The Herald team covering Scotland at Euro 2024 said about the Munich bierkellers when they tried to get a drouth-quencher after a hard day at the coalface.\n\nIt was a tough old shift too for many during the opening day of the 124th staging of the USGA's flagship event.\n\nPhil Mickelson, with six runners-up finishes in the only major that has eluded him, crashed to a nine-over 79 during a round that started with four bogeys in a row and was littered with debris.\n\nJustin Thomas, the two-time major champion, also had a day to forget with an opening 77. As for Tiger Woods?\n\nWell, the 15-time major champion, with three US Open wins on his cv, had inched his way to the top of the leaderboard in the early stages of his round. The sight of his name at the summit, even for a brief spell, generated great shrieks of giddy excitement.\n\nAlas, the delirium didn't last long, and Woods, who leaked five shots in seven holes around the turn, had to settle for a four-over 74 which left him nine shots behind the early clubhouse leader, Patrick Cantlay, who plodded and plotted his way to the top with a tidy 65.\n\nBehind Cantlay, lurked the terrific, unflappable Swede, Ludvig Aberg. Making his first appearance in the US Open in this season of major debuts - he's aiming to become the first debutant to win the US title since 1913 - Aberg put in a wonderfully poised, patient and polished performance over the treasured and testing Pinehurst No 2 course.\n\nThe 24-year-old, who finished second in his first major outing at the Masters back in April, hit all 14 fairways and 16 of 18 greens in regulation as he signed for a 66. It was fine effort from the world No 6 who's been a professional for only 12 months\n\n\"Not a lot to complain about,\" said Aberg, who said that the first US Open he remembers was at Pinehurst in 2014, when his caddie Joe Skovron was working for joint runner-up Rickie Fowler.\n\n\"The times when you get out of position a little bit, you just try to get back into play as easy as you can and give yourself a chance for a par.\n\n\"I think staying very disciplined is important. There's a lot of pins you don't really think about going for.\"\n\nPinehurst's notorious turtleback greens and satanic run-offs that look like they've been mown by the devil himself, can mangle the mind but Cantlay's canny, methodical approach reaped considerable rewards.\n\nCantlay, who had a good chance of a major breakthrough at the 2019 Masters, hasn't really threatened in the grand slam events but feels he is heading in the right direction.\n\n\"We're working on it,\" he said of his efforts to improve that record.\n\nFrenchman Matthieu Pavon also got working and finished just a couple of shots off the clubhouse lead with a 67.\n\nPavon, who won his first PGA Tour title in January, eagled the fifth and 10th during a welcome return to form after a poor recent run of results.\n\n\"I've been crushed by the few last golf courses,\" Pavon admitted. \"I played terrible at Quail Hollow. I played terrible at the (US) PGA. I played terrible at Memorial, too.\n\n\"I used to play slightly easier golf courses back in Europe, so on these types of courses I kind of have to adjust my game, adjust my thinking.\n\n\"Obviously when it's really, really tough like this week, at least you know that sometimes you have to take away some pressure and some expectations and play smart.\"\n\nSergio Garcia had plenty to smile about as he made the most of his late call-up to the championship with a one-under 69.\n\nGarcia was in danger of missing out on a 25th straight appearance in the US Open when he lost out in a play-off in final qualifying in Dallas but got in off the reserve list on Monday.\n\nHe made the most of it. The super sub became just the sixth player to card a bogey-free round in a US Open at Pinehurst with 17 pars and one birdie.\n\nThe last time Garcia went bogey-free in the first round of a major was in the 2017 Masters, which he went on to win. A good omen? We'll see.\n\n\"Obviously to shoot under par in a US Open, which is a championship that I love, it's always great,\" Garcia said. \"To go bogey-free is even greater. I'm very proud.\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Thomas_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Thomas (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_statistical_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combined statistical area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Herald_(Glasgow)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Herald (Glasgow)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rickie Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthieu_Pavon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthieu Pavon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/18193784/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650361", "eventUri": "eng-9650361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

It takes a special kind of mental fortitude to hang tough at venues designed to give the world's best golfers the most extreme tests they face all year.\n\nTalk about needing to stay locked in. Every single shot and every single corner of Pinehurst No. 2, disaster lurks. Look no further than even one of the top contenders so far, Ludvig Aberg. With an excellent round going, the 24-year-old phenom hit his tee shot just short of the par-3 sixth green, his 15th hole of Thursday's opening round. A relatively straightforward pitch and run all of a sudden turned into a most awkward stance.\n\nThankfully for Aberg, he managed to get up and down from there with a nervy putt for bogey from about eight feet. To be fair, Aberg is making his U.S. Open debut -- and what a start he's had with quality shots like these:\n\nGot a 10-1 ticket on Aberg to win. Pray for me. Or for Scottie Scheffler to get arrested again since that's all that seems to be stopping him these days.\n\nOnce again, though, the slightest lapse in concentration or execution can turn into a big number in a hurry. Collin Morikawa found that out the hard way with a somewhat short-sided bunker shot early in his round. The ball just kept rolling on him, and wound up totally off the green to the other side.\n\nThat was one of two double bogies Morikawa made on par 3s because of how severe Pinehurst's table-top contoured greens are. However, the two-time major champ who's seeking the third leg of the career Grand Slam this week hung tough, totally redeemed himself for that bunker mishap with a hole-out on the 17th, and curled in a sick birdie at the last to salvage an even-par round of 70.\n\nYou can see by the usually even-keeled Morikawa's reactions to those two birdies how huge they were. it's still so early in the tournament, but at a U.S. Open, you can shoot yourself out of it with a couple big numbers early on. Although he trails clubhouse leader Patrick Cantlay by five strokes, there's no telling how difficult the conditions may get. There's not a raindrop in sight on the forecast for Pinehurst, North Carolina, with temperatures due to reach the low 90s in each of the next three days.\n\nWhat does that mean? Even faster fairways, greens, and more cartoonish carnage around the course as the weekend unfolds and the intensity of competition ramps up.\n\nA little earlier in the morning wave, two-time PGA Tour winner Sungjae Im and former Italian prodigy Matteo Manassero further illustrated how small the margin for error is at Pinehurst:\n\nThought this was notable from Johnson Wagner, who predicted that only three players will still be under par by the time the champion is decided on Sunday:\n\nCantlay has set the standard, yet he's never sealed the deal on a major before, so there's a fat chance he'll remain at Wagner's projected winning score -- much less go lower. Pinehurst may need to water the greens, move up tees, or give the players more kind pins to fire at. Otherwise, we're in real danger of the U.S. Open getting a little out of hand.", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Wagner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnson Wagner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Manassero", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matteo Manassero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Pinehurst.png?fit=1049%2C610&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650361", "eventUri": "eng-9650361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

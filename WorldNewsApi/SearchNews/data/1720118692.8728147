On 2 May, Spencer broke through the back door of Iceland, also in Priestsic Road, before stealing meat products. He then returned two hours later and stole more than \u00a3300 worth of stock. He returned to the store for another theft on 19 May. It was during one of those offences Spencer helped himself to 17 tubs of Pringles, police said, and he later made the comment when questioned \u201conce you pop, you can\u2019t stop\u201d - a nod to the snack's famous advertising slogan. Spencer pleaded guilty to all counts at court on Wednesday. On top of his suspended sentence, he was also ordered to pay \u00a3200 in compensation and complete a six-month drug rehabilitation requirement programme.

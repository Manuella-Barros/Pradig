I\u2019m thinking about annuities, but what I\u2019ve read is not good. Late Bloomer Related: I\u2019m 54 and have $2.6 million saved. My husband, 68, wants me to retire early, but he has very little retirement savings. Dear Late Bloomer, Your position may not be as precarious as you fear. There\u2019s a lot you can do with $100,000, but you probably don\u2019t want to lock it up into anything. Broadly speaking, annuities are an insurance product that give investors guaranteed income. Annuities aren\u2019t inherently bad, but they can have high fees, complicated terms and their reputation has been tarnished because of heavy sales tactics that sometimes push people into investments that aren\u2019t right for them. However, regulation has improved and the financial services industry and the government are paving the way to make them more accessible. Still, annuities may not be the right move for you. Some advisers steer clear of annuities for retirees when it would require tying up most of their liquid assets into that sort of product. Once you buy that type of product, you can\u2019t take the money out like you could in an investment portfolio or money-market fund. You will have $4,000 a month combined from Social Security and your pension. If your expenses are below $4,000 a month in retirement, you wouldn\u2019t be living as tight as you think. You could even put some more money away into a savings account while you\u2019re retired \u2014 imagine that! And if you\u2019re on the cusp of $4,000 a month, then you could draw down your savings at the most minimal level to offset those expenses. Do you have questions about retirement, Social Security, where to live or how to afford it at all? We want to hear from you.

The financial services industry uses the 4% rule as a benchmark for how you can withdraw from your retirement savings over the span of 30 years. If you didn\u2019t add anything else to that $100,000, you\u2019d take $4,000 out for the first year of retirement (which breaks down to about $333 a month). In the following years, you\u2019d have to adjust for inflation (and of course the amount of money you need from year to year might fluctuate). As far as the $100,000 goes, strike a balance between letting it grow, but not investing in anything too risky. A regular savings account wouldn\u2019t give you protection from inflation, but a high-yield savings account or money in Treasury bills could help. You could also construct a balanced investment portfolio, but consult a financial planner who would make sure it isn\u2019t too conservative or too aggressive, either of which would not be good. There\u2019s no magical product to make up for the years you did not save, but that does not mean you can\u2019t make some smart moves now. For instance, you said you intend to retire in three years, so during that time and assuming you stick to that timeline, try to prioritize your savings as much as you can. If you have a 401(k) or 403(b) at your job, enroll in it and try to put away as much as possible through pre-tax paycheck deductions. Alternatively, you can use an IRA, which doesn\u2019t have as high of a contribution limit as the 401(k), but is an investment account you can put money in so long as it\u2019s earned income. You can also choose a traditional or Roth IRA account, the former of which is contributed with pre-tax dollars and the latter of which is after-tax. Having both types (in the form of employer-sponsored retirement accounts or an IRA) will help diversify your retirement income. Focus on your own plan \u2014 and not on how much others have saved.

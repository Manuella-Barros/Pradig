{"id": 223683384, "title": "SNP blasts Anas Sarwar after Labour leader admits family firm not paying Living Wage to all staff", "text": "Anas Sarwar has been accused of \"hypocrisy\" after he admitted not every member of staff at his family's business was being paid the Living Wage. The Scottish Labour leader was quizzed about working practices at United Wholesale after his party previously pledged to deliver a \"genuine living wage\". Sarwar has no active role in the company set up by his father and voluntarily waived his right to dividend payments after becoming an MSP. The rate for the Scottish Living Wage is \u00a312 per hour, 66p more than the minimum wage which is set at \u00a311.44. Asked if his family's business was now paying all its staff at least the real living wage, Sarwar told the BBC: \"Well, they have a really good strong relationship with the USDAW trade union.\u201d \"They will have to do what everyone will have to do which is comply with the new deal for working people that will deliver a genuine living wage, and they have a trade union recognition agreement with USDAW and a very strong relationship with USDAW.\u201d \"It's not my business. I have no shares in that business. It's a business that yes, my family has an involvement in, but I have no direct involvement with that business.\u201d Asked if he did not know whether they pay all of the staff at least the real living wage or if he knew that they didn\u2019t, he replied: \"Well, I don't believe that every single staff member is on the real living wage.\" The admission was seized on by SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn on day four of the general election campaign in Scotland. The Aberdeen South MP said: \"Anas Sarwar isn't even the change the workers in his family's firm need - never mind Scotland. 'This Labour Party hypocrisy scandal shows why voting SNP is vital to protect workers' rights and put Scotland first. \"Hard working people across Scotland are struggling to make ends meet thanks to Westminster failure - and Anas Sarwar's family firm are doubling down on that struggle by refusing to pay a Real Living Wage. \"To make matters worse, Anas' household has been raking in profits of at least \u00a340,000 a year from the business - that's well over the average annual income for a working Scot. \"The Labour party has repeatedly watered down their commitments on workers\u2019 rights and it\u2019s no surprise given this astonishing revelation from their most senior figure in Scotland. \"Anas Sarwar is a sleekit salesman and when push comes to shove it really is less change, more chancer. Sarwar\u2019s family firm shows exactly why we need SNP MPs who will always put Scotland and workers first.\" To sign up to the Daily Record Politics newsletter, click here", "summary": "Stephen Flynn accused Labour of &quot;watering down their commitments on workers\u2019 rights&quot;.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/snp-blasts-anas-sarwar-after-32896096", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32884056.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS334427795.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:44:12", "author": "Chris McCall", "authors": ["Chris McCall"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.129}

{"id": 223722846, "title": "Conor Coady says leaving Wolves was right decision after being proven right", "text": "Conor Coady has expressed his delight at making the \"brave decision\" to leave Premier League side Wolves for Championship club Leicester City, a move that has paid off with promotion. The seasoned centre-back sought more game time and found success under Enzo Maresca's management as the Foxes made their triumphant return to the top tier. \"It's incredible,\" Coady enthused. \"To go through a full season like we have, well the boys have been incredible. I dropped out of the Premier League to come to Leicester, so to be going back to the Premier League, well it's justified as well.\" READ MORE: Former Wolves boss 'accepts' offer to return to Premier League READ MORE: Wolves agree first signing of the summer with four-year deal He continued, expressing his pride: \"It fills me with pride and, to be honest, I'm not someone who thinks too much about myself. But to do it with this club, especially the way we have, has just been brilliant.\" Reflecting on his career, Coady added, \"I've been lucky enough to play for some fantastic football clubs, I really have, but this one is another one of them. From top to bottom, from the owner, the staff, the manager and the players, it's amazing.\", reports the Daily Star. He concluded by affirming the team's success: \"It's justified we've got promoted. Leicester is a huge football club and I couldn't wait to get here.\" Despite only featuring in 12 league games for Leicester this season, Coady's \u00a37.5million transfer last summer and his presence in the squad have been deemed crucial. He stated: \"Our goal at the start of the season was to get promoted as champions and we've gone and done it. It was no secret what we wanted to do because that's what the club needs and where the club has to be.\" \"The players, the manager and the staff have produced when it's mattered. It's been an incredible season for us, absolutely fantastic. We'll celebrate well.\" After securing promotion from the second tier with two games still to play, a 3-0 bashing of Preston North End at Deepdale bagged them the Championship title. Furthermore, Coady, the veteran 31 year old centre back who spent most of last season on loan at Everton, emphasised the need to stay grounded despite being tipped for automatic promotion to the top flight. \"Listen, I think everybody thought we were going to cruise it in February, but it was never ever going to be like that and we knew that,\" insisted Coady, who tasted promotion with Hull in the 2017-2018 season. \"We've been fantastic and done what we needed to do. The supporters pay good money to come and watch us, winning the league is for them.\" \"Leicester City getting promoted or Leicester City winning anything, well it's all for the supporters and what they do. It's incredible for them, incredible for us and incredible for the whole football club.\" \"You'll have seen the celebrations with the owner [after we got promoted], I can't get over how close this football club actually is. I think it's absolutely incredible.\" \"The boys have been fantastic this year.\"", "summary": "Latest Wolverhampton Wanderers transfer news from BirminghamLive as Conor Coady reflects on leaving Wolves to drop down to the Championship with Leicester - and it has paid off in style with the experienced defender now heading back to the Premier League", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/conor-coady-says-leaving-wolves-29242843", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article28031856.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Wolverhampton-Wanderers-v-Burnley-Pre-Season-Friendly.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:39:39", "author": "Neil Goulding,Steve Wollaston", "authors": ["Neil Goulding", "Steve Wollaston"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.172}

Kristi Noem squirms as she is asked about killing her pet dog", "body": "She also defended her controversial decision to shoot her unruly dog, citing the need for honesty about tough choices\n\nSouth Dakota Governor Kristi Noem made for some awkward television viewing on Sunday morning as she was repeatedly challenged over a claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nSpeaking on CBS Face The Nation, journalist Margaret Brennan asked Noem about the anecdote, said to be printed in her forthcoming book.\n\nIn one section discussing meetings with international leaders, Noem writes: 'Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders - some who wanted our help, and some who didn't\n\n'I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. 'I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor after all).'\n\nBut Noem appeared to be in no mood to offer any corrections. 'I'm so proud of this book and what it will bring to people,' she said defiantly. 'I'm not retracting anything.'\n\nSouth Dakota Governor Kristi Noem faced scrutiny on CBS's Face The Nation on Sunday over her claim of meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\n\nKristi Noem wrote that she met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, above, while serving in the House of Representatives, which appears to be false.\n\nThe description of a supposed meeting between Un and herself was quickly challenged and described as implausible by experts on U.S.-North Korea relations - a fact not lost on Brennan as she asked Noem directly, 'Did you meet Kim Jong Un?'\n\n'You know, as soon as this was brought to my attention, I certainly made some changes and looked at this passage and I've met with many, many world leaders. I've traveled around the world,' Noem responded, avoiding answering the question.\n\n'As soon as it was brought to my attention we went forward and have made some edits, so I'm glad this book is being released in a couple of days and that those edits will be in place and people will have the updated version.'\n\nBut Brennan wasn't finished. 'You did not meet with Kim Jong-un, that's what you're saying?', she queried.\n\nNoem was no clearer in her answer the second time around.\n\n'I've met with many, many world leaders and traveled around the world. I think I've talked extensively in this book about my time serving in congress, my time as governor, before governor, some of the travels that I've had.'\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem's continues to be in the doghouse over anecdotes shared in her forthcoming book. She is pictured at a Trump rally in March\n\nA Facebook picture shows South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem with a gun. In her forthcoming book she writes about Cricket, a 14-month-old wirehair pointer, that Noem shot dead in the gravel pit on her family property, moments before her children came home from school\n\nNoem then attempted to give her comments an air of plausibility: 'I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I'm just not going to do that.\n\n'This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book and as soon as it was brought to my attention I made sure that was adjusted,' Noem added.\n\nBrennan then asked who she might have confused Un for before stating that she had never been to North Korea.\n\nNoem said she had visited the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea but that there were 'some specifics' she was 'not willing to share.'\n\nWhile former President Donald Trump met with Kim on three occasions during his presidency, Noem served in the Congress from 2007 to 2011, when relations were frostier.\n\nNoem detailed in her upcoming book a story about shooting and killing her 'dangerous' 14-month-old farm puppy Cricket. Another dog, Hazel, a Vizsla, is pictured\n\nNoem has written a new book, No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward , which will be released on May 7\n\nIn a statement to DailyMail.com Noem's spokesperson Ian Fury placed the blame on Noem's ghostwriter.\n\n'It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors,' Fury said. 'This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.'\n\n'Kim Jong Un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been. The Governor spoke with Nikki Haley in 2020 and met with her in 2021,' he added.\n\nFury cast scrutiny of the errors in Noem's book as biased, saying, 'The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge.'\n\nNoem was then asked about the shooting dead of her 14-month-old puppy, Cricket.\n\nNoem said that she took care of her 'untrainable' dog the correct way by taking Cricket to a gravel pit and shooting her after aggressive behaviors like killing neighbor's chickens and trying to bite her.\n\nShe acknowledge on X she understands why 'some people are upset' but reiterated it was legal in South Dakota to 'put down' a dog that attacks and kills livestock\n\nCritics claim that Noem, who shot her dog while her kids were at school, could have rehomed the dog or surrendered to a shelter that may have been better equipped to train the animal.\n\n'The reason that this story is in the book -- because people need to understand who I am and some of those difficult decisions,' Noem said. 'This book is filled with vulnerable painful moments in my life, filled with times where I've made very difficult decisions.\n\n'This was a dangerous animal killing livestock and attacking people. We had many kids running around and I made a difficult choice. I would ask everybody in the country to put themselves in that situation because that's what I faced. I talk about it because what I'm tired of in this country is politicians who pretend to be something they're not.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_(North_Korean_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader (North Korean title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Dakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea\u2013United_States_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Korea\u2013United States relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korean Demilitarized Zone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghostwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/06/02/84492979-0-image-a-48_1714960719450.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 3933, "textEnd": 3938}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

Kristi Noem (R) 's home state, found a few holes in a story about her meeting North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Noem's upcoming book (not including the hole she put in her dog's head).\n\nNoem is set to promote her upcoming book, No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward, ahead of its May 7 release, and she will surely continue to defend her decision to murder her puppy Cricket. But her Kim Jung Un anecdote might also need defending, namely why she claimed to have met the dictator while she was a member of Congress when such a meeting was highly unlikely. The Scout did some digging.\n\nHere is the passage in question:\n\nThrough my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders. I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all). Dealing with foreign leaders takes resolve, preparation and determination. My experiences on those many foreign trips made me a better member of Congress and a stronger governor. It allowed me to hone my deal-making skills, which play a crucial role in leadership.\n\nAs a former member of Congress, Noem's travel records are available to the public, and the Scout knew where Noem was during her time on the Armed Services Committee. They were also able to crosscheck that with Un's travel timeline:\n\nNoem served on the House Armed Services Committee from 2013-2015. During that period, committee members including Noem visited China in 2014. But there is no record of Kim being in China then. After assuming the role of supreme leader of North Korea in 2011, Kim did not leave North Korea until 2018, says University of Notre Dame professor and North Korea expert George Lopez.\n\nThat timeline, along with Kim's preference to operate through proxies, makes Noem's account nearly impossible, Lopez said.\n\n\"I don't see any conceivable way that a single junior member of Congress without explicit escort from the U.S. State Department and military would be meeting with a leader from North Korea,\" said Lopez, an expert and published author on the country. \"What would have been so critical in his bag of tricks that he would have met with an American lawmaker, this one distinctively?\"\n\nThe Scout also quoted \"a longtime, high-level Capitol Hill staffer who worked on the House Armed Services Committee during the period in which Noem says she met Kim,\" who said the story was \"bullshit.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scouting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_(North_Korean_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader (North Korean title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Notre Dame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Korean", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Korean", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24117762411136-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 391, "textEnd": 396}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

Kristi Noem claims in a new book to have met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem is releasing a new book called \"No Going Back,\" but on Friday her office said she would actually be going back to correct some errors -- including a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe Republican governor's new book was part of an overt effort to be selected as a running mate for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but it has already faced bipartisan backlash for a story of how she once shot her hunting dog. Then, after scrutiny of her descriptions of meetings with international leaders, her spokesperson Ian Fury said in a statement that it was an error to include Kim in a list of world leaders who Noem has met -- and the publisher would correct any future editions of the book.\n\nNoem's political prospects were already falling amid widespread disgust for how she recounted killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket after it had shown aggressive behavior and killed her neighbor's chickens.\n\nIn her soon-to-be-released book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" Noem also describes instances where she has stood up to international leaders -- anecdotes that would have bolstered her foreign policy experience -- but those were swiftly called into question. She writes about canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAfter The Dakota Scout first reported Noem's descriptions of the meetings, Fury said that the book \"has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nIn addition to the meeting with Kim, Fury said Noem also mistook the dates in which she spoke with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury added.\n\nIn a section of the book about meeting with international leaders, Noem writes: \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders -- some who wanted our help, and some who didn't.\n\n\"I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" she writes. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor after all).\"\n\nThe description of such a meeting was quickly challenged and described as implausible by experts on U.S.-North Korea relations. When Noem was a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015, relations between the two countries were tense and a congressional delegation meeting with Kim would have generated considerable awareness, said Syd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on the relationship with North Korea.\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and was not notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.\n\nNoem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nIn the book, Noem also writes that she was \"slated to meet with\" Macron in November last year while she was in Paris for a conference of European conservative leaders, but canceled when he made comments that she considered \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, Macron's office told The Associated Press that no \"direct invitation\" had been made for Noem to meet the French president, though it did not rule out that she may have been invited to a Paris event that he was also scheduled to attend.\n\nFury said, \"The governor was invited to sit in President Macron's box for the Armistice Day Parade at Arc de Triomphe. Following his anti-Israel comments, she chose to cancel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noem is trying to fend off the backlash for writing about shooting her dog as well as a goat.\n\n\"Don't believe the #fakenews media's twisted spin,\" she posted on the social platform X this week. \"I had a choice between the safety of my children and an animal who had a history of attacking people & killing livestock.\"\n\nHer spokesperson, Fury, also cast scrutiny of the errors in Noem's book as biased, saying, \"The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge.\"\n\nStill, members of Congress have poked fun at Noem, with Reps. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Florida; Susan Wild, a Democrat from Pennsylvania; and Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina; launching a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus this week.\n\nMoskowitz said on X that one of the group's rules was \"you cannot kill a puppy.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

Kristi Noem speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC 2024, at the National Harbor, Feb. 23, in Oxon Hill, Md. AP-Yonhap\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem is releasing a new book called \"No Going Back,\" but on Friday her office said she would actually be going back to correct some errors -- including a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un .\n\nThe Republican governor's new book was part of an overt effort to be selected as a running mate for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but it has already faced bipartisan backlash for a story of how she once shot her hunting dog . Then, after scrutiny of her descriptions of meetings with international leaders, her spokesperson Ian Fury said in a statement that it was an error to include Kim in a list of world leaders who Noem has met -- and the publisher would correct any future editions of the book.\n\nNoem's political prospects were already falling amid widespread disgust for how she recounted killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket after it had shown aggressive behavior and killed her neighbor's chickens.\n\nIn her soon-to-be-released book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" Noem also describes instances where she has stood up to international leaders -- anecdotes that would have bolstered her foreign policy experience -- but those were swiftly called into question. She writes about canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron .\n\nAfter The Dakota Scout first reported Noem's descriptions of the meetings, Fury said that the book \"has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nIn addition to the meeting with Kim, Fury said Noem also mistook the dates in which she spoke with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury added.\n\nIn a section of the book about meeting with international leaders, Noem writes: \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders -- some who wanted our help, and some who didn't.\n\n\"I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" she writes. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor after all).\"\n\nThe description of such a meeting was quickly challenged and described as implausible by experts on U.S.-North Korea relations. When Noem was a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015, relations between the two countries were tense and a congressional delegation meeting with Kim would have generated considerable awareness, said Syd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on the relationship with North Korea.\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and was not notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.\n\nNoem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nSouth Dakota Governor Kristi Noem greets former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump before he speaks at a South Dakota Republican party rally in Rapid City, South Dakota, U.S. Sept. 8, 2023. Reuters-Yonhap\n\nIn the book, Noem also writes that she was \"slated to meet with\" Macron in November last year while she was in Paris for a conference of European conservative leaders, but canceled when he made comments that she considered \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, Macron's office told The Associated Press that no \"direct invitation\" had been made for Noem to meet the French president, though it did not rule out that she may have been invited to a Paris event that he was also scheduled to attend.\n\nFury said, \"The governor was invited to sit in President Macron's box for the Armistice Day Parade at Arc de Triomphe.

She also says she canceled a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron last year.\n\nBut, The Dakota Scout reported Thursday, neither of these supposed instances have records or outside sources to back them. Macron's office told the Scout that there was never a meeting scheduled with Noem, and there are no congressional travel documents that indicate Noem met Kim. In fact, a meeting with the North Korean dictator was news to congressional staffers.\n\n\"It's bullshit,\" said a House Armed Services Committee staff member who worked there during the period in which Noem says she met Kim. According to the Scout, that staff member was one of a dozen who had no knowledge of such a meeting or said Noem never mentioned it. Her book uses that meeting to inflate her leadership skills.\n\n\"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee,\" she wrote, \"I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders. I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).

So, I decided to cancel. There is no place for pro-Hamas rhetoric.\"\n\nWhile the Scout confirmed with the French president's office that a direct invitation was not made to Noem, she could have been scheduled to speak at a political event where Macron was also scheduled. On November 10, Noem spoke at an event on the same day that Macron called for a cease-fire in Israel's bombardment of Gaza.\n\nNoem's book is scheduled to be released on May 7.

Noem admits error of describing meeting North Korea's Kim Jong Un in new book - World News", "body": "Photo: The Canadian Press FILE - South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC 2024, at the National Harbor, Feb. 23, 2024, in Oxon Hill, Md. Noem claims in a new book to have met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress, but her office has said the publisher will be addressing \"conflated\" names in the book as further scrutiny was put on the Republican governor's life story. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem is releasing a new book called \"No Going Back,\" but on Friday her office said she would actually be going back to correct some errors -- including a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe Republican governor's new book was part of an overt effort to be selected as a running mate for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but it has already faced bipartisan backlash for a story of how she once shot her hunting dog. Then, after scrutiny of her descriptions of meetings with international leaders, her spokesperson Ian Fury said in a statement that it was an error to include Kim in a list of world leaders who Noem has met -- and the publisher would correct any future editions of the book.\n\nNoem's political prospects were already falling amid widespread disgust for how she recounted killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket after it had shown aggressive behavior and killed her neighbor's chickens.\n\nIn her soon-to-be-released book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" Noem also describes instances where she has stood up to international leaders -- anecdotes that would have bolstered her foreign policy experience -- but those were swiftly called into question. She writes about canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAfter The Dakota Scout first reported Noem's descriptions of the meetings, Fury said that the book \"has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nIn addition to the meeting with Kim, Fury said Noem also mistook the dates in which she spoke with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury added.\n\nIn a section of the book about meeting with international leaders, Noem writes: \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders -- some who wanted our help, and some who didn't.\n\n\"I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" she writes. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor after all).\"\n\nThe description of such a meeting was quickly challenged and described as implausible by experts on U.S.-North Korea relations. When Noem was a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015, relations between the two countries were tense and a congressional delegation meeting with Kim would have generated considerable awareness, said Syd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on the relationship with North Korea.\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and was not notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.\n\nNoem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nIn the book, Noem also writes that she was \"slated to meet with\" Macron in November last year while she was in Paris for a conference of European conservative leaders, but canceled when he made comments that she considered \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, Macron's office told The Associated Press that no \"direct invitation\" had been made for Noem to meet the French president, though it did not rule out that she may have been invited to a Paris event that he was also scheduled to attend.\n\nFury said, \"The governor was invited to sit in President Macron's box for the Armistice Day Parade at Arc de Triomphe. Following his anti-Israel comments, she chose to cancel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noem is trying to fend off the backlash for writing about shooting her dog as well as a goat.\n\n\"Don't believe the #fakenews media's twisted spin,\" she posted on the social platform X this week. \"I had a choice between the safety of my children and an animal who had a history of attacking people & killing livestock.\"\n\nHer spokesperson, Fury, also cast scrutiny of the errors in Noem's book as biased, saying, \"The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge.\"\n\nStill, members of Congress have poked fun at Noem, with Reps. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Florida; Susan Wild, a Democrat from Pennsylvania; and Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina; launching a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus this week.\n\nMoskowitz said on X that one of the group's rules was \"you cannot kill a puppy.\"", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

In contrast to her claims, the French president's staff reportedly acknowledged to The Dakota Scout that Macron and Noem never had an arranged meeting.\n\n\"It's bullshit,\" declared a senior Capitol Hill employee who was employed by the House Armed Services Committee at the time the GOP leader said she met the North Korean dictator.\n\nGeorge A. Lopez, a professor at the University of Notre Dame and expert on North Korea, said that he sees \"no conceivable way that a single junior member of Congress without explicit escort from the US State Department and military would be meeting with a leader from North Korea.\"\n\nAnother well-known North Korean watcher, Benjamin Young, an assistant professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, dismissed Noem's claims, stating that \"There's no way.\"\n\nVeteran North Korea observers were also startled by Noem's reference to Kim as \"president,\" despite the fact that his official title is \"chairman.\"\n\nIan Fury, a spokesman for Noem, initially told The Post on Thursday that the governor will not be disclosing the details of her meetings with global leaders. \"If she wanted to share those, she would have outlined them in the book,\" he stressed.\n\nHowever, the spokesman took a U-turn just a few hours later and confirmed that the publisher of Noem's book \"will be addressing conflated world leaders' names in the book before it is released.\"\n\nNoem said she had also met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Jordan's King Abdullah II, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Kristol, Editor at large & Morning Shots co-author, said in a tweet, \"It turns out that Gov. Noem is not just a puppy-killer. She's also a fantasist.

Kristi Noem erroneously describes meeting with Kim Jong Un in new book", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem described in a new book having met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress. But her office said Friday that the story of the meeting was an error as further scrutiny was put on the Republican governor's life story.\n\nNoem was already facing backlash for a description of how she shot a hunting dog. The book was part of an overt pitch to be chosen as a running mate for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But her political prospects have fallen amid bipartisan disgust for how she recounted killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket after it had shown aggressive behavior and killed her neighbor's chickens.\n\nIn her soon-to-be-released book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" Noem describes instances where she has stood up to international leaders -- anecdotes that would have bolstered her foreign policy experience -- but those were called into question. She writes about meeting Kim Jong Un while she worked in Congress, and more recently, canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron\n\nREAD MORE: South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem sued over release of travel expense records\n\nAfter The Dakota Scout first reported Noem's descriptions of the meetings, her spokesman Ian Fury said in a statement, \"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nFury said that Kim was erroneously included in a list of world leaders Noem has met with, and she also mistook the dates in which she spoke with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury added.\n\nIn the book, Noem wrote, \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders - some who wanted our help, and some who didn't. I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor after all).\"\n\nThe description of such a meeting was quickly met with skepticism by experts in U.S.-North Korea relations. When Noem was a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015, relations between North Korea and the U.S. were tense and a congressional delegation meeting with Kim would have generated considerable awareness, said Syd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on the relationship with North Korea.\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and had not been notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.\n\nNoem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nIn the book, Noem also writes that she was \"slated to meet\" with Macron in November last year while she was in Paris for a conference of European conservative leaders, but later canceled when he made comments that she considered \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, Macron's office told The Associated Press that no \"direct invitation\" had been made for Noem to meet the French president, though it did not rule out that she may have been invited to a Paris event that he was also scheduled to attend.\n\nFury said, \"The governor was invited to sit in President Macron's box for the Armistice Day Parade at Arc de Triomphe. Following his anti-Israel comments, she chose to cancel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noem is trying to fend off the bipartisan backlash for the book's description of shooting her hunting dog, as well as a goat.\n\n\"Don't believe the #fakenews media's twisted spin,\" she posted on X, formerly Twitter, this week. \"I had a choice between the safety of my children and an animal who had a history of attacking people & killing livestock.\"\n\nHer spokesman, Fury, also cast scrutiny of the errors in Noem's book as biased, saying, \"The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge but will continue to downplay Joe Biden's repeated and false claims ... \"\n\nStill, members of Congress have poked fun at Noem, with Reps. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Florida, Susan Wild. a Democrat from Pennsylvania. and Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, launching a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus this week.\n\nMoskowitz said on X that one of the group's rules was \"you cannot kill a puppy.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType":

Noem erroneously describes meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in new book", "body": "South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem claimed in a new book to have met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem described in a new book having met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress. But her office said Friday that the story of the meeting was an error as further scrutiny was put on the Republican governor's life story.\n\nNoem was already facing backlash for a description of how she shot a hunting dog. The book was part of an overt pitch to be chosen as a running mate for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But her political prospects have fallen amid bipartisan disgust for how she recounted killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket after it had shown aggressive behavior and killed her neighbor's chickens.\n\nIn her soon-to-be-released book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" Noem describes instances where she has stood up to international leaders -- anecdotes that would have bolstered her foreign policy experience -- but those were called into question. She writes about meeting Kim Jong Un while she worked in Congress, and more recently, canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron\n\nAfter The Dakota Scout first reported Noem's descriptions of the meetings, her spokesman Ian Fury said in a statement, \"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nFury said that Kim was erroneously included in a list of world leaders Noem has met with, and she also mistook the dates in which she spoke with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury added.\n\nIn the book, Noem wrote, \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders - some who wanted our help, and some who didn't. I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor after all).\"\n\nThe description of such a meeting was quickly met with skepticism by experts in U.S.-North Korea relations. When Noem was a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015, relations between North Korea and the U.S. were tense and a congressional delegation meeting with Kim would have generated considerable awareness, said Syd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on the relationship with North Korea.\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and had not been notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.\n\nNoem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nIn the book, Noem also writes that she was \"slated to meet\" with Macron in November last year while she was in Paris for a conference of European conservative leaders, but later canceled when he made comments that she considered \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, Macron's office told The Associated Press that no \"direct invitation\" had been made for Noem to meet the French president, though it did not rule out that she may have been invited to a Paris event that he was also scheduled to attend.\n\nFury said, \"The governor was invited to sit in President Macron's box for the Armistice Day Parade at Arc de Triomphe. Following his anti-Israel comments, she chose to cancel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noem is trying to fend off the bipartisan backlash for the book's description of shooting her hunting dog, as well as a goat.\n\n\"Don't believe the #fakenews media's twisted spin,\" she posted on X, formerly Twitter, this week. \"I had a choice between the safety of my children and an animal who had a history of attacking people & killing livestock.\"\n\nHer spokesman, Fury, also cast scrutiny of the errors in Noem's book as biased, saying, \"The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge but will continue to downplay Joe Biden's repeated and false claims ... \"\n\nStill, members of Congress have poked fun at Noem, with Reps. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Florida, Susan Wild. a Democrat from Pennsylvania. and Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, launching a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus this week.\n\nMoskowitz said on X that one of the group's rules was \"you cannot kill a puppy.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed.\n\nMore from this section\n\nCitizens

How she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird.\"\n\nOn April 27, Noem defended shooting and killing her 14 month-old dog Cricket, a story she also tells in the yet to be published book.\n\nShe said, \"We love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm.\"\n\nThe controversial aspects of Noem's forthcoming book haven't diminished her support among many Republicans.\n\nIn a Florida Politics report, Brevard Republican Party Chair Rick Lacey said Noem remains the keynote speaker for the organization's annual Lincoln/Reagan Dinner on May 25 despite any controversy from her book.\n\n\"Everybody is excited about hearing her and meeting her,\" Lacey said.", "source": {"uri": "sunherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_cunningham@sunherald.com", "name": "Doug Cunningham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brevard_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brevard County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brevard County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/E-Books", "label": "dmoz/Computers/E-Books", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/1ef20s/picture288287455/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/81dd2172-8521-4a0a-801f-33211a7bbade", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 5}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 1726, "textEnd": 1734}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 2223, "textEnd": 2229}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Noem erroneously describes meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in new book", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem described in a new book having met with North Korean leader Kim...\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem described in a new book having met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress. But her office said Friday that the story of the meeting was an error as further scrutiny was put on the Republican governor's life story.\n\nNoem was already facing backlash for a description of how she shot a hunting dog. The book was part of an overt pitch to be chosen as a running mate for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But her political prospects have fallen amid bipartisan disgust for how she recounted killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket after it had shown aggressive behavior and killed her neighbor's chickens.\n\nIn her soon-to-be-released book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" Noem describes instances where she has stood up to international leaders -- anecdotes that would have bolstered her foreign policy experience -- but those were called into question. She writes about meeting Kim Jong Un while she worked in Congress, and more recently, canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron\n\nAfter The Dakota Scout first reported Noem's descriptions of the meetings, her spokesman Ian Fury said in a statement, \"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nFury said that Kim was erroneously included in a list of world leaders Noem has met with, and she also mistook the dates in which she spoke with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury added.\n\nIn the book, Noem wrote, \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders - some who wanted our help, and some who didn't. I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor after all).\"\n\nThe description of such a meeting was quickly met with skepticism by experts in U.S.-North Korea relations. When Noem was a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015, relations between North Korea and the U.S. were tense and a congressional delegation meeting with Kim would have generated considerable awareness, said Syd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on the relationship with North Korea.\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and had not been notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.\n\nNoem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nIn the book, Noem also writes that she was \"slated to meet\" with Macron in November last year while she was in Paris for a conference of European conservative leaders, but later canceled when he made comments that she considered \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, Macron's office told The Associated Press that no \"direct invitation\" had been made for Noem to meet the French president, though it did not rule out that she may have been invited to a Paris event that he was also scheduled to attend.\n\nFury said, \"The governor was invited to sit in President Macron's box for the Armistice Day Parade at Arc de Triomphe. Following his anti-Israel comments, she chose to cancel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noem is trying to fend off the bipartisan backlash for the book's description of shooting her hunting dog, as well as a goat.\n\n\"Don't believe the #fakenews media's twisted spin,\" she posted on X, formerly Twitter, this week. \"I had a choice between the safety of my children and an animal who had a history of attacking people & killing livestock.\"\n\nHer spokesman, Fury, also cast scrutiny of the errors in Noem's book as biased, saying, \"The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge but will continue to downplay Joe Biden's repeated and false claims ... \"\n\nStill, members of Congress have poked fun at Noem, with Reps. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Florida, Susan Wild. a Democrat from Pennsylvania. and Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, launching a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus this week.\n\nMoskowitz said on X that one of the group's rules was \"you cannot kill a puppy.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Kristi Noem's forthcoming book is getting tweaked amid backlash for telling a false story about an encounter with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, and making other dubious claims about French President Emmanuel Macron and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.\n\nAhead of this month's release of the 52-year-old politician's memoir, No Going Back -- which has already garnered headlines over an excerpt in which she wrote about shooting and killing her puppy -- fact checkers who read the manuscript disputed the accuracy of a few details.\n\nAs Politico reported, Noem writes in the book about meeting with Kim Jong Un while on the House Armed Services Committee, a position she held from 2013-2015. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all),\" she wrote, per the outlet.\n\nThe Dakota Scout interviewed a dozen Capitol Hill staffers, all who claimed they had no knowledge of Noem meeting with the dictator -- including one who called her remarks \"bulls---.\"\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE on Friday, May 3, Noem's spokesperson acknowledged that a couple of \"small errors\" made it into the book, and that it has been \"communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\n\"Kim Jong Un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been,\" the spokesperson said, noting that the book has not yet been released and \"all future editions will be corrected.\"\n\nRelated: South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem Shot and Killed Her Puppy, the Trump VP Candidate Reveals in New Book\n\nAs the Scout notes, Noem had visited China in 2014 but there is no record of Kim being in China at that time. University of Notre Dame professor George Lopez told the outlet that Kim did not leave North Korea between 2011 (when he assumed the role of supreme leader) and 2018.\n\n\"I don't see any conceivable way that a single junior member of Congress without explicit escort from the U.S. State Department and military would be meeting with a leader from North Korea,\" Lopez, an expert in North Korea, told the Scout. \"What would have been so critical in his bag of tricks that he would have met with an American lawmaker, this one distinctively?\"\n\nVirginia Commonwealth University professor Benjamin Young, another North Korea expert, added that \"there's no way\" Noem met the dictator, and that he has \"never heard of Kim Jong Un meeting congressmen or congresswomen.\"\n\nRelated: Kristi Noem Doubles Down on Killing Her 'Less than Worthless' Hunting Puppy: 'I Decided What I Did'\n\nNoem also wrote in her forthcoming book that she canceled a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron last year, according to the Scout. The French president's office confirmed to the outlet that they never had a meeting scheduled.\n\nShe wrote that \"the day before we were to meet he made what I considered a very pro-Hamas and anti-Israel comment to the press,\" which prompted her to \"cancel\" a meeting with Macron. His office told the Scout that while she didn't receive a \"direct invitation\" to meet with Macron, Noem could have been scheduled to attend the same event.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nOne final, less consequential anecdote shared in Noem's book -- about how she interpreted a call from Nikki Haley -- caught the attention of Politico while the outlet reviewed an advance copy.\n\nIn No Going Back, Noem recalled that while she \"was hauling a trailer full of horses\" in the summer of 2021, she learned that Haley wanted to connect with her, per Politico.\n\nNoem claimed that while they chatted, Haley -- who had served as the first female governor of South Carolina -- offered to \"be a mentor\" and said the following: \"I've heard a lot of really good things about you. But I also want you to know that if I hear something bad ... I will be sure to let you know.\"\n\nNoem then said that Haley reiterated how she would \"make sure that you know,\" per Politico, and that immediately after they got off the call, she told an assistant she was \"pretty sure I was just threatened by Nikki Haley.\"\n\n\"It was clear that she wanted me to know that there was only room for one Republican woman in the spotlight. It was weird,\" Noem wrote, according to Politico. \"Unsurprisingly, I never received any calls or 'mentoring' from her, but the message was clear. I'm the alpha female here, and you should know your place. I actually felt a little sad for her.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Haley told the outlet that the politicians spoke in 2020, not 2021, and that Haley \"has long called and written notes supporting other women when they go through challenging times.\"\n\n\"She called Governor Noem in 2020 to encourage her when she was criticized for keeping her state open during Covid,\" Haley's spokesperson added. \"How she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird.\"\n\nOn Friday, Noem's spokesperson told PEOPLE that the governors did speak in 2020, but met in 2021, and that it would be clarified in final versions of the book.\n\nAs previously reported, Noem -- once considered a top contender for Donald Trump's running mate position -- defended her decision to kill a puppy after writing about it in an excerpt for the book, first shared by The Guardian.\n\nOf her dog Cricket, whom she referred to as \"untrainable\" and \"less than worthless as a hunting dog,\" Noem later wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that the \"20 year old story\" was part of a book that included \"many honest stories of my life, good and bad days, challenges, painful decisions, and lessons learned.\"\n\nFor more People

Gov. Kristi Noem's book", "body": "WASHINGTON -- South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem is releasing a new book called \"No Going Back,\" but on Friday her office said she would actually be going back to correct some errors - including a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.\n\nThe Republican governor's new book was part of an overt effort to be selected as a running mate for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but it has already faced bipartisan backlash for a story of how she once shot her hunting dog. Then, after scrutiny of her descriptions of meetings with international leaders, her spokesperson Ian Fury said in a statement that it was an error to include Kim in a list of world leaders who Noem has met - and the publisher would correct any future editions of the book.\n\nNoem's political prospects were already falling amid widespread disgust for how she recounted killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket after it had shown aggressive behavior and killed her neighbor's chickens.\n\nIn her soon-to-be-released book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" Noem also describes instances where she has stood up to international leaders - anecdotes that would have bolstered her foreign policy experience - but those were swiftly called into question. She writes about canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAfter The Dakota Scout first reported Noem's descriptions of the meetings, Fury said that the book \"has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nIn addition to the meeting with Kim, Fury said Noem also mistook the dates in which she spoke with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury added.\n\nIn a section of the book about meeting with international leaders, Noem writes: \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders - some who wanted our help, and some who didn't.\n\n\"I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un,\" she writes. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor after all).\"\n\nThe description of such a meeting was quickly challenged and described as implausible by experts on U.S.-North Korea relations. When Noem was a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015, relations between the two countries were tense and a congressional delegation meeting with Kim would have generated considerable awareness, said Syd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on the relationship with North Korea.\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and was not notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.\n\nNoem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nIn the book, Noem also writes that she was \"slated to meet with\" Macron in November last year while she was in Paris for a conference of European conservative leaders, but canceled when he made comments that she considered \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, Macron's office told The Associated Press that no \"direct invitation\" had been made for Noem to meet the French president, though it did not rule out that she may have been invited to a Paris event that he was also scheduled to attend.\n\nFury said, \"The governor was invited to sit in President Macron's box for the Armistice Day Parade at Arc de Triomphe. Following his anti-Israel comments, she chose to cancel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noem is trying to fend off the backlash for writing about shooting her dog as well as a goat.\n\n\"Don't believe the #fakenews media's twisted spin,\" she posted on the social platform X this week. \"I had a choice between the safety of my children and an animal who had a history of attacking people & killing livestock.\"\n\nHer spokesperson, Fury, also cast scrutiny of the errors in Noem's book as biased, saying, \"The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge.\"\n\nStill, members of Congress have poked fun at Noem, with Reps. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Florida; Susan Wild, a Democrat from Pennsylvania; and Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina; launching a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus this week.\n\nMoskowitz said on X that one of the group's rules was \"you cannot kill a puppy.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors":

Kristi Noem (R) told CBS News on Sunday. \"We're not going back to the days before Donald Trump. Donald Trump broke politics. And I think that's a good thing.\"\n\nNoem, a potential Trump VP pick, is certainly right about his breaking politics, but perhaps not in the way she meant.\n\nHer game attempt to proceed with a media tour promoting her book despite alleged inaccuracies and a story about killing her dog is a testament to the thoroughly Trumpian impulse to just push on through - while averting facts.\n\nTo recap: Not only has Noem faced bipartisan backlash for her story about her young dog Cricket, but other anecdotes in the book have also been called into question in recent days. There's the meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un that seems unlikely to have happened. And there is the meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron she says she canceled, and the threatening conversation with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley she says she recalled. (Representatives for Macron and Haley have rejected her accounts.)\n\nThrough it all, Noem and her office have offered shifting accounts and, especially on the Kim story, proven bizarrely evasive.\n\nAfter the South Dakota Scout last week questioned the Kim meeting - there is no record of it; Noem was a backbencher in Congress at the time; and relations between the countries were especially frosty, leading some experts to conclude there's no way it took place - Noem and her office set about cleaning up.\n\nHer spokesman initially cited \"conflated world leaders' names in the book\" and said they would be addressed - a clear suggestion that Kim was mixed up with someone else.\n\nBut since then, Noem has declined repeated attempts to explain the situation. She won't even say that she didn't meet Kim.\n\nCBS anchors asked her twice Sunday and twice more Monday whether she met with Kim, and Noem punted each time.\n\n\"I'm saying that I'm not talking about that meeting - I'm not talking about my meetings with world leaders,\" Noem said Monday morning.\n\nPressed one more time on whether she met with Kim, Noem responded: \"That's the answer that I have for you, is that it will be adjusted\" in the book.\n\nPart of the problem with Noem's saying she met Kim is that his first known foreign trip after taking power in 2011 was in 2018. Her book claims she met him before then.\n\nCBS's Margaret Brennan posited that Noem had never been to North Korea. Noem responded, \"I have been there.\" But she proceeded to talk about visiting the demilitarized zone, or DMZ, between North and South Korea.\n\n\"There are details in this book that talk about going to the DMZ and specifics that I'm willing to share,\" Noem said. \"There's some specifics I'm not willing to share with you.\"\n\nDoes Noem want people to believe the meeting might have actually happened but she just can't talk about it? That's difficult to square with the initial comment about conflating world leaders' names. And even if the newer implication is correct, it would mean she put a meeting she wasn't supposed to talk about in her book, which could certainly lead to questions about her judgment.\n\nNoem was also evasive Sunday when Brennan noted that Noem recorded the audio edition of her book.\n\n\"You didn't catch these errors when you were recording it?\" Brennan asked. (Noem's office has admitted to using an incorrect date for the phone call with Haley.)\n\nNoem avoided the question, saying merely: \"Well, Margaret, as soon as it was brought to my attention, I took action to make sure that it was reflected.\"\n\nNoem has set about claiming persecution by the media, noting the number of times Brennan interrupted her, for instance.\n\n\"What I talk about in the book extensively, when people are able to get it on Tuesday, is to see the whole story and the truth, not the spin that the media has put on this story,\" Noem said.\n\nShe added later: \"I hope that they will buy it. They'll find a lot of truthful stories.\"\n\nAs for one of the book's most publicized stories, though, it appears the truth just can't - or won't - be told.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korean Demilitarized Zone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demilitarized_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demilitarized zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/E-Books", "label": "dmoz/Computers/E-Books", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "wgt": 20}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/06/PDTN/73590374007-noemanalysis-fwq-4-sfb-2-qsorye-3-rjpehbs-6-rnq.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3765,2118,x231,y282&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Kristi Noem says Kim Jong Un book claims have been 'adjusted' but stands by killing Cricket. Here's where things stand with 'No Going Back.'David ArtaviaMay 5, 2024 at 10:03 AM\n\nKristi Noem, the Republican governor of South Dakota and potential 2024 running mate for Donald Trump, has been in the spotlight over the past week for a controversial passage in her forthcoming memoir, No Going Back, in which she describes shooting and killing a pet dog.\n\nOn Sunday, she was pressed about that and another passage that appeared in advance copies of the book, in which she falsely claimed to have met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nIn an interview with CBS's Face the Nation, Noem sat down with host Margaret Brennan to talk about the controversies surrounding her memoir.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the interview.\n\nOn her alleged meeting with Kim Jong Un\n\nIn Noem's book, out on May 7, she wrote about meeting with various world leaders during her time in Congress -- including North Korean dictator Kim, who she claimed \"underestimated\" her potential as a leader. Experts and Capitol Hill staffers were quick to dispute the governor's claim, and Noem acknowledged the mistake during Sunday's interview.\n\n\"As soon as this was brought to my attention, I certainly made some changes and looked at this passage,\" Noem told Brennan. \"We went forward and made some edits, so I'm glad that this book is being released in a couple of days and that people will have the updated version.\"\n\nNoem deflected when asked to confirm whether she had actually met with Kim.\n\n\"I met with many many world leaders,\" she said. \"I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I'm just not going to do that. This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book and as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that it was adjusted.\"\n\nTake 2\n\nFollowing backlash from experts who questioned her story of meeting Kim, Noem's claim will be removed from the book prior to its release on May 7, but other claims in the memoir are coming under scrutiny.\n\nNoem also wrote about Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, claiming that Haley called her in 2021 to offer support and mentorship. In her book, Noem wrote that the call felt threatening, stating that Haley must believe \"there was only room for one Republican woman in the spotlight.\"\n\nHaley spokesperson Chaney Denton has since come out to say that the women spoke in 2020 -- not 2021, as written in the book. During the call, Denton said Haley was supportive of Noem for not closing down her state during COVID.\n\n\"How she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird,\" Denton said.\n\nNoem's spokesperson Ian Fury declared that these points were \"small errors,\" which were \"communicated to the ghostwriter and editor\" and that future editions of the book will correct this mistake.\n\nAddressing the killing of Cricket\n\nNoem was also pressed about an anecdote in her book in which she recounted shooting and killing her 14-month-old dog Cricket, who she claimed was untrainable, after he attacked chickens on a neighbor's farm. (Later in the book, Noem writes that she also shot and killed a goat on her farm.)\n\n\"This dog was a working dog and it had come from a family that already had issues with this dog. I put months and months of training into this dog. This dog had gone to other trainers as well,\" she said, noting that killing Cricket was a \"choice I made over 20 years ago, and I didn't ask somebody else to take that responsibility for me. I had to make that decision myself.\"\n\nShe also said that President Joe Biden should be held accountable for his dog, Commander, who reportedly has attacked two dozen Secret Service agents.\n\n\"Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people, so how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog and what to do with it?\" she asked.\n\nShe claims the goat story is being used against her\n\nIn the chapter \"Bad Day to be a Goat,\" Noem writes that, after shooting Cricket, she later shot a billy goat she claimed to be unruly. Noem told Brennan that the story has repeatedly come up over the years by political opponents who try to \"use it against me.\"\n\n\"It's well known in South Dakota and it has been to other people,\" she said of the goat. \"I want the truth out there and [for people] to understand that these animals were attacking my children, that we live on a farm and a ranch and that tough decisions are made many times, and it is to protect people.\"\n\nBad PR at a bad time for Noem\n\nBipartisan reaction to the story of Noem killing Cricket has been largely negative and comes at a time that she appears to be lobbying to be picked to be Trump's running mate in 2024.\n\n\"Anyone who has ever owned a birddog knows how disgusting, lazy and evil this is,\" Ryan Busse, a Democratic candidate for governor of Montana, wrote on X.\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr., said she was bewildered by Noem's account of killing the dog. \"It makes no sense. I don't understand. I've always liked Gov. Noem. She works very hard, tirelessly on behalf of the movement,\" she remarked during an interview with One America News Network, adding, \"I just can't imagine that because there's a forever home for all animals. ... I don't know what happened, maybe somebody slipped that in and she didn't see it.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nShe added that such meetings with foreign leaders take \"resolve, preparation and determination.\"\n\nNoem served as a representative for South Dakota between 2011 and 2019, her tenure on the House Armed Services Committee lasted two years,between 2013-2015. While Noem did take a trip to China with the committee in 2014, according to a North Korean expert interviewed by The Dakota Scout -- Kim did not leave North Korea until 2018, almost a decade after assuming leadership of the nation.\n\nThe governor's office all but conceded that no such meeting happened in a statement to Politico on Friday. \"We've been made aware that the publisher will be addressing conflated world leaders' names in the book before it is released,\" Noem spokesperson Ian Fury told the publication.\n\nIt's difficult to believe that Noem confused Kim Jong Un with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but an imagined meeting with one of the world's most notorious dictators isn't the only international anecdote she may have fabricated.\n\n\"While in Paris, I was slated to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron,\" Noem also writes. \"However, the day before we were to meet he made what I considered a very pro-Hamas and anti-Israel comment to the press. So, I decided to cancel. There is no place for pro-Hamas rhetoric.\"\n\nAccording to conversations between The Dakota Scout and Macron's office, Noem at no point had a \"direct invitation\" to a meeting with the French president and there was no scheduled event involving the two on his calendar. Marcon's office conceded to the Scout that Noem could have planned to attend an event where Macron was also present.\n\nIn another anecdote reviewed by Politico, Noem accused former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley of threatening her in a phone call shortly after Noem's election as governor.\n\nNoem recounts Haley -- who previously served as governor of South Carolina -- offering to mentor her during the phone call, and telling her that she'd \"heard many good things about you. But when I do hear bad things, I will make sure that you know.\"\n\n\"I'm pretty sure I was just threatened by Nikki Haley. It was clear that she wanted me to know that there was only room for one Republican woman in the spotlight. It was weird,\" Noem wrote. \"Unsurprisingly, I never received any calls or 'mentoring' from her, but the message was clear. I'm the alpha female here, and you should know your place.

How she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird.\"\n\nDespite the myriad issues plaguing Noem's upcoming book -- from puppy killing to invented anecdotes -- the governor seems committed to seeing this misguided endeavor through to its expected publication later this month.

Kristi Noem's hopes of becoming presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's running mate may have been destroyed by the puppy shooting controversy. Noem has been drawing widespread criticism -- even among fellow Republicans -- for an anecdote in her new book \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong With Politics and How We Move America Forward\" in which she describes taking a dog to a gravel pit on a farm, shooting it and killing it.\n\nAlthough that anecdote is receiving a great deal of attention, it is only one of the many things Noem talks about in her book. Noem, who served in the U.S. House of Representatives for eight years before becoming South Dakota governor, also talks about her foreign policy experience.\n\nBut according to the Dakota Scout, an \"alleged meeting\" with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un described in Noem's book is \"in dispute.\"\n\nREAD MORE:'I hated that dog': Kristi Noem recalls taking family pup to gravel pit and killing it\n\nScout reporters Austin Goss and Jonathan Ellis, in an article published on May 2, explain, \"In 'No Going Back,' Noem says she met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un while serving in Congress on the House Armed Services Committee. Last year, as governor, she says she canceled a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. But neither account has been verified by congressional travel documents or outside sources reviewed by The Dakota Scout. And The Scout confirmed with the French president's office that Macron never had a meeting scheduled with Noem.\"\n\nA Capitol staffer interviewed by The Scout, presumably on condition of anonymity, said of Noem's alleged meeting with Jong Un, \"It's b*****t.\"\n\nAccording to Goss and Ellis, \"That staffer was among a dozen staffers interviewed by The Scout who said they had no knowledge of the meeting, or who said Noem had never mentioned it before.... Noem served on the House Armed Services Committee from 2013-2015. During that period, committee members, including Noem, visited China in 2014. But there is no record of Kim being in China then.\"\n\nGeorge A.

Last week, the Guardian obtained a copy and reported how Noem describes killing Cricket - a 14-month-old dog she said she \"hated\" - after deeming her uncontrollable and a danger to people, and a goat she said was \"nasty and mean\", smelled \"disgusting, musky, rancid\", and bothered her children.\n\nNoem has repeatedly defended the story as illustrative of the harsh realities of farm life. But it set off a political firestorm, by most assessments dynamiting the governor's chance of being named running mate to Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nThe Scout reported that Noem's book also contains \"at least two instances in which she recounts meetings with world leaders that are in dispute\".\n\nIn one, Noem writes: \"Through my tenure on the House armed services committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders.\n\n\"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nBut the Scout quoted one \"longtime, high-level Capitol Hill staffer\" who worked on the armed services committee when Noem was on it, between 2013 and 2015, as saying: \"It's bullshit.\"\n\n\"That staffer was among a dozen staffers ... who said they had no knowledge of the meeting, or who said Noem had never mentioned it before,\" the paper said.\n\nIt quoted experts saying Noem's claim to have met with Kim, the autocratic leader of a pariah state who did not even meet with Barack Obama - the US president for the first five years of Noem's time in the US House - was unlikely.\n\n\"I don't see any conceivable way that a single junior member of Congress without explicit escort from the US state department and military would be meeting with a leader from North Korea,\" George Lopez of Notre Dame University, an expert on North Korea, told the Scout.\n\n\"What would have been so critical in his bag of tricks that he would have met with an American lawmaker, this one distinctively?\"\n\nAnother North Korea expert, Benjamin Young of Virginia Commonwealth University, called Noem's account of meeting Kim \"dubious\".\n\n\"There's no way,\" Young told the Scout. \"There's no way.\"\n\nNoem also claims to have canceled a meeting with Emmanuel Macron, the president of France. She writes of being in Paris, \"slated to meet\" the French president.\n\n\"However, the day before we were to meet he made what I considered a very pro-Hamas and anti-Israel comment to the press. So, I decided to cancel. There is no place for pro-Hamas rhetoric.\"\n\nMacron's office told the Scout no direct invitation to Noem was issued, though it did say Noem and Macron might have been scheduled to attend the same event last 10 November.\n\nNoem spoke at a conference in Paris that day, the same day Macron called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nNoem's spokesperson did not comment to the Scout before it published its story.\n\nAfter the story went live, the paper said, it was told: \"The publisher will be addressing conflated world leaders' names in the book before it is released.\"", "source":

Kristi Noem said she has \"made some changes\" to her upcoming memoir, \"No Going Back,\" but won't be retracting the book -- which originally contained a story about meeting North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\n\"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" Noem wrote in an excerpt published by the Dakota Scout on Thursday, adding \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\" Noem's office quickly backpedaled on the story, telling Forbes in a statement that an error had been communicated with her ghostwriter, and that \"Kim Jong Un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been.\"\n\n\"I've met with many world leaders,\" Noem said. \"There are many that I've met with who are in this book, there are many that I've met with who are not in this book, and this is an anecdote that I've asked to be removed because I don't think it's appropriate at this time.\" Noem refused to confirm or deny whether she had met with Kim Jong Un, later telling Brennan: \"I'm not going to talk to you about those personal meetings that I've had with world leaders. I'm just not going to have that conversation because I think it's important.\"\n\nNoem has long been considered on the short list for a possible vice presidential nomination from former President Donald Trump. However, her chances have fallen fast in the last week after excerpts of her upcoming book have made headlines. In one excerpt published by The Guardian, Noem recalled shooting and killing her 14-month-old dog, named Cricket, after she ruined a pheasant hunt and attacked a neighbor's chicken coop. Noem has spent the last week defending her actions, and continued to do so Sunday. \"This was a dangerous animal that was killing livestock and attacking people. And I had little children at the time, our operation had many kids running around, and people, and interaction with the public, and I made a difficult choice.\" Noem said she deliberately included the story in the book to not be one of the \"politicians who pretend to be something that they're not.\" She also likened her struggles to control the Cricket narrative to scrutiny of Trump's campaign and ongoing legal battles.\n\nNoem also connected her story about Cricket to President Joe Biden's issues with his German shepherd, Commander, who was removed from the White House in October after multiple biting incidents. According to the new book, Noem said her first matter of business after retaking the White House would be to \"make sure that Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds. Commander, say hello to Cricket.\" Noem stood by the controversial comments in her interview Sunday, saying \"Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people.

('Commander, say hello to Cricket for me.')\"\n\nNoem adds that her own dog, Foster, \"would sure be welcome\" at the White House.\n\n\"He comes with me to the [state] capitol all the time and loves everyone,\" she writes.\n\nNonetheless, a governor widely held to have designs on the presidency in 2028 has at least implied she would have a predecessor's dog killed - whether by herself with a shotgun, like Cricket and the goat, or not.\n\nNoem has defended her description of killing Cricket and the goat as evidence of her willingness to do unpleasant things in farm life as well as in politics.\n\nCommander, a German shepherd owned by Joe and Jill Biden, was removed from the White House after biting Secret Service agents.\n\nOn Sunday, Noem spoke to CBS's Face the Nation. Her host, Margaret Brennan, quoted Noem's apparent threat to kill Commander and asked: \"Are you doing this to try to look tough? Do you still think that you have a shot at being a VP?\"\n\nNoem said: \"Well, number one, Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people. So, how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog and what to do with it?\"\n\nBrennan said: \"Well, he's not living at the White House any more.\"\n\nNoem said: \"That's a question that the president should be held accountable to.\"\n\nBrennan said: \"You're saying he [Commander] should be shot?\"\n\nNoem said: \"That what's the president should be accountable to.\"\n\nNoem tried to move on, to talk about Covid in South Dakota. But she also said she was \"so proud\" of a book that contained \"a lot of truthful stories\".\n\nElsewhere, though, Noem's publisher, Center Street, said that at Noem's request it was removing from her book \"a passage regarding Kim Jong-un ... upon a reprint of the print edition and as soon as technically possible on the audio and ebook editions\".\n\nIn her book, Noem writes: \"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nAs first reported by the Dakota Scout, no such meeting occurred.\n\nNoem told CBS: \"What bothers me the most about politicians is when they're fake.\"\n\nBrennan said: \"But if you have to retract ... parts of [the book] ...\"\n\nNoem, whose publisher said it would retract part of her book, said: \"I'm not retracting anything.\"\n\nBrennan said: \"OK.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Noem attended a Trump Florida fundraiser featuring a host of vice-presidential contenders.\n\nNoem was \"somebody I love\", NBC reported Trump as saying, adding: \"She's been with me, and a supporter, and I've been a supporter of hers for a long time.\"\n\nBut unlike other hopefuls, among them the South Carolina senator Tim Scott and the New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Noem was not called to the stage.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Then, after scrutiny of her descriptions of meetings with international leaders, her spokesperson Ian Fury said in a statement that it was an error to include Kim in a list of world leaders who Noem has met -- and the publisher would correct any future editions of the book.\n\nNoem's political prospects were already falling amid widespread disgust for how she recounted killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket after it had shown aggressive behavior and killed her neighbor's chickens.\n\nIn her soon-to-be-released book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" Noem also describes instances where she has stood up to international leaders -- anecdotes that would have bolstered her foreign policy experience -- but those were swiftly called into question. She writes about canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAfter The Dakota Scout first reported Noem's descriptions of the meetings, Fury said that the book \"has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nIn addition to the meeting with Kim, Fury said Noem also mistook the dates in which she spoke with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury added.\n\nIn a section of the book about meeting with international leaders, Noem writes: \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders -- some who wanted our help, and some who didn't.\n\n\"I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" she writes. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor after all).\"\n\nThe description of such a meeting was quickly challenged and described as implausible by experts on U.S.-North Korea relations. When Noem was a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015, relations between the two countries were tense and a congressional delegation meeting with Kim would have generated considerable awareness, said Syd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on the relationship with North Korea.\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and was not notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.\n\nNoem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nIn the book, Noem also writes that she was \"slated to meet with\" Macron in November last year while she was in Paris for a conference of European conservative leaders, but canceled when he made comments that she considered \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, Macron's office told The Associated Press that no \"direct invitation\" had been made for Noem to meet the French president, though it did not rule out that she may have been invited to a Paris event that he was also scheduled to attend.\n\nFury said, \"The governor was invited to sit in President Macron's box for the Armistice Day Parade at Arc de Triomphe. Following his anti-Israel comments, she chose to cancel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noem is trying to fend off the backlash for writing about shooting her dog as well as a goat.\n\n\"Don't believe the #fakenews media's twisted spin,\" she posted on the social platform X this week. \"I had a choice between the safety of my children and an animal who had a history of attacking people & killing livestock.\"\n\nHer spokesperson, Fury, also cast scrutiny of the errors in Noem's book as biased, saying, \"The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge.\"\n\nStill, members of Congress have poked fun at Noem, with Reps. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Florida; Susan Wild, a Democrat from Pennsylvania; and Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina; launching a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus this week.\n\nMoskowitz said on X that one of the group's rules was \"you cannot kill a puppy.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [],

Not only does Noem claim to have met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but even makes an apparent threat against President Joe Biden's dog.\n\nBrennan first addressed the false claim that Noem met with Jong Un, noting that she had written: \"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, I'm sure he underestimated me having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants. I've been a children's pastor, after all.\"\n\nNoem never explicitly stated she did not meet with Jong Un, but countered that she has met with \"many, many world leaders\" and that when that specific anecdote was brought to her attention, they made edits.\n\n\"I'm glad that this book is being released in a couple of days, and that those edits will be in place, and that people will have the updated version,\" Noem said, later adding that she is \"not going to talk about [her] specific meetings with world leaders.\"\n\nNoem then claimed to have visited North Korea, citing her trip to the Korean Demilitarized Zone -- a heavily fortified buffer zone between the two Koreas that serves as a popular tourist attraction accessible from the South Korean side.\n\nIn a statement to the Associated Press, Noem's spokesperson attributed the error to the ghostwriter and stated that future editions about the Jong Un anecdote will be corrected.\n\nBut Brennan on Sunday pushed back, noting that Noem released a video of herself recording an audio version of the book.\n\n\"You didn't catch these errors when you were recording it?\" she asked.\n\nNoem reiterated that the issue was corrected as soon as she was made aware of it, before deflecting and arguing that Biden slips up and makes errors frequently.\n\n\"This is what is so discouraging about politics in the media today, is that we have the White House that just recently came out and confirmed that President Joe Biden has misspoken, has made mistakes, has even outright lied over close to 150 times just this year, and you've done nothing to question him on any of that,\" Noem replied. \"And you're talking about a book that hasn't been released yet that's been corrected before it's been released.\"\n\nBrennan countered that if she were to interview Biden, she'd press him on his record, and went on to address another controversial segment of Noem's book -- her tale of shooting her 14-month-old puppy, Cricket, after failing to train her to hunt.\n\n\"I just wonder why you concluded that a young dog was untrainable and not just take it to a shelter?\" Brennan asked.\n\n\"This dog was a working dog and it had come from a family that already had issues with this dog,\" Noem countered. \"And I had put months and months of training into this dog. This dog had gone to other trainers as well.\"\n\nBrennan also noted that Noem wrote of killing one of her farm's goats after shooting Cricket because he smelled and would chase the kids, noting, \"it seems like you're celebrating the killing of the animals.\"\n\nNoem argued the story has been used to attack her for years and that she wants \"the truth to be out there and to understand that these animals were attacking [her] children.\" (Cricket was previously dubbed by her as solely a threat to livestock and even recounted in the book that her daughter asked where Cricket was after being killed.)\n\nThe South Dakota governor went on to defend an apparent veiled threat she made against Biden's dog, Commander, in the book, where she wrote that if she was vice president, she would make sure Commander is nowhere near the White House, adding, \"Commander say hello to Cricket.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people,\" Noem said, noting the aggression that prompted Biden to eventually send Commander away to relatives. \"So how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog?\"\n\nThe interview was brutally mocked on social media, with one person joking that \"Face the Nation just did to Kristi Noem what she did to Cricket.\"\n\n\"Due to mounting pressure from a biased media, Kristi Noem has decided to retract all imaginary interactions with world leaders from her upcoming biography,\" cracked someone else.\n\n\"I really did not expect Kristi Noem to try and justify the puppy theriocide by making the argument that Biden was too soft on Commander and if she was in the White House she would show toughness and decisiveness by hauling him to a gravel pit and whacking him too,\" commented attorney and prominent anti-Trump poster Ron Filipkowski. \"But she did.\"\n\nReacted Megyn Kelly: \"She is humiliating herself daily now.\"\n\nAnd Noem's apparent threat against Commander revived criticism in the GOP and cast doubt on her vice presidential prospects.\n\n\"There's gotta be some kind of happy medium between 'allowing your German Shepherd free rein to bite dozens of Secret Service agents' and 'executing your puppy in a gravel pit,'\" commented Christina Pushaw, an aide to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. \"Perhaps just ... don't get a dog if you can't commit to training & caring for it properly?\"\n\n\"I still say the outrage over Noem killing the dog 20 years ago is wildly overblown and ridiculous but on a purely political level I have never seen any politician torpedo their career so quickly, efficiently, and most of all hilariously,\" said right-wing commentator Matt Walsh.\n\nSince revealing the tale of killing Cricket, the odds of Noem becoming Donald Trump's running mate have plummeted 83%, according to the online prediction market PredictIt.", "source":

('Commander, say hello to Cricket for me.')\"\n\nNoem adds that her own dog, Foster, \"would sure be welcome\" at the White House.\n\n\"He comes with me to the [state] capitol all the time and loves everyone,\" she writes.\n\nNonetheless, a governor widely held to have designs on the presidency in 2028 has at least implied she would have a predecessor's dog killed - whether by herself with a shotgun, like Cricket and the goat, or not.\n\nNoem has defended her description of killing Cricket and the goat as evidence of her willingness to do unpleasant things in farm life as well as in politics.\n\nCommander, a german shepherd owned by Joe and Jill Biden, was removed from the White House after biting Secret Service agents.\n\nOn Sunday, Noem spoke to CBS's Face the Nation. Her host, Margaret Brennan, quoted Noem's apparent threat to kill Commander and asked: \"Are you doing this to try to look tough? Do you still think that you have a shot at being a VP?\"\n\nNoem said: \"Well, number one, Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people. So, how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog and what to do with it?\"\n\nBrennan said: \"Well, he's not living at the White House any more.\"\n\nNoem said: \"That's a question that the president should be held accountable to.\"\n\nBrennan said: \"You're saying he [Commander] should be shot?\"\n\nNoem said: \"That what's the president should be accountable to.\"\n\nNoem tried to move on, to talk about Covid in South Dakota. But she also said she was \"so proud\" of a book that contained \"a lot of truthful stories\".\n\nElsewhere, though, Noem's publisher, Center Street, said that at Noem's request it was removing from her book \"a passage regarding Kim Jong-un ... upon a reprint of the print edition and as soon as technically possible on the audio and ebook editions\".\n\nIn her book, Noem writes: \"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nAs first reported by the Dakota Scout, no such meeting occurred.\n\nNoem told CBS: \"What bothers me the most about politicians is when they're fake.\"\n\nBrennan said: \"But if you have to retract ... parts of [the book] ...\"\n\nNoem, whose publisher said it would retract part of her book, said: \"I'm not retracting anything.\"\n\nBrennan said: \"OK.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Noem attended a Trump Florida fundraiser featuring a host of vice-presidential contenders.\n\nNoem was \"somebody I love\", NBC reported Trump as saying, adding: \"She's been with me, and a supporter, and I've been a supporter of hers for a long time.\"\n\nBut unlike other hopefuls, among them the South Carolina senator Tim Scott and the New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Noem was not called to the stage.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

Noem erroneously describes meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in new book", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem described in a new book having met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress. But her office said Friday that the story of the meeting was an error as further scrutiny was put on the Republican governor's life story.\n\nNoem was already facing backlash for a description of how she shot a hunting dog. The book was part of an overt pitch to be chosen as a running mate for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But her political prospects have fallen amid bipartisan disgust for how she recounted killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket after it had shown aggressive behavior and killed her neighbor's chickens.\n\nIn her soon-to-be-released book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" Noem describes instances where she has stood up to international leaders -- anecdotes that would have bolstered her foreign policy experience -- but those were called into question. She writes about meeting Kim Jong Un while she worked in Congress, and more recently, canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron\n\nAfter The Dakota Scout first reported Noem's descriptions of the meetings, her spokesman Ian Fury said in a statement, \"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nFury said that Kim was erroneously included in a list of world leaders Noem has met with, and she also mistook the dates in which she spoke with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury added.\n\nIn the book, Noem wrote, \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders - some who wanted our help, and some who didn't. I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor after all).\"\n\nThe description of such a meeting was quickly met with skepticism by experts in U.S.-North Korea relations. When Noem was a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015, relations between North Korea and the U.S. were tense and a congressional delegation meeting with Kim would have generated considerable awareness, said Syd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on the relationship with North Korea.\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and had not been notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.\n\nNoem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nIn the book, Noem also writes that she was \"slated to meet\" with Macron in November last year while she was in Paris for a conference of European conservative leaders, but later canceled when he made comments that she considered \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, Macron's office told The Associated Press that no \"direct invitation\" had been made for Noem to meet the French president, though it did not rule out that she may have been invited to a Paris event that he was also scheduled to attend.\n\nFury said, \"The governor was invited to sit in President Macron's box for the Armistice Day Parade at Arc de Triomphe. Following his anti-Israel comments, she chose to cancel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noem is trying to fend off the bipartisan backlash for the book's description of shooting her hunting dog, as well as a goat.\n\n\"Don't believe the #fakenews media's twisted spin,\" she posted on X, formerly Twitter, this week. \"I had a choice between the safety of my children and an animal who had a history of attacking people & killing livestock.\"\n\nHer spokesman, Fury, also cast scrutiny of the errors in Noem's book as biased, saying, \"The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge but will continue to downplay Joe Biden's repeated and false claims ... \"\n\nStill, members of Congress have poked fun at Noem, with Reps. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Florida, Susan Wild. a Democrat from Pennsylvania. and Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, launching a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus this week.\n\nMoskowitz said on X that one of the group's rules was \"you cannot kill a puppy.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Kristi Noem's Memoir Falsely Claims She Met Kim Jon Un In New Memoir - uInterview", "body": "South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem's (R) upcoming memoir, No Going Back, has generated considerable controversy before its release on May 7.\n\nAlongside the public outcry at Noem's written recollection of when she euthanized her dog, questions have been raised about Noem's claim to have met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un while she served in Congress on the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nIn her book, Noem wrote, \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders. I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\"\n\nAs the independent newspaper The Dakota Scout reports, congressional travel documents and reliable external sources do not provide proof of these claims.\n\nNoem continued in her book, \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all). Dealing with foreign leaders takes resolve, preparation and determination. My experiences on those many foreign trips made me a better member of Congress and a stronger governor. It allowed me to hone my deal-making skills, which play a crucial role in leadership.\"\n\nRecords indicate that Noem served on the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015 and visited China in 2014.\n\nThe Scout reports no evidence of Kim's presence in China during that period. North Korea expert George Lopez, a University of Notre Dame professor, told the paper that Kim did not leave North Korea between 2011 and 2018.\n\nIn addition to her alleged encounter with Un, Noem claimed in her book that she had a meeting scheduled with French President Emmanuel Macron in 2023, which was subsequently canceled. However, The Scout confirmed with Macron's office that Noem did not receive a direct invitation from the French president. Noem was in Paris for a political conference and spoke on November 10, the same day Macron called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nEfforts to address the controversy around her memoir come in the wake of Noem's attempt to explain the euthanization of her family's 14-month-old \"working dog,\" Cricket, in a recent appearance on Fox News.\n\nIn her memoir, she wrote that she killed the animal after the dog ruined a pheasant hunt when it chased the birds and then \"massacred\" a neighbor's chickens. Noem attributed the media's attention and criticism to \"fake news\" tactics and claimed that the incident had been distorted and sensationalized.\n\nLast month, Noem was banned by four Native American tribes for her comments connecting tribal leadership to Mexican cartels.\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply Read more about: Kristi Noem", "source": {"uri": "uinterview.com", "dataType": "news",

And over that time I have traveled around the world and I have met with leaders around the world. And that anecdote -- I've asked them to change the content.\"\n\nMorales pressed the governor to answer \"yes or no\" regarding ever meeting Kim, and Noem once again refused.\n\nOn Sunday, two days before the book's release, Center Street Publishing, a subsidiary of Hachette Livre specializing in right-wing grievance literature, announced that it would be removing an anecdote in which the South Dakota governor falsely claimed to have met Kim Jong Un.\n\n\"At the request of Governor Noem, we are removing a passage regarding Kim Jong Un from her book No Going Back, upon reprint of the print edition and as soon as technically possible on the audio and ebook editions,\" the publisher wrote in an announcement on social media.\n\n\"Further questions about the passage should be referred to the author.\"\n\nNoem is receiving plenty of questions about inconsistencies and controversial anecdotes already identified in No Going Back. The widespread backlash around the book over Noem's gleeful description of executing a 14-month-old hunting dog named Cricket was compounded last week when allegations emerged that the governor had fabricated stories of meetings with prominent political figures.\n\nAccording to The Dakota Scout, which obtained a copy of the book, Noem claims that as a member of Congress, she met Kim Jong Un.\n\n\"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders,\" Noem wrote. \"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nWhile Noem did take a trip to China with the committee in 2014, Kim did not leave North Korea until 2018, almost a decade after assuming leadership of the nation.\n\nThe governor was also accused of inventing a story in which she canceled a meeting with Emmanuel Macron over the French president's comments on the war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. Macron's office denied ever extending an official invitation to Noem.\n\nThe book has already become the subject of widespread mockery. Saturday Night Live skewered Noem on \"Weekend Update,\" and host Dua Lipa joked in her opening monologue that even she -- a radical optimist -- couldn't put a positive spin on Noem's puppy killing.\n\nNoem seems committed to continuing her humiliating promotional media tour for the book. On Sunday, during an appearance on CBS's Face the Nation, the governor ducked questions about how a fake meeting with Kim made it into the book.\n\n\"Well, as soon as this was brought to my attention, I certainly made some changes and looked at this passage, and I've met with many, many world leaders,\" she said. \"I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders, I'm just not going to do that. This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book, and as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that that was adjusted.\"\n\nLater in the interview, Noem was asked about a passage in the book in which she seems to suggest President Biden's dog Commander should be shot. Noem writes that if she ever made it to the White House, her first act would be to make sure \"Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds. Commander, say hello to Cricket.\" Commander was previously evicted from the White House after allegedly biting Secret Service personnel on at least 24 occasions.\n\n\"You're saying [Commander] should be shot?\" host Margaret Brennan asked incredulously about the passage.\n\nNoem did not acknowledge the question, instead talking over Brennan and deflecting criticism as run-of-the-mill attacks from her opponents.\n\nWhile the whole debacle is already embarrassing, it may be costing the MAGA governor more than just credibility in the public eye. As previously reported by Rolling Stone, Noem's puppy-slaying ways and poor grasp of public relations may have killed her chances of becoming Donald Trump's vice president. Trump, sources recounted, has repeatedly questioned Noem's decision to execute the dog, including specifically, \"Why would she do that?\" and \"What is wrong with her?\"\n\nIt's getting \"kind of ridiculous\" how \"disgusted\" the former president sounded, one source said.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Noem erroneously describes meeting with North...", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) - South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem described in a new book having met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress. But her office said Friday that the story of the meeting was an error as further scrutiny was put on the Republican governor's life story.\n\nNoem was already facing backlash for a description of how she shot a hunting dog. The book was part of an overt pitch to be chosen as a running mate for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But her political prospects have fallen amid bipartisan disgust for how she recounted killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket after it had shown aggressive behavior and killed her neighbor's chickens.\n\nIn her soon-to-be-released book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What\u00b4s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" Noem describes instances where she has stood up to international leaders - anecdotes that would have bolstered her foreign policy experience - but those were called into question. She writes about meeting Kim Jong Un while she worked in Congress, and more recently, canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron\n\nAfter The Dakota Scout first reported Noem's descriptions of the meetings, her spokesman Ian Fury said in a statement, \"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back\u00b4 has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nFury said that Kim was erroneously included in a list of world leaders Noem has met with, and she also mistook the dates in which she spoke with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury added.\n\nFILE - South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC 2024, at the National Harbor, Feb. 23, 2024, in Oxon Hill, Md. Noem claims in a new book to have met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress, but her office has said the publisher will be addressing \"conflated\" names in the book as further scrutiny was put on the Republican governor's life story. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nIn the book, Noem wrote, \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders - some who wanted our help, and some who didn\u00b4t. I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I\u00b4m sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I\u00b4d been a children\u00b4s pastor after all).\"\n\nThe description of such a meeting was quickly met with skepticism by experts in U.S.-North Korea relations. When Noem was a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015, relations between North Korea and the U.S. were tense and a congressional delegation meeting with Kim would have generated considerable awareness, said Syd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on the relationship with North Korea.\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and had not been notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.\n\nNoem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nIn the book, Noem also writes that she was \"slated to meet\" with Macron in November last year while she was in Paris for a conference of European conservative leaders, but later canceled when he made comments that she considered \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, Macron's office told The Associated Press that no \"direct invitation\" had been made for Noem to meet the French president, though it did not rule out that she may have been invited to a Paris event that he was also scheduled to attend.\n\nFury said, \"The governor was invited to sit in President Macron\u00b4s box for the Armistice Day Parade at Arc de Triomphe. Following his anti-Israel comments, she chose to cancel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noem is trying to fend off the bipartisan backlash for the book's description of shooting her hunting dog, as well as a goat.\n\n\"Don\u00b4t believe the #fakenews media\u00b4s twisted spin,\" she posted on X, formerly Twitter, this week. \"I had a choice between the safety of my children and an animal who had a history of attacking people & killing livestock.\"\n\nHer spokesman, Fury, also cast scrutiny of the errors in Noem's book as biased, saying, \"The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge but will continue to downplay Joe Biden\u00b4s repeated and false claims ... \"\n\nStill, members of Congress have poked fun at Noem, with Reps. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Florida, Susan Wild. a Democrat from Pennsylvania. and Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, launching a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus this week.\n\nMoskowitz said on X that one of the group's rules was \"you cannot kill a puppy.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

Kristi Noem faces questions in new interview about false claim in her book that she met Kim Jong Un", "body": "South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem on Monday defended controversial passages in her forthcoming book as she faces scrutiny over a number of anecdotes, including a false claim about a meeting with Kim Jong Un, a story about killing her dog, and a phone call with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley where Noem said she felt \"threatened.\"\n\nIn one anecdote that prompted questions, Noem claimed to have met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress. She told \"CBS Mornings\" Monday the anecdote shouldn't have been included in the book and is being adjusted, and her publisher, Center Street, confirmed Sunday that the anecdote would be removed. But Noem would not answer a question about whether the meeting with the North Korean leader actually occurred. There is no public record of her visiting North Korea or meeting with the reclusive Kim.\n\n\"I've met with many, many world leaders. I've traveled around the world,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I should not have put that anecdote in the book.\"\n\nThe Republican governor said on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that she would not discuss specifics about her meetings with world leaders or trips she's taken. When pressed by moderator Margaret Brennan about whether she had been to North Korea, Noem insisted she had been to the DMZ -- the demilitarized zone separating North Korea from South Korea.\n\nNoem also defended her description of the call with Haley, after which she said she felt \"very much threatened.\"\n\n\"Words matter,\" Noem said on \"CBS Mornings,\" describing the call where she claimed Haley said she would tell her, with long pauses, if she heard bad things about her.\n\nNoem said it was clear from the call that Haley \"was the lone wolf and that there wasn't room for another Republican woman in politics.\"\n\nNoem had been considered among a list of possible running mates for former President Donald Trump in his latest White House bid. But questions have swirled about her political future in recent days, as she faces intense blowback after writing in her new book about killing her dog decades ago.\n\nIn her book, titled \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" Noem writes that the 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket had shown aggressive behavior while she was training the dog for pheasant hunting. She said on Monday that the decision to kill the dog \"was extremely hard for me.\"\n\n\"The purpose of telling the story was so that people would know I don't pass my responsibilities on to anybody else,\" she added.\n\nNoem's appearance on \"CBS Mornings\" came one day after she kicked off her book tour on \"Face the Nation,\" where she was asked about a passage in her book about President Biden's dog, Commander, which had been known for biting people at the White House. In the book, Noem writes that if she got to the White House, she would say, \"Commander, say hello to Cricket.\"\n\nNoem said the \"president should be held accountable\" for the dog, and when Brennan asked, \"Are you saying he should be shot?\" Noem answered again, \"That's what the president should be accountable to.\"\n\nAfter Sunday's interview on \"Face the Nation,\" Noem tweeted that she had been repeatedly interrupted and accused the \"fake news media\" of a double standard.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Mornings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CBS Mornings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean Demilitarized Zone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republican_(Springfield,_Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commander (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/06/7bbdbf99-841c-4a2e-b7f7-5d8b91dd2916/thumbnail/1200x630g2/995d0fdfa339ecab88f4809f4f6a2d53/1715012491563.png?v=1d6c78a71b7b6252b543a329b3a5744d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Kristi Noem recounts a graphic, disturbing story in her forthcoming book about killing her puppy with a gun, the Republican from South Dakota defended the violence as a \"tough decision\" she had to make. The dog, she wrote, had attacked some chickens.\n\n\"I talk about it because what I'm tired of in this country is politicians who pretend to be something that they're not,\" Noem said on CBS's Face the Nation today.\n\nThat tough talk aside, Noem apparently is not immune to such posing: It has now also emerged that she falsely claimed in her book to have met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. And she refused to cop to the embarasssing mistake directly when CBS host Margaret Brennan questioned her about it on Sunday. The passage in question, which appears to have first been reported by independent South Dakota news site The Dakota Scout, says Noem met the dictator while serving in Congress on the House Armed Services Committee. According to the New York Times, which obtained an advanced copy of Noem's book, the governor wrote:\n\nI had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders -- some who wanted our help, and some who didn't. I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all). Dealing with foreign leaders takes resolve, preparation, and determination.\n\nWhen questioned about the anecdote, Noem's spokesperson admitted to The Dakota Scout that the publisher will be updating the book to address \"conflated world leaders' names\" before its release -- though the spokesperson does not appear to have clarified who Noem could have been referring to. (The spokesperson did not respond to questions from Mother Jones on Sunday afternoon.) Noem, too, refused to clear things up when Brennan confronted her on air.\n\n\"Did you meet Kim Jong Un?\" Brennan asked.\n\n\"Well, you know, as soon as this was brought to my attention, I certainly made some changes and looked at this passage. And I have met with many, many world leaders. I have traveled around the world. As soon as it was brought to my attention, we went forward and have made some edits,\" Noem replied, adding that \"people will have the updated version\" when the book is released Tuesday.\n\n\"So you did not meet with Kim Jong Un? That's what you're saying,\" Brennan pressed.\n\nNoem went on to repeat the claim that she has met with \"many, many world leaders\" before insisting she was \"not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders, I'm just not going to do that.\"\n\n\"This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book,\" Noem continued. \"And as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that that was adjusted.\"\n\nLater, Brennan tried to clarify how Noem could have possibly made such an error, asking, \"who is it that you confused Kim Jong-un with?\"\n\nNoem had no answer; later, she blasted Brennan as part of the \"fake news media\" and criticized her for interrupting her throughout the interview.\n\nWhen it comes to owning up to her mistakes, it seems that Noem is taking a cue from the title of her book: No Going Back.", "source": {"uri": "motherjones.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mother Jones"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julianne_mcshane@motherjones.com", "name": "Julianne McShane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Jones_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mother Jones (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_05_05_noem-1-e1714932581280.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Mitt Romney's car roof-riding dog had his time in the sun, but Seamus did not end his owner's career the way Cricket seems to be dashing Noem's hope of being the Trump VP pick. As Romney himself put it, the two scandals are quite different because: \"I didn't eat my dog. I didn't shoot my dog. I loved my dog, and my dog loved me.\"\n\nIncredibly, it seems Noem's \"dog killer\" anecdote isn't the only weird or possibly inaccurate tale in the book, which was clearly intended to make Noem a more attractive potential Trump running mate. Here's a list, which we'll keep updated, of every self-sabotaging story the South Dakota governor inexplicably included in No Going Back.\n\nIn the book Noem recalls the time she decided to haul her dog Cricket, \"a wirehair pointer, about 14 months old,\" to a gravel pit and fatally shoot her. Cricket's crime: she had an \"aggressive personality\" and after Noem attempted to train her to hunt pheasant she attacked some chickens instead.\n\nHere's the story, per The Guardian:\n\nBy taking Cricket on a pheasant hunt with older dogs, Noem says, she hoped to calm the young dog down and begin to teach her how to behave. Unfortunately, Cricket ruined the hunt, going \"out of her mind with excitement, chasing all those birds and having the time of her life.\"\n\nNoem describes calling Cricket, then using an electronic collar to attempt to bring her under control. Nothing worked. Then, on the way home after the hunt, as Noem stopped to talk to a local family, Cricket escaped Noem's truck and attacked the family's chickens, \"grabb[ing] one chicken at a time, crunching it to death with one bite, then dropping it to attack another.\"\n\nCricket the untrainable dog, Noem writes, behaved like \"a trained assassin.\"\n\nWhen Noem finally grabbed Cricket, she says, the dog \"whipped around to bite me.\" Then, as the chickens' owner wept, Noem repeatedly apologised, wrote the shocked family a check \"for the price they asked, and helped them dispose of the carcasses littering the scene of the crime.\"\n\nThrough it all, Noem says, Cricket was \"the picture of pure joy\".\n\n\"I hated that dog,\" Noem writes, adding that Cricket had proved herself \"untrainable,\" \"dangerous to anyone she came in contact with\" and \"less than worthless ... as a hunting dog.\"\n\nIncredibly, Noem's horrific animal tale doesn't end there. She writes that right after killing Cricket she decided she needed to put down her goat too, as he was \"nasty and mean\" because he had not been castrated. Per The Guardian:\n\nNoem decided to kill the unnamed goat the same way she had just killed Cricket the dog. But though she \"dragged him to a gravel pit\", the goat jumped as she shot and therefore survived the wound. Noem says she went back to her truck, retrieved another shell, then \"hurried back to the gravel pit and put him down\".\n\nAt that point, Noem writes, she realised a construction crew had watched her kill both animals. The startled workers swiftly got back to work, she writes, only for a school bus to arrive and drop off Noem's children.\n\nNoem included her child's bewildered reaction, for unclear reasons:\n\n\"Kennedy looked around confused,\" Noem writes of her daughter, who asked: \"Hey, where's Cricket?\"\n\nIn the book Noem says she met the North Korean dictator while she was serving in Congress, which almost certainly did not happen. She writes, per The Dakota Scout:\n\nThrough my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee ... I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders. I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all). Dealing with foreign leaders takes resolve, preparation and determination. My experiences on those many foreign trips made me a better member of Congress and a stronger governor. It allowed me to hone my deal-making skills, which play a crucial role in leadership.\n\nNoem is not specific about when this meeting with Kim Jong Un took place, but she served on the House Armed Services Committee from 2013-2015. Multiple sources and North Korea experts told The Dakota Scout that there's no record of this meeting taking place, and there's no way a single junior member of Congress had a secret run-in with the dictator during this time. Even President Obama did not meet with Kim.\n\nIt seems Noem is already backtracking on the story. Her spokesperson, Ian Fury, gave Politico Playbook this cryptic statement: \"We've been made aware that the publisher will be addressing conflated world leaders' names in the book before it is released.\"\n\nNoem says that while serving as governor last year she canceled a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\"While in Paris, I was slated to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron,\" Noem writes. \"However, the day before we were to meet he made what I considered a very pro-Hamas and anti-Israel comment to the press. So, I decided to cancel. There is no place for pro-Hamas rhetoric.\"\n\nThis is more plausible than secretly meeting Kim Jong Un, but it appears this story may also be untrue. The Dakota Scout conferred with Macron's office, which said he never had a meeting scheduled with the governor:\n\nThe Scout confirmed through the French president's office that Noem did not receive a \"direct invitation\" from the French president. However, the office didn't rule out the possibility that Noem - who was in Paris for a political conference - could have been scheduled to attend an event where Macron was also scheduled. Noem spoke at the conference on Friday, Nov. 10, the same day that Macron called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nNoem claims that former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley got aggressive with her during a phone conversation in the summer of 2021. But it seems the governor may have gotten the date wrong, and nothing she recalls Haley saying sounds very threatening. Politico published this excerpt from the book:\n\n\"Hi, Governor, this is Ambassador Nikki Haley, and I just wanted to introduce myself and have a conversation. I just wanted to let you know that I follow you quite a bit. I have heard quite a bit about you, and you are doing a good job there in South Dakota. I was thinking that maybe you might like a mentor, and maybe I could be someone who could do that for you. Because you're a governor, you've gone through some challenging things that I did as well. I would be more than willing to be a mentor, because you've never been in this type of role before.\"\n\nShe went on to tell me about her life story, her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and some of the challenges she faced in her legislature as governor and as ambassador to the United Nations reading daily talking points from the State Department. Once again, I recall, she offered to mentor me, as she was sure I was facing some decisions and situations I'd never seen before. ...\n\nAfter what seemed to me a bit of an awkward pause, she added, \"I ... just ... also want you to know one more thing ... I've heard a lot of really good things about you. But I also want you to know that if I hear something bad ... I will be sure to let you know.\"\n\nThere was a long pause.\n\n\"Um, well, thanks for that, Ambassador.\"\n\n\"Let me be clear,\" she added. \"I've heard many good things about you. But when I do hear bad things, I will make sure that you know. I've enjoyed talking to you. We will visit soon. Goodbye.\" Click.\n\nNoem then told her assistant she thought Haley threatened her:\n\n\"Yeah, I'm pretty sure I was just threatened by Nikki Haley. It was clear that she wanted me to know that there was only room for one Republican woman in the spotlight. It was weird.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, I never received any calls or \"mentoring\" from her, but the message was clear. I'm the alpha female here, and you should know your place. I actually felt a little sad for her.\n\nHaley spokesperson Chaney Denton confirmed that the former ambassador did speak to Noem, but she said her calendar showed the call took place in 2020, not 2021. And she cast doubt on the idea that Haley was issuing some kind of warning to Noem.\n\n\"Nikki has long called and written notes supporting other women when they go through challenging times,\" Denton said. \"She called Governor Noem in 2020 to encourage her when she was criticized for keeping her state open during Covid. How she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird.\"", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "margaret_hartmann@nymag.com", "name": "Margaret Hartmann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gravel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheasant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pheasant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scouting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_America_Forward", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Move America Forward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Castration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

But she had already fallen off Trump's VP shortlist", "body": "CNN --\n\nFor South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, much of the 2024 campaign cycle has turned out to be a case study in what not to do to rise into potential vice presidential contention.\n\nThat includes the latest hiccup, with the second-term South Dakota governor - once considered a top potential running mate who has since fallen off former President Donald Trump's shortlist, according to multiple Republicans with knowledge of that list - finding herself in an unwanted spotlight over questions about actions she describes in her upcoming book: \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward.\"\n\nNoem's crisis hasn't affected her standing on Trump's vice presidential candidate shortlist - sources said she had fallen off that list long before that - but it has confirmed to skeptics in Trump's orbit that she shouldn't be in consideration and won't be anytime soon.\n\nNoem's book launch has become a problem for her for multiple reasons. First, there was Noem's description of her decision to kill a 14-month-old wirehair pointer, named Cricket, who was not displaying the signs of an ideal hunting dog. The governor wrote that the dog was \"untrainable,\" according to excerpts first reported by The Guardian. She also described shooting a goat in the book.\n\nNoem has argued that those anecdotes were meant to show how capable she is of doing some of the more gruesome jobs in life when necessary.\n\nBut the Cricket episode in particular instead resulted in days of Noem having to publicly defend the decision to put the dog down. A bipartisan group of members of Congress set up a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus in a not so subtle dig to the South Dakota governor.\n\nSome Republicans came to her defense, like South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson, who acknowledged, \"Life is a little different in rural America.\"\n\nBut South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds struck a different tone: \"I don't see how it helps,\" he said Tuesday.\n\nNoem has repeatedly defended her actions this week. Appearing on Fox News Wednesday, Noem explained it was a \"very aggressive dog\" that \"massacred\" a local family's chickens and attacked her, which ultimately led her to shoot the dog in a gravel pit. She argued it was the responsible decision to protect her children and those around her business.\n\n\"Dogs that have this kind of a problem, that have been to training for months and still kill for fun, they are extremely dangerous and a responsible owner does what they need to do and what the law will allow,\" Noem said.\n\nAs many questioned why she volunteered this story in her book, Noem said it demonstrates how she doesn't run from the truth.\n\n\"What the point of the story is, is that most politicians, they will run from the truth,\" Noem said. \"They will shy away and hide from making tough decisions. I don't do either of those.\"\n\nTrump himself has privately criticized Noem about the story, a person with direct knowledge of the comments told CNN. The former president, however, appeared more dismayed that she chose to disclose the anecdote and at her faltering attempts to do damage control, than the story itself, they said.\n\nOn Thursday, the situation got worse for Noem when The Dakota Scout, an independent newspaper, reported that Noem suggested in her book that, as a member of the US House Armed Services Committee, she had met North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un. Noem, according to that excerpt, also said that she was set to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron as governor before cancelling. In both cases, the Scout reported, records indicated that Noem did not meet with Kim or have a meeting scheduled with Macron.\n\nIn another excerpt obtained by Politico, Noem described a 2021 phone call she says occurred with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley that she took as Haley trying to intimidate Noem from the national spotlight. That excerpt was first reported by Politico on Friday. A Haley spokeswoman though said that Haley called Noem in 2020, not 2021.\n\nIn response, Ian Fury, Noem's spokesperson, released a statement that these were small errors and would be changed.\n\n\"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor. Kim Jong Un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been,\" Fury said in a statement to CNN on Friday. \"The Governor spoke with Nikki Haley in 2020 and met with her in 2021. The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected.\"\n\nRepublicans have been befuddled how the book was published with these errors.\n\n\"You would hope that these sort of anecdotes would be vetted prior to the release of a book, that would typically happen in most high profile book launches, and obviously there's some orchestrated events going on here. She has several interviews set up,\" Jesse Hunt, a Republican strategist and former communications director for the Republican Governors Association, said. \"Clearly this was thought out. The advisers that she had involved didn't see it as having any problematic narratives.\"\n\nNoem's standing\n\nWhile at one point considered a top contender for vice president, advisers to Trump have said for weeks that Noem no longer held that standing, even before she revealed she shot her dog and before she posted a bizarre infomercial for a Texas dental practice. However, she was included on the short list that the campaign compiled for vetting, with her advisers noting that no one should be entirely ruled out given Trump's often spontaneous decision making. Despite this caveat, at least two advisers said she was currently not in the running.\n\nFor Noem, the increasing scrutiny about her book is the latest bump in an ongoing list of her attempts to raise her profile on the national stage.\n\nOn paper, Noem had all the markings of a strong contender to be Trump's running mate. For the operatives that fixate on simplistic criteria in picking a running mate, the argument behind Noem is she's an anti-abortion Republican who started out in humble means and rose to the governor's mansion. Noem has also displayed comfort in front of large crowds or a camera.\n\nAs governor of South Dakota during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, she resisted lockdowns. While speaking at a National Rifle Association event, she said that her two-year-old grandchild has multiple guns.\n\nNoem also has been deferential to Trump and the Trump movement going back to before she was elected to her current job in 2018. She was one of the earliest governors to endorse the former president in the 2024 cycle.\n\nBut her term as governor has been rocky. She's received national criticism for her opposition to any Covid-19 lockdown measures - but not by hardcore Trump loyalists. Her office has seen significant staff turnover, with seasoned operatives leaving and Noem bringing in more controversial ones - like former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Noem has faced ethics complaints in South Dakota for inappropriately using her office to help her daughter with a real estate appraiser's license. And more recently, she was banned from some tribal lands in her home state over comments the governor made about tribal leaders focusing more on benefiting from drug cartels than their children.\n\nThroughout it all, Noem has sought to boost her national profile. Early in the 2024 cycle, she set up a federal political action committee - a time honored move that future candidates for high office make. Noem has also had her political operation air ads on national television to highlight her state's economy. In March, Noem opted to star in a near five-minute informercial for a dental practice based in Texas.\n\nAt one point, some of these moves seemed to be working. But that was long before the public learned about Cricket or the unnamed goat.\n\n\"He soured on her long before this,\" a person close to Trump, who has spoken with the former president about his potential vice presidential contenders, told CNN.\n\n\"He has questioned some of her choices. But where they may have been lingering questions over whether she could find herself back on the list, this story has killed that. It is totally disqualifying,\" they added, referencing the story about how she killed her 14-month-old dog.\n\nTrump has often mentioned Noem in both private and public as a loyal supporter. The former president was particularly pleased after her August 2023 television appearance affirming her decision that she would not be running for president in 2024.\n\nNoem is still set to appear at a big fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago this weekend, alongside other potential vice presidential picks for Trump. She's also slated to headline a fundraiser in Jefferson County in Colorado on Saturday, according to The Denver Post. That's a schedule a top tier Republican would have if they were in strong contention to be Trump's running mate. But the last few weeks and months have cast strong doubt among Republicans about Noem's viability.\n\n\"You need to be skilled at defending Trump and the campaign but she's having trouble defending herself in her own book,\" said Matt Gorman, a veteran Republican strategist.\n\nStill, Gorman stressed that it's important for Noem to attend the Mar-a-Lago spring retreat.\n\n\"I think it's important to go because one thing that's important to remember is if you don't like the current headline, make a new one. So going to Mar-a-Lago, if I were giving her team advice, it'd be be very visible. The worst thing you can do is hideout and let the headlines overtake you. You want to create headlines as much as you can, create your own news, your own content.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But her office said Friday that the story of the meeting was an error as further scrutiny was put on the Republican governor's life story.\n\nNoem was already facing backlash for a description of how she shot a hunting dog. The book was part of an overt pitch to be chosen as a running mate for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But her political prospects have fallen amid bipartisan disgust for how she recounted killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket after it had shown aggressive behavior and killed her neighbor's chickens.\n\nIn her soon-to-be-released book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" Noem describes instances where she has stood up to international leaders -- anecdotes that would have bolstered her foreign policy experience -- but those were called into question. She writes about meeting Kim Jong Un while she worked in Congress, and more recently, canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAfter The Dakota Scout first reported Noem's descriptions of the meetings, her spokesman Ian Fury said in a statement, \"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nFury said that Kim was erroneously included in a list of world leaders Noem has met with, and she also mistook the dates in which she spoke with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury added.\n\nIn the book, Noem wrote, \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders - some who wanted our help, and some who didn't. I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor after all).\"\n\nThe description of such a meeting was quickly met with skepticism by experts in U.S.-North Korea relations. When Noem was a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015, relations between North Korea and the U.S. were tense and a congressional delegation meeting with Kim would have generated considerable awareness, said Syd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on the relationship with North Korea.\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and had not been notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.Noem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nIn the book, Noem also writes that she was \"slated to meet\" with Macron in November last year while she was in Paris for a conference of European conservative leaders, but later canceled when he made comments that she considered \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, Macron's office told The Associated Press that no \"direct invitation\" had been made for Noem to meet the French president, though it did not rule out that she may have been invited to a Paris event that he was also scheduled to attend.\n\nFury said, \"The governor was invited to sit in President Macron's box for the Armistice Day Parade at Arc de Triomphe. Following his anti-Israel comments, she chose to cancel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noem is trying to fend off the bipartisan backlash for the book's description of shooting her hunting dog, as well as a goat.\n\n\"Don't believe the #fakenews media's twisted spin,\" she posted on X, formerly Twitter, this week. \"I had a choice between the safety of my children and an animal who had a history of attacking people & killing livestock.\"\n\nHer spokesman, Fury, also cast scrutiny of the errors in Noem's book as biased, saying, \"The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge but will continue to downplay Joe Biden's repeated and false claims ... \"\n\nStill, members of Congress have poked fun at Noem, with Reps. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Florida, Susan Wild. a Democrat from Pennsylvania. and Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, launching a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus this week.\n\nMoskowitz said on X that one of the group's rules was \"you cannot kill a puppy.\"", "source": {"uri": "eastbaytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Bay Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Kristi Noem (R) did not say whether she met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when responding to the inaccuracies reported in her new book.\n\nNoem has been facing mounting criticism over her forthcoming book, set to be released this week, over her inclusion of a story where she details shooting and killing a dog and a goat on her property about 20 years ago. In recent days, she has faced additional scrutiny after writing in her book that she had met Kim while serving in Congress on the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nThe Dakota Scout reported last week that a meeting between Noem and Kim would likely not have been possible, citing interviews with congressional staffers and North Korea analysts. While Noem had visited China as part of her time on the committee in 2014, there were no reports of Kim leaving North Korea until 2018, when Noem was campaigning for governor, according to the outlet.\n\nNoem's office later said in a statement to The Hill that Kim \"was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been.\"\n\nHost Margaret Brennan pressed Noem on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on whether she had actually met Kim and how that story was included in her book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward.\"\n\n\"You know, as soon as this was brought to my attention, I certainly made some changes and looked at this passage, and I've met with many, many world leaders.

Kristi Noem says Kim Jong Un book claims have been 'adjusted,' but stands by killing Cricket. Here's where things stand with 'No Going Back.'", "body": "Kristi Noem, the Republican governor of South Dakota and potential 2024 running mate for Donald Trump, has been in the spotlight over the past week for a controversial passage in her forthcoming memoir, No Going Back, in which she describes shooting and killing a pet dog.\n\nOn Sunday, she was pressed about that and another passage that appeared in advanced copies of the book, in which she falsely claimed to have met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nIn an interview with CBS's Face the Nation, Noem sat down with host Margaret Brennan to talk about the controversies surrounding her memoir.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the interview.\n\nIn Noem's book, out May 7, she wrote about meeting with various world leaders during her time in Congress -- including North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who she claimed \"underestimated\" her potential as a leader. Experts and Capitol Hill staffers were quick to dispute the governor's claim, and Noem acknowledged the mistake during Sunday's interview.\n\n\"As soon as this was brought to my attention, I certainly made some changes and looked at this passage,\" Noem told Brennan. \"We went forward and made some edits, so I'm glad that this book is being released in a couple of days and that people will have the updated version.\"\n\nNoem deflected when asked to confirm whether she had actually met with Jong Un.\n\n\"I met with many many world leaders,\" she said. \"I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I'm just not going to do that. This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book and as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that it was adjusted.\"\n\nFollowing backlash from experts who questioned her story of meeting Kim Jong Un, Noem's claim will be removed from the book prior to its release on May 7, but other claims in the memoir are coming under scrutiny.\n\nNoem also wrote about Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, claiming that Haley called her in 2021 to offer support and mentorship. In her book, Noem wrote that the call felt threatening, stating that Haley must believe \"there was only room for one Republican woman in the spotlight.\"\n\nHaley spokesperson Chaney Denton has since come out to say that the women spoke in 2020 -- not 2021, as written in the book. During the call, Denton said Haley was supportive of Noem for not closing down her state during COVID.\n\n\"How she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird,\" Denton said.\n\nNoem's spokesperson Ian Fury declared that these points were \"small errors,\" which were \"communicated to the ghostwriter and editor\" and that future editions of the book will correct this mistake.\n\nNoem was also pressed about an anecdote in her book in which she recounted shooting and killing her 14-month old dog Cricket, who she claimed was untrainable, after he attacked chickens on a neighbor's farm. (Later in the book, Noem writes that she also shot and killed a goat on her farm.)\n\n\"This dog was a working dog and it had come from a family that already had issues with this dog. I put months and months of training into this dog. This dog had gone to other trainers as well,\" she said, noting that killing Cricket was a \"choice I made over 20 years ago, and I didn't ask somebody else to take that responsibility for me. I had to make that decision myself.\"\n\nShe also said that President Joe Biden should be held accountable for his dog, Commander, who reportedly has attacked two dozen Secret Service agents.\n\n\"Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 secret service people, so how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog and what to do with it?\" she asked.\n\nIn the chapter \"Bad Day to be a Goat,\" Noem writes that, after shooting Cricket, she later shot a billy goat she claimed to be unruly. Noem told Brennan that the story has repeatedly come up over the years by political opponents who try to \"use it against me.\"\n\n\"It's well known in South Dakota and it has been to other people,\" she said of the goat. \"I want the truth out there and [for people] to understand that these animals were attacking my children, that we live on a farm and a ranch and that tough decisions are made many times, and it is to protect people.\"\n\nBipartisan reaction to the story of Noem killing Cricket has been largely negative and comes at a time that she appears to be lobbying to be picked to be Trump's running mate in 2024.\n\n\"Anyone who has ever owned a bird-dog knows how disgusting, lazy and evil this is,\" Ryan Busse, a Democratic candidate for governor of Montana, wrote on X.\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr., said she was bewildered by Noem's account of killing the dog. \"It makes no sense. I don't understand. I've always liked Gov. Noem. She works very hard, tirelessly on behalf of the movement,\" she remarked during an interview with One America News Network, adding, \"I just can't imagine that because there's a forever home for all animals...I don't know what happened, maybe somebody slipped that in and she didn't see it.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Dakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Guilfoyle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Guilfoyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_America_News_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One America News Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost_and_Found", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost and Found", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DQWGte3XWfd0JO1m7NXiBQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NjE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/610eb3f0-0afa-11ef-bd7c-e20beacb8410", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 666, "textEnd": 671, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Kristi Noem is facing more controversy over her new memoir, with her spokesman saying a claim she makes about meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and an account of an interaction with former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley are \"errors\" that \"will be corrected\" in future editions.\n\nNoem's book, \"No Going Back,\" has drawn backlash for how she describes shooting and killing her 14-month-old dog, Cricket, in an incident she said happened 20 years ago.\n\nNow, Noem -- widely rumored to be seeking to be a potential vice-presidential pick for former President Donald Trump -- is addressing new questions over an account of a meeting she said she had with the North Korean leader while she served in Congress.\n\nMORE: 'She killed her chances': Kristi Noem's odds dim of being Trump's VP pick, sources say\n\n\"As a congresswoman and governor, I've met with Chinese president Xi Jingping, the king and princes of Saudi Arabia, North Korean president Kim Jong Un, the king of Jordan, South Korean president Lee Myung-bak, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, UK prime minister Boris Johnson, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and many more,\" Noem writes in her book.\n\nABC News has obtained a copy.\n\n\"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders -- some who wanted our help, and some who didn't. I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all),\" Noem continued.\n\nMORE: Kristi Noem defends controversial decision to shoot dog: 'Understand why some people are upset'\n\nNow, her team is trying to clean up that misleading story, suggesting, \"Kim Jong Un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been,\" Noem's spokesman Ian Fury said in a statement to ABC News. The statement doesn't underscore why the South Dakota governor elaborated on the purported meeting with Kim.\n\nShe also describes an interaction with Haley over the phone in the summer of 2021 during which the former U.N. ambassadors allegedly said she would be Noem's mentor and would tell Noem anything bad she heard about her -- which Noem says she took as a threat.\n\nFury acknowledged that the timeline of the Haley conversation is muddled. Noem's spokesperson suggests, \"they spoke in 2020\" -- instead of 2021 as the book suggests -- and that Haley \"met with her in 2021.\"\n\nHaley spokesperson Chaney Denton confirmed to ABC News that Haley's calendar shows the two spoke on the phone in 2020, not 2021.\n\n\"Nikki has long called and written notes supporting other women when they go through challenging times. She called Governor Noem in 2020 to encourage her when she was criticized for keeping her state open during COVID,\" Denton said. \"How she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird.\"\n\nThere will be corrections to these \"two small errors\" to all future editions before next week's release date, Fury said.\n\n\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury said.\n\nABC News' Nicholas Kerr contributed to this report.\n\nNoem backpedals on anecdote in book about meeting with Kim Jong Un originally appeared on abcnews.go.com",

Kristi Noem is releasing a new book called \"No Going Back,\" but on Friday her office said she would actually be going back to correct some errors -- including a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe Republican governor's new book was part of an overt effort to be selected as a running mate for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but it has already faced bipartisan backlash for a story of how she once shot her hunting dog. Then, after scrutiny of her descriptions of meetings with international leaders, her spokesperson Ian Fury said in a statement that it was an error to include Kim in a list of world leaders who Noem has met -- and the publisher would correct any future editions of the book.\n\nNoem's political prospects were already falling amid widespread disgust for how she recounted killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket after it had shown aggressive behavior and killed her neighbor's chickens.\n\nWashington University faculty placed on leave, students 'houseless' after Gaza protest Wentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Southwest Airlines considering changes to its quirky boarding, pick-your-own seating practices Cardinals games dropped by Comcast after Bally Sports deal falls through Washington University students suspended after campus protest against war in Gaza Messenger: SLU soccer star, now 82, faced eviction.

She writes about canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAfter The Dakota Scout first reported Noem's descriptions of the meetings, Fury said that the book \"has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nIn addition to the meeting with Kim, Fury said Noem also mistook the dates in which she spoke with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury added.\n\nIn a section of the book about meeting with international leaders, Noem writes: \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders -- some who wanted our help, and some who didn't.\n\n\"I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" she writes. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor after all).\"\n\nThe description of such a meeting was quickly challenged and described as implausible by experts on U.S.-North Korea relations. When Noem was a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015, relations between the two countries were tense and a congressional delegation meeting with Kim would have generated considerable awareness, said Syd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on the relationship with North Korea.\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and was not notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.\n\nNoem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nIn the book, Noem also writes that she was \"slated to meet with\" Macron in November last year while she was in Paris for a conference of European conservative leaders, but canceled when he made comments that she considered \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, Macron's office told The Associated Press that no \"direct invitation\" had been made for Noem to meet the French president, though it did not rule out that she may have been invited to a Paris event that he was also scheduled to attend.\n\nFury said, \"The governor was invited to sit in President Macron's box for the Armistice Day Parade at Arc de Triomphe. Following his anti-Israel comments, she chose to cancel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noem is trying to fend off the backlash for writing about shooting her dog as well as a goat.\n\n\"Don't believe the #fakenews media's twisted spin,\" she posted on the social platform X this week. \"I had a choice between the safety of my children and an animal who had a history of attacking people & killing livestock.\"\n\nHer spokesperson, Fury, also cast scrutiny of the errors in Noem's book as biased, saying, \"The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge.\"\n\nStill, members of Congress have poked fun at Noem, with Reps. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Florida; Susan Wild, a Democrat from Pennsylvania; and Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina; launching a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus this week.\n\nMoskowitz said on X that one of the group's rules was \"you cannot kill a puppy.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri":

Kristi Noem's forthcoming book incorrectly said she had met with Kim Jong Un. After the passage leaked before publication, she said she asked the book's publisher remove it. She did her own narration for the audiobook. Why didn't she catch the error then?\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem may have been caught fibbing.\n\nThe rising Republican politician claimed last week she ordered changes to her soon-to-be-released book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" after learning it falsely said she met with North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.\n\n\"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, I'm sure he underestimated me having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants. I've been a children's pastor after all,\" Noem wrote in her book about an interaction with the North Korean leader that never happened, as Politico reported last week.\n\nCBS News' \"Face the Nation\" host Margaret Brennan pressed Noem on Sunday about the false passage in her book.\n\n\"Did you meet Kim Jong Un?\" Brennan asked the governor.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders, I'm just not going to do that,\" Noem said. \"This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book, and as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that that was adjusted.\"\n\nLater Sunday, Noem's book publisher released a statement. \"At the request of Governor Noem, we are removing a passage regarding Kim Jong Un from her book No Going Back, upon reprint of the print edition and as soon as technically possible on the audio and ebook editions,\" it said.\n\nIn other words, the audiobook version of Noem's memoir narrated by the governor herself will have to be edited as well, meaning Noem read the false North Korea statement aloud for the recording without correcting it.\n\nA representative from Noem's office did not respond to Business Insider's question about why the governor didn't report the error sooner. CBS News asked Noem a similar question during their interview, leading the governor to accuse the host of treating her \"differently than every other person\" she's spoken with on the show.\n\nThe rollout for Noem's forthcoming book has been a diaster.\n\nThe Guardian obtained an early copy of Noem's book in late April, and revealed that Noem wrote about shooting her family's 14-month-old dog in a gravel pit.\n\nShe's since defended the passage, adding that she recently also killed three horses. Noem has also said that President Joe Biden's dog, Commander, should be put down after it reportedly bit several Secret Service agents.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported on May 3 that sources close to former President Donald Trump said Noem's recent negative attention effectively disqualified her from becoming his vice presidential running mate, calling it \"political suicide.\"\n\nBut a fundraiser in Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, Trump was recorded saying she was \"somebody that I love.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madison_hall@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Madison Hall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_(North_Korean_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader (North Korean title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiobook", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Audiobook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commander (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/6638ec2aec0c696569013ecc.jpg?ver=1715018624", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 2653, "textEnd": 2658}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

University of Notre Dame professor George Lopez told the outlet that Kim did not leave North Korea between 2011 (when he assumed the role of supreme leader) and 2018.\n\n\"I don't see any conceivable way that a single junior member of Congress without explicit escort from the U.S. State Department and military would be meeting with a leader from North Korea,\" Lopez, an expert in North Korea, told the Scout. \"What would have been so critical in his bag of tricks that he would have met with an American lawmaker, this one distinctively?\"\n\nVirginia Commonwealth University professor Benjamin Young, another North Korea expert, added that \"there's no way\" Noem met the dictator, and that he has \"never heard of Kim Jong Un meeting congressmen or congresswomen.\"\n\nNoem also wrote in her forthcoming book that she canceled a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron last year, according to the Scout. The French president's office confirmed to the outlet that they never had a meeting scheduled.\n\nShe wrote that \"the day before we were to meet he made what I considered a very pro-Hamas and anti-Israel comment to the press,\" which prompted her to \"cancel\" a meeting with Macron. His office told the Scout that while she didn't receive a \"direct invitation\" to meet with Macron, Noem could have been scheduled to attend the same event.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nOne final, less consequential anecdote shared in Noem's book -- about how she interpreted a call from Nikki Haley -- caught the attention of Politico while the outlet reviewed an advance copy.\n\nIn No Going Back, Noem recalled that while she \"was hauling a trailer full of horses\" in the summer of 2021, she learned that Haley wanted to connect with her, per Politico.\n\nNoem claimed that while they chatted, Haley -- who had served as the first female governor of South Carolina -- offered to \"be a mentor\" and said the following: \"I've heard a lot of really good things about you. But I also want you to know that if I hear something bad ... I will be sure to let you know.\"\n\nNoem then said that Haley reiterated how she would \"make sure that you know,\" per Politico, and that immediately after they got off the call, she told an assistant she was \"pretty sure I was just threatened by Nikki Haley.\"\n\n\"It was clear that she wanted me to know that there was only room for one Republican woman in the spotlight. It was weird,\" Noem wrote, according to Politico. \"Unsurprisingly, I never received any calls or 'mentoring' from her, but the message was clear. I'm the alpha female here, and you should know your place. I actually felt a little sad for her.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Haley told the outlet that the politicians spoke in 2020, not 2021, and that Haley \"has long called and written notes supporting other women when they go through challenging times.\"\n\n\"She called Governor Noem in 2020 to encourage her when she was criticized for keeping her state open during Covid,\" Haley's spokesperson added. \"How she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird.\"\n\nOn Friday, Noem's spokesperson told PEOPLE that the governors did speak in 2020, but met in 2021, and that it would be clarified in final versions of the book.\n\nAs previously reported, Noem -- once considered a top contender for Donald Trump's running mate position -- defended her decision to kill a puppy after writing about it in an excerpt for the book, first shared by The Guardian.\n\nOf her dog Cricket, whom she referred to as \"untrainable\" and \"less than worthless as a hunting dog,\" Noem later wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that the \"20 year old story\" was part of a book that included \"many honest stories of my life, good and bad days, challenges, painful decisions, and lessons learned.\"", "source": {"uri":

But she had already fallen off Trump's VP shortlist - KION546", "body": "By Daniel Strauss, Alayna Treene, Kristen Holmes and Kit Maher, CNN\n\n(CNN) -- For South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, much of the 2024 campaign cycle has turned out to be a case study in what not to do to rise into potential vice presidential contention.\n\nThat includes the latest hiccup, with the second-term South Dakota governor - once considered a top potential running mate who has since fallen off former President Donald Trump's shortlist, according to multiple Republicans with knowledge of that list - finding herself in an unwanted spotlight over questions about actions she describes in her upcoming book: \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward.\"\n\nNoem's crisis hasn't affected her standing on Trump's vice presidential candidate shortlist - sources said she had fallen off that list long before that - but it has confirmed to skeptics in Trump's orbit that she shouldn't be in consideration and won't be anytime soon.\n\nNoem's book launch has become a problem for her for multiple reasons. First, there was Noem's description of her decision to kill a 14-month-old wirehair pointer, named Cricket, who was not displaying the signs of an ideal hunting dog. The governor wrote that the dog was \"untrainable,\" according to excerpts first reported by The Guardian. She also described shooting a goat in the book.\n\nNoem has argued that those anecdotes were meant to show how capable she is of doing some of the more gruesome jobs in life when necessary.\n\nBut the Cricket episode in particular instead resulted in days of Noem having to publicly defend the decision to put the dog down. A bipartisan group of members of Congress set up a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus in a not so subtle dig to the South Dakota governor.\n\nSome Republicans came to her defense, like South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson, who acknowledged, \"Life is a little different in rural America.\"\n\nBut South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds struck a different tone: \"I don't see how it helps,\" he said Tuesday.\n\nNoem has repeatedly defended her actions this week. Appearing on Fox News Wednesday, Noem explained it was a \"very aggressive dog\" that \"massacred\" a local family's chickens and attacked her, which ultimately led her to shoot the dog in a gravel pit. She argued it was the responsible decision to protect her children and those around her business.\n\n\"Dogs that have this kind of a problem, that have been to training for months and still kill for fun, they are extremely dangerous and a responsible owner does what they need to do and what the law will allow,\" Noem said.\n\nAs many questioned why she volunteered this story in her book, Noem said it demonstrates how she doesn't run from the truth.\n\n\"What the point of the story is, is that most politicians, they will run from the truth,\" Noem said. \"They will shy away and hide from making tough decisions. I don't do either of those.\"\n\nTrump himself has privately criticized Noem about the story, a person with direct knowledge of the comments told CNN. The former president, however, appeared more dismayed that she chose to disclose the anecdote and at her faltering attempts to do damage control, than the story itself, they said.\n\nOn Thursday, the situation got worse for Noem when The Dakota Scout, an independent newspaper, reported that Noem suggested in her book that, as a member of the US House Armed Services Committee, she had met North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un. Noem, according to that excerpt, also said that she was set to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron as governor before cancelling. In both cases, the Scout reported, records indicated that Noem did not meet with Kim or have a meeting scheduled with Macron.\n\nIn another excerpt obtained by Politico, Noem described a 2021 phone call she says occurred with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley that she took as Haley trying to intimidate Noem from the national spotlight. That excerpt was first reported by Politico on Friday. A Haley spokeswoman though said that Haley called Noem in 2020, not 2021.\n\nIn response, Ian Fury, Noem's spokesperson, released a statement that these were small errors and would be changed.\n\n\"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor. Kim Jong Un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been,\" Fury said in a statement to CNN on Friday. \"The Governor spoke with Nikki Haley in 2020 and met with her in 2021. The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected.\"\n\nRepublicans have been befuddled how the book was published with these errors.\n\n\"You would hope that these sort of anecdotes would be vetted prior to the release of a book, that would typically happen in most high profile book launches, and obviously there's some orchestrated events going on here. She has several interviews set up,\" Jesse Hunt, a Republican strategist and former communications director for the Republican Governors Association, said. \"Clearly this was thought out. The advisers that she had involved didn't see it as having any problematic narratives.\"\n\nWhile at one point considered a top contender for vice president, advisers to Trump have said for weeks that Noem no longer held that standing, even before she revealed she shot her dog and before she posted a bizarre infomercial for a Texas dental practice. However, she was included on the short list that the campaign compiled for vetting, with her advisers noting that no one should be entirely ruled out given Trump's often spontaneous decision making. Despite this caveat, at least two advisers said she was currently not in the running.\n\nFor Noem, the increasing scrutiny about her book is the latest bump in an ongoing list of her attempts to raise her profile on the national stage.\n\nOn paper, Noem had all the markings of a strong contender to be Trump's running mate. For the operatives that fixate on simplistic criteria in picking a running mate, the argument behind Noem is she's an anti-abortion Republican who started out in humble means and rose to the governor's mansion. Noem has also displayed comfort in front of large crowds or a camera.\n\nAs governor of South Dakota during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, she resisted lockdowns. While speaking at a National Rifle Association event, she said that her two-year-old grandchild has multiple guns.\n\nNoem also has been deferential to Trump and the Trump movement going back to before she was elected to her current job in 2018. She was one of the earliest governors to endorse the former president in the 2024 cycle.\n\nBut her term as governor has been rocky. She's received national criticism for her opposition to any Covid-19 lockdown measures - but not by hardcore Trump loyalists. Her office has seen significant staff turnover, with seasoned operatives leaving and Noem bringing in more controversial ones - like former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Noem has faced ethics complaints in South Dakota for inappropriately using her office to help her daughter with a real estate appraiser's license. And more recently, she was banned from some tribal lands in her home state over comments the governor made about tribal leaders focusing more on benefiting from drug cartels than their children.\n\nThroughout it all, Noem has sought to boost her national profile. Early in the 2024 cycle, she set up a federal political action committee - a time honored move that future candidates for high office make. Noem has also had her political operation air ads on national television to highlight her state's economy. In March, Noem opted to star in a near five-minute informercial for a dental practice based in Texas.\n\nAt one point, some of these moves seemed to be working. But that was long before the public learned about Cricket or the unnamed goat.\n\n\"He soured on her long before this,\" a person close to Trump, who has spoken with the former president about his potential vice presidential contenders, told CNN.\n\n\"He has questioned some of her choices. But where they may have been lingering questions over whether she could find herself back on the list, this story has killed that. It is totally disqualifying,\" they added, referencing the story about how she killed her 14-month-old dog.\n\nTrump has often mentioned Noem in both private and public as a loyal supporter. The former president was particularly pleased after her August 2023 television appearance affirming her decision that she would not be running for president in 2024.\n\nNoem is still set to appear at a big fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago this weekend, alongside other potential vice presidential picks for Trump. She's also slated to headline a fundraiser in Jefferson County in Colorado on Saturday, according to The Denver Post. That's a schedule a top tier Republican would have if they were in strong contention to be Trump's running mate. But the last few weeks and months have cast strong doubt among Republicans about Noem's viability.\n\n\"You need to be skilled at defending Trump and the campaign but she's having trouble defending herself in her own book,\" said Matt Gorman, a veteran Republican strategist.\n\nStill, Gorman stressed that it's important for Noem to attend the Mar-a-Lago spring retreat.\n\n\"I think it's important to go because one thing that's important to remember is if you don't like the current headline, make a new one. So going to Mar-a-Lago, if I were giving her team advice, it'd be be very visible. The worst thing you can do is hideout and let the headlines overtake you. You want to create headlines as much as you can, create your own news, your own content.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" Ms Noem wrote in the book.\n\n\"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all). Dealing with foreign leaders takes resolve, preparation and determination. My experiences on those many foreign trips made me a better member of Congress and a stronger governor. It allowed me to hone my deal-making skills, which play a crucial role in leadership.\"\n\nMs Noem served on the House Armed Services Committee from 2013-2015 - and visited China in 2014. However, there is no record of Kim being in China at that time, according to The Dakota Scout.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2018, Mr Kim did not leave North Korea, according to University of Notre Dame professor and North Korea expert George Lopez.\n\n\"I don't see any conceivable way that a single junior member of Congress without explicit escort from the U.S. State Department and military would be meeting with a leader from North Korea,\" Mr Lopez said.\n\n\"What would have been so critical in his bag of tricks that he would have met with an American lawmaker, this one distinctively?\"\n\nBenjamin Young, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University and an expert on North Korea, told The Dakota Scout that Ms Noem's account of meeting Kim was \"dubious.\"\n\n\"I cover North Korea very closely, and I have never heard of Kim Jong Un meeting congressmen or congresswomen,\" Mr Young said.\n\nAside from claiming she met with Kim Jong Un, she also wrote that in 2023, she had a meeting set up with French President Emmanuel Macron but it was canceled.\n\n\"While in Paris, I was slated to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron,\" Ms Noem wrote in the book. \"However, the day before we were to meet he made what I considered a very pro-Hamas and anti-Israel comment to the press. So, I decided to cancel. There is no place for pro-Hamas rhetoric.\"\n\nPresident Macron's office confirmed to The Dakota Scout that Ms Noem did not receive a \"direct invitation\" from the French president.\n\nMs Noem was in Paris for a political conference at the time, and spoke on 10 November, the same day that Macron called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nIn a statement to The Dakota Scout, Ms Noem's office said that she does not discuss her meetings with foreign leaders.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Governor Noem's office for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication.\n\nEarlier this week, Ms Noem made an attempt to explain putting down their family's 14-month-old \"working dog\" Cricket during an appearance on Fox News.\n\nShe blamed the \"fake news\" media for stirring up controversy after she wrote that she killed the animal after a pair of incidents in a single day, where the dog ruined a pheasant hunt by chasing the birds, then \"massacred\" a neighbour's chickens.\n\nDuring an interview with Sean Hannity on Wednesday, she tried to blame the media for the attention the incident was receiving.\n\n\"Well, Sean, you know how the fake news works. They leave out some or most of the facts of a story, they put the worst spin on it. And that's what's happened in this case,\" Ms Noem told Hannity.\n\n\"I hope people really do buy this book and they find out the truth of the story because the truth of the story is that this was a working dog and it was not a puppy. It was a dog that was extremely dangerous.\"\n\nMs Noem has spent the past week in damage control mode over the dog-killing story. She has been pilloried by political commentators, Democrats, and anti-Trump Republicans. One Trump ally speculated the anecdote has ruined her once-serious chances of becoming Donald Trump's running mate.\n\n\"The reason it's in the book is because this book is filled with tough, challenging decisions I've had to make throughout my life,\" she also told Hannity.\n\n\"The point of this story is most politicians, they will run from the truth, they will shy away and hide from making tough decisions. I don't do either of those.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un",

But Did She Meet Kim Jong-un?", "body": "\"I've met with many, many world leaders; I've traveled around the world. I should not have put that anecdote in the book, and at my request, they have removed it.\" -- South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, speaking about an anecdote in her book describing a meeting with Kim Jong-un\n\nCricket who? The news of Noem shooting her 14-month-old dog in a gravel pit is old hat. Instead, the book prerelease scandal catching more attention over the past few days has been Noem's anecdote about meeting with the North Korean dictator.\n\n\"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" Noem writes in her book about her time on the House Armed Services Committee. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all). Dealing with foreign leaders takes resolve, preparation, and determination.\"\n\nThe issue with this anecdote is that the meeting doesn't appear to have happened. Kim never had an opportunity to estimate her one way or another. Those born yesterday will be shocked to learn that Noem's compendium of veepstakes-timed fluff was written by a ghostwriter, on whom Noem's spokesperson Ian Fury initially laid part of the blame.\n\n\"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book No Going Back has two small errors ... This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor. Kim Jong-un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been,\" Fury said.\n\nHe shouldn't have been included because ... the meeting did not happen? Yes/no? Strangely, Noem, across a series of interviews, refuses to answer this question. One axle of the bus has already passed over the ghostwriter; why not finish the job? She could just say that she and the ghostwriter got lost in [crosstalk], and that she was really referring to meeting the dictator Barack Obama, for example. Instead, she repeats versions of the pablum highlighted at the top.\n\nHere is the relevant vignette from CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday, in conversation with host Margaret Brennan.\n\nNoem posted on social media afterward that Brennan had interrupted her too much during their interview. She then went on another CBS morning news show on Monday, where this same repetition of \"many, many world leaders\" occurred a couple more times, for good measure.\n\nTo avoid answering the question straightforwardly, Noem is attempting to put on airs of that's classified or this is a national security matter without quite saying so, because that would be absurd. In her interview with Brennan, she does confirm that she visited the Korean Demilitarized Zone and that there are \"specifics I'm willing to share.\" On the other hand, she says, \"there's some specifics I'm not willing to share with you.\" She's spinning the \"error\" her spokesperson had conceded, then, into something different. It's not that she didn't meet Kim Jong-un at all, but that access to that information, one way or another, was always above the readers' pay grade.\n\nThis is silly!\n\nAs for other developments on the Kristi Noem Book front ...\n\n* Dogs: Kristi Noem wants Joe Biden's dog Commander dead, too. (Slate nervously tugs its collar.) \"What would I do if I was president on the first day in office in 2025?\" Noem reportedly writes in her book. \"Thanks for asking. I happen to have a list. The first thing I'd do is make sure Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds ('Commander, say hello to Cricket for me').\" Rooting for dogs to join each other in hell -- could this book be good?\n\n* Manny Macron: Noem says she canceled a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron last year after he said something \"very pro-Hamas.\" Macron's office says that they never had a direct meeting scheduled, but that there's a chance they were supposed to bump into each other somewhere. Or maybe the meeting was classified!\n\n* Nikki Haley: Another episode involves a conversation Noem had with Nikki Haley (BOO!) in 2021. Noem argues that Haley threatened her in a phone call. Noem recalls Haley telling her twice in that phone call that \"I've heard many good things about you. But when I do hear bad things, I will make sure that you know.\" I don't understand either what Haley was saying here, or why Noem was threatened by it. The main thing to keep in mind is that Haley became a MAGA villain during the production of this book, so it was important to throw in some sort of dig at her.\n\nThe upshot of all of this is that Kristi Noem is not going to be your next vice president -- and hasn't really been a contender since before this funny book saga, anyway.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_newell@slate.com", "name": "Jim Newell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ghostwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sketch comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commander (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korean Demilitarized Zone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slate (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/9fe58c0a-c393-4dc0-b3ed-aabff7d8fb5c.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Kristi L. Noem (R) on Sunday acknowledged that she was removing a claim that she met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un from her forthcoming book and continued to defend her decision to kill a dog.\n\nThe biographical book, \"No Going Back,\" is set to be released Tuesday and has caused controversy on multiple fronts as Noem positions herself as a possible running mate for former president Donald Trump.\n\nNoem's office said Friday it was working to correct some errors ahead of publication, including a passage claiming that Kim, a reclusive dictator, was one of the world leaders she met with as a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015.\n\n\"As soon as this was brought to my attention, I certainly made some changes and looked at this passage,\" Noem said Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"I've met with many, many world leaders. I've traveled around the world. As soon as it was brought to my attention, we went forward and made some edits.\"\n\nNoem did not directly say whether she ever met with Kim. She emphasized she has met with \"many\" world leaders and said she would not discuss specific meetings.\n\nNoem, a farmer and rancher, was already under scrutiny for the dog-killing anecdote, in which she describes shooting and killing her 14-month-old wirehair pointer, Cricket, because the dog was \"untrainable\" and aggressive. After the excerpt came out late last month, Noem drew a wave of scorn from Democrats and other political figures, including President Biden's reelection campaign.\n\nNoem suggested Sunday she did not regret sharing the story, saying the book is \"filled with vulnerable, painful moments in my life, filled with times where I've made very difficult decisions.\"\n\n\"As a mom, I made a choice between protecting my children and protecting them from a dangerous animal that was killing livestock and attacking people,\" Noem said.\n\nThe host, Margaret Brennan, pressed Noem further by saying that her book describes how \"you'd make sure Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds. 'Commander, say hello to Cricket,'\" alluding that Biden's family dog, Commander, should face the same fate as Cricket.\n\nCommander has bitten Secret Service agents about 24 times, according to records released earlier this year, and was sent away from the White House last year.\n\n\"Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people,\" Noem said. \"So how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog?\"\n\nAsked if she was suggesting Commander should be shot, too, Noem replied \"that the president should be accountable to\" answer that question.\n\nThe uproar over the dog-killing story has fueled speculation that Noem's chances of being Trump's running mate have dwindled. She was among several possible vice-presidential candidates whom Trump hosted at a fundraising retreat this weekend in Florida.\n\nThe book's initial reviews include one from Trump that calls it a \"winner.\"\n\nAsked if Trump mentioned the response to her book, Noem responded: \"Oh, he certainly knows about this book, and I appreciate his endorsement of it.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_svitek@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Patrick Svitek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_(North_Korean_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader (North Korean title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://thumb.spokesman.com/-_SOCwyUp5A65MU55s8IZoZenks=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2024/05/05/6637facc313fa.hires.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Kristi Noem refused Monday to reveal whether she instructed her forthcoming book's ghostwriter to write that she had met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un -- despite no evidence such a meeting ever took place and the fact that such a claim would certainly be fact-checked upon publication.\n\n\"I specifically have worked on policy for over 30 years and over that time, I have traveled around the world and I have met with leaders around the world,\" Noem, 52, told \"CBS Mornings.\"\n\nThe Republican also refused to say once again whether or not she actually met with the pariah state's leader, simply saying: \"I should not have put that anecdote in the book.\"\n\nMultiple outlets, including The Post, reported last week on Noem's claim in her tome \"No Going Back\" to have greeted Kim while a member of the House Armed Services Committee between 2013 and 2015.\n\nNoem visited US ally South Korea as part of a delegation organized by then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) in April 2014, but there are no records of her -- or any legislator -- ever traveling to the American adversary to the North. (Kim is not known to have left North Korea for official or unofficial visits during the period when Noem said she met with him.)\n\nThe governor has also ducked questions about why or how she didn't catch the glaring mistake -- if indeed that's what it was -- while recording the audiobook of \"No Going Back.\"\n\n\"I'm not talking about that meeting. I'm not talking about my meeting with world leaders,\" she insisted Monday. \"There are some that are in the book and then there's some that's [sic] not in the book -- many of them actually.\"\n\nIn a galley copy seen by The Post, Noem reflected on the supposed meeting with Kim, writing: \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nIn a Sunday interview with CBS' \"Face The Nation,\" Noem tried a different explanation, telling moderator Margaret Brennan that \"I went to the DMZ [demilitarized zone]. And there are details in this book that talk about going to the DMZ and specifics that I'm willing to share.\"\n\nThe DMZ is a heavily fortified 160-mile-long buffer that divides North and South Korea, but visiting the area is not the same as setting foot in the Hermit Kingdom.\n\nNoem also tried again Monday to address the controversy about her shooting a 14-month-old puppy roughly two decades ago, another of the notorious episodes outlined in the book.\n\n\"Oh, I love dogs. Yeah, I have a dear dog named Foster right now that goes everywhere with me,\" Noem declared.\n\n\"The purpose of telling the story was so that people would know I don't pass my responsibilities onto anybody else,\" she added when asked why she didn't simply give the dog away. \"It was extremely hard for me and that's clear when you read the story.\"\n\nThe South Dakota Republican explained Cricket, a wirehaired pointer, had been very aggressive, prompting concerns for the safety of her children.\n\n\"I hated that dog,\" Noem recalled in a book excerpt previewed by The Guardian. \"[Cricket was] dangerous to anyone she came in contact with.\"\n\nLater, Noem described shooting a \"disgusting, musky, rancid\" smelling family goat that she said would accost her kids and knock them down\n\n\"My political opponents have tried to use this story against me in previous campaigns. I want people to know the truth. And that's why I put that in this book,\" Noem claimed Monday.\n\nOn Sunday, Noem had evaded a question about what she meant in the book when she wrote that President Biden's nippy former dog Commander should \"say hello to\" Cricket.\n\n\"How many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog?\" she asked aloud while refraining from outright calling for Commander's execution.\n\nThe first dog, who is believed to have bitten dozens of people and drawn blood from a Secret Service agent, was given to Biden relatives, the White House announced in February.\n\nNoem's name had been tossed around as a potential vice presidential contender, only for Trump campaign sources to tell The Post she had \"no shot\" after revealing the story of Cricket in the book.\n\n\"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" is slated to hit bookshelves Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com",

Kristi Noem was in political freefall Friday as embarrassing revelations continued to emerge from the scrutiny of advance copies of her memoir, which doesn't officially publish until Tuesday.\n\nNoem was already reeling from near-universal backlash against her disclosure in the book that she shot and killed a dog named Cricket and a billy goat years ago -- the dog for its failures on a hunting excursion and its attacks on a neighbor's chickens, and the goat for chasing after Noem's children and smelling bad.\n\nThursday and Friday, news emerged from outlets including Politico and The Dakota Scout of inaccuracies in Noem's book, the title of which -- \"No Going Back\" -- is now ripe with irony. The most glaring inaccuracy is Noem's recounting of a meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress -- a meeting that never happened.\n\n\"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" Noem wrote. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nThe Dakota Scout published a story Thursday casting doubt on the meeting. Noem's spokesman, Ian Fury, eventually said the anecdote was one of \"two small errors\" in the book that were the fault of others.\n\n\"This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor,\" Fury said, according to the Scout. \"Kim Jong Un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been.\"\n\nYet there seems to be no way Noem could've been unaware of the errors. She's been promoting the book for weeks, there is no other writer credited in the book besides her, and she's already voiced an audio version of the book.\n\nThe Scout also questioned Noem's anecdote in the book about canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron over Noem's dislike of his comments about the Israeli-Hamas war. The French president's office released a statement that Macron had never extended a \"direct invitation\" to Noem for a meeting, the Scout reported, but the office left open the possibility that the two could have been scheduled to attend the same event.\n\nPolitico reported on a story Noem related in the book about a 2021 conversation with former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. Noem wrote that Haley, who would go on to unsuccessfully seek the Republican presidential nomination this election season, \"threatened\" Noem politically. A spokesperson for Haley told Politico that Haley had called to encourage Noem, and \"how she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird.\"\n\nPolitico also reported that a Colorado county Republican group canceled a Saturday fundraiser Noem was scheduled to headline, after the group received death threats and information about a planned protest related to Noem's treatment of animals.\n\nReacting to the cascade of negative news, political science professor Jon Schaff of Northern State University in Aberdeen said Noem's short-term national ambitions \"have been weakened, considerably.\" Until recently, Noem had been widely considered to be a potential running mate for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.\n\nBut Schaff said it's too early to tell what it all means for Noem long-term. He said she is popular in South Dakota, and it would be naive to count her out in future races, such as a U.S. Senate race in the eventuality of a retirement by Sen. John Thune or Sen. Mike Rounds. Thune is 63 years old, Rounds is 69 and Noem is 52.\n\n\"Rounds and Thune won't be there forever,\" Schaff said.\n\nMeanwhile, Dan Ahlers, executive director of the South Dakota Democratic Party, said the negative news is unlikely to end Noem's career, given that past scandals have not seemed to hurt her. Those scandals have included published allegations of an affair with former Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski, accusations of misusing the state airplane, and allegedly intervening to help her daughter earn a real estate appraiser's license.\n\n\"These things don't end any of these Republican politicians' careers anymore,\" Ahlers said. \"They end up raising more money and smelling like roses.\"\n\nNoem went on \"Hannity\" on Fox News on Wednesday and blamed \"fake news\" for the fallout from the dog and goat stories. Sunday, she's scheduled to appear on \"Face the Nation\" on CBS.\n\n\"We'll get into the controversies surrounding her upcoming memoir,\" said a Friday tweet from the show.", "source": {"uri":

I didn't ask anybody to take that responsibility for me.\"\n\nNoem's latest justification for fatally shooting Cricket at her farm - an act chronicled in her upcoming memoir No Going Back and first reported by the Guardian - comes as fellow Republicans have all but written off her chances of being chosen as Donald Trump's running mate.\n\nA Guardian review of South Dakota state law found Noem may have committed misdemeanors by failing to control Cricket and by killing the animal on her own property. A spokesperson has not responded to inquiries on that point, which many advocates against animal cruelty have also raised.\n\nRemarkably, Cricket was only one of two animals Noem says she shot on the same day. On Sunday, the CBS host Margaret Brennan asked Noem to address her admission that, after Cricket, she also shot dead an un-castrated goat, which \"smelled\" and chased children around Noem's farm. In No Going Back, the chapter that recounts the episode is entitled \"Bad Day to be a Goat\".\n\nBrennan noted that Noem's book also contains the phrase, \"Commander, say hello to Cricket\" - a reference to Joe Biden's dog, who was removed from the White House after biting or otherwise assailing Secret Service agents.\n\n\"How do you justify that?\" Brennan said to Noem of her decision to kill the goat. \"How was the goat a threat? And I'm asking you this because it seems like you're celebrating the killing of the animals?\"\n\nNoem replied that political opponents know the story of the goat's killing well and have tried to leverage it against her, so she simply wanted \"the truth to be out there\".\n\n\"These animals were attacking,\" Noem said. \"We live on a farm and a ranch and ... tough decisions are made many times, and it is - it is to protect people.\"\n\nNoem obliquely acknowledged that - ahead of her book's release Tuesday - she had to retract an anecdote about meeting the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un because the encounter never happened.\n\nIn her book, Noem claims she was \"underestimated\" by Kim, but trumpets her experience of \"staring down little tyrants\", from her work as a religious pastor ministering to children.\n\nThe Dakota Scout newspaper reported how Noem's account of meeting Kim was unlikely, and her spokesperson subsequently told journalists a correction was forthcoming. On Sunday, Noem said \"this anecdote shouldn't have been in the book, and as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that that was adjusted\".\n\n\"When the book is released, we'll do all that we can to see that - that that is reflected,\" Noem said.\n\nPressed on the retraction, Noem made comments suggesting that she could no longer hear the host.\n\n\"Hello? I'm sorry, I ... \" the former congresswoman said, as Brennan asked why she had not caught the error as she recorded the audio book of the memoir.\n\nYet Noem answered seamlessly when Brennan finished the question, saying: \"As soon as it was brought to my attention, I took action to make sure that it was reflected.\"\n\nNoem insisted: \"I've met with many, many world leaders - I've traveled around the world.\"\n\nBut she also said she was no longer interested in delving into details about such audiences.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk to you about those personal meetings,\" Noem said. \"OK? I'm just not going to have that conversation.\"\n\nHer CBS interview occurred after Trump called some of those on his VP shortlist to the stage at a private donor retreat in Florida over the weekend, NBC reported.

Noem later doubled down on the controversy, saying the decision to kill the farm dog because it was \"untrainable\" was proof of her tough political acumen and how she has never \"passed on my responsibilities to anyone\" even if they are \"hard and painful.\"\n\nIn the wake of the extracts about killing her dog, online betting companies have slashed Noem's chances of being Trump's running mate, with reports suggesting the former president has repeatedly criticized the South Dakota governor for talking about why she killed her pet more than 20 years ago.\n\nPolymarket, a platform where users can place \"yes\" or \"no\" bets on the likelihood of world events, placed Noem as the second favorite to be Trump's next running in late April, giving her a 10 percent chance. In the wake of the dog killing controversy, these odds have since been dramatically reduced to just a 2 percent chance, with Noem at risk of falling out of Polymarket's top 10 shortlist of candidates altogether.\n\nElsewhere, former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich recently suggested that Noem \"killing the dog and then writing about it ended any possibility of her being picked as VP.\"\n\nThere have also been reports in Rolling Stone, not verified by Newsweek, that Trump has been frequently \"disgusted\" by Noem writing about shooting her dog and suggesting that she has a poor grasp of \"public relations.\"\n\nThe report, citing unmanned sources, also claims Trump has been specifically asking \"why would she do that?\" and \"what is wrong with her?\" with regards to Noem writing about killing her dog.\n\nTrump's and Noem's offices have been contacted for comment via email.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Noem's upcoming book No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward did not end with the story about killing her dog.\n\nMore recently, Noem's team admitted that a passage of the book where the she discussed meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while she served in the House Armed Services Committee during her time as a congresswoman did not occur.\n\n\"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" Noem wrote. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nNoem's spokesperson Ian Fury has since said that the passage about meeting the North Korea leader is inaccurate and will be removed from the book.\n\n\"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book No Going Back has two small errors,\" Fury told The New York Times. \"This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor. Kim Jong-un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been.\"\n\nThe second error involves a conversation between Noem and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. Fury said a passage will be amended to reflect the tone of the talk, and state that it happened in 2020, not 2021 as suggested in the book, according to Politico.\n\nIn a recent interview on CBS' Face the Nation, Noem dismissed the criticisms against her from GOP figures such as Gingrich while once again defending her actions.\n\n\"I would say about Republicans criticizing me, these are the same Republicans that criticized me during COVID. They criticized me when I've made other decisions in South Dakota to protect my state,\" Noem said. \"My state today is extremely happy and thriving.\n\n\"This was a dangerous animal that was killing livestock and attacking people. And I had little children at the time,\" she added. \"Our operation had many kids running around and people in interaction with the public. And I made a difficult choice.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ewan_palmer@newsweek.com", "name": "Ewan Palmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Dakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Going_Back_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "No Going Back (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newt_Gingrich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newt Gingrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghostwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2388406/donald-trump-kristi-noem.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=2b12b99152869f9802c7edf30b771287", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Lopez, a North Korea expert and professor at the University of Notre Dame, told The Dakota Scout, which first reported on Noem's questionable Kim claim.\n\n\"There's no way,\" Benjamin Young, another prominent observer of North Korea and an assistant professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, told the outlet. \"There's no way.\"\n\nNoem also raised eyebrows among veteran North Korea watchers by referring to Kim as \"president,\" when his formal title is \"chairman.\"\n\nWhen contacted by The Post Thursday, Noem spokesman Ian Fury initially said the governor \"will not be discussing the details of her meetings with world leaders,\"\n\n\"If she wanted to share those, she would have outlined them in the book,\" he added.\n\nSeveral hours later, Fury sent an additional response, saying that Noem's publisher \"will be addressing conflated world leaders' names in the book before it is released.\"\n\nIn addition to Kim, Noem said she had met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Jordan's King Abdullah II, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nThe latest controversy comes less than a week after Noem all but killed her chances at becoming former President Donald Trump's 2024 running mate by admitting in the same book that she executed a 14-month-old dog named Cricket that Noem says she \"hated\" in part because it was \"untrainable\" as a hunting dog.\n\nWhile Trump has not spoken publicly about Noem's claims, she faced fierce backlash from Republicans and Democrats alike when the news broke.", "source": {"uri":

I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\" In fact, Politico reports that Noem never actually met with Un, and you don't just have to take the \"fake news\" media's word for it. A spokesman for Noem basically admitted as much, telling Politico, \"We've been made aware that the publisher will be addressing conflated world leaders' names in the book before it is released.\"\n\nAnd that's not the only story being called into question. Noem also claims that in 2021, former ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley called to offer mentorship, and then threatened her. According to Politico, Noem recounts telling an aide, \"I'm pretty sure I was just threatened by Nikki Haley. It was clear that she wanted me to know that there was only room for one Republican woman in the spotlight.\" Noem writes that \"the message was clear. I'm the alpha female here, and you should know your place.\"\n\nExcept, according to a spokesperson for Haley, the then ambassador implied no such thing. \"Nikki has long called and written notes supporting other women when they go through challenging times,\" Chaney Denton told Politico, also noting that Noem got the year of their phone call wrong. \"She called Governor Noem in 2020 to encourage her when she was criticized for keeping her state open during COVID. How she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird.\" Noem's spokesman, Ian Fury, clarified to The Hill that the call took place in 2020 and the two met in 2021.

Kristi Noem is releasing a new book called \"No Going Back,\" but on Friday her office said she would actually be going back to correct some errors -- including a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe Republican governor's new book was part of an overt effort to be selected as a running mate for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but it has already faced bipartisan backlash for a story of how she once shot her hunting dog. Then, after scrutiny of her descriptions of meetings with international leaders, her spokesperson Ian Fury said in a statement that it was an error to include Kim in a list of world leaders who Noem has met -- and the publisher would correct any future editions of the book.\n\nPeople are also reading...

She writes about canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAfter The Dakota Scout first reported Noem's descriptions of the meetings, Fury said that the book \"has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nIn addition to the meeting with Kim, Fury said Noem also mistook the dates in which she spoke with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury added.\n\nIn a section of the book about meeting with international leaders, Noem writes: \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders -- some who wanted our help, and some who didn't.\n\n\"I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" she writes. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor after all).\"\n\nThe description of such a meeting was quickly challenged and described as implausible by experts on U.S.-North Korea relations. When Noem was a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015, relations between the two countries were tense and a congressional delegation meeting with Kim would have generated considerable awareness, said Syd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on the relationship with North Korea.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and was not notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.\n\nNoem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nIn the book, Noem also writes that she was \"slated to meet with\" Macron in November last year while she was in Paris for a conference of European conservative leaders, but canceled when he made comments that she considered \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, Macron's office told The Associated Press that no \"direct invitation\" had been made for Noem to meet the French president, though it did not rule out that she may have been invited to a Paris event that he was also scheduled to attend.\n\nFury said, \"The governor was invited to sit in President Macron's box for the Armistice Day Parade at Arc de Triomphe. Following his anti-Israel comments, she chose to cancel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noem is trying to fend off the backlash for writing about shooting her dog as well as a goat.\n\n\"Don't believe the #fakenews media's twisted spin,\" she posted on the social platform X this week. \"I had a choice between the safety of my children and an animal who had a history of attacking people & killing livestock.\"\n\nHer spokesperson, Fury, also cast scrutiny of the errors in Noem's book as biased, saying, \"The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge.\"\n\nStill, members of Congress have poked fun at Noem, with Reps. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Florida; Susan Wild, a Democrat from Pennsylvania; and Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina; launching a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus this week.\n\nMoskowitz said on X that one of the group's rules was \"you cannot kill a puppy.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Credit - Kamil Krzaczy\u0144ski -- Getty Images, Vladimir Smirnov -- Getty Images\n\nSouth Dakota Governor Kristi Noem reportedly wrote in her new memoir that she met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un -- but her spokesperson is later quoted as having said the statement was an \"error.\"\n\nIn No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward, Noem wrote that she met the North Korean leader while she was in Congress as South Dakota's representative, according to news outlets which obtained a copy of the book ahead of its publication on May 7. The Dakota Scout reported the news on May 2, which was then picked up by other outlets.\n\n\"I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders -- some who wanted our help, and some who didn't,\" the New York Times quoted Noem as writing. \"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all). Dealing with foreign leaders takes resolve, preparation, and determination.\"\n\nAfter doubt was cast upon this account, Noem's spokesperson Ian Fury told the Dakota Scout that the book's publisher would be \"addressing conflated world leaders' names in the book.\" Fury was then quoted telling other news outlets that the North Korean leader was mentioned in error.\n\n\"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors,\" Fury told the New York Times. \"This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor. Kim Jong Un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been.\"\n\nTIME reached out to Noem's office, campaign, spokespeople, and publisher about the report.\n\nRead More: Kristi Noem Faces Backlash After Admitting to Killing Her Dog\n\nNoem was widely considered to be a Vice President contender for presidential candidate Donald Trump, having spoken at his rallies and publicly pledged her support for the former President. However, CNN reported on May 4 that she had \"fallen off\" the shortlist before her book controversies took center stage.\n\nThe Governor was already facing criticism for another part of her new memoir in which she admitted to shooting dead her 14-month-old dog Cricket after she said the \"untrainable\" canine ruined a hunt, killed another family's chickens, and moved to bite her. She also killed a goat. The admissions were first reported by the Guardian.\n\nNoem has since defended herself. In one post on X (formerly Twitter) she said: \"I can understand why some people are upset about a 20 year old story of Cricket, one of the working dogs at our ranch, in my upcoming book -- No Going Back.\"\n\n\"The fact is, South Dakota law states that dogs who attack and kill livestock can be put down. Given that Cricket had shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did,\" she later continued in the same post. \"Whether running the ranch or in politics, I have never passed on my responsibilities to anyone else to handle.

Kristi Noem spent Sunday morning trying to redirect questions about her forthcoming memoir to its main themes, rather than explain why she had to go back and revise the much-discussed \"No Going Back.\"\n\nThe book, which Noem described Sunday as a \"how-to guide\" for people who want to make their voices heard, first came under fire after a grisly excerpt about an incident in which Noem shot and killed her 14-month-old wirehair pointer, Cricket, for misbehaving sparked backlash across the board.\n\nLater, it emerged in a report from the Dakota Scout that the memoir also included an unlikely -- and seemingly inaccurate -- anecdote about the time Noem met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un while serving as a back-bencher in Congress. On Sunday, Noem acknowledged that the book had to be corrected before its imminent release, but declined to say that she never met the North Korean leader.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I'm just not going to do that. This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book and as soon as it was brought to my attention I made sure that that was adjusted,\" Noem said during an interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" The book is due to be released Tuesday.\n\n\"There are details in this book that talk about going to the [demilitarized zone] and specifics I'm willing to share. There's some specifics I'm not willing to share with you,\" Noem added later when pressed by CBS' Margaret Brennan.\n\nNoem insisted that her book offered ideas on how America could move forward under Donald Trump's leadership. But once floated as a possible running mate for Trump, Noem's odds in the veepstakes seem to have disintegrated -- though the reasons extend beyond the messy memoir rollout.\n\nShe's held firm in her decisions depicted in the book, pitching the killing of Cricket as a sign she's willing to make difficult choices.\n\n\"This dog was a working dog and had come from a family that had issues with this dog and I had put months and months of training into this dog. This dog had gone to other trainers as well,\" Noem said Sunday.\n\n\"So all of that is the facts of the story, and all of that shows that when you put someone in a position where they have to make a decision and they want to protect their family and protect children and other people from getting attacked from an animal that has attacked others and killed livestock that's the choice I made over 20 years ago. And that I didn't ask somebody else to take that responsibility for me.\"\n\nCricket reportedly isn't the only pup that faced Noem's ire in the book. Noem also criticized President Joe Biden's dog, Commander, who was in the doghouse earlier this year after it emerged that he had bit Secret Service agents dozens of times.\n\n\"Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people, so how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog and what to do with it?\" Noem said.\n\nNoem also sparred with Brennan, accusing the CBS reporter of interrupting her and treating her \"differently\" than other guests that have previously come on the show. It's an argument Noem made earlier this weekend during a Palm Beach donor retreat.\n\n\"Listen, going through hard things, and I've been through a few of them -- I'm going through one right now, I mean they're just attacking me like crazy right now,\" Noem said according to audio obtained by POLITICO.\n\nAs for the book: \"This book is a powerful book, it's an honest book. It's an honest book of a blueprint for America about what citizens can do to take their country back,\" Noem maintained in her CBS interview.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_(North_Korean_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader (North Korean title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demilitarized_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demilitarized zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Kristi Noem speaks to members of the public at a town hall in Mitchell on March 13, 2024. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)\n\nKristi Noem owes South Dakotans an explanation for the embarrassment she's caused herself and the state.\n\nThe Republican governor has not yet told us how or why she included a false story in her forthcoming book about meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nMargaret Brennan of \"Face the Nation\" pressed Noem for an answer Sunday on CBS.\n\nNoem replied, \"This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book, and as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that that was adjusted.\"\n\nSo Noem would have us believe that she didn't know until last week -- when The Dakota Scout broke the story -- that her own memoir falsely claimed she had met one of the world's most notorious dictators.\n\nThe relevant portion of the book isn't a passing mention of Kim's name. It's a full-on boast.\n\n\"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" Noem wrote. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nHow could such a passage be included without Noem's knowledge, when she's the only credited author? South Dakotans aren't as dumb as she apparently thinks we look, so we can deduce three possibilities:\n\nWe can rule out the third possibility, because we know Noem read her own manuscript. Prior to anyone else reading it, she posted social media videos of herself narrating the audiobook.\n\nThat leaves two explanations: She lied, or she's incompetent. When those are the only answers, it's no wonder she avoids the question.\n\nNoem's other starring television role this weekend was on \"Saturday Night Live\" -- but not as the host. Instead, she was the butt of several jokes about another portion of her book, in which she disclosed that she fatally shot a hunting dog and a billy goat.\n\nThe show's focus on Noem made it abundantly clear that she's the main object of ridicule in the country right now. That's no small feat while a former president is on trial for allegedly falsifying business records to cover up hush-money payments to a porn star.\n\nThe governor's shocking fall is an abrupt flip of the script for South Dakotans, after Noem and her enablers spent the past few years promoting her rising political fame as a boon to the state.\n\nNow South Dakotans can only wait to see how far Noem might drag down the state's reputation before she hits rock bottom. With the book not even scheduled to be released until Tuesday -- all the damage so far has arisen from advance copies -- who knows what further humiliation might be in store.\n\nNoem intended the book's title, \"No Going Back,\" as a rallying cry for her plans to move the country forward. Instead, it now stands as a sadly ironic reference to a turning point in her career.\n\nBut the title isn't the only ironic part of the book. Its 200-plus pages include pronouncements by Noem that \"excuses are not accepted\" in her state, and that \"we need truth from our leaders.\"\n\nPerhaps Noem should take her own advice by dropping the excuses, telling the truth about why the false Kim Jong Un anecdote is in her book, and saving what little dignity she and her state have left.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_(North_Korean_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader (North Korean title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republican_(Springfield,_Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scouting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Town hall meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiobook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audiobook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_dakota_searchlight_articles_601/c7901e6f14bd707bbee537de20067c7d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-03-", "textStart": 92, "textEnd": 100}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Now It's Running Out of Money\n\nAfter shooting her own dog, Kristi Noem now seems to be gunning for Joe Biden's pooch, Commander. In a trainwreck of an interview, Noem defended a passage where she seems to suggest Commander should be shot. She also defended her decision to remove a part of the book where she falsely claimed she met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nFace the Nation host Margaret Brennan confronted the South Dakota governor about a previously unreported passage of her upcoming book -- No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward -- where Noem claimed that Biden's dog, Commander, should meet her own deceased pup, Cricket -- presumably in the afterlife. In the book, Noem wrote that she shot Cricket because she \"hated\" the 14-month-old dog who she called \"dangerous,\" \"untrainable,\" and \"less than worthless as a hunting dog\" after Cricket allegedly killed some chickens and moved to bite Noem.\n\n\"At the end of the book, you say the very first thing you would do if you got to the White House that was different from Joe Biden is that you'd make sure 'Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds. Commander, say hello to Cricket.' Are you doing this to try to look tough?\" Brennan asked.\n\n\"Well, number one, Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people,\" Noem said. \"So how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog and what to do with it?\"\n\n\"Well he's not living at the White House anymore,\" Brennan interjected. Commander was removed from the White House and sent to live with other members of the Biden family after the German Shepherd bit Secret Service personnel on at least 24 occasions.\n\n\"That's a question that the president should be held accountable to,\" Noem replied.\n\n\"You're saying [Commander] should be shot?\" Brennan asked incredulously.\n\n\"That's what the president should be accountable to. What is the number?\" Noem said.\n\nIn another embarrassing exchange for Noem, Brennan asked about a passage in the book where the governor falsely claimed she met Kim Jong Un. \"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" Noem wrote in the book. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\n\"Did you meet Kim Jong Un?\" Brennan asked Noem.\n\n\"Well, as soon as this was brought to my attention, I certainly made some changes and looked at this passage, and I've met with many, many world leaders,\" Noem said. \"I've traveled around the world. As soon as it was brought to my attention, we went forward and have made some edits. So I'm glad that this book is being released in a couple of days, and that those edits will be in place, and that people will have the updated version.\"\n\n\"So you did not meet with Kim Jong Un? That's what you're saying,\" Brennan clarified.\n\n\"No, I've met with many, many world leaders, many world leaders,\" Noem said. \"I've traveled around the world... I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders, I'm just not going to do that. This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book, and as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that that was adjusted.\"\n\nNoem later clarified that she had never been to North Korea but she had visited the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). \"South Korea is a treaty ally. North Korea is a nuclear armed adversary, so that's a pretty big thing to confuse,\" Brennan pointed out, adding, \"I know you read this book before it was published because you released video of your recording of the audiobook. You didn't catch these errors when you were recording it?\"\n\n\"Well, Margaret, as soon as it was brought to my attention, I took action to make sure that it was reflected,\" Noem said.\n\n\"You're not taking responsibility for the mistakes in the book?\" Brennan later asked.\n\n\"I am saying that this book is very, very good,\" Noem responded. \"I've met with many world leaders, and... world leaders that I've met with that are in this book, there are many that I met with that are not in this book. And this is an anecdote that I asked to have removed, because I think it's appropriate at this point in time.

So Brennan asked Noem the question again.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders,\" Noem responded once more.\n\nNobody asked you about other world leaders, just the one! Did you meet him or not?\n\n\"I take responsibility for that being in the book,\" Noem said. \"And as soon as it was brought to my attention, I asked for it to be changed.\"\n\nBut how does a mistake like that happen? This is like trying to figure out who overlooked the missing bolts. In this case, Brennan reminded Noem that she read the passage aloud for the audiobook.\n\n\"You didn't catch these errors when you were recording it?\" Brennan asked.\n\n\"I marked it as soon as it was brought to my attention,\" Noem answered. \"I took action to make sure that it was reflected. And listen, this is what is so discouraging about politics in the media today.\"\n\nThe media! Always trying to find things out! How dare they!\n\nMore from Dave Ross: We built it, and they had better come\n\nI understand a politician not wanting us to cover a sleazy sexual encounter. But this is the opposite. This is about not encountering someone. It was as if Kristi Noem wants us to think she actually did meet him, but that it was supposed to be a secret.\n\n\"There are world leaders that I've met with that are in this book and there are many that I met with that are not in this book, but I'm not going to talk to you about those personal meetings that I've had with world leaders,\" Noem said.\n\nAnd then she said that, even though the mention of the meeting with Kim Jong Un was taken out of the book, she is \"not retracting anything.\"\n\nNot retracting anything? OK, but I have to say that this new generation of authentic politicians is sounding a lot like the old generation.", "source": {"uri": "mynorthwest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My Northwest"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_ross@mynorthwest.com", "name": "Dave Ross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Dakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIRO-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KIRO-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Ross"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-Design-2024-05-06T064127.644.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Trump, has already spent the last week defending a grisly excerpt from the book in which she describes killing a family dog.\n\nMs. Noem's new book, a memoir obtained by The New York Times that was aimed at burnishing her image, also includes an error about when a phone call with Nikki Haley took place. That will be corrected in future editions of the book, too, said Ian Fury, the chief of communications for Ms. Noem.\n\n\"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors,\" Mr. Fury said. \"This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor. Kim Jong-un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been.\"\n\nMs. Noem mentions the meeting with Mr. Kim when writing about her eight years in Congress as South Dakota's sole representative, in a passage about her role as a member of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\n\"I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders -- some who wanted our help, and some who didn't,\" Ms. Noem writes. \"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).

Noem erroneously describes meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in new book", "body": "By STEPHEN GROVES - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem described in a new book having met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress. But her office said Friday that the story of the meeting was an error as further scrutiny was put on the Republican governor's life story.\n\nNoem was already facing backlash for a description of how she shot a hunting dog. The book was part of an overt pitch to be chosen as a running mate for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But her political prospects have fallen amid bipartisan disgust for how she recounted killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket after it had shown aggressive behavior and killed her neighbor's chickens.\n\nPeople are also reading...

She writes about meeting Kim Jong Un while she worked in Congress, and more recently, canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron\n\nAfter The Dakota Scout first reported Noem's descriptions of the meetings, her spokesman Ian Fury said in a statement, \"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors. This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nFury said that Kim was erroneously included in a list of world leaders Noem has met with, and she also mistook the dates in which she spoke with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected,\" Fury added.\n\nIn the book, Noem wrote, \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders - some who wanted our help, and some who didn't. I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor after all).\"\n\nThe description of such a meeting was quickly met with skepticism by experts in U.S.-North Korea relations. When Noem was a member of the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015, relations between North Korea and the U.S. were tense and a congressional delegation meeting with Kim would have generated considerable awareness, said Syd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on the relationship with North Korea.\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and had not been notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nNoem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nIn the book, Noem also writes that she was \"slated to meet\" with Macron in November last year while she was in Paris for a conference of European conservative leaders, but later canceled when he made comments that she considered \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, Macron's office told The Associated Press that no \"direct invitation\" had been made for Noem to meet the French president, though it did not rule out that she may have been invited to a Paris event that he was also scheduled to attend.\n\nFury said, \"The governor was invited to sit in President Macron's box for the Armistice Day Parade at Arc de Triomphe. Following his anti-Israel comments, she chose to cancel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noem is trying to fend off the bipartisan backlash for the book's description of shooting her hunting dog, as well as a goat.\n\n\"Don't believe the #fakenews media's twisted spin,\" she posted on X, formerly Twitter, this week. \"I had a choice between the safety of my children and an animal who had a history of attacking people & killing livestock.\"\n\nHer spokesman, Fury, also cast scrutiny of the errors in Noem's book as biased, saying, \"The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge but will continue to downplay Joe Biden's repeated and false claims ... \"\n\nStill, members of Congress have poked fun at Noem, with Reps. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Florida, Susan Wild. a Democrat from Pennsylvania. and Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, launching a Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus this week.\n\nMoskowitz said on X that one of the group's rules was \"you cannot kill a puppy.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Noem claims that she met the man that National Interest executive editor and North Korea expert Harry J. Kazianis likes to call the portly pariah of Pyongyang. Yes, you heard that right. Mr. Big. None other than North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nIn her book, Noem explains that she encountered the despot during her service in Congress. \"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee,\" she stated, \"I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders. I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nWhether Kim would have underestimated a woman who has the capacity to blow away the family pet is an open question that will probably never be resolved -- the problem being that Noem never actually met him in the first place. How could he have a clue about her if he never met Noem? Ian Fury, Noem's spokesman acknowledged, \"We've been made ware that the publisher will be addressing conflated world leaders' names in the book before it is released.\" Conflated is a fancy term for admitting that Noem concocted the episode to bolster her foreign policy bona fides.\n\nNor is this all. Apparently, Noem also recounts a conversation with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley (whom she disparages as a \"lone wolf\" for failing to stick up for Donald Trump for his actions on January 6) that she interpreted as a threat. \"It was clear that she wanted me to know that there was only room for one Republican woman in the spotlight,\" Noem says. The Haley camp says Noem's account is barking up the wrong tree.\n\nSome Republicans are starting to back away from Noem. In Colorado, Noem was supposed to headline a fundraiser for Jefferson County Republicans on Saturday, where she would \"share her perspective\" on the animal killings, but a Jeffco Republicans Facebook indicated that they got cold feet about hosting her.\n\nCalifornia Republicans, however, are standing their ground. Their response to Noem's execution of her dog Cricket is crickets. Noem will be a keynote speaker at the party's convention in Burlingame in mid-May. According to Politico, tickets to a Saturday luncheon with Noem will be $175 and anyone who splurges will receive a private photo-op with her for $300.\n\nCan Noem make a comeback? Trump has his eye on a variety of candidates for the VP slot, ranging from Senator J.D. Vance to Tim Scott. Today, numerous aspirants, including Noem, will attend a Republican donor retreat in Palm Beach at the Four Seasons Hotel to vie for the post, with a lunch to follow at Mar-a-Lago on Satruday, where Trump himself will speak. But don't expect to hear much from Noem. For now, she remains in the doghouse.", "source": {"uri": "nationalinterest.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Interest"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Going_Back_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No Going Back (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pyongyang"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pyongyang"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

On Sunday, Noem acknowledged that the book had to be corrected before its imminent release, but declined to say that she never met the North Korean leader.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I'm just not going to do that. This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book and as soon as it was brought to my attention I made sure that that was adjusted,\" Noem said during an interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" The book is due to be released Tuesday.\n\n\"There are details in this book that talk about going to the [demilitarized zone] and specifics I'm willing to share. There's some specifics I'm not willing to share with you,\" Noem added later when pressed by CBS' Margaret Brennan.\n\nNoem insisted that her book offered ideas on how America could move forward under Donald Trump's leadership. But once floated as a possible running mate for Trump, Noem's odds in the veepstakes seem to have disintegrated -- though the reasons extend beyond the messy memoir rollout.\n\nShe's held firm in her decisions depicted in the book, pitching the killing of Cricket as a sign she's willing to make difficult choices.\n\n\"This dog was a working dog and had come from a family that had issues with this dog and I had put months and months of training into this dog. This dog had gone to other trainers as well,\" Noem said Sunday.\n\n\"So all of that is the facts of the story, and all of that shows that when you put someone in a position where they have to make a decision and they want to protect their family and protect children and other people from getting attacked from an animal that has attacked others and killed livestock that's the choice I made over 20 years ago. And that I didn't ask somebody else to take that responsibility for me.\"\n\nCricket reportedly isn't the only pup that faced Noem's ire in the book. Noem also criticized President Joe Biden's dog, Commander, who was in the doghouse earlier this year after it emerged that he had bit Secret Service agents dozens of times.\n\n\"Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people, so how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog and what to do with it?\" Noem said.\n\nNoem also sparred with Brennan, accusing the CBS reporter of interrupting her and treating her \"differently\" than other guests that have previously come on the show. It's an argument Noem made earlier this weekend during a Palm Beach donor retreat.\n\n\"Listen, going through hard things, and I've been through a few of them -- I'm going through one right now, I mean they're just attacking me like crazy right now,\" Noem said according to audio obtained by POLITICO.\n\nAs for the book: \"This book is a powerful book, it's an honest book.

This was a dangerous animal that was killing livestock and attacking people.\"\n\nNoem took to X again after the interview to complain about the interviewer.\n\n\"This morning in our 15-minute interview, Margaret Brennan interrupted me 36 times -- once every 25 seconds on average,\" she complained, arguing that other guests, such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, had an easier time.\n\nWhat Noem describes as interruptions, however, were the CBS host's efforts to clarify details, more often than not giving Noem the last word. And the hard questions Noem faced were entirely a product of her own claims, which have attracted bipartisan condemnation. Besides describing how she killed her dog, Noem's book also includes an account of a meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un -- a meeting that never happened, forcing the publisher to issue a correction.\n\nBut Noem, who refused to address the false anecdote or otherwise discuss her \"many, many\" interactions with foreign leaders, insists she is a victim.\n\n\"In the fake news media, there are two sets of rules, and conservative[s] are always treated differently,\" she said. \"That's why Americans don't trust the Fake News.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Dakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Political_Action_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Political Action Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media2.salon.com/2024/05/kristi_noem_2026352608.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

And since then, Noem's memoir has only drawn more scrutiny.\n\nExperts widely doubted the veracity of an anecdote which Noem included in the book about meeting the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un and feeling underestimated by him. Her camp subsequently conceded she never met the North Korean leader.\n\nAdditionally, a spokesperson for former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley denied the book's characterization of a conversation between Haley and Noem, who claimed Haley threatened her after she challenged Haley's status as a leading woman in the Republican party.\n\nThe book claims the conversation occurred when Noem first took office in 2019, but it was a year later.\n\nWhatever the case, Noem's chief of communications, Ian Fury, told The New York Times that both errors would be corrected.\n\n\"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book No Going Back has two small errors,\" Fury said to the Times. \"This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor. Kim Jong-un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been.\"\n\nSeparately on Friday, the chairperson of Colorado's Jefferson county Republican party said the organization canceled its annual fundraiser because Noem's planned headlining appearance had spurred multiple threats.\n\nNoem was still set to headline Florida's Brevard county Republican party fundraiser on 25 May. The county party's chairperson defended Noem's decision to kill Cricket, and the purchase of a ticket includes a copy of No Going Back.\n\nRounding out the South Dakota governor's Friday was the Rolling Stone report based on sources of the publication who recounted how Trump has expressed disgust with Noem's killing of Cricket in closed-door meetings and telephone conversations.\n\n\"Why would she do that?\" Trump - who is grappling with nearly 90 felony criminal charges, among other legal problems - was quoted as saying. \"What is wrong with her?\"\n\nRolling Stone added: \"He has expressed bewilderment that she would have ever admitted to doing this, willingly and in her own writing, and has argued it demonstrates she has a poor grasp of 'public relations'.\"\n\nThe publication also wrote that Trump's responses were leaked to definitively eliminate Noem from vice-presidential contention.\n\nNoem is scheduled to appear on Sunday morning on CBS's Face the Nation and is expected to be asked about the ongoing fallout from her new book.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Dakota Scout reported the news on May 2, which was then picked up by other outlets.\n\n\"I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders -- some who wanted our help, and some who didn't,\" the New York Times quoted Noem as writing. \"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all). Dealing with foreign leaders takes resolve, preparation, and determination.\"\n\nAfter doubt was cast upon this account, Noem's spokesperson Ian Fury told the Dakota Scout that the book's publisher would be \"addressing conflated world leaders' names in the book.\" Fury was then quoted telling other news outlets that the North Korean leader was mentioned in error.\n\n\"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors,\" Fury told the New York Times. \"This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor. Kim Jong Un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been.\"\n\nTIME reached out to Noem's office, campaign, spokespeople, and publisher about the report.\n\nRead More: Kristi Noem Faces Backlash After Admitting to Killing Her Dog\n\nNoem was widely considered to be a Vice President contender for presidential candidate Donald Trump, having spoken at his rallies and publicly pledged her support for the former President. However, CNN reported on May 4 that she had \"fallen off\" the shortlist before her book controversies took center stage.\n\nThe Governor was already facing criticism for another part of her new memoir in which she admitted to shooting dead her 14-month-old dog Cricket after she said the \"untrainable\" canine ruined a hunt, killed another family's chickens, and moved to bite her. She also killed a goat. The admissions were first reported by the Guardian.\n\nNoem has since defended herself. In one post on X (formerly Twitter) she said: \"I can understand why some people are upset about a 20 year old story of Cricket, one of the working dogs at our ranch, in my upcoming book -- No Going Back.\"\n\n\"The fact is, South Dakota law states that dogs who attack and kill livestock can be put down. Given that Cricket had shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did,\" she later continued in the same post. \"Whether running the ranch or in politics, I have never passed on my responsibilities to anyone else to handle. Even if it's hard and painful. I followed the law and was being a responsible parent, dog owner, and neighbor.\"\n\nThe Republican was elected as South Dakota's first female governor in 2018 and re-elected in 2022, after serving in Congress since 2011 and in the South Dakota House of Representatives since 2007.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_(North_Korean_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader (North Korean title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Going_Back_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "No Going Back (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_America_Forward", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Move America Forward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Dakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghostwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republican_(Springfield,_Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-4.png?w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 487, "textEnd": 492}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 532, "textEnd": 537}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 1956, "textEnd": 1961}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Kristi Noem has been traveling the interview circuit ahead of the release of her book, \"No Going Back,\" which is set to drop on Tuesday. The first excerpts of the book - including Noem's tale about shooting a dog named Cricket - set off a firestorm of publicity and controversy, and Noem has offered no apologies.\n\nRELATED: In Upcoming Book, Gov Kristi Noem Describes Shooting Her Own Dog - Will It Damage Her VP Chances?\n\nIn these interviews she's given more detail about what led to her decision to shoot Cricket in the head and dump her body in a gravel pit. Whether one agrees with Noem's decision or not, the fact that the incident has to be explained is a problem. As RedState's Andrew Malcolm has observed about politics, \"If you're explaining, you're losing.\"\n\nAs it turns out, the only thing Noem's worse at than explaining is deflecting. In a \"Face the Nation\" interview on Sunday, Noem was confronted about both the puppy story and a factual error in the book, and in trying to deflect gave terrible answers and made a huge gaffe. Then, she cried victim - not a great look for a woman whose book is designed to show how tough she is. Sis, if you can't handle an interview with Margaret Brennan, you're not gonna be able to handle Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping.\n\nBrennan quoted a portion of the book in which Noem reminisced about an alleged meeting with Kim Jong-un, and then asked her whether that meeting happened. Noem wrote:\n\n\"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants. I have been a children's pastor after all.\"\n\nSyd Seiler, a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent decades working on issues between the U.S. and North Korea, told the Associated Press no such meeting occurred:\n\n\"Nothing like this happened,\" he said, adding that he was working at the White House and State Department during that time period and was not notified of a congressional meeting with Kim.\n\nNoem did join an international congressional trip, known as a codel, to Japan, South Korea and China in 2014.\n\nNoem told Brennan:\n\nWell, you know, as soon as this was brought to my attention, I certainly made some changes and looked at this - this passage.\n\nAnd I have met with many, many world leaders. I have traveled around the world. As soon as it was brought to my attention, we went forward and have made some edits. So I'm glad that this book is being released in a couple of days, and that those edits will be in place, and that people will - will have the updated version.\n\nBrennan then attempted to clarify, saying, \"So, you did not meet with Kim Jong-un?\" Noem replied:\n\nNo, I have met with many, many world leaders, many world leaders. I have traveled around the world. I think I have talked extensively in this book about my time serving in Congress, my time as governor, before governor, some of the travels that I have had. I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders, I'm just not going to do that. This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book. And as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that that was adjusted.\n\nI take responsibility for that being in the book. And as soon as it was brought to my attention, I asked for it to be changed. So I'm glad that the release date is in a couple of days. And we're excited to talk to America about my new book, \"No Going Back.\"\n\nThere really aren't any great explanations Noem could give, but trying to weasel out of it by acting like a journalist asking for specifics on meetings she brought up in her book is somehow out of bounds and asking for classified information isn't the way. Also, why would the anecdote have to be brought to her attention? We all know that she didn't actually write the book, but she should have at least read the book before signing off on its publication.\n\nNoem did try to pivot the conversation to her experience \"work[ing] on ag policy and federal policy for over 30 years,\" but Brennan then said, \"Right, but you never went to North Korea.\" This leads to Noem's next facepalm moment.\n\nNoem replied:\n\nSo, I make no specifics in this book. I talk about the fact that - yes, I have. I have been there.\n\n. . .\n\nI went to the DMZ. And there are details - there details in this book that talk about going to the DMZ and specifics that I'm willing to share. There's some specifics I'm not willing to share with you.\n\nBless her heart. The Demilitarized Zone is not part of North Korea; it's a 2.5 mile wide buffer zone between North and South Korea that was established in the Korean Armistice Agreement.\n\nNoem then went back to saying she asked for the anecdote to be removed and added, \"because I think it's appropriate at this point in time.\" That's a puzzling addition.\n\nSo then Brennan got to the Cricket discussion. She relayed a summary of the incident, then asked Noem, \"I wonder if you have regrets about sharing this story?\"\n\nNoem's long answer reflected what she'd said in interviews over the past week but also seems overly workshopped/full of PR-speak:\n\nYou know, Margaret, this book is filled with vulnerable, painful moments in my life, filled with times where I have made very difficult decisions. The reason that this story is in the book because people need to understand who I am and some of those difficult decisions. This was a dangerous animal that was killing livestock and attacking people. And - and I had little children at the time. Our operation had many kids running around and people and interaction with the public. And I made a difficult choice. I think you're a mother too. And you have little kiddos. Would you make a choice between your children or a dangerous animal?\n\nAnd I think I would ask everybody in the country to put themselves in that situation, because that's what I faced. And I talk about it because what I'm tired of in this country is politicians who pretend to be something that they're not, that they aren't willing to have the hard conversations and look at the past and the tough decisions that they've made. I'm - what I talk about in the book extensively when people are able to get it on Tuesday is to see the whole story and the truth, not the spin that the media has put on this story. The media has put some or removed - removed most of the facts and - and what - the reason this is in there... is because I want people to know that I don't ask anybody else to take on my responsibilities.\n\nI understood my responsibility. And, as a mom, I made a choice between protecting my children, and protecting them from a dangerous animal that was killing livestock and attacking people.\n\nMembers of the press have undoubtedly removed some of the facts shown in the book for their own ends, but if Noem and her people didn't expect that to happen and craft the book with that in mind, that's on them. That's to be expected.\n\nAfter more discussion of the Cricket incident and Noem's description of shooting a \"smelly\" billy goat right after she killed Cricket, Brennan asked Noem about a passage at the end of the book in which she insinuated that she'd shoot Joe Biden's dog Commander (who has a long history of biting people) the way she did Cricket. Brennan asked:\n\nIn fact, at the end of the book, you say the very first thing you would do if you got to the White House that was different from Joe Biden, is you'd make sure Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds. \"Commander, say hello to Cricket.\" Are you doing this to try to look tough? Do you still think that you have a shot at being a V.P.?\n\nCommander is a dog who absolutely has behavior problems, and finally Biden was forced to retire Commander to the Delaware beach house. People can absolutely disagree regarding the proper solution to the Commander problem (whether he should be put down, or whether he simply needs to be at a home where there aren't new people coming in and out all the time), but again we go back to: if you're explaining, you're losing. There was no need for Noem to put that sentiment at the end of the book; it seems that she's rather proud of the Cricket story and wants to brag about it instead of it being just an example of the hard choices one faces on a farm. It's all unnecessary and shows she's not ready for the national spotlight.\n\nDuring the interview Noem asked Brennan why the mainstream press wasn't going after Joe Biden for the fairy tales he continues to insert into his life story, which is a great and valid point. A better strategy for Noem would have been to not give the press this opportunity to ignore Biden's gaffes and lies.\n\nNoem's terrible strategy continued after the interview, when she tweeted:\n\nThis morning in our 15-minute interview, Margaret Brennan interrupted me 36 times -- once every 25 seconds on average. But when liberals like@gretchenwhitmer and @SpeakerPelosi are on @FaceTheNation, they aren't interrupted once. In the fake news media, there are two sets of rules, and conservative are always treated differently. That's why Americans don't trust the Fake News.\n\nSorry, Gov. Noem. Your media woes are all of your own doing. You can't publish a book and (record the audiobook) that contains factual errors and a tone-deaf and, according to your explanations now, incomplete anecdote about shooting a young dog in the head and then claim that the ensuing backlash is the fault of the media and Republicans who didn't like your COVID policies.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"},

Kristi Noem says \"I want the truth to be out there\" after viral stories of killing her dog, false Kim Jong Un claim", "body": "Washington -- South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said on Sunday that she's \"not retracting anything\" after facing backlash for stories about killing her young dog and a false claim about meeting with Kim Jong Un, although she said the latter story will be adjusted in her book.\n\n\"I'm so proud of this book and what it will bring to people,\" Noem said on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday. \"I'm not retracting anything.\"\n\nThe Republican governor, who had been considered among a list of possible running mates for former President Donald Trump in his latest White House bid, has been widely criticized after writing in her new book about killing her dog decades ago, a story that went viral in recent days.\n\nShe writes in her book that the 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket had shown aggressive behavior, while she was training the dog for pheasant hunting. She said on Sunday that she made the choice to protect her children from a \"dangerous animal.\"\n\n\"I would ask everybody in the country to put themselves in that situation,\" she said. \"As a mom, I made a choice between protecting my children, and protecting them from a dangerous animal that was killing livestock and attacking people.\"\n\nBut the anecdote has spurred questions about her political future. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Politico that Noem's writing about killing her dog \"ended any possibility of her being picked as VP.\"\n\nNoem defended the anecdote and the book more broadly, saying it's \"filled with vulnerable painful moments in my life.\"\n\n\"I want the truth to be out there and to understand that these animals were attacking my children, that we live on a farm and a ranch and that tough decisions are made many times and it is to protect people,\" Noem said.\n\nShe added that the reason the story is in the book is because \"people need to understand who I am\" and some of the \"difficult decisions\" she's made. She said that the story is \"well known in South Dakota\" and her \"political opponents have tried to use against me for years.\"\n\nIn the book, Noem writes that the first thing she would do if she got to the White House that was different from President Biden is make sure Mr. Biden's dog, Commander, was nowhere on the grounds. Commander has since been moved to an undisclosed location after biting several Secret Service agents, but Noem writes that she would say \"Commander say hello to Cricket.\"\n\n\"Well, No. 1, Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people,\" Noem said. \"So how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog?\"\n\nWhen \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan asked if that meant Commander should be shot, Noem answered \"that what's the president should be accountable to.\"\n\nThe South Dakota governor has also faced scrutiny for details in the book about mentioning a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress that appeared to be an error. Noem said the anecdote shouldn't have been included in the book and has been adjusted.\n\n\"This is an anecdote that I asked to have removed because I think it's appropriate at this point in time,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commander (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newt_Gingrich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newt Gingrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/05/d22fd5dd-086c-44ee-929d-29ecf147801b/thumbnail/1200x630/c2271902d5122627af11fd090eaf84c8/1714923685334.png?v=1d6c78a71b7b6252b543a329b3a5744d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

However, CNN on Saturday reported that Noem had \"fallen off\" that list in wake of the criticism she has been facing for being a 'dog killer'.\n\nBefore Kim Jong Un's tale, the South Dakota Governor was already under fire for admitting in her memoir that she shot dead her 14-month-old dog 'Cricket', calling him \"untrainable\".

For some reason, her book tour handlers thought it was a good idea for the Republican governor to be interviewed by CBS's Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan. To be kind, I would say the interview did not go well for Noem.\n\nTo be brutally honest, I would say that the interview was a disaster. Her book is set to be released on Tuesday.\n\nA brand new controversy has emerged. In her new book, \"No Going Back,\" the governor tells a story about meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. That little bombshell received more attention than the story about Cricket the Dog has received up until now. To say it was a surprise is an understatement.\n\n\"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" she wrote in the book set to be released Tuesday. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\n\"There are details in this book that talk about going to the DMZ and specifics I'm willing to share,\" she said. \"There's some specifics I'm not willing to share with you. I've traveled the world and visited with world leaders. Some of that is referenced in the book and this anecdote is something, when brought to my attention, we made some changes and when the book is released we'll do all that we can to see that that is reflected.\"\n\nIn the book, she speaks about meetings with many world leaders when she was a member of the House Armed Services Committee. It turns out that the meeting with Kim Jong-un didn't happen. She was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 2011 to 2019.\n\nNow it is being edited out of her book.\n\n\"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors,\" Noem's spokesperson Ian Fury told the New York Times. \"This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor. Kim Jong-un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been.\"\n\nMargaret Brennan, a host who openly sneers at Republican guests, zeroed in on the North Korea story. Noem appeared ill-prepared to answer the questioning.\n\n\"Did you meet Kim Jong Un?\" Brennan directly asked the governor, who avoided answering the question and instead said she's \"met with many, many world leaders\" and has \"made some edits\" to the book.\n\n\"I've met with many, many world leaders and traveled around the world,\" Noem said. \"I think I've talked extensively in this book about my time serving in Congress, my time as governor, before governor, some of the travels that I've had. I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I'm just not going to do it.\"\n\nNoem appeared robotic in her delivery. She kept repeating that answer as Brennan continued to ask about the meeting. Finally, she said that edits would be made to her book. It was excruciating to watch.\n\nIt seems to me that making up a meeting with the North Korean dictator to imply she's tough and willing to face down evil leaders is a bigger story than shooting her 14-month-old dog. That story is bad, don't get me wrong, but why fudge about a list of world leaders she met with during her time in Congress? That is easily fact-checked and she had to have known that every Democrat operative masquerading as a show host on television would have staff who would do just that.\n\nI like Kristi Noem, or at least I did. Her story about shooting a dog may be handed off as a story about the reality of farm life but many Americans are already disturbed about that one. Now questions are arising about her ability to retell her political career stories. This goes to judgment and decision-making skills. She wants to look strong and she's been rumored to be on Trump's shortlist for a running mate. But when is it all too much?\n\nThe other error Fury referenced is the timeline of a conversation with former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who she says called her in 2021 to offer to mentor her. Noem wrote that the conversation ended with Haley saying: \"I've heard many good things about you. But when I do hear bad things, I will make sure that you know.\"\n\nNoem wrote that she perceived the call as a threat. A spokesperson for Haley told the Times and Politico that Noem's characterization of the conversation is inaccurate, and that Haley \"has long called and written notes supporting other women when they go through challenging times.\"\n\nThe book will be corrected in the future to say the conversation happened in 2020, not 2021, Fury told the Times.\n\nThat can be written off as a misunderstanding in communication. And, the wrong recollection of the year of a conversation isn't the end of the world. It does make the book look like it wasn't properly edited in the first place.\n\nThere is also a reference to a meeting with French President Macron as governor that she said she canceled. That meeting was never scheduled.\n\nNoem read her book for the audio edition. Didn't she catch the mistakes when she did that?\n\nObviously, her book was ghostwritten. Did she write any of it?

However, experts have called into question whether such a meeting could have ever taken place.\n\n\"Did you meet Kim Jong Un?\" Brennan directly asked the governor, who avoided answering the question and instead said she's \"met with many, many world leaders\" and has \"made some edits\" to the book.\n\n\"I've met with many, many world leaders and traveled around the world,\" Noem said. \"I think I've talked extensively in this book about my time serving in Congress, my time as governor, before governor, some of the travels that I've had. I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I'm just not going to do it.\"\n\nHer blatant refusal to say whether she actually met with the dictator contradicts her admission that the anecdote should not have been included in the book -- a point Noem repeatedly noted during the interview. She never explained why she is pulling the story from the final version, however.\n\nBrennan tried to offer Noem alternative explanations, including whether she might have instead met with South Korea's leader, but Noem refused to clarify her actual reality.\n\nThe governor also claimed she went to North Korea via the Korean Demilitarized Zone, which borders the two nations and can be visited by tourists.\n\nKristi Noem Killed Her Dog -- Then Ruined This GOP Fundraiser\n\n\"There are details in this book that talk about going to the DMZ and specifics I'm willing to share,\" she said. \"There's some specifics I'm not willing to share with you. I've traveled the world and visited with world leaders. Some of that is referenced in the book and this anecdote is something, when brought to my attention, we made some changes and when the book is released we'll do all that we can to see that that is reflected.\"\n\nNoem was also grilled about another anecdote in the book, first reported by The Guardian, in which Noem brags about executing her 14-month-old dog, Cricket, after it killed a neighbor's chickens and tried to bite her.\n\nNoem wrote that she \"hated\" Cricket, and so she took the \"extremely dangerous\" dog to a gravel pit on her property and put it down. It was \"not a pleasant job,\" she wrote, but \"had to be done.\" (The governor also recalled executing a goat she claimed was too smelly and aggressive.)\n\nThe revelation, among other oddities contained in her book, caused near-universal outrage and is widely viewed as having destroyed her chances of being selected as Donald Trump's running mate.\n\nWhen asked about her chances as the veep choice on Sunday, Noem ignored the question and seemingly suggested to Brennan that President Joe Biden's dog, Commander, should be shot for chomping on Secret Service agents.\n\nNoem's advisers had reportedly hoped that her Face the Nation interview would produce some news, ostensibly to change the emerging public narrative of a cold, obfuscating politician. However, throughout the interview, Noem only seemed to use her time to deflect from questions and attack Brennan, asking her why Brennan wasn't raising Joe Biden's lies -- during an interview with Noem, not the president.\n\n\"If I had an interview with Joe Biden, who I've asked for multiple times, I will ask him about this,\" Brennan said. \"I'm asking you about your book.\"\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

She even put out a \"look at ME\" book intended to show everyone how awesome she was. Well, she got the spotlight. It was shall we say less than flattering. Not only did the bright spotlight of Presidential politics reveal Noem wasn't ready for prime time, it's showing more and more each day she should have stayed as far away as possible from it!\n\nSince you're here on Politizoom you follow political stuff. Even people who don't pay much attention to politics have learned more than they ever wanted about Noem's callous, downright cruel treatment of her dog Cricket. Of taking him to a gravel pit on their farm and murdering him by shooting him in the face, literally blowing his head off with a shotgun. This wasn't \"leaked\" by some nearby workers who witnessed the incident. Nope, she wrote about it in the book meant to show Trump and the country she was ready for the big-time. To be a heartbeat away from the Presidency.\n\nWell, she shot and killed poor Cricket for not being what she considered a good dog but she wasn't done shooting. While she was at it she decided to lead a goat she described as nasty and smelly to the same gravel pit and kill it too. Only she botched the job, and had to go fetch additional shotgun shells to finish off the goat. Noem wasn't done shooting however. As I said this story wasn't leaked by those nearby who saw it all happen, but because she went and shot off her mouth about it in her book! I guess she wanted to project a \"tough\" image, an unhesitating willingness to \"make tough decisions\" and \"take tough action.\"\n\nReaction to this \"blurb\" sent out to increase interest in her book before next week's official release was revulsion and horror. Adding details like \"I hated that dog\" and noting her daughter's perplexed question of \"where's Cricket?\" when she got home from school didn't help. So Noem tried to do damage control and she keeps stepping further into the giant $hitpile she made. Cricket at least in Noem's retelling has morphed from an excitable and too energetic dog into an \"untrainable\" dog, an untrainable \"working\" (hunting) dog, a livestock (yes, when she let Cricket escape from the car at the neighbor's he killed some chickens. And chickens qualify as livestock) to a dog that tried to bite her, to a dog that did bite her, to a \"danger\" to her children. Cujo in real life. Who knows what she'll say next about poor Cricket.\n\nNow, all of that is truly awful and not at all good for Noem's political future. However as much as this particular excerpt from her book stands out other blurbs are coming out and they're raising questions of their own. Newser has an article that discusses a couple of them and I'm betting it's a sign of (not good) things to come when the book finally comes out. It seems Noem is making up stories to make herself into a bigger deal than she was back during her days as a Congress Critter. SHOCKING! Just kidding. Politicians have been fudging details to pad their resumes since long before I was born. Some are maddeningly competent, even good at it and some are not. As we can see Noem falls squarely in the second group. Newser cites a report from the Dakota Scout, going on to say:\n\nNoem writes in No Going Back about meeting Kim Jong Un while serving on the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015 and about canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron after he \"made what I considered a very pro-Hamas and anti-Israel comment to the press.\" Macron's office said he never had a meeting scheduled with Noem. Meanwhile, a dozen Capitol Hill staffers said they'd never heard of Noem meeting Kim. \"It's bullshit,\" said one who worked on the committee at the time in question.\n\nTo be sure, it was easier in the old days before there was an internet and social media which could use said internet to do some real-time fact checking. Because of that, higher level politicians have interns monitoring for mention of their name so they can respond if need be should they get linked to something/someone unfavorable. And debunk it if it's entirely false. I'll get to that one but first let's talk about Noem meeting North Korea's Kim.\n\nLet's face it, that's some George Santos level stuff. Maybe she'll have aides spread \"background\" about how during her time on the House Armed Services Committee she got hold of the training manuals for an Air Force jet that could fly to North Korea. And some service manuals too. And procedures for arranging mid-air refuelings. Like Jared Kushner learning how to solve conflict in the middle east by reading some books she read up on how to sneak onto an Air Force base, \"borrow\" a jet and fly across the Pacific! Like I said, we're talking George Santos level bullshitting here.\n\nWhat did they talk about I wonder? Maybe Noem was the linchpin of his meeting up with Kim and the groundwork was laid back before Trump even announced his candidacy. (If Noem weren't so busy making the Cricket story worse with each retelling she could have been teasing the details of being responsible for the Trump/Kim summit) Experts agree Kim never left his country between 2011 and 2018, nor were there any Congressional visits to North Korea. But somehow, at least Noem would have us believe she did manage to go meet him. Sure Kristi. Just like Cricket was the most huge, vicious puppy dog ever!\n\nStill, in addition to what's in the book she spoke about it to local reporters. As the linked article indicates Noem told the Scout(which couldn't find any record of any Congressional level meeting with Kim):\n\nNoem mentions the supposed meeting while remarking that \"I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders.\" Of Kim, she writes, \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nIt's hard to say how this would have played in her lobbying Trump for the Veep slot. On the one hand he might have believed her and admired her gumption. On the other he might have believed her and been upset at her for not seeing Kim in the glowing light Trump has held him. Our very own Murfster might, if he gets a chance weigh in on that since he risks his own sanity spending too much time in Trump's head trying to figure him out. In the end it's one helluva tall tale and if the furor over murdering Cricket for being an over-energetic puppy dies down by next week this will get a lot more scrutiny.\n\nAs for her touting her \"diplomacy\" chops and \"meeting\" with France's Macron, again it's quite the tall tale that's Santos level in audacity. Complete with HER cancelling on HIM. What, you had better things to do Kristi? Maybe sneak away for a tryst with fellow Trump fluffer Corey Lewandowski? (Yep, she might talk the talk and present the image to her voters of a devoted with and mom she she and Lewandowski had an affair) Or someone else? Maybe you think touting a meeting you set up with a world leader, a major ally then bailing makes you look bigly cool and important. Or maybe you're full of sh*t. Still, you write about it in your book:\n\nOf Macron, she writes she was \"slated to meet\" him while in Paris for a political conference but \"decided to cancel.\" The president's office said Noem never received a \"direct invitation,\" though it's possible she and Macron were scheduled to attend the same event. In response to questions, Noem's office said she doesn't discuss her meetings with foreign leaders, though the book clearly disputes that. The Scout was later told the publisher would be \"addressing conflated world leaders' names in the book.\" Read the full report here\n\nAnyway these are just two of the non-cricket anecdotes Noem's book will contain. Both as I say are Santos level bullshit. Who knows how much more there will be? My own guess is that this book will turn out to be quite the piece of fiction. Not that with all the other news we'll hear much about it. For the most part the references to her book will talk about Noem's cruelty. (She IS a cruel person and it's good that people know that) However, she can't stop publication at this point. She might be and probably is out of the running to be Trump's VP pick. Still, like Nikki Haley she's plenty young enough to make a Presidential run for at least two, maybe even three cycles. Or maybe go for a Senate seat.\n\nLet's just hope all the bullshit in her book gets exposed, and her political career is well and truly over.", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news",

shook the nation, according to The Guardian who read it before its release.\n\nShe detailed how she shot and killed her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer Cricket due to the puppy's \"aggressive personality.\"\n\nThe governor decided to take her on a hunting trip so she could learn from older dogs.\n\nHowever, Noem was displeased with her performance and said Cricket ruined the hunt by \"chasing all those birds and having the time of her life.\"\n\n\"I hated that dog,\" she admitted in the book.\n\nIt came to a breaking point after Cricket escaped Noem's truck to attack a nearby family's chickens, and grabbed \"one chicken at a time\" to crunch them to death \"with one bite.\"\n\nWhen Noem tried to stop her dog, she whipped her head around and tried to bite her.\n\nWith the chickens' owners in tears, Noem wrote them a check and helped \"them dispose of the carcasses littering the scene of the crime.\"\n\n\"At that moment, I realized I had to put her down,\" she declared.\n\nWhen they returned home, Noem said she got her gun and brought Cricket to a gravel pit on her farm.\n\n\"It was not a pleasant job, but it had to be done,\" she said.\n\nNoem seemingly confirmed the story and warned that there would be more to come in her book, in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"We love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Sadly, we just had to put down 3 horses a few weeks ago that had been in our family for 25 years.\n\n\"If you want more real, honest, and politically INcorrect stories that'll

Given that Cricket had shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did.\n\nNoem is photographed with a different dog that she owned, Hazel, a Vizsla\n\n'As I explained in the book, it wasn't easy. But often the easy way isn't the right way.'\n\nNoem later told Fox News that Cricket 'massacred' a neighbor's livestock the day it was killed.\n\n'It had come to us from a family who had found her way too aggressive,' she claimed.\n\nThe book, titled No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward, will be released on May 7.\n\nIn it, Noem wrote about the wirehair pointer she shot at the gravel pit on her family property, moments before her children came home from school.\n\nShe claimed Cricket had an 'aggressive personality' that couldn't be tamed - as evidenced by the fact that he ruined a pheasant hunt for being 'out of her mind with excitement, chasing all those birds and having the time of her life'.\n\nAdditionally, when the South Dakota governor took Cricket with her to meet a local family the dog started killing the family's chickens like 'a trained assassin.'\n\nAccording to a book excerpt obtained by the Guardian, Cricket 'grabbed one chicken at a time, crunching it to death with one bite, then dropping it to attack another'.\n\nAs former President Donald Trump contemplates who should become his VP, Noem has written a new book, No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward , which will be released on May 7\n\nWhen Noem finally grabbed the dog she wrote that Cricket 'whipped around to bite me'.\n\nCricket was 'the picture of pure joy'. Meanwhile, the chickens' owner wept.\n\nNoem wrote that she cut a check 'for the price they asked, and helped them dispose of the carcasses littering the scene of the crime.'\n\n'I hated that dog,' Noem wrote, believing the 14-month-old pooch to be 'untrainable,' 'dangerous to anyone she came in conatct with' and 'less than worthless... as a hunting dog.'\n\nSo she decided to kill Cricket.\n\n'At that moment,' the governor wrote. 'I realized I had to put her down.'\n\nShe shot Cricket at the family's gravel pit.\n\n'It was not a pleasant job,' Noem said, 'but it had to be done. And after it was over, I realized another unpleasant job needed to be done.'\n\nNoem decided to off the family goat as well because he was 'nasty and mean,' as he remained uncastrated and smelled 'disgusting, musky [and] rancid' and 'loved to chase' the governor's children.\n\nShe 'dragged him to the gravel pit' as well, but the goat jumped as she tried to shoot him, leaving him briefly alive.\n\nNoem said she had to go back to her truck and retrieve another shell and then 'hurried back to the gravel pit and put him down.'\n\nA Facebook picture shows South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem with a gun. In her forthcoming book she writes about Cricket, a 14-month-old wirehair pointer, that Noem shot at the gravel pit on her family property, moments before her children came home from school\n\nHer actions were witnessed, she said, by a construction crew working nearby. Moments later, the bus dropped off her kids.\n\n'Kennedy looked around confused,' Noem recalled of her daughter, who asked, 'Hey where's Cricket?'\n\nNoem then admitted, 'I guess if I were a better politician I wouldn't tell the story here.'\n\nOn Friday the internet was buzzing with reactions to her story.\n\nAlyssa Farah Griffin, a sharp critic of Trump who used to be his White House communications director, wrote on X that anyone 'who would needlessly hurt an animal because they are inconvenient needs help.'\n\n'I'm a dog lover and I am honestly horrified by the Kristi Noem excerpt. I wish I hadn't even read it. A 14-month old dog is still a puppy & can be trained.\n\n'A large part of bad behavior in dogs is not having proper training from the humans responsible for them,' Griffin wrote.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Dakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel_pit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gravel pit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Going_Back_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No Going Back (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriott_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marriott International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_America_Forward", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Move America Forward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheasant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pheasant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Farah_Griffin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alyssa Farah Griffin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

This has been dismissed by experts as \"bullshit.\" There's no chance that it happened, and Noem, a confirmed psychopath, clearly made the whole thing up.\n\nNoem writes in her political memoir, \"Through my tenure on the House armed services committee [2011-2018], I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders. I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants.\" She then adds parenthetically (and bizarrely), \"I'd been a children's pastor, after all.\" I guess she thinks the same of kids as she does puppies.\n\nAnyway, it's a common feature of narcissists to invent fantastical stories in which they are the hero. Noem's claim has been shouted down by experts across Washington DC. Noem should have known better than to make up such an obvious lie. But then, Noem is also stupid, like most Republicans.\n\nNoem also claims in her book to have cancelled a meeting with French president Emmanuel Macron. She writes of being in Paris \"slated to meet\" the French president when, \"... the day before we were to meet [Macron] made what I considered a very pro-Hamas and anti-Israel comment to the press. So, I decided to cancel. There is no place for pro-Hamas rhetoric.\" This is also a lie, created to make Noem look like a woman of both importance and principles. Macron's office says no direct invitation to Noem was ever issued.\n\nLess substantial is the rumour that Noem also invented the story about the time she dragged her puppy and a goat to a gravel pit and murdered them both with a gun. It turns out that this story was already well-known in political circles, but the true details are far more disturbing.\n\nAccording to the rumour the story goes that Noem murdered the animals not out of \"reluctant compassion\" but in a fit of uncontrollable, frenzied rage. Several people witnessed the incident, including numerous construction workers. All who saw it were deeply shocked by the wanton fury with which this out-of-control lunatic slaughtered both animals. The theory is that the incident, as it actually happened, was so awful and so disturbing that Noem included a tamer, watered down version of the event in her book in an effort to get ahead of the story and diffuse its potential impact.\n\nIn short, Kristi Noem is a lying psychopath with no morals. That is, a garden variety 21st century Republican.

The South Dakota governor was specifically asked on CBS News's Face the Nation about a part in her book where she says, \"Commander, say hello to Cricket for me.\"\n\n\"Well, No. 1, Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people. So how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog?\" Noem said, before anchor Margaret Brennan interrupted to point out that Commander does not live at the White House anymore.\n\n\"And that's the question that the President should be held accountable to,\" Noem added.\n\nBrennan then directly asked Noem if she was saying Commander should have been shot.\n\n\"That what's the president should be accountable to.

While the GOP governor received immediate backlash online, Noem continued to defend her actions stating during an interview on Fox News that the \"fake news\" put the \"worst spin\" on the story.\n\nNoem stated that the \"extremely dangerous\" dog had endangered the \"safety\" of her children, forcing her to choose between her family or the animal.

The U.K. outlet obtained an advance copy of the book, in which Noem reportedly admits to shooting her wirehaired pointer puppy after the excited dog ruined a hunt and later killed a neighbour's chicken. Cricket also tried to bite her, Noem wrote.\n\n\"I hated that dog,\" the book reads. \"It was not a pleasant job but it had to be done. And after it was over, I realized another unpleasant job needed to be done.\"\n\nNoem went on to kill one of her uncastrated male goats, who she described as \"disgusting, musky, rancid.\"\n\nDuring Sunday's interview, Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan brought up another passage from Noem's book that referenced the dog-killing story.\n\n\"At the end of the book, you say the very first thing you would do if you got to the White House, that was different from Joe Biden, is you'd make sure Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds. 'Commander, say hello to Cricket,'\" Brennan quoted.\n\nNoem replied that Commander \"has attacked 24 Secret Service people. So how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog and what to do with it? That's the question that the president should be held accountable to.\"\n\nCommander, a German Shepherd owned by the Bidens, has been involved in at least 24 biting incidents and was relocated from the White House as a result.\n\n\"You're saying (Commander) should be shot?\" Brennan asked.\n\n\"That's what the president should be accountable to,\" Noem replied.\n\nNoem also faced a question from Brennan about why she determined that Cricket, at 14 months old, was \"untrainable\" and why the governor didn't just surrender the dog to a shelter.\n\n\"I had put months and months of training into this dog. This dog had gone to other trainers, as well,\" Noem explained. \"That's the choice I made over 20 years ago... I didn't ask somebody else to take that responsibility for me.\"\n\nThe governor also said she feared for her children's safety and made a \"difficult choice\" to protect her family.\"\n\n\"Would you make a choice between your children or a dangerous animal?

Kristi Noem (R-SD) ostensibly to promote her new memoir -- but as everyone knows, it really acts as the South Dakota governor's audition to become former President Donald Trump's running mate -- can only be described as suicidal. And that might be intentional.\n\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee has reportedly been considering Noem for his vice presidential pick, alongside a short list that includes Sens. Tim Scott (R-SC) and J.D. Vance (R-OH), Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), and Gov. Doug Burgum (R-ND). That is until Noem decided to dish gleefully on executing her \"less than worthless\" 14-month-old puppy Cricket in her memoir and then proceeded to stand firm on killing her canine on national television.\n\n\"The reason it's in the book is because this book is filled with tough, challenging decisions that I had to make throughout my life,\" Noem said on television, although the memoir's jovial tone makes clear she didn't consider gunning down the pup a \"tough\" decision at all.\n\nNoem also inexplicably claimed in the memoir she had met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, equating him to the \"little tyrants\" she had previously \"star[ed] down\" as \"a children's pastor.\" When asked by CBS's Margaret Brennan point blank whether she had ever actually met the fratricidal dictator, Noem refused to answer.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I'm just not going to do that,\" Noem said. \"This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book. And as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that that was adjusted.\"\n\nWhile the popular explanation of Noem's bleak book tour is that she was too lazy to read the manuscript actually authored by a ghostwriter, Noem narrated the audiobook. Presumably, she heard herself claim to meet one of the most infamous men in the world, one whose every encounter is globally surveilled and reported on, rendering a claim such as Noem's easily falsifiable.\n\nTrump is reportedly \"disgusted\" by the fallout, which may very well be the point if, as it appears, Noem doesn't want to win Trump's nomination.\n\nAlthough Noem has a fixed, term-limited retirement deadline at the start of 2027, she presumably wants some sort of future in the GOP, and that means she cannot possibly turn Trump down if he actually asks her to join the 2024 ticket. Without a compelling reason, Noem would be relegated to Trump's Truth Social feed as a MAGAvatar of disloyalty and disdain to the movement. Noem could avoid such a fate by waiting out her term far away from Washington and then either joining Trump's administration as a lower-profile appointment or trying to replace Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD), who will be well into his 70s, as he is due reelection right when Noem departs the governor's mansion.\n\nThe reason for not wanting to win the \"veepstakes\" is obvious. We all saw how Trump rewarded Mike Pence for four straight years of unyielding loyalty when the vice president followed through on his legal and constitutional mandate to certify the 2020 election: When a violent mob, including those chanting they would \"hang Mike Pence,\" stormed the Capitol and forced Pence and his family to hide for their lives, Trump did nothing. He refused to call off rioters threatening to murder his most loyal consigliere.\n\nOne can recognize the national security and economic threat posed by a second presidential term for Joe Biden and support Trump's reelection more generally without personally wanting to sign up as his second-in-command. Not to mention that anyone, especially a Republican woman, tapped by Trump will be torn to shreds by a global gang of Democratic opposition researchers and corporate press (not that these really differ in practice).\n\nWhen Noem made the baffling decision to cut a social media promotion for veneers she scored from a Texas dental practice, she committed much worse than the \"undisclosed advertisement\" corruption she was accused of. Rather, as an attractive woman in politics held to a persistently different standard by the public, Noem committed the fatal political error of revealing that, indeed, sometimes, attractive women have an assist in the form of cosmetic enhancements. Noem, who has been an attractive woman in politics for nearly two decades, from the state House to the People's House to Pierre, likely did not do this by accident but rather to take her further out of the running for running mate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nNone of this is to mention the persistent but unproven reports that the married Noem had an affair with professional mess Corey Lewandowski, and while the moral majority may now be fine with electing men who have repeatedly committed adultery, the electorate may not be ready to degrade women to the same standards.\n\nThe only other alternative here is that Noem, who managed to make it to Congress without a bachelor's degree and the White House short list from the fifth smallest state in the union, is actually a moron.

Kristi Noem of South Dakota, center, makes false claims in her book about meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, right, and canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. (GV Wire Composite/Paul Marshall)\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a possible VP pick on Donald Trump's 2024 ticket, asserts that she has met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but an investigation reveals the claim -- and others -- to be fabricated.\n\nA recent update to an upcoming book by Noem addresses concerns over inaccuracies regarding meetings with world leaders. The book, titled \"No Going Back,\" has stirred controversy not only for its account of the governor shooting a dog but also for two disputed instances involving international leaders.\n\nIn the book, Noem claims to have met with Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress and scheduled a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, which she canceled.\n\nHowever, there is no independent verification of this meeting through congressional travel records or other sources. In addition, the French president's office has confirmed that Noem did not have a scheduled meeting with Macron.\n\nFormer congressional staffers have expressed skepticism about Noem's alleged meeting with Kim Jong Un, citing the logistical implausibility and North Korea's diplomatic practices.\n\nRelated Story: Trump's Potential VP Pick Boasts About Executing Puppy\n\nNoem's office has not provided further details or clarification on these matters.\n\nThe book also details Noem's interactions with other world leaders, such as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, in more documented and effusive terms. However, the accuracy of these accounts has not been disputed.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the book extends beyond its international narratives.

So how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog?\" Noem said, before anchor Margaret Brennan interrupted to point out that Commander does not live at the White House anymore.\n\n\"And that's the question that the President should be held accountable to,\" Noem added.\n\nBrennan then directly asked Noem if she was saying Commander should have been shot.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"That what's the president should be accountable to.

She added that when she grabbed Cricket, the dog \"whipped around to bite me.\"\n\n\"At that moment,\" Noem wrote, \"I realized I had to put her down.\"\n\nThe governor also wrote that she \"hated that dog,\" describing it as \"untrainable\" and \"dangerous to anyone she came in contact with.\"\n\nThe excerpt drew widespread condemnation, with many Republican critics arguing that Noem should not have shot the dog, but instead could have trained it or rehomed it. Others questioned why she willingly wrote about the incident in her book.\n\nFace the Nation host Margaret Brennan pressed Noem on Sunday about the political implications of the controversy, as well as criticism from former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who recently told Politico, \"Killing the dog and then writing about it ended any possibility of her being picked as VP.\"\n\n\"On this point, because you have been rumored to be a potential vice presidential candidate, as you know. And former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said, 'Killing the dog and then writing about it ended any possibility of her being picked as VP'...Are you doing this to try to look tough? Do you think that you still have a shot at being VP?\" Brennan asked.\n\nNoem largely dismissed the criticism while also defending her decision to put the dog down.\n\n\"I would say about Republicans criticizing me, these are the same Republicans that criticized me during COVID. They criticized me when I've made other decisions in South Dakota to protect my state,\" she said. \"My state today is extremely happy and thriving. We're doing well. We've got thousands of people moving to our state because they love the opportunities that are here and the businesses that have come.\"\n\nBrennan also asked Noem if she has any regrets about sharing the story amid the criticism.\n\nNoem said the excerpt was worth sharing because she believes that \"people need to understand who I am and some of those difficult decisions.\"\n\n\"This was a dangerous animal that was killing livestock and attacking people. And I had little children at the time. Our operation had many kids running around and people in interaction with the public. And I made a difficult choice,\" the governor said.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Noem's office for comment via email.\n\nNoem previously responded to the criticism on X, formerly Twitter, and wrote: \"I can understand why some people are upset about a 20-year-old story of Cricket, one of the working dogs at our ranch, in my upcoming book -- No Going Back. The book is filled with many honest stories of my life, good and bad days, challenges, painful decisions, and lessons learned.\"\n\nNoem also contended that she \"followed the law and was being a responsible parent, dog owner, and neighbor.\"\n\n\"South Dakota law states that dogs who attack and kill livestock can be put down. Given that Cricket had shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did. As I explained in the book, it wasn't easy. But often the easy way isn't the right way,\" she continued.\n\nPolymarket, an online prediction platform where users can place \"yes\" or \"no\" bets on the likelihood of world events, gave Noem a 3 percent chance of potentially being the next Republican vice president after the incident about Cricket emerged.\n\nOn April 26, Noem was given a 5 percent chance of being selected as Trump's next running mate, down from 10 percent the previous day. On March 25, Polymarket was listing Noem as the second favorite with 9 percent chance, behind South Carolina Senator Tim Scott on 22 percent.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_stanton@newsweek.com", "name": "Andrew Stanton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_America_Forward", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Move America Forward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newt_Gingrich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newt Gingrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2388327/kristi-noem-republican-criticism.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=6ad6f1ea9621f653ef8426cfca99c0b5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 4101, "textEnd": 4109}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-25", "textStart": 4235, "textEnd": 4243}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Kristi Noem wrote that she shot and killed her 14-month-old puppy, Cricket. She's since doubled and tripled down on her decision and is now apparently quadrupling down, suggesting that Commander Biden should also be killed.\n\nIn April, an excerpt from the forthcoming memoir of South Dakota Gov. and (probably former) Trump veepstakes hopeful Kristi Noem (R) revealed Noem killed her puppy, Cricket. She's since justified her decision to shoot the 14-month-old pup in a gravel pit by saying Cricket -- who was apparently supposed to be a hunting dog -- was hard to train, easily excitable, and once killed some chickens. Now, in a new excerpt of the memoir shared over the weekend, Noem writes that she wants President Joe Biden's dog, Commander, to \"say hello to Cricket for me.\" Um...??!!!!!\n\n\"What would I do if I was president on the first day in office in 2025? Thanks for asking. I happen to have a list. The first thing I'd do is make sure Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds ('Commander, say hello to Cricket for me'). But my dog, Foster, would sure be welcome. He comes with me to the capitol all the time and loves everyone,\" Noem writes. Very cool, normal stuff!\n\nThat bloodthirsty (fur-thirsty??) snippet alone could speak for itself, but alas, in a Sunday interview on CBS' Face the Nation, Noem went out of her way to seemingly reiterate that she would, in fact, kill Biden's dog.\n\n\"Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people. So, how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog and what to do with it?\" Noem said. She seems to be referencing reporting from February that the Biden family's German shepherd bit Secret Service personnel on 24 different occasions at the White House and other locations, per CNN. Commander was removed from the White House in October. (He was simply relocated, but fret not, he is very much alive and very much still the Biden family's dog.)\n\n\"You're saying [Commander] should be shot?\" Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan asked Noem. \"That's what the president should be accountable to,\" Noem replied. \"What is the number\" of times Commander should bite people, she asked, before taking a hard pivot to say that any Republican criticizing her is the \"same Republicans that criticized me during covid.\" OK.\n\nThis lady is just... so weird? Who is this obsessed with killing dogs other than serial killers. After the first excerpt came out, it was reported that this had effectively disqualified Noem from Trump VP contention, due to the very obvious fact that American voters across the political spectrum love dogs and loathe dog abusers. As we've seen with Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in 2012 or Dr. Oz's Senate race in 2022, mistreating dogs is where pretty much everyone -- even Trump campaign operatives -- draw the line.\n\nYet, here Noem is, doubling, tripling, and now, quadrupling down on just how much she wanted to kill not just her own dog, but apparently wants to kill her political enemies' dogs, too.\n\nIn her memoir, Noem writes that she had to kill Cricket because of Cricket's \"aggressive personality.\"\n\n\"I hated that dog,\" she wrote, calling Cricket \"untrainable,\" \"worthless as a hunting dog,\" and \"dangerous to anyone she came in contact with.\"\n\nEarlier in the interview on Sunday, when Brennan asked Noem about her decision to kill Cricket, Noem responded, \"I made a difficult choice. I think you're a mother, too. And you have little kiddos. Would you make a choice between your children or a dangerous animal? And I think I would ask everybody in the country to put themselves in that situation.\" Except...??? Even in Noem's own words in her memoir, Cricket hardly sounds scary enough to warrant death by firing squad. As some have pointed out, Cricket just \"gets more vicious with each re-telling\" from Noem, because she knows she doesn't have any actual moral ground to stand on to justify shooting a 14-month dog.\n\nYou can re-home dogs! You can give them to shelters! You can do many things that aren't shooting them! And, guess what: For the sake of what meager political career might still be salvageable for you at this point, you can also shut up about killing dogs.", "source": {"uri": "jezebel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jezebel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kylie_cheung@jezebel.com", "name": "Kylie Cheung", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Shepherd", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "German Shepherd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney_2012_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney 2012 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/juploads/2024/05/kristi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

She secured reelection in 2022 after representing the state in Congress since 2011. However, controversies surrounding her memoir have sparked debates.South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem's new memoir, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" has stirred controversy over claims of meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and her admission of shooting her dog. Here's a breakdown of the unfolding controversy surrounding Noem's book.\n\nIn her memoir, Noem recounts a purported meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her tenure as South Dakota's representative in Congress. She describes the encounter as part of her global diplomatic engagements. However, doubts arose regarding the accuracy of this assertion, prompting Noem's spokesperson to clarify that the mention of Kim Jong Un was an error, as mentioned in a report by TIME. Ian Fury stated that the book's publisher would address the inclusion of the North Korean leader among world figures, attributing it to a mistake.\n\nBefore the controversy surrounding her memoir surfaced, Noem was considered a potential Vice Presidential candidate for former President Donald Trump. However, reports indicate that she had fallen off the shortlist even before these revelations emerged. The book's controversies have brought further scrutiny to Noem's political standing and raised questions about her suitability for higher office.\n\nAside from the purported encounter with Kim Jong Un, Noem's memoir drew criticism for her admission of shooting her 14-month-old dog, Cricket. Noem justified her actions by citing the dog's aggressive behavior, which allegedly posed a threat to livestock and people. This revelation sparked outrage among animal welfare advocates and the public, further overshadowing the book's release.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Noem defended her decision to euthanize Cricket, stating that South Dakota law permits the disposal of dogs that attack and kill livestock. She emphasized her commitment to upholding the law and assuming responsibility, whether in ranch management or politics. Despite facing condemnation, Noem reiterated her stance on adhering to legal mandates and fulfilling her obligations as a rancher, pet owner, and community member, according to a TIME magazine article.\n\nKristi Noem, a Republican, made history as South Dakota's first female governor, securing reelection in 2022 after serving in Congress since 2011. However, the controversies surrounding her memoir have raised questions about her leadership and judgment, potentially impacting her political trajectory and legacy.\n\nKristi Noem, born to Ron and Corinne Arnold in Watertown, South Dakota, spent her formative years with her siblings on their family ranch and farm in rural Hamlin County.

Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation, Margaret Brennan called her out over the reported inaccuracies -- and the governor didn't like it.\n\nIn a testy clash Sunday, Brennan pressed Noem over the false claim that she met with Kim Jong Un -- a claim which her team seemed to lay at the feet of the book's ghostwriter and editor.\n\n\"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors,\" Mr. Fury said. \"This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor. Kim Jong-un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been.\"\n\nBut examining the full context, the tale about Kim Jong Un was very specific.\n\n\"I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders -- some who wanted our help, and some who didn't. I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all). Dealing with foreign leaders takes resolve, preparation, and determination.\"\n\nSunday morning, Brennan bluntly asked Noem, \"Did you meet Kim Jong Un?\"\n\n\"As soon as this was brought to my attention, I certainly made some changes and looked at this passage,\" Noem said. \"And I've met with many, many world leaders. I've traveled around the world. As soon as it was brought to my attention, we went forward and have made some edits.\"\n\n\"So you did not meet with Kim Jong Un?\" Brennan said. \"That's what you're saying.\"\n\nNoem oddly refused to say.\n\n\"You know, I met with many, many world leaders, many world leaders,\" Noem said. \"I've traveled around the world. I think I've talked extensively in this book about my time serving in Congress, my time as governor, before governor, some of the travels that I've had, I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I'm just not going to do that. This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book. And as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that that was adjusted.\"\n\nBrennan was still trying to get to the bottom of how the mistake happened.\n\n\"I'm wondering, who is it that you confused Kim Jong Un with?\" Brennan said. After an exchange in which Noem confrimed she has visited North Korea and the DMZ, Brennan followed up by saying, \"I'm asking about that specifically because you made the point to bring [Kim] up twice and that he was a little tyrant.\"\n\n\"You have a question for me, Margaret?\" Noem said, icily.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" Brennan said -- before noting that Noem read the passage in question while she was recording the audiobook. \"I know you read this book before it was published because you released video of your recording of the audio book. You didn't catch these errors when you were recording it?\"\n\nNoem, like Tim Scott before her on this Sunday morning, deflected to blame the media to avoid answering a question she didn't like.\n\n\"This is what is so discouraging about politics and the media today is that we have the White House that just recently came out and confirmed that President Joe Biden has misspoken, has made mistakes, has even outright lied over close to 150 times just this year,\" Noem said. \"And you've done nothing to question him on any of that.\"\n\n\"I'm asking you about your book here, which we have,\" Brennan said.\n\n\"I'm just asking why am I being treated differently than every other person that you've interviewed?\" Noem said. \"I've looked at your last interviews -- \"\n\n\"I'm quoting you,\" Brennan said.\n\n\"You don't interrupt other people,\" Noem said. \"You let them talk.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ghostwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korean Demilitarized Zone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen-Shot-2024-05-05-at-11.26.43-AM-scaled-e1714922927799.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Kristi Noem, R-S.D., hits back at critics following outrage over excerpts from her new memoir that reveals she once killed a dog on 'Hannity.'\n\nA highly anticipated 2024 ticket, a controversial dog tale, and feeling \"threatened\" by Nikki Haley - Gov. Kristi Noem's, R-S.D., newest book unpacks her role in leadership and experience behind the scenes of D.C. politics.\n\nNoem's book, titled \"No Going Back\" details her life lessons through her family farming business, service in congress, and current role as Governor. And despite not yet hitting the shelves, the conservative's book has already stirred up the news cycle.\n\nThe Governor hunkered down on her support for former President Donald Trump, who she described as a \"bull in a china shop\" in the book, shared with Fox News Digital ahead of its release Tuesday.\n\nTrump recently confirmed the Republican governor was on his shortlist for vice president, and when asked about the coveted position, Noem said she wants the former president \"to pick who's going to help him win.\"\n\nDEFIANT KRISTI NOEM DEFENDS KILLING FARM PUP AMID CRITICISM FROM DEMS, GOP\n\n\"He knows that I'll do whatever I can to help him win. But every day, it's clear to me that our way of life is under attack. And unless he gets in the White House, this country is going to see some very challenging times ahead,\" Noem told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview ahead of the book launch.\n\nAhead of the book launch, there was one released excerpt in particular that drew serious controversy - a story of Noem putting down her hunting dog.\n\nVP STAKES: TRUMP MEETING WITH POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES THIS WEEKEND\n\nThe story went as follows. Noem had a young dog, Cricket, who she described as \"untrainable\" and having an \"aggressive personality.\" One day, the dog jumped out of her car, proceeded to kill several of her neighbors' chickens, and nearly bit Noem as she tried to control it. So Noem decided to put the dog down, along with a \"demon goat\" on her farm.\n\nLawmakers, on both sides of the aisle, criticized the governor on social media for the story, with a bipartisan group even launching the Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus just days after the excerpt was released. The governor defended including the story in her book, telling Fox \"it was a difficult decision and a vulnerable story.\"\n\n\"I'm not surprised that those who have always attacked me are attacking me. Republicans and Democrats who attacked me during Covid are the same ones who are attacking me now,\" Noem said when asked about the backlash from the story. \"But I think the average citizen, when they read that story will recognize that I put the safety of people in my hands above an animal that was killing livestock and attacking people.\"\n\nTRUMP EYES 2 BATTLEGROUND STATES AS HE LOOKS TO TEAR DOWN DEM 'BLUE WALL' AGAIN\n\nNoem also recalled a phone call with former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, revealing that she felt \"threatened\" by the former presidential candidate.\n\n\"That's the thing with Nikki Haley: you never know who she's going to be tomorrow,\" Noem wrote. \"She's going to be whatever the polls or donors tell her to be. And that should be very scary to the American people. The people who know her the best, including some colleagues in her home state, seem to have the same concerns.\"\n\nAfter Haley's team told Politico the story was a \"twist\" of the conversation, Noem told Fox News Digital that she was \"not surprised\" by the response.\n\n\"I think Nikki says whatever is convenient for Nikki that day,\" Noem told Fox. \"I've watched this for years now. You never know who she's going to be tomorrow. She tends to be motivated by what works and what the polling says, and that's not the kind of politicians we need leading our country.\"\n\nReflecting on GOP losses in the 2022 midterms, Noem wrote that \"the fact that our party did not achieve a majority in the US Senate was a failure by the Republican National Committee.\" Noem added \"Donald Trump and a handful of brave folks broke politics. But what do we do now? Instead of \"fixing\" politics by going back to the \"good old days,\" let's step into the chaos and move the nation forward. Our best days truly are ahead.\"\n\nNoem's book will be officially launched on Tuesday, May 7th.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The new book is called No Going Back. And it's about what's wrong with politics and how we're going to move America forward.

Her camp subsequently conceded she never met the North Korean leader.\n\nAdditionally, a spokesperson for former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley denied the book's characterization of a conversation between Haley and Noem, who claimed Haley threatened her after she challenged Haley's status as a leading woman in the Republican party.\n\nThe book claims the conversation occurred when Noem first took office in 2019, but it was a year later.\n\nWhatever the case, Noem's chief of communications, Ian Fury, told The New York Times that both errors would be corrected.\n\n\"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book No Going Back has two small errors,\" Fury said to the Times. \"This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor. Kim Jong-un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been.\"\n\nSeparately on Friday, the chairperson of Colorado's Jefferson county Republican party said the organization canceled its annual fundraiser because Noem's planned headlining appearance had spurred multiple threats.\n\nNoem was still set to headline Florida's Brevard county Republican party fundraiser on 25 May. The county party's chairperson defended Noem's decision to kill Cricket, and the purchase of a ticket includes a copy of No Going Back.\n\nRounding out the South Dakota governor's Friday was the Rolling Stone report based on sources of the publication who recounted how Trump has expressed disgust with Noem's killing of Cricket in closed-door meetings and telephone conversations.\n\n\"Why would she do that?\" Trump - who is grappling with nearly 90 felony criminal charges, among other legal problems - was quoted as saying. \"What is wrong with her?\"\n\nRolling Stone added: \"He has expressed bewilderment that she would have ever admitted to doing this, willingly and in her own writing, and has argued it demonstrates she has a poor grasp of 'public relations'.\"\n\nThe publication also wrote that Trump's responses were leaked to definitively eliminate Noem from vice-presidential contention.\n\nNoem is scheduled to appear on Sunday morning on CBS's Face the Nation and is expected to be asked about the ongoing fallout from her new book.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Kristi Noem's (R-SD) new memoir will no doubt go down in history as a case study for how not to write a book as a politician.\n\nStill a few days before the whole book is released, more anecdotes from Noem's memoir No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward are emerging. And they are further sullying the governor's image.\n\nJust days after the release of an excerpt that detailed how she shot a farm puppy named Cricket, another anecdotal story from the memoir includes details from Noem's time on the House Armed Services Committee and how this afforded her the opportunity to meet the reclusive leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un.\n\n\"Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders,\" Noem writes in the book. \"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.

The only problem is that it is entirely false. Members of Congress do not go to North Korea to meet Kim Jong Un, because only odd ducks such as former basketball star Dennis Rodman go to North Korea to meet Kim Jong Un. In fact, no president had even met with the leader of North Korea until Donald Trump did in 2018.\n\nAnother anecdote from the book is in serious dispute as well, where Noem accuses former U.N.

It's More Kristi Noem Book Drama", "body": "Barf Bag: The infamous book in which the South Dakota Governor voluntarily shares that she executed her dog, Cricket, has more weird stories.\n\nOne week ago, we learned that South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) wrote in her own book that she shot and killed a 14-month-old puppy meant to be a hunting dog because it was \"untrainable\" and tried to bite her. I regret to inform you that there's more Noem Nonsense to report, including potential fabrications in said book about other lawmakers. But first: #PuppyGate Updates. (Yes, another #PuppyGate.)\n\nNoem has been doubling and tripling down on why she had to drag the young dog named Cricket to a gravel pit and execute her, rather than trying to find Cricket a new home. She told Fox News that it was a \"working dog, not a puppy\" and was \"extremely dangerous,\" so she had to put the wirehaired pointer down for her children's sake.\n\nEven Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) -- who notoriously strapped the carrier of the family dog Seamus to the roof of their car for an hours-long drive in the 80s -- had some fun dunking on Noem. \"I didn't shoot my dog,\" Romney said. Noem's chances to be Donald Trump's running mate are essentially over because, in the United States, many people love dogs more than they do other human beings. One Trumpworld source told the Daily Beast, \"This stuff is devastating. There's nothing more popular in politics than dogs, and she killed one -- and she continues to talk about it... That's what's baffling and shows out of control judgment.\"\n\nBut it appears there's even more drama surrounding her forthcoming book, titled No Going Back. Noem writes in the book that she, as a mere member of the House Armed Services Committee, somehow met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. She said of the likely fictional meeting that the leader \"underestimated\" her, but that, as a children's pastor, she had \"experience staring down little tyrants.\" Ma'am, I don't think yelling at a seven-year-old to stop picking his nose is the same skill set as dealing with an authoritarian.\n\nIan Fury, a spokesperson for Noem, conceded that there are errors in the book, telling Politico, \"We've been made aware that the publisher will be addressing conflated world leaders' names in the book before it is released.\" It looks like her publisher, at least, will be Going Back.", "source": {"uri": "jezebel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jezebel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susan_rinkunas@jezebel.com", "name": "Susan Rinkunas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Dakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Going_Back_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "No Going Back (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/juploads/2024/05/krsitibarfbag.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

More about that in a moment. Noem was scheduled to go to CO-07 for a fundraiser and book signing Saturday May 4. It was cancelled out of \"safety concerns\" and then it comes out that a massive protest was planned. And in all fairness, that could be cause to worry about safety. This is just one more railroad spike in Noem's coffin.\n\nJefferson County Republican Party Chair Nancy Pallozzi said in a statement Friday that the group's fundraising dinner, which was set to take place Saturday, was being cancelled \"due to safety concerns\" after the group, the governor and her staff, and the hotel hosting the event received \"numerous threats and/or death threats.\"\n\n\"After a conversation with the Governor's office late Wednesday, we mutually decided that safety was the most important concern for everyone involved,\" Pallozzi said. \"The Denver West Marriott also received alarming comments and shared with us their deep concern over the safety and security for those attending our event, other guests, and their staff.\"\n\nNoem was confirmed to be a keynote speaker at the Jefferson County Republicans' annual fundraiser in early April after the group sent her an invitation in January, Pallozzi said.\n\nThat was before The Guardian released an article late last month that described Noem's account of leading her 14-month-old dog, Cricket, to a gravel pit to be shot after concluding it was \"less than worthless\" and \"untrainable.\"\n\nThis last minute change would, conveniently, free Noem up to attend Donald Trump's fundraising bash in Mar-a-Lago, also this weekend. I'm going to bet you won't see her there.\n\nNow, as to what else Noem has done to blow up her campaign. You may have read here earlier today how Noem claimed to have met Kin Jong-Un and \"stared him down.\" She also said she had experience in \"staring little tyrants down\" having once been a youth pastor. I am seriously beginning to wonder if whoever wrote this book for Noem was a an undercover Democratic operative, because the more that comes out about this woman's book, the more utterly clueless and ridiculous she seems.\n\nKristi Noem is turning into the Ron DeSantis of VP candidates. If you didn't know that much about her, she seemed fine. She had the MAGA look, MAGA appeal, she toadies to Trump, all should be well, right? If she hadn't published this stupid book, she might in fact be in the running for VP. She's managed to destroy her political career in one week, astonishingly. Say what you will about Ron and Casey DeSantis, it took them a couple of months to self-immolate.\n\nAnd there is a larger lesson here. This is basically the Peter Principle in action. Both Noem and DeSantis got to a certain level in politics. They rose to the level that they could go and that level was not national. DeSantis was a terrible presidential candidate and his campaign was on of the most inept ever seen. Likewise, in her quest to let people \"know her better\" -- which is what I presume was the purpose of her book -- she has only shown herself to be a heartless, tone deaf person and now an out and out liar.\n\nThe dog anecdote did not set well. If there's one things Americans are, it's animal lovers. We adore our four footed family members. We love them more than we love other people. Noem tried to spin the story later as her protecting her children from a vicious dog, but that was way too late and a stupid excuse.\n\nAnd the Kim Jong-Un story is stupid. It's too easy to vet. She never met Kim.\n\nBoth anecdotes have one thing in common and that's that they were evidently shared to evoke some kind of a reaction -- and they did do that -- but it was emphatically not the reaction Noem was looking to evoke. And the other thing that both anecdotes have in common is that it's assumed that people are stupid and that they will see the world through the eyes of Kristi Noem and agree with her.\n\nWhatever ghostwriter did this (and I'm assuming she had a ghostwriter. Maybe she did not and maybe that's the problem right there) hates Kristi Noem. That's pretty clear. Or, maybe Noem did pen the piece herself and she simply doesn't know the basics of writing anything autobiographical is that first of all you tell the complete truth about what happened and then you let the chips fall where they may. She doesn't like that end of it. Assuming she told the complete truth about hating Cricket, that's fine. She told the truth. Now be prepared for the blowback that the average American just can't deal with the image of shooting a family pet like that.\n\nNoem characterized Cricket as a \"working dog.\" Fine. Lassie was a working dog, too, but the story of Lassie is so tear jerking that all you can think about is the devotion that Lassie had to her people, not how she kept the sheep together.\n\nBefore all this blew up there were other signs that Noem wasn't who she professed to be. She's not welcome on the reservations of the Oglala tribe. And there was that business a few years ago when she had a real estate appraiser examination changed so that her daughter could pass it.\n\nNoem needs to be out of politics. She's achieved that end for herself, incredibly. And what is more incredible still, is I don't think she understands what really has happened here. Noem immediately jumped into damage control mode on Sean Hannity's show where she carried on about the \"fake news spin.\" What's the fake news part of this story? Did she shoot the dog or not? Did she say she hated it, and that it was worthless, or not? Again, IF Noem wrote this herself, the demand she's making is that people experience life through a Kristi Noem lens. And unfortunately for her, callous slaughter of animals is not normal.\n\nMaybe that's the part she can't get. Maybe Sean Hannity can explain it to her.", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PolitiZoom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ursula_faw@politizoom.com", "name": "Ursula Faw",

But when I do hear bad things, I will make sure that you know.\"\n\nNoem wrote that she perceived the call as a threat. A spokesperson for Haley told the Times and Politico that Noem's characterization of the conversation is inaccurate, and that Haley \"has long called and written notes supporting other women when they go through challenging times.\"\n\nThe book will be corrected in the future to say the conversation happened in 2020, not 2021, Fury told the Times.\n\nNoem's memoir has gained attention in recent days for an account of shooting a 14-month-old wirehair pointer on her family farm.\n\nNoem described the dog as \"untrainable\" and ruined a hunt and attacked chickens. It acted like a \"trained assassin\" that was \"dangerous to anyone she came in contact with,\" she wrote.\n\nThe anecdote drew backlash from both sides of the aisle and quickly became fodder for Noem's political opponents. The Democratic National Committee called the excerpts from the book \"horrifying\" and \"disturbing.\"\n\nNoem has defended the story as a reality of farm life, and as an indicator that she can face \"difficult, messy and ugly\" tasks.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "riley_beggin@usatoday.com", "name": "Riley Beggin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Going_Back_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "No Going Back (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghostwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/E-Books", "label": "dmoz/Computers/E-Books", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/30/USAT/73509918007-20230909-t-013221-z-782958407-rc-2-p-43-ajgb-8-r-rtrmadp-3-usatrump.JPG?crop=5499,3094,x0,y286&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

In those unapologetic pages, Noem proudly recounts the time she brutally shot her 14-month-old Wirehaired Pointer named Cricket.\n\nLet that sink in for a moment. A puppy, barely out of infancy, was shot in cold blood by this despicable excuse for a human being, all because it showed a bit too much enthusiasm for its natural instincts. What's next on Noem's list of capital offenses, puppies who piddle on the carpet or chew on shoes? Given her demonstrated lack of empathy, it would not be surprising if Noem had already compiled an extensive watchlist of canine \"criminals\" just waiting for their day of reckoning.\n\nAnd indeed, Noem has now set her sights on a new target -- the First Dog, Commander. In a recent appearance on Face the Nation, Noem tripled down on her mindless attempt to present herself as a tough leader by killing animals as she acknowledged that her despicable book contains the line, \"Commander, meet Cricket,\" as well as the threat that if she sets foot in the White House, Biden's dog, Commander, would meet the same grisly fate as poor Cricket.\n\nThis is beyond the pale, even for a Republican politician. Commander's alleged \"crime\" is nipping a few Secret Service agents - hardly an offense worthy of death, and something that could likely be resolved with proper training and supervision. But in Noem's twisted worldview, any transgression, no matter how minor, is grounds for a summary execution.\n\nHas Noem been taking cues from ATF agent/dog-killer extraordinaire from John Wick? Or perhaps she's trying to one-up fellow Republican Mike Huckabee's son, who once gleefully recounted hanging a dog as a Boy Scout.\n\nYou know, I'm starting to understand why Republicans are so vehemently opposed to any form of gun control. They're not worried about their rights; they just want to make sure they have unfettered access to firearms when the urge to slaughter an innocent puppy strikes.\n\nIt's becoming increasingly clear that Noem has some serious issues that include a disturbing and wonky mindset. In the same Face the Nation interview, when host Margaret Brennan asked about her claim in the book that she met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, Noem suddenly got cagey. Now I don't know about that part, what she wanted to hide, but it's almost as if she realized that casually name-dropping a brutal despot in the the memoir would boost her own thirst for blood. Margaret then pointed out the lines from her book:\n\nI remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all)\n\nSo, apparently, Noem views children as \"little tyrants\" to be \"stared down.\" This isn't just unhinged -- it's downright psychopathic. Is it any wonder, then, that she views puppies as disposable objects to be shot on a whim?\n\nI'm not sure what's more disturbing - the fact that Noem seems to think puppy-killing is a point of pride, or that she believes tripling down on this deranged narrative will somehow boost her memoir sales and political clout. I mean, I've heard of politicians doing some crazy things to stay relevant, but \"Puppy Killer\" seems like a hell of a hill to die on.\n\nIf this is the best the Republican Party has to offer, then we're all in serious trouble.\n\nKristi Noem is a vile, heartless monster who has no business holding any public office. If you see Noem anywhere near a child or puppy again, do the right thing - tackle her to the ground and call animal control. God help us all if this unhinged psychopath ever gets anywhere near the White House.

I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nCNBC reported this week Trump \"will mingle with potential vice presidential running mates and wealthy Republican donors at the Republican National Committee's spring donor retreat. The meetings are likely to act as informal tryouts for a short list of politicos in the running to join the Trump ticket.\"\n\nThe list of Republican \"special guests\" includes U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Tim Scott, and J.D. Vance, Rep. Elise Stefanik, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, and South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem.\n\nAlso expected to attend are House Speaker Mike Johnson, U.S. Reps.

Kristi Noem Monday after she issued a bizarre call in a TV interview to have the president's banished German shepherd Commander put down after a series of biting incidents.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre delivered the unusually sharp response after Noem made the comment Sunday while trying to contain the pet issue that already has observers saying it could wipe her off Donald Trump's list of vice presidential contenders.\n\nDays ago, Jean-Pierre called revelations that Noem had her own pup shot in a gravel pit immediately after killing chickens from a neighbor's flock 'sad.'\n\n'When we learned last week, obviously like all of you, in her book that she killed her puppy, you heard me say that was very sad. We find her comments from yesterday disturbing,' Jean-Pierre told reporters.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called it 'disturbing' and 'absurd' after South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem suggested President Biden's dog Commander (who has left the White House) be put down\n\n'We find them absurd. And, and here - this is a country that loves dogs. And you have a leader talking about putting dogs down, killing them. And that's a disturbing statement. I would say her she should probably should stop digging herself in a hole.'\n\nIt was a pointedly direct comment for the press secretary, who frequently tries to dodge volatile questions by referring to government agencies or invoking rules she says bar her from venturing a response.\n\nHer words prompted reporters to shout out more follow ups, including about the status of Commander, who left he White House last fall after a series of concerning biting incidents involving Secret Service members.\n\n'Commander is living with family members,' she said.\n\nHer response came after Noem suggested President Joe Biden's dog Commander should be put down because of his aggressive behavior in another stunning defense of shooting dead her 14-month-old puppy.\n\nThe South Dakota Republican said she told the story about killing her farm dog Cricket because 'people need to understand who I am.'\n\nAt the end of her book where she told the story about shooting and killing the dog, Noem suggested that Biden's German Shepherd Commander should be put down, writing the dog should 'say hello to Cricket.'\n\nShe doubled-down on Sunday, telling CBS Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan that she does think it would be best to put down the president's dog, who was removed from the White House complex after a series of attacks.\n\nPrepared: Jean-Pierre was ready with a response when a reporter asked about Noem's comments at Monday's White House press briefing\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem doubled down on suggesting President Joe Biden's dog Commander should be put down\n\nBiden's German Shepard Commander was removed from the White House complex after multiple reports of biting incidents\n\n'Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people,' Noem said. 'So how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog.'\n\nShe added: 'That's the question that the President should be held accountable to.'\n\nSeveral reports emerged about how Commander exhibited aggressive behavior toward staff and specifically posed safety issues and bite risks for Secret Service agents.\n\nShe dodged Brennan's question, however, on whether she felt that Commander ' should be shot.'\n\nNoem said that she took care of her 'untrainable' dog the correct way by taking Cricket to a gravel pit and shooting her after aggressive behaviors like killing neighbor's chickens and trying to bite her.\n\nCritics claim that Noem, who shot her dog while her kids were at school, could have rehomed the dog or surrendered to a shelter that may have been better equipped to train the animal.\n\nNoem detailed in her upcoming book a story about shooting and killing her 'dangerous' 14-month-old farm puppy Cricket (not pictured)\n\nNoem's book No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward hits shelves on May 7. The release follows a few weeks of criticism after an excerpt was published in The Guardian where the governor told a two-decade old story about killing her family's farm dog.\n\n'The reason that this story is in the book -- because people need to understand who I am and some of those difficult decisions,' Noem told Brennan on Sunday when explaining why she included the recounting of the decision to kill Cricket.\n\nNoem's chances of being selected as Donald Trump's vice president also severely decreased after the story came out.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commander (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Shepherd", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "German Shepherd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/05/18/84482717-0-image-m-14_1714930758112.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 4171, "textEnd": 4176}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The book was part of an overt pitch to be chosen as a running mate for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But her political prospects have fallen amid bipartisan disgust for how she recounted killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket after it had shown aggressive behavior and killed her neighbor's chickens.\n\nLet the news come to you\n\nGet any of our free email newsletters -- news headlines, obituaries, sports, and more.\n\nExplore newsletters\n\nFeatured Local Savings", "source": {"uri": "beloitdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beloit Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@beloitdailynews.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "stephen_groves@beloitdailynews.com", "name": "Stephen Groves", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_(North_Korean_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader (North Korean title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/E-Books", "label": "dmoz/Computers/E-Books", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/beloitdailynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/c7/8c746932-625d-5ad0-adb6-aebb24f2ba1c/663524757e71b.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Mandela was incarcerated at Robben Island Prison in Cape Town between the years 1964 and 1982. The Biden campaign eventually admitted that he was not arrested, and was referring to having been detained and separated from his Black colleagues at the airport in Johannesburg.\n\nAfter Margaret Brennan said she would ask Biden \"about his record\" if he's a guest on the show, Noem replied, \"I'm just asking -- why am I being treated differently than every other person that you've interviewed? I've looked at your last several interviews, you don't interrupt other people, you let them talk. Thank you for inviting me to have this conversation about this book.\"\n\nThe conversation began after Brennan quoted a passage from the book in which Noem claimed, \"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants. I've been a children's pastor, after all.\"\n\nBrennan then asked Noem point-blank if the meeting had ever transpired. \"You know, as soon as this was brought to my attention, I certainly made some changes and looked at this this passage,\" Noem said evasively.\n\n\"I've met with many many world leaders. I've traveled around the world. As soon as it was brought to my attention, we went forward and have made some edits. So I'm glad that this book is being released in a couple of days and that those edits will be in place and that people will will have the updated version,\" she added.\n\n\"So you did not meet with Kim Jung Un,\" Brennan replied. \"That's what you're saying.\"\n\n\"I've met with many, many world leaders, many world leaders,\" Noem reiterated. \"I've traveled around the world. I think I've talked extensively in this book about my time serving in Congress, my time as governor, before governor, some of the travels that I've had. I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I'm just not going to do that.\"\n\nWhile she narrated the audiobook, it also wasn't immediately clear if she had used any of the now-available AI-assisted recording features that allow authors to have passages read based on samples of their voice.

No, not because she got to kill anything. So far as we know, anyway. We suppose she could have spent the weekend throwing a litter of newborn kittens against the wall of her barn.\n\nNo, it was quite the weekend for Noem because the fallout around her book-shaped audition to be Donald Trump's vice president continued to cause headaches for her and choking laughter for pretty much everyone else.\n\nCNN got its hands on an advance copy of the book, No Going Back, and discovered something about the anecdote released last week in which Noem reminisced about shooting her dog, Cricket, to death, because that's just the kind of hard decision that a South Dakota rancher has to make.\n\nIt turns out the dog murder anecdote also contains a couple of shots at Joe Biden's dog, Commander, the hound who earned a bad reputation because he kept biting Secret Service agents. Biden did not have the dog shot, which to the rest of America sounds compassionate, but to a sociopath like Noem sounds like weakness:\n\n\"What would I do if I was president on the first day in office in 2025? Thanks for asking. I happen to have a list. The first thing I'd do is make sure Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds ('Commander, say hello to Cricket for me'). But my dog, Foster, would sure be welcome. He comes with me to the capitol all the time and loves everyone,\" Noem writes.\n\nMaybe Foster is a well-behaved dog because when he misbehaves, his master points out the window towards the gravel pit and tells him to shape up or she'll do to him what he did to Cricket. Are even Noem's grandchildren terrified of getting Cricketed? You kids mind your Meemaw and do what she says, or she'll take you to the gravel pit!\n\nNoem appeared on CBS's \"Face The Nation\" on Sunday to try and defend herself by hollering whatabout Commander HEEENNNNNGH? Thereby proving once again that whataboutism is one of the more regrettable tics infesting the national discourse:\n\n\"Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people,\" she told her interviewer, Margaret Brennan. \"So how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog?\"\n\nCommander is not on the White House grounds now. The Bidens banished him last year after those biting incidents. So, 24 is the number, apparently.\n\nWhat the Bidens did not do was drag Commander to a gravel pit somewhere and shoot him and then brag about this being an example of Joe Biden making the tough decisions required of a POTUS, because a) Joe Biden is not an insecure try-hard who has to inflate his resume for a national audience, and b) Joe Biden is not a psychopath.\n\nNoem also demanded that Joe Biden be \"held accountable\" for Commander's actions, which indicates Noem has a very skewed idea of the types of decisions for which American voters hold a president accountable. There are a lot of reasons why people will not -- or at least say in May that they will not -- vote for Joe Biden in November. We doubt \"because his dog bit a bunch of Secret Service agents before he gave up and sent the dog to live elsewhere\" is on the list.\n\nHere is Noem getting all defensive about her bloodlust, around the 13:13 mark, after \"Face The Nation\" host Margaret Brennan asks her if she's saying this garbage to look tough. (The answer is yes, Margaret Brennan, because Kristi Noem is, again, a whiny and insecure try-hard who wants to lead a party full of whiny and insecure try-hards.)\n\nKristi Noem is discovering that there is a very fine line between looking tough-minded and looking like a hateful asshole who would stand over the body of a dog she just shot and yodel in triumph.\n\nNoem's publisher also announced that future editions of her campaign pamphlet of an autobiography would remove a reference to her having once met North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un when she was in Congress, since this meeting did not actually happen. There is no word on which Asian leader Noem did meet, if she met one at all, but we guess they all look alike to Kristi Noem so who cares.\n\nWe can't wait for the plank in the platform of her inevitable presidential campaign when she promises to install a gravel pit at the White House that she can drag any recalcitrant world leader to if he doesn't do the bidding of the United States.

Kristi Noem continued to claim Sunday that she visited North Korea -- and cited a trip to South Korean's demilitarized zone (DMZ) as proof.\n\nNoem, 52, has been in hot water for a passage in her forthcoming book in which she recounted staring down North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un -- a tale she has since said she'll correct.\n\nMargaret Brennan, the moderator of CBS \"Face the Nation,\" challenged her Sunday on a claim she also visited the famously isolated Hermit Kingdom, saying \"You never went there.\"\n\nNoem responded: \"Yes, I have. I've been there.\"\n\nShe added: \"I went to the DMZ. And there are details in this book that talk about going to the DMZ and specifics that I'm willing to share.\"\n\nThe DMZ is a roughly 160-mile-long buffer zone that separates North and South Korea, fortified heavily with military hardware and troops on both sides.\n\nTourists can gaze into North Korea from the DMZ in South Korea.\n\nBut very few American politicians have actually visited the pariah state of North Korea, which is notorious for human rights abuses.\n\nBack in 2019, former President Donald Trump took 20 steps over from the DMZ and became the first sitting commander-in-chief to enter North Korea.\n\nLast year, a bipartisan delegation from Congress, led by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) visited the Korean DMZ -- but did not cross into North Korea.\n\nThe late former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson (D) is also known to have made several visits to the US adversary in the past as an informal negotiator for the US.\n\nThere is certainly proof that Noem was at the South Korean side of the DMZ when she was serving in the US House.\n\nOne of Noem's former colleagues, former Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) posted an image on social media of a 2014 visit.\n\nNot long after, he posted a selfie with Noem at the Great Wall of China.\n\nNoem served on the House Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2015.\n\nLast week it emerged from early copies of her forthcoming book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" that she dubiously claimed to have met with \"North Korean President Kim Jong Un.\"\n\n\"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" she wrote. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nA spokesperson for Noem later explained that there had been \"two small errors\" in her upcoming book that were then communicated to the \"ghostwriter and editor.\"\n\nBut on Sunday, Noem was evasive about the mistake when Brennan asserted, \"You did not meet with Kim Jong Un.\"\n\n\"No, I've met with many, many world leaders, many world leaders,\" she replied.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I'm just not going to do that,\" Noem went on.\n\n\"This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book and as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that -- that was adjusted.\"\n\nAt one point, Brennan pressed the South Dakota governor about how she didn't catch the error in her book while recording audio for it.\n\n\"I took action to make sure that it was [corrected],\" Noem stressed.\n\nHer upcoming memoir is set to hit bookshelves on Tuesday.\n\nNoem had been widely speculated as a contender to be Trump's vice president pick, but recently, several confidants close to

Since the excerpt from the book revealed the story, Noem has faced immense criticism from Trump and his circle in private.\n\nThe \"puppy-killing\" story has cost the governor her shot at being Trump's VP pick. However, Noem has defended her actions, saying Cricket was actually a \"working dog\" and that South Dakota's animal law supports her actions.\n\nSources close to former US President Donald Trump have revealed his stance on South Dakota's MAGA Governor Kristi Noem's controversy after she revealed that she executed her puppy, Cricket.\n\nSeveral sources told Rolling Stone that Trump discussed the topic several times and expressed his disappointment at Noem's decision to share the story.\n\nAccording to the publication, some sources revealed they are disclosing the content of their private discussions because they want Noem off Trump's 2024 vice presidential shortlist and dislike Corey Lewandowski, Trump's former 2016 campaign chief, and Noem's long-time adviser.\n\nOther sources noted that Trump has spoken about the puppy execution story frequently since it was released in the excerpt. They said that it's \"getting kind of ridiculous\" how \"disgusted\" the former US president is with Noem for including the puppy-killing incident in her memoir.\n\nThe Guardian shared an excerpt from Noem's forthcoming book, \"No Going Back,\" in which she detailed the execution of her 14-month-old puppy, Cricket.\n\nNoem wrote that she took the dog, which she \"hated,\" to a gravel pit and executed her after it showed violent behavior.\n\nThe incident that triggered the politician's decision to execute Cricket was when the puppy leaped out of her truck during a visit to some neighbors. The dog allegedly attacked and killed several of the chickens living on the property and even bit her when she tried to intervene.\n\nNoem wrote that the attack featured Cricket \"grabb[ing] one chicken at a time, crunching it to death with one bite, then dropping it to attack another.\"\n\nWhen the governor tried to stop the dog, Cricket \"whipped around to bite [her]\" and continued the chicken killing spree.\n\nAccording to the sources, Noem's scandal has been discussed in several of Trump's phone and closed-door meetings.\n\nThey shared that the former President pointedly asked why Noem would decide to kill the dog and questioned, \"What is wrong with her?\"\n\nTrump reportedly expressed shock that Noem would even admit to the execution in her writing, saying it shows her lack of understanding of \"public relations.\"\n\nHe had also allegedly mentioned that being a dog-killer would not sit well with voters, so this has automatically crossed Noem off the potential VP list.\n\nSources close to Trump previously revealed to the New York Post that the ex-president's team was shocked to hear of Noem's detailed story about how she killed her dog in the book.\n\nAn insider said, \"She was already unlikely to be picked as VP but had a shot. After this, it's just impossible.\" Noem was rumored to be an option for Trump's Vice President position.\n\nAnother source told the publication that the former US president \"likes Kristi a lot\" but was very \"disappointed\" to hear the story about her dog.\n\nThe source said, \"It certainly has not enhanced her chances, but no decision has been made concerning any of the VP candidates.\"\n\nThey further noted: \"Trump isn't a dog person necessarily, but I think he understands that you can't choose a puppy killer as your pick for blatantly obvious reasons.\"\n\nAmid the heavy backlash, Noem has defended her actions twice. During a recent appearance on Fox News, the politician told informal Trump adviser Sean Hannity that Cricket wasn't actually a puppy but an older \"working dog.\"\n\nNoem also took to X (formerly Twitter) to defend her actions against social media critics.\n\nShe wrote, \"I can understand why some people are upset about a 20 year old story of Cricket, one of the working dogs at our ranch, in my upcoming book -- No Going Back. The book is filled with many honest stories of my life, good and bad days, challenges, painful decisions, and lessons learned.\"\n\nNoem further revealed that her actions have legal backing, as there's a South Dakota law on the treatment of violent animals.\n\nShe tweeted, \"The fact is, South Dakota law states that dogs who attack and kill livestock can be put down. Given that Cricket had shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "favour_adegoke@theblast.com", "name": "Favour Adegoke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Lewandowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corey Lewandowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Working dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Going_Back_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "No Going Back (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Hannity", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Hannity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/1300x600/2024/05/04162318/Collage-NO-border-2024-05-04T212252.246.png?", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

So how many people are enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog?\" Noem asked.\n\n\"That's the question that the President should be held accountable to,\" the potential Trump VP added.\n\nModerator Margaret Brennan promptly asked if \"You're saying he should be shot?\"\n\n\"What is the number?\" Noem replied before attempting to change the topic.\n\nFollowing the reports that Commander drew blood from a Secret Service agent, the White House in March said that Biden handed over the German shepherd to his relatives due to repeated biting incidents.\n\nNoem, whose name has been touted as a potential vice presidential candidate for Donald Trump, has come under fire after she admitted to killing her dog in a new book 'No Going Back', which will hit the shelves on May 7.\n\n\"I hated that dog,\" Noem said in her book, as per the copy obtained by The Guardian. \"[Cricket was] dangerous to anyone she came in contact with.\"\n\nNoem then recalled shooting the \"disgusting, musky, rancid\" goat, which she claimed used to chase her kids.\n\nAlso Read: Kristy Noem finally clears the air if she really met with Kim Jong Un amid fresh

blatantly directed at the South Dakota Governor for defending her claims of killing her mischievous puppy due to its \"aggressive personality\".\n\nTrump met with a group of potential vice presidential candidates at the Republican National Committee's spring conference in Palm Beach on Saturday.\n\nNBC claimed that Noem arrived there but left early as her name was not mentioned among

That will be corrected in future editions of the book, too, said Ian Fury, the chief of communications for Ms. Noem.\n\n\"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book 'No Going Back' has two small errors,\" Mr. Fury said. \"This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor. Kim Jong-un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been.\"\n\nIn the book, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times ahead of its official publication on May 7, Ms. Noem mentions the meeting with Mr. Kim when writing about her eight years in Congress as South Dakota's sole representative, in a passage about her role as a member of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\n\"I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders -- some who wanted our help, and some who didn't,\" Ms. Noem writes. \"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all). Dealing with foreign leaders takes resolve, preparation, and determination.\"\n\nMr. Fury did not respond to a question about whom Ms. Noem could have been referring to, if not Mr. Kim.\n\nThe conversation that Ms. Noem describes having with Ms. Haley, the former South Carolina governor who dropped out of the Republican presidential primary in March, suggests that Ms. Haley had threatened her because they were both prominent Republican women.\n\nMs. Noem describes the call as starting with Ms. Haley offering to mentor her during her first term as governor of South Dakota, but then saying: \"I've heard many good things about you. But when I do hear bad things, I will make sure that you know. I've enjoyed talking to you. We will visit soon. Goodbye.\"\n\nMs. Noem then recounts the conversation with her secretary, writing that she said: \"I'm pretty sure I was just threatened by Nikki Haley. It was clear that she wanted me to know that there was only room for one Republican woman in the spotlight. It was weird.\"\n\nChaney Denton, a spokeswoman for Ms. Haley, said Ms. Noem's story was inaccurate.\n\n\"Nikki has long called and written notes supporting other women when they go through challenging times,\" Ms. Denton said in a statement. \"She called Governor Noem in 2020 to encourage her when she was criticized for keeping her state open during Covid. How she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird.\"\n\nFuture editions of the book will correct the timeline, clarifying that Ms. Noem spoke with Nikki Haley in 2020 and met with her in 2021.

Kristi Noem just won't stop talking about killing her dog", "body": "First, South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem wrote about killing her 14-month-old dog, Cricket, in her soon-to-be-released book, \"No Going Back.\"\n\nThen, over the course of three separate days, the Republican posted on social media about killing her dog -- a series of missives that ranged from book promotion to defensive explanation to, finally, blame-the-media spin.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Noem appeared on Sean Hannity's Fox News show, where the two devoted five minutes to Noem's late wirehair pointer, as a befuddled Hannity tried to give Noem -- who wrote about dragging her female dog out to a gravel pit and shooting her -- the benefit of the doubt. \"Is there a difference which way you put a dog down?\" he asked. \"I'm not really sure.\"\n\nIn short, Noem just can't stop talking about killing her dog -- much to the collective confusion of horrified observers.\n\n\"As the saying goes, if you find yourself in a hole, stop murdering your puppy -- and stop digging,\" said Tommy Vietor, co-host of \"Pod Save America\" and former Obama administration official.\n\nThe controversy started last Friday, when The Guardian published details from her upcoming political memoir -- the sort of obligatory hardcover intended to juice her chances of emerging as Donald Trump's vice-presidential pick. Ironically, it seems to have done the exact opposite.\n\nThe Guardian recounted that, in the book, Noem describes her female dog, still nearly a puppy, as \"a trained assassin\" with an \"aggressive personality.\" Unable to train Cricket, Noem recounts watching as the dog, on the way home from a pheasant hunt, attacks a local family's chickens, grabbing \"one chicken at a time, crunching it to death with one bite, then dropping it to attack another.\"\n\n\"I hated that dog,\" Noem writes of Cricket, who she says then tried to bite her. \"At that moment, I realized I had to put her down.\"\n\nNoems also writes of how -- perhaps feeling emboldened after killing Cricket -- she then decided to kill a \"nasty and mean\" family goat, dragging it to the same gravel pit where Cricket met her demise. But the goat jumped as Noem shot it, forcing the Republican governor to return to her truck for another shell.\n\nThe scene of slaughter ends with Noem's kids getting off the school bus, and her daughter asking, \"Hey, where's Cricket?\"\n\nNoem seems to have recounted the episode as something of a parable, intended to show both that she is tough enough to face \"difficult, messy and ugly\" tasks and authentic enough to tell the truth about it.\n\nBut even before Noem's recent controversy, people close to Trump privately said she was always a long shot to be his running mate, citing assorted \"baggage\" -- and that was before canicide got added to her vetting files.\n\nYet Noem persisted, plowing ahead with her tale of the untrainable dog.\n\nOn the Friday The Guardian story came out, Noem wrote a post on X that was part explanation and part book promotion.\n\n\"We love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm,\" she wrote, in a missive that included a link to preorder her book. \"Sadly, we just had to put down 3 horses a few weeks ago that had been in our family for 25 years.\"\n\nThen on Sunday, when the intervening two days had made clear she had a political crisis on her hands, she weighed in again about killing Cricket -- this time with an even lengthier social media post aimed squarely at damage control.\n\n\"I can understand why some people are upset about a 20-year-old story of Cricket, one of the working dogs at our ranch,\" wrote Noem, who went on to describe herself as an \"authentic\" leader who doesn't \"shy away from tough challenges.\"\n\nAnd finally, on Thursday, she returned to the topic again, this time squarely through a \"fake news\" lens.\n\n\"Don't believe the #fakenews media's twisted spin,\" she wrote, linking to her Hannity interview. \"I had a choice between the safety of my children and an animal who had a history of attacking people & killing livestock. I chose my kids.\"\n\nBut the morbid fascination with the Noah's ark worth of animals Noem has talked about putting down -- three horses, a goat, a dog -- transcends the so-called liberal media. On Thursday, for instance, a bipartisan group of lawmakers responded to the news by forming the Congressional Dog Lovers Caucus.\n\nAnd even would-be allies have been left scratching their heads -- not just that Noem killed her dog, but that she continues to talk about it, holding up the gravel pit executions as a character witness for her leadership chops.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine a universe where bragging about shooting your 14-month-old puppy increases your brand value,\" Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., wrote in a text. \"I've known hunters who accidentally or impulsively shot their hunting dog, but I've never known anyone who bragged about it or considered it noble in any way.\"\n\nOthers, including fellow conservatives, were less generous.\n\n\"Why ... would you write about this in a book and flex on it?\" wondered radio personality Dana Loesch. \"That doesn't look tough. It looks stupid.\"\n\n\"Not ideal,\" Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., said to laughter on his video podcast. \"I read that and I'm like: 'Who put that in the book?' I was like, 'Your ghost writer must really not like you if they're gonna include that one. That was rough.'\"\n\nEven Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose past includes a more benign dog incident, weighed in.\n\n\"I didn't eat my dog. I didn't shoot my dog. I loved my dog, and my dog loved me,\" Romney told The HuffPost. (Romney's 2012 presidential campaign was dogged by a story of Romney family lore -- the 1983 vacation the clan took with Seamus, their Irish setter, strapped in his carrier to the roof of the station wagon for 12 hours).\n\nIn repeatedly returning to the tale, Noem also opened herself up to additional criticism, including charges that her story has changed to portray her in a more flattering light. A community note at the bottom of her Thursday X post, in which readers are allowed to add additional context, reads that \"Noem's description of why she shot Cricket has morphed.\"\n\nThe note says that in her book, Noem writes that she killed Cricket because she was untrainable for pheasant hunting and killed the neighboring chickens. But that when criticized, \"Noem altered her story\" -- going from claiming that Cricket snapped at her to claiming Cricket actually bit her to claiming Cricket had a biting history and was a \"danger to children.\"\n\nA person close to Noem rejected the charge of revisionist history, pointing to the line in her book that reads, \"Cricket was untrainable and, after trying to bite me, dangerous to anyone she came in contact with.\" Cricket regularly came in contact with Noem's young kids, this person said, arguing the sentence shows that Noem had always considered the safety of her children when she made the decision to kill Cricket.\n\nNoem does have her defenders. She is slated to headline the annual Brevard County Republicans dinner in Florida later this month, and Rick Lacey, the county party chair, said he's already had interest from 200 people and is worried about selling out the space, which can hold about 500.\n\n\"This happens all the time,\" Lacey said, referring to putting down dogs known for biting people, \"but I guess if you're a Republican governor with national prospects, it becomes a bigger issue.\"\n\nStu Loeser, a longtime Democratic staffer and strategist who specializes in crises, noted he shares \"a house on the Hudson with a Havanese and we are both horrified.\" But, from a crisis communications perspective, he argued that Noem is never going to be able to change her detractors' minds -- but that she may get some credit for continuing to largely stand by her original story.\n\nFor now, the controversy shows no signs of abating, in part because Noem is promoting her book, which officially comes out Tuesday.\n\nAs part of her publicity tour, the South Dakota governor is already slated to appear on the CBS's \"Face The Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nAn X post by the \"Face The Nation\" account said that in addition to other issues, \"we'll get into the controversies surrounding her upcoming memoir.\"", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors":

'I'm just not going to do that.'\n\nGovernor Noem of South Dakota, often mentioned as a top candidate for vice president on President Trump's 2024 ticket, on Sunday refused to back down from a claim in her upcoming book that she once met North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un.\n\nOn a Sunday talk show, Mrs. Noem was asked about the claim that she went to North Korea, to which the governor said she has visited the Demilitarized Zone between South and North Korea.\n\n\"Yes, I have. I've been there,\" she said. \"I went to the DMZ. And there are details in this book that talk about going to the DMZ and specifics that I'm willing to share.\"\n\nAt the DMZ, there are buildings used for meeting between the two sides. From first-hand knowledge, some of the buildings are taped off in the middle -- half in North Korea, half in South Korea -- so it is technically possible to enter the Hermit Kingdom simply by being inside a building.\n\nBut actual visits to North Korea by American politicians to North Korea remain exceedingly rare due to the country's international standing and human rights record.

Kristi Noem for executing his puppy and writing about it in her upcoming memoir -- a case that appears to have closed the book on the idea of selected as a vice-presidential candidate.\n\nIn conversations with close political allies and other confidants, sources said, the former president brought up the incident several times, including in recent days, to criticize Noem and question her statesmanship.\n\nThis report is based on four sources close to the matter and two other informed people. Over the past few days, all but one source has contacted Rolling Stone unprompted to describe recent discussions with Trump, or brought up the topic off the cuff in unrelated conversations.\n\nSome sources have candidly said they are disclosing these private details because they want Noem permanently removed from Trump's shortlist for vice president in 2024, or because they despise Corey Lewandowski, the former head of Trump campaign in 2016 who has advised Noem for years. Some separately said they were discussing it simply because Trump had talked about killing Noem's puppy so often that it became, in the words of one of the sources, \"a little ridiculous\" how much the former president had looking \"disgusted\" about it and how he often \"taunted\" Noem behind her back.\n\nLast week, The Guardian reported that Noem had written in her new book how she took her 14-month-old puppy, Cricket - a dog she \"hated\" - to a gravel pit and executed her, after the dog hunter showed undisciplined behavior. notably by injuring some of his neighbor's chickens. The memoir, No Going Back, is set to be released next week, with a blurb from Trump calling Noem a \"tremendous leader\" and her book a \"winner.\"\n\nIn recent days, the former president has discussed or brought up the execution of Noem's puppy in closed-door meetings, as well as on the phone. Trump, sources say, pointedly asked questions about her decision to kill the dog, including: \"Why would she do that?\" and \"What's wrong with her?\" He said he was perplexed that she had ever admitted to doing this, voluntarily and in her own writings, and argued that it demonstrated that she had a poor understanding of \"public relations\". In these various conversations last week, the ex-president also mentioned that voters generally do not like politicians who kill dogs, add two people familiar with the matter. Editor's Choice\n\nAmong MAGAland's upper crust, Noem has long been considered a candidate for Trump's 2024 pick, although she has often been considered a long shot. Those hopes appear to be dead now, after longtime allies and other conservatives close to Trump actively worked to bring him stories about Noem and the dog, as Rolling Stone reported earlier this week.\n\nNoem defended Cricket's killing during an appearance on Fox News Wednesday, telling host and informal Trump adviser Sean Hannity that the 14-month-old dog \"was a working dog and it wasn't a puppy\".\n\n\"The reason this is in the book is because this book is filled with difficult and challenging decisions that I have had to make throughout my life,\" she added.\n\nNoem was previously scheduled to lead a Saturday fundraiser for Jefferson County Republicans in Lakewood, Colorado. The event was canceled due to apparent \"security concerns.\"\n\nTendency\n\nThe band wrote that \"we were delighted to have [Noem] to speak at our annual fundraiser,\" adding, \"The timing was perfect, as it was right before the release of her new book. We had no prior knowledge of the contents of the book when we invited her.\n\nFollowing \"mainstream media coverage\" of the book, the group said it had received death threats and that its event would be the subject of protests. \"Please know that the Jefferson County Republican Party is not taking a position on the public outcry over the governor's book,\" the group wrote.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Lewandowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corey Lewandowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Hannity", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Hannity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mainstream media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakewood,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lakewood, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lakewood, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kristi-noem-donald-trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Noem apparently was given a free German Wirehaired Pointer puppy who a family could not control. The puppy was 14 months old. Noem could not control it, but took it along with older dogs on a hunt, where the dog was exuberant and chased up all the pheasants which infuriated Noem.\n\nSo Noem being a priss who would not allow Cricket to be in a pick up cab, put the puppy into the box of the pick up, as Noem was too cheap to buy a kennel to protect the dog. The dog jumps out in a farmer's yard, and starts catching chickens and killing them in one bite.\n\nNoem is stunned, the farmers a bawling over their dead birds, Noem pays or the dead birds, but does not butcher them, wasting perfectly good meat. She then hauls the dog to a gravel pit, with a shotgun, which will blow the dogs head off like John Kennedy and kills the puppy.\n\nThis gets better in the book as Noem is on PMS fucking rampage as murdering a puppy is not enough. She gets in her yard, sees a billy goat, who stinks which is what goats do as they piss on themselves like elk do when aroused. She says the goat bunts her children........apparently Noem has never heard of dog kennels or livestock panels to keep goats in and away from children............so Noem blows the head off this pet goat too.\n\nJust remember that Noem was hunting pheasants. She was using bird shot, small shot, not suitable to kill large mammals. So she had to be close to kill puppies and goats and blew the hell out of these animals in her rampage.\n\nShe includes her story about the ill-fated Cricket, she says, to illustrate her willingness, in politics as well as in South Dakota life, to do anything \"difficult, messy and ugly\" if it simply needs to be done.\n\nBy taking Cricket on a pheasant hunt with older dogs, Noem says, she hoped to calm the young dog down and begin to teach her how to behave. Unfortunately, Cricket ruined the hunt, going \"out of her mind with excitement, chasing all those birds and having the time of her life\".\n\nNoem describes calling Cricket, then using an electronic collar to attempt to bring her under control. Nothing worked. Then, on the way home after the hunt, as Noem stopped to talk to a local family, Cricket escaped Noem's truck and attacked the family's chickens, \"grabb[ing] one chicken at a time, crunching it to death with one bite, then dropping it to attack another\".\n\nCricket the untrainable dog, Noem writes, behaved like \"a trained assassin\".\n\nWhen Noem finally grabbed Cricket, she says, the dog \"whipped around to bite me\". Then, as the chickens' owner wept, Noem repeatedly apologised, wrote the shocked family a check \"for the price they asked, and helped them dispose of the carcasses littering the scene of the crime\".\n\nThrough it all, Noem says, Cricket was \"the picture of pure joy\".\n\n\"I hated that dog,\" Noem writes, adding that Cricket had proved herself \"untrainable\", \"dangerous to anyone she came in contact with\" and \"less than worthless ... as a hunting dog\".\n\n\"At that moment,\" Noem says, \"I realised I had to put her down.\"\n\nOK, the Lame Cherry has some real life experience with hunting dogs and goats.\n\nThis puppy like all puppies are exuberant. I have had hunting dogs who went bird nuts and dogs that refused to obey. I did not murder them. I did not beat the hell out of them. The bird wild dog, I simply hunted with in controlled situations as in duck hunting. I never let my pet loose in pheasant hunting as she simply went deaf. The other dog I simply let hunt, and I hunted from the other direction. It confused the birds and I got to hunt, got to take my dog home I loved and all was well.\n\nPuppies all have energy. My neighbor had a Wirehair from hell who never stayed home.......THE FIRST TWO YEARS. The dog just had to grow up some and settle down. He stays home now and is a good dog.\n\nThis puppy that Noem murdered in rage, is not at fault. This is Noem's fault. She had zero control of this puppy. Did not protect the dog with a kennel so she did not jump out of a pick up box and break a leg and did not invest enough time with this puppy to help it conform.\n\nThis Noem story is disgusting and it is an insight that this woman has rage issues and should not be in anyway around nuclear buttons.\n\nAs for goats, my male, named Newbie was a semen stinking obnoxious male. He would jump up on the gate and I would talk to him, he was horny like all goats out of his gourd, and he would bawl, he would make goat chatter, he loved me with all his being, and I adored him.\n\nWe had the goats out of their pen to let them join in the family. Newbie was eating in the apple tree, and I told the mother to leave him alone, but she was a bitch who could not be told anything, so started whacking him with a stick, Newbie charged by and knocked her flat. She had a weak femur and it broke it. Was not the goats fault as goats are goats. I put him in the pen and put the mother in the hospital.\n\nI still miss my goats, but stopped raising them, as they do not last that long, compared to dogs and you get attached to them and it hurts when they die after 5 years.\n\nI will be frank. There are psychological problems with Kristi Noem. I would for the people of South Dakota that Donald Trump will pick her for some job to save those people out there as they have a shit hole of GOPliters, but I don't think outside of mass murderers like Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio that no one has a threat like Kristi Noem in power. She does belong in some job where she has no power. Trump owes the people of South Dakota that in voting for him, coming 3 times now.\n\nWhat is the worst of this is Kristi Noem revealing that she is murderous when she goes into a rampage, that as a psychosis she has zero comprehension like a serial killer that what she did was abnormal and outside the bounds of what is normal.\n\nI'm not a novice to any of this being a rural gal. I have shot pet dogs in putting them down when they were suffering or when one had a very submissive Setter in a throat lock. I never did any of this in a blind rage where I started gunning down other animals. I was extremely sad and went about to burying my dogs as good or bad, sick or well, they were my dogs, like all of my animals are my pets. It is the reason my pasture has bones all over it as I refuse to have my cows abused by Mexican slaughter house thugs to gain a few hundred dollars in selling them when they are old.\n\nIf you are not responsible enough to get a pen for an animal, or patient enough to invest the time for an animal to grow up or figure another way to work with their behavior, you do not have any legitimate reason for having any animals.\n\nI'm most concerned that Noem has a Vizsla male now. What the hell happens when Donald Trump does not choose this lunatic for Vice President? Is Noem going to slaughter that dog and work her way up to some one at the South Dakota Capitol that she comes across who she has figured does not measure up to her standards?\n\nKristi Noem is as troubling as the holocaust in Gaza. Now it makes me wonder is this why Jews chose her as she kills dogs and goats and they kill babies and mothers in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheasant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pheasant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Puppy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Wirehaired_Pointer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "German Wirehaired Pointer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunting dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mass murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shotgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sodomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The South Dakota Governor recently appeared on CBS' Face of Nation to clear the air about her falsely claimed meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and to suggest that President Joe Biden's dog Commander should be killed.\n\nAfter getting candid with CBS host Margaret Brennan, Trump's potential VP contender garnered much limelight as she started trending on social media, including X, for her interview. However, Noem took U-turn on Sunday to complain about Brennan, alleging that she was unfairly grilled by her.\n\nShe went on to say that her Democratic colleagues like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would never have been exposed to such harsh interrogation.\n\n\"This morning in our 15-minute interview, Margaret Brennan interrupted me 36 times -- once every 25 seconds on average,\" miffed Noem posted on X. In contrast to her claims, the host was seen interrupting or questioning her at a few moments, prompting the governor to change the topic or move ahead without answering the question.\n\nDuring the interview, Noem felt the heat as she asked the interviewer, \"Why am I being treated differently than every other person that you've interviewed? You don't interrupt other people. You let them talk.\"\n\nTo make her point clear, she continued on X, \"In the fake news media, there are two sets of rules, and conservative[s] are always treated differently. That's why Americans don't trust the Fake News.\"\n\nAlso Read: US House lawmakers form 'Dog Lovers Caucus' after Kristi Noem calls puppy shooting report 'fake' news\n\nNotably, Noem's post on X came after she faced backlash over her remarks in the interview, with MSNBC host, saying \"No bad dogs, only bad people.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Former GOP Rep Joe Walsh told to CNN: \"I served with Kristi Noem; she wasn't like this. Every one of my former Republican colleagues has learned to be like Trump. To be cruel. To lie. To never, ever apologise.\"\n\n\"Kristi Noem, Trump's potential VP nominee, says that she wants to put down President Biden's dog. These people are lunatics and we cannot let them near power,\" a handle named Biden's Win tweeted.\n\nSome of the X users even commented on Noem's post, asking her to \"stop playing the victim card\".\n\n\"We all watched the interview, and you were not rudely interrupted, but you did lie an awful lot. At least it kept you busy so you couldn't kill any more dogs for a few minutes,\" one of her followers commented.\n\nNoem was basically grilled about her upcoming book 'No Going Back'. When Brennan openly asked her if she really met Kim Jong Un, the governor refused to talk about her \"specific\" encounters with world leaders.\n\nHowever, she admitted the error in her book and the publisher will make the edits before its release. Meanwhile, publisher Center Street announced on X that they have removed the passage in question, but added, \"Further questions about the passage should be referred to the author\".\n\nThe governor, who tried to defend killing her 14-old-month dog 'Cricket', seemed to suggest on-air that Biden's troubled dog Commander should meet a similar fate.\n\nAfter removing Commander from the White House for biting several Secret Service personnel, Biden decided to send his dog to his relatives in order to reach a perfect resolution.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Dakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/06/1600x900/Kristi-Noem-Book-0_1714993609689_1714993634970.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

(Seth Tupper and Joshua Haiar, South Dakota Searchlight) - South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem was in political freefall Friday as embarrassing revelations continued to emerge from the scrutiny of advance copies of her memoir, which doesn't officially publish until Tuesday.\n\nNoem was already reeling from near-universal backlash against her disclosure in the book that she shot and killed a dog named Cricket and a billy goat years ago -- the dog for its failures on a hunting excursion and its attacks on a neighbor's chickens, and the goat for chasing after Noem's children and smelling bad.\n\nThursday and Friday, news emerged from outlets including Politico and The Dakota Scout of inaccuracies in Noem's book, the title of which -- \"No Going Back\" -- is now ripe with irony. The most glaring inaccuracy is Noem's recounting of a meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un during her time in Congress -- a meeting that never happened.\n\n\"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" Noem wrote. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nThe Dakota Scout published a story Thursday casting doubt on the meeting. Noem's spokesman, Ian Fury, eventually said the anecdote was one of \"two small errors\" in the book that were the fault of others.\n\n\"This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor,\" Fury said, according to the Scout. \"Kim Jong Un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been.\"\n\nYet there seems to be no way Noem could've been unaware of the errors. She's been promoting the book for weeks, there is no other writer credited in the book besides her, and she's already voiced an audio version of the book.\n\nThe Scout also questioned Noem's anecdote in the book about canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron over Noem's dislike of his comments about the Israeli-Hamas war. The French president's office released a statement that Macron had never extended a \"direct invitation\" to Noem for a meeting, the Scout reported, but the office left open the possibility that the two could have been scheduled to attend the same event.\n\nPolitico reported on a story Noem related in the book about a 2021 conversation with former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. Noem wrote that Haley, who would go on to unsuccessfully seek the Republican presidential nomination, \"threatened\" Noem politically. A spokesperson for Haley told Politico that Haley had called to encourage Noem, and \"how she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird.\"\n\nPolitico also reported that a Colorado county Republican group canceled a Saturday fundraiser Noem was scheduled to headline, after the group received death threats and information about a planned protest related to Noem's treatment of animals.\n\nReacting to the cascade of negative news, political science professor Jon Schaff of Northern State University in Aberdeen said Noem's short-term national ambitions \"have been weakened, considerably.\" Until recently, Noem had been widely considered to be a potential running mate for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.\n\nBut Schaff said it's too early to tell what it all means for Noem long-term. He said she is popular in South Dakota, and it would be naive to count her out in future races, such as a U.S. Senate race in the eventuality of a retirement by Sen. John Thune or Sen. Mike Rounds. Thune is 63 years old, Rounds is 69 and Noem is 52.\n\n\"Rounds and Thune won't be there forever,\" Schaff said.\n\nMeanwhile, Dan Ahlers, executive director of the South Dakota Democratic Party, said the negative news is unlikely to end Noem's career, given that past scandals have not seemed to hurt her. Those scandals have included published allegations of an affair with former Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski, accusations of misusing the state airplane, and allegedly intervening to help her daughter earn a real estate appraiser's license.\n\n\"These things don't end any of these Republican politicians' careers anymore,\" Ahlers said. \"They end up raising more money and smelling like roses.\"\n\nNoem went on \"Hannity\" on Fox News on Wednesday and blamed \"fake news\" for the fallout from the dog and goat stories. This weekend, she's scheduled to attend a Trump campaign donor retreat in Florida, according to Politico. Sunday, she's scheduled to appear on \"Face the Nation\" on CBS.\n\n\"We'll get into the controversies surrounding her upcoming memoir,\" said a Friday tweet from the show.\n\nPIERRE, S.D. (Joshua Haiar, South Dakota Searchlight) - State wildlife officials are not bringing back a popular method of estimating South Dakota's pheasant population, despite requests from the public to do so.\n\nSouth Dakota is one of the top states for pheasant hunting in the nation, with millions of birds and millions of dollars in economic impact from the hunters that flock to the state each fall.\n\nWhen the Department of Game, Fish and Parks recently released the draft of its new pheasant management plan for 2024 to 2028, the end of the document said that \"by 2028,\" the department planned to \"improve existing population monitoring programs to develop survey methods to inform biologists on population status, reproductive success, and relative densities of pheasant populations.\"\n\nAfter reading that draft plan, some people wrote in to tell the department that the way to improve population monitoring programs is to reinstate the old method -- commonly called the \"brood count.\"\n\n\"I continue to be amazed and disgusted that GFP no longer conducts the summer brood count survey,\" John McDermott wrote in a comment to the department.\n\n\"Reinstate the statewide pheasant annual brood survey,\" Larry Fredrickson wrote.\n\n\"Bring back the brood survey,\" Mark Schaefer wrote.\n\nIn response, the department deleted the language in the draft plan that sparked the comments.\n\nGF&P Senior Upland Game Biologist Alex Solem told the GF&P Commission on Friday that the change to the plan came \"after just some kind of public comments and that sort of stuff.\" The commission unanimously approved the new version of the plan, without the language calling for improved population monitoring programs.\n\nThe state started the brood count as early as 1960 and ended it in 2019, citing concerns at the time that reports of lower pheasant numbers ahead of the hunting season deterred out-of-state hunters from traveling to South Dakota.\n\nThe department explained the rationale for ending the count in a Pheasant Hunting Marketing Workgroup and Plan. It said ending the count would \"ensure that South Dakota is not unintentionally deterring hunters from coming to our state based on the media headlines reporting of low bird numbers.\"\n\nPrior to the brood count's end, department staff conducted it by driving the same rural routes annually to count groups of young pheasants and hens. Those observations and other variables, including a winter male-to-female ratio count and hunter harvest numbers, were fed into a formula to determine a pheasant population estimate ahead of the hunting season. The last brood count in 2019 reflected a 17% drop in pheasants counted per mile.\n\nNow, according to the new management plan, the department uses hunter surveys to estimate how many pheasants are harvested, how many people hunted pheasants, the economic impact of pheasant hunting, and hunter satisfaction.\n\nGeorge Vandel, a former wildlife director for Game, Fish and Parks, said the brood count was a more accurate way of estimating the pheasant population.\n\n\"It wasn't barbershop biology,\" Vandel said.\n\nThe numbers were also used to help inform changes to the federal farm bill's grassland conservation programs, he added. The programs help provide habitat for pheasants and other wildlife.\n\n\"It showed them how long and when grasses should be left alone before being hayed or grazed, to give pheasants and similar wildlife the best chance possible,\" Vandel said. \"And they did away with that.\"\n\nThe hunter surveys that the GF&P now relies on were only one of the variables in the brood count formula.\n\nChuck Dieter, a retired professor of natural resource management at South Dakota State University, does not like the new method.\n\n\"I think it's ridiculous to use that one variable to extrapolate a population estimate,\" Dieter said.\n\nLast month, Solem shared the draft pheasant management plan with the GF&P Commission. He explained how the department estimates the population \"through harvest surveys, hunter questionnaires -- that sort of thing.\"\n\nSolem said about 15,000 resident and 15,000 non-resident hunters participate. Questions include how many birds they harvested, when and where, and their satisfaction level with hunting pheasants in South Dakota.\n\nAt the time, Solem referenced the draft pheasant management plan's goal of improving population monitoring programs but did not offer specifics.\n\n\"We want to use and improve on current population harvest and public opinion surveys to, obviously, monitor these population trends as well as the economic impact that hunting, harvest levels and hunter satisfaction have on the landscape,\" Solem said about the draft. \"It's no secret that pheasant hunting in the state of South Dakota has a huge economic impact, and we want to make sure that we continue to provide good populations out there for a lot of hunters to come in and harvest birds.\n\nPrior to Friday, GF&P Commission Chair Stephanie Rissler told South Dakota Searchlight that the commission is confident in the department's current method for counting pheasants. She said department staff can use harvest surveys, habitat and weather conditions for a preseason pheasant forecast, without reinstating the brood count.\n\n\"I feel we have come a long way in modeling since 1960,\" Rissler said in an email.\n\nAfter Friday's vote to approve the amended management plan, Solem shared the department's annual pheasant harvest report. The report showed about 135,000 hunters harvested 1.2 million pheasants outside of private preserves in South Dakota -- representing a 6% increase in hunters and a 7% increase in pheasants harvested compared to the prior year.", "source": {"uri": "wnax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio 570 WNAX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type":

Korea Lie, Shooting Biden's Dog Key Moments", "body": "This debacle with Kristi Noem murdering a puppy has been going on for well over a week now but she did manage to do the impossible on Sunday morning, which is to make herself the least credible and most despised person in Republican politics, eclipsing even Donald Trump -- whom she thanked for endorsing her book. That was, quite possibly, the most incredible part of the performance. Trump has managed to keep himself away from this scandal until now, but that's a little difficult to do when the author of the book is boasting about how you ringingly endorsed it, dog murders, lies about Little Rocket Man and all.\n\nNoem is actually a perfect match for Trump in 2024. They are both in politics out of sheer desperation. Noem is term limited and she has no prestigious job to go onto after her political stint and Trump is running for office in an effort to stay out of prison. Here's how it all began.\n\nI believe she just dug herself in one step deeper. It should be fairly easy to prove that she wasn't in North Korea and for precisely the reason that Brennan raised. Unless Kim Jong-Un is giving audiences these days to Botoxed bimbos and nobody knows about it. Now that's bad enough but here's where it gets unbelievable. Noem actually is advocating that Joe Biden's dog, Commander, should be put down.\n\nIs that not incredible? And here Noem is, dragging Trump into the fray. I am going to bet he's not happy with this.\n\nBrennan says, \"I know you're back from a gathering in Florida...\". Yeah? Any photos of that? Because if Noem was there yesterday, she missed the big photo op with Trump on stage. I'm curious that that was on the program today. Here's where Kristi Noem stands. Or shall we say, \"lies\" because she is both literally lying and she just publicly fell on her ass, so that might be a more descriptive phrase.\n\nAnd now the party is going to ask you to ignore the evidence of your eyes and ears and believe that Kristi Noem was badly treated on TV this morning.\n\nNoem is not in her right mind. She's desperate and she's doing the stupid things that desperate people do, namely lie and blame. Let's just see how often she shows up at Mar-a-Lago in days to come because I think that will tell the tale.

Noem refuses to admit she never met Kim Jong Un", "body": "In a strange interview on Sunday, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem would not admit that she never personally met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nDuring an appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" host Margaret Brennan questioned Mrs. Noem about her memoir's claims of visiting North Korea.\n\n\"So you did not meet with Kim Jong Un? That's what you're saying,\" Ms. Brennan said. Mrs. Noem did not answer directly, saying \"No, I've met with many, many world leaders, many world leaders.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I'm just not going to do that,\" Mrs. Noem added. \"This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book and as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that -- that was adjusted.\"\n\nIn her upcoming memoir, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,\" Mrs. Noem claimed she personally met the dictator.\n\n\"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" she wrote. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all).\"\n\nDuring her appearance on a Sunday talk show, Mrs. Noem was challenged about her claim of having visited North Korea. She clarified that her visit was to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the border area between South Korea and North Korea, and not the interior of the North Korean state.\n\nAsked if she had been to North Korea, she said, \"Yes, I have. I've been there. There are details in this book that talk about going to the DMZ and specifics that I'm willing to share.\"\n\nThe DMZ, known for its high security, features buildings straddling the border between the two Koreas. It is in these buildings that it is technically feasible to cross into North Korean territory. However, actual visits to North Korea by American officials are highly uncommon due to the country's contentious international relations and human rights issues.\n\nMrs. Noem's claims raised eyebrows, especially considering the rarity of American politicians visiting North Korea.

Kristi Noem of South Dakota would like to speak to the manager.\n\nThe Republican took to social media on Sunday to complain that she'd been unfairly grilled by Margaret Brennan in a catastrophic appearance on CBS' Face the Nation hours earlier, alleging that her Democratic counterparts would never have been subjected to such fierce interrogation.\n\nHaving crunched the numbers, Noem posted on X: \"This morning in our 15-minute interview, Margaret Brennan interrupted me 36 times -- once every 25 seconds on average.\"\n\nThough her math checks out, the governor was not actually \"interrupted\" by Brennan nearly as much as she claimed. As Noem steamrolled through her answers to the CBS host's questions, Brennan attempted to interject just over a dozen times, resulting in crosstalk that just as often ended with Noem continuing to plough forward without answering the query.\n\nNoem clearly felt the heat even in the midst of the interview, however. At one point, her expression still perfectly neutral, the governor asked, \"Why am I being treated differently than every other person that you've interviewed? You don't interrupt other people. You let them talk.\"\n\nShe pressed that point in her X post.\n\n\"But when liberals like [Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer] and [former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi] are on @FaceTheNation, they aren't interrupted once,\" Noem said.\n\n\"In the fake news media, there are two sets of rules, and conservative[s] are always treated differently,\" she continued. \"That's why Americans don't trust the Fake News.\"\n\nNoem struggled to keep to her talking points in the CBS interview, insisting to Brennan -- who opened by asking whether the governor had actually ever met Kim Jong Un, as her upcoming book claimed -- that she wasn't going to talk about her \"specific\" encounters with world leaders, of whom she'd met \"many, many.\"\n\nCenter Street, the publisher of her memoir No Going Back, which is set to be released this week, announced Sunday that it would remove the passage in question \"upon reprint of the print edition and as soon as technically possible on the audio and ebook editions.\"\n\nBut it did not address what may have happened to allow the seemingly false passage to make its way into print.\n\n\"Further questions about about the passage should be referred to the author, \" Center Street added.\n\nThe governor also continued to defend her decision to kill a troublesome hunting dog around two decades ago, insisting she didn't regret the possibly career-ending decision to disclose that she once shot a 14-month-old puppy in the face. \"As a mom, I made a choice between protecting my children, and protecting them from a dangerous animal that was killing livestock and attacking people,\" Noem said.\n\nShe similarly dug her heels in while addressing a passage of her book in which she appears to suggest that President Joe Biden's dog, Commander, should meet a similar fate to Cricket.\n\n\"At the end of the book, you say the very first thing you would do if you got to the White House... is that you'd make sure 'Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds. Commander, say hello to Cricket.' Are you doing this to try to look tough?\" Brennan asked.\n\n\"Well, number one, Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people,\" Noem said. \"So how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog and what to do with it?\"\n\nBrennan then correctly pointed out that Commander, who has indeed bitten around two dozen Secret Service personnel, has since been removed from the White House and sent to live with relatives of the president.\n\n\"You're saying [Commander] should be shot?\" the host asked.\n\n\"That's what the president should be accountable to,\" Noem replied. \"What is the number?\"\n\nNo Going Back, which Noem repeatedly described on Face the Nation as a \"how-to guide\" for Americans looking \"to have input into their government,\" hits shelves on Tuesday.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Kim Jong Un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been.\"\n\nNo Going Back also featured claims Ms Noem turned down an invitation to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron, which his office denied.\n\nBeyond the claims about world leaders, the memoir has attracted attention for Governor Noem's account of killing a young dog on her farm after it misbehaved and ate a neighbors chickens.\n\n\"The fact is, South Dakota law states that dogs who attack and kill livestock can be put down,\" she wrote on X in April. \"Given that Cricket had shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Going_Back_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No Going Back (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_(North_Korean_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader (North Korean title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Commonwealth_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Commonwealth University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Notre Dame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghostwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Korean", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Korean", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Hapkido", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Hapkido", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/28/20/newFile.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Image via Gage Skidmore.\n\nSouth Dakota Governor Kristi Noem (R) is almost certainly out of consideration in the 2024 veepstakes due to the story of her shooting her 14 month-old puppy, Cricket.\n\nRolling Stone journalist Asawin Suebsaeng recently reported that former President Donald Trump is reportedly \"disgusted\" by the story from Noem's memoir, according to unnamed sources close to the ex-president. Those sources say that Trump has repeatedly discussed Noem's story of shooting her family dog during closed-door meetings and private phone calls.\n\n\"Trump, sources recount, has pointedly asked questions regarding her decision to kill the dog, including specifically, 'Why would she do that?' and 'What is wrong with her?'\" Suebsaeng wrote. \"He has expressed bewilderment that she would have ever admitted to doing this, willingly and in her own writing, and has argued it demonstrates she has a poor grasp of 'public relations.'\" In the report, Trump is also described as \"taunting\" Noem behind her back about the incident.\n\nREAD MORE: (Opinion) Kristi Noem defends shooting her 14 month-old puppy to death, brags she has media 'gasping'\n\n\"In these various conversations over the past week, the ex-president has also mentioned that voters generally don't like politicians who kill dogs, two of the people familiar with the matter add,\" Suebsaeng continued.\n\nRolling Stone's sources reportedly sought to use Noem's anecdote about Cricket to convince him to remove her from consideration as the presumptive GOP nominee's vice presidential pick. Sources were apparently motivated to go after Noem due to both their desire to see Trump select a stronger running mate, and out of opposition to Noem's paramour and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\n\nAs fallout increases over Noem's story, she has sought to downplay the incident, insisting that Cricket was meant to be a \"working dog\" but was \"extremely dangerous\" and had to be put down after killing a neighbor's chickens. The South Dakota governor also maintained that the theme of her book is about how she's had to make tough decisions throughout her life, with the Cricket story being just one example.\n\n\"You know how the fake news works,\" Noem said in a Fox News interview. \"They leave out some or most of the facts of a story, they put the worst spin on it. And that's what's happened in this case.\n\nREAD MORE: Kristi Noem's damage control response to puppy shooting story: She also killed 3 horses\n\nFuror over the story erupted last week, after an excerpt from Noem's autobiography emerged in which she said she \"hated that dog.\" Noem emphasized that Cricket was \"less than worthless... as a hunting dog\" and that the puppy was \"untrainable\" and \"dangerous to anyone she came in contact with.\"\n\n\"[Cricket] had come to us from a family who had found her way too aggressive,\" Noem said. \"We were her second chance and the day she was put down was a day that she massacred livestock that were part of our neighbors. She attacked me and it was a hard decision.\"\n\nWith Noem likely out of VP consideration, Trump's VP shortlist has narrowed to a few high-profile names. The former president is reportedly fond of Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) and JD Vance (R-Ohio). He's also considering House Republican Conference chair Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-New York) and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum (R). Trump has yet to indicate when he would be announcing his running mate, though USA Today reports that he's holding court with several members of the shortlist at an event in Florida this weekend.\n\nClick here to read Rolling Stone's report (subscription required).\n\nREAD MORE: 'I hated that dog': Kristi Noem recalls taking family pup to gravel pit and killing it", "source": {"uri":

Kristi Noem's office confirmed Friday she has not met with illusive North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, despite a reported excerpt from her book saying otherwise -- the latest eyebrow-raising claim in the Republican governor's memoir, in which Noem discusses shooting her dog and allegedly getting threats from Nikki Haley.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines.

Noem wrote she shot her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket because the dog had an \"aggressive personality\" and was difficult to train. She reportedly uses the story to talk about her willingness \"to do anything \"difficult, messy and ugly.\" She also wrote about shooting a \"nasty and mean\" goat her family owned. She said the goat survived the first shot and she had to run back to her truck to get a second shell before returning to \"put him down.\" Noem was immediately hit with backlash for the story about her dog and later called reports \"fake news\" while also defending the decision, saying the dog needed to be killed because it was \"extremely dangerous.\"\n\nNoem has been widely viewed as a possible running mate for former President Donald Trump this year -- but some observers think the dog excerpt could hurt her chances.\n\nA conversation between Noem and Haley recounted in \"No Going Back,\" as quoted by Politico, has also gotten some attention. Noem says Haley offered to mentor her, but allegedly went on to say, \"I've heard a lot of really good things about you. But I also want you to know that if I hear something bad ... I will be sure to let you know.'\" Noem said she took the conversation as a threat, and said Haley had \"wanted me to know that there was only room for one Republican woman in the spotlight. It was weird.\" Chaney Denton, a spokesperson for Haley, told Politico his boss \"has long called and written notes supporting other women when they go through challenging times\" and that she was reaching out to Noem to encourage her amid criticism of her handling of Covid-19. \"How she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breaking news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Going_Back_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "No Going Back (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_civil_rights_movement_(1954\u20131968)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African-American civil rights movement (1954\u20131968)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_America_Forward", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Move America Forward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-trailer_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semi-trailer truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannibalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nelson Mandela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denton,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denton, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denton, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6635275154fe1222dd5d8f36/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2410,1357,x0,y58,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Kristi Noem for executing her puppy and writing about it in her forthcoming memoir -- a matter that appears to have closed the book on the idea of selecting her as a vice presidential nominee.\n\nDuring conversations with close political allies and other confidants, sources say, the former president has repeatedly brought up the incident, including as recently as in the past couple days, to criticize Noem and question her political acumen.\n\nThis reporting is based on four sources familiar with the matter, and another two people briefed on it. Over the last few days, all but one source on this story approached Rolling Stone unprompted to describe recent discussions with Trump, or brought up the topic unsolicited during unrelated conversations.\n\nSome of the sources candidly said they were disclosing these private details because they want Noem permanently eliminated from Trump's 2024 vice presidential shortlist, or because they despise Corey Lewandowski, Trump's former 2016 campaign chief who has advised Noem for years. Some separately said they were discussing this simply because Trump had been talking about Noem's puppy slaying so frequently that it was, in the words of one of the sources, \"getting kind of ridiculous\" how \"disgusted\" the former president sounded about this and how much he has been \"taunting\" Noem behind her back.\n\nLast week, The Guardian reported that Noem wrote in her new book about how she took her 14-month-old puppy, Cricket -- a dog she \"hated\" -- to a gravel pit and executed her, after the hunting dog displayed unruly behavior, including harming some of her neighbor's chickens. The memoir, No Going Back, is set for release next week, with a blurb from Trump calling Noem a \"tremendous leader\" and her book \"a winner.\"\n\nIn recent days, the former president has discussed or brought up Noem's pup-execution in closed-door meetings, as well as over the phone. Trump, sources recount, has pointedly asked questions regarding her decision to kill the dog, including specifically, \"Why would she do that?\" and \"What is wrong with her?\" He has expressed bewilderment that she would have ever admitted to doing this, willingly and in her own writing, and has argued it demonstrates she has a poor grasp of \"public relations.\" In these various conversations over the past week, the ex-president has also mentioned that voters generally don't like politicians who kill dogs, two of the people familiar with the matter add.\n\nAmong the upper crust of MAGAland, Noem has long been considered a contender for Trump's 2024 veep pick, though she was often viewed as a longshot. Those hopes appear to be dead now, after longtime allies and other conservatives close to Trump actively worked to place news stories about Noem and the dog in front of him, as Rolling Stone reported earlier this week.\n\nNoem defended executing Cricket in an appearance on Fox News on Wednesday, telling host and informal Trump adviser Sean Hannity that the 14-month-old canine \"was a working dog and it was not a puppy.\"\n\n\"The reason it's in the book is because this book is filled with tough, challenging decisions that I had to make throughout my life,\" she added.\n\nNoem was previously scheduled to headline a fundraiser on Saturday for Jefferson County Republicans in Lakewood, Colorado. The event was canceled due to apparent \"safety concerns.\"\n\nThe group wrote that \"we were excited to have [Noem] speak at our annual fundraiser,\" adding, \"The timing was perfect, as it was just prior to her new book being released. We had no prior knowledge of the contents of the book when we invited her.\"\n\nAs a result of \"mainstream media coverage\" about the book, the group said it has received death threats and its event was set to face protests. \"Please know that the Jefferson County Republican Party is not taking a position on the public outcry on the governor's book,\" the group wrote.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "asawin_suebsaeng@rollingstone.com", "name": "Asawin Suebsaeng", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "andrew_perez@rollingstone.com", "name": "Andrew Perez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Lewandowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corey Lewandowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Hannity", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Hannity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mainstream media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakewood,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lakewood, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lakewood, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kristi-noem-donald-trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all),\" she wrote.\n\nAfter a wave of public scepticism over the claim, Ian Fury, Ms Noem's spokesman, clarified it was one of two \"small errors\" that would be changed.\n\nThe book's publisher also confirmed it would be removed from the print edition and \"as soon as technically possible in the audio and eBook editions.\"\n\nUnfavourable scrutiny\n\nWhen asked directly if she had met with North Korea's authoritarian leader, Ms Noem told CBS News's Face the

to my attention, I made sure that was adjusted.\"\n\nThe unfavourable scrutiny of Ms Noem's memoir has fuelled speculation it could harm her chances of being picked as the Republican's vice-presidential candidate.\n\nHowever, CNN, citing Mr Trump's advisors, said the governor had already fallen off his shortlist.\n\nMs Noem has since defended her killing of Cricket as a \"hard decision\" that she made to protect her children from an \"extremely dangerous\" dog.\n\nShe said the anecdote had been twisted by \"fake news\" and that the incident showed how capable she was of doing some of the more gruesome jobs in life when necessary.\n\nOn Sunday, she stoked the controversy further by saying Joe Biden, the US President, should put down his dog Commander because the

Trump is reportedly criticizing South Dakota's Governor Noem, a staunch MAGA supporter, in private for the decision to kill her puppy and discuss it in her new memoir. This development seems to have effectively ended any consideration of her as a potential vice presidential nominee.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, Trump has brought up the incident multiple times during discussions with close political allies and other trusted individuals. This information comes from four sources with direct knowledge of the situation and another two individuals who knew about it and spoke to Rolling Stone. Some of these sources admitted to revealing these private details because they 'want Noem permanently eliminated' from consideration for Trump's 2024 VP shortlist. Others mentioned that their motivation stemmed from their dislike of Corey Lewandowski, Trump's former 2016 campaign chief, who had been working with Noem for a while. A few individuals stated that they were sharing this information for the sake of discussion alone.\n\nTrump's frequent discussion of Noem's decision to kill her puppy had reached a point where, according to one source, the former president's level of 'disgust' and the extent of his 'taunting' of Noem behind her back seemed excessive. In recent times, the ex-president has been talking about the incident during private meetings and phone conversations. Sources have disclosed that Trump is also questioning, \"Why would she do that?\" and \"What is wrong with her?\"\n\nThe real estate tycoon was apparently surprised that she would openly admit to such an action. Additionally, he has argued that this incident showcased her poor understanding of public relations. Trump also reportedly mentioned that voters typically do not favor politicians who harm dogs. The Guardian recently reported that in her new book, Noem detailed the story of taking her 14-month-old puppy, Cricket, a dog she did not like, to a gravel pit to be put down. This decision came after the hunting dog exhibited unruly behavior, including harming some of her neighbor's chickens.\n\nNo Going Back, the memoir by Noem, is scheduled for release next week, featuring praise from Trump, who hails her as a 'tremendous leader' and describes her book as a 'winner,' as per the same report by Rolling Stones. \"Cricket was a wirehair pointer, about 14 months old,\" the South Dakota governor wrote. Additionally, she mentioned that the dog, a female, displayed aggressive behavior and required training for pheasant hunting. The subsequent narrative reveals how this training endeavor took a disastrous turn and, surprisingly, Cricket was not the sole domestic animal Noem decided to euthanize during hunting season.\n\nNoem included the story of Cricket to demonstrate her readiness, both in politics and in everyday life in South Dakota, to tackle difficult, messy, and unsightly tasks when necessary.

fundraising dinner for the Jefferson County Republican Party slated to feature South Dakota governor and vice-presidential hopeful Kristi Noem has been canceled due to safety concerns, party officials announced Friday.\n\nThe cancellation comes amid new criticisms of Noem's book \"No Going Back,\" as experts dismiss two meetings the governor claims to have had with world leaders -- including North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and French President Emmanuel Macron -- as \"dubious\" if not outright impossible, The Dakota Scout reported Wednesday.\n\nThe timing of inviting Noem to speak at the group's annual fundraiser dinner seemed perfect when the Jefferson County GOP reached out in January, as it was just prior to the release date for the governor's new book, party chair Nancy Pallozzi said in a statement released Friday.\n\nNoem was elected as the first female governor of South Dakota in 2018 and \"is on President Trump's short list for Vice President,\" organizers wrote on an event page that has since been taken down.\n\n\"We had no prior knowledge of the contents of the book when we invited her,\" Pallozzi stated.\n\nIn late April, Noem began to receive backlash over a section in her soon-to-be-released book where she described killing her 14-month-old dog over behavioral problems.\n\nThe incident took place 20 years ago, but Noem's retelling sparked criticism from Republicans, Democrats and dog experts alike, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIn the past few days, numerous threats and death threats have been made to the party, the Denver West Marriot and to the South Dakota governor and her staff, Pallozzi stated Friday.\n\n\"We understood there was a planned organized protest outside of the hotel, led by Progress Now,\" Pallozzi said in Friday's statement. \"I felt that our event would be negatively impacted, and we could not take the risk that those who made threats would cause physical harm.\"\n\nAccording to Pallozzi, the last threat the county organization received was a voicemail message warning that there would be \"guns at the protest and people might get hurt.\"\n\nThe Jefferson County Republican Party is working to plan a different event in the near future.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_penington@denverpost.com", "name": "Lauren Penington",

It's a good thing because it makes you stronger, and it teaches you really what you're up against, and it makes you recognize how much they lie, how much they will twist, how much they will manipulate. And you just have to be strong and be happy warriors.\"\n\nEarlier in the speech, Noem said the Republican Party was \"in a war\" with the media and Democrats who \"don't care about the truth.\"\n\nNoem's remarks came during what was billed as a \"breakfast conversation\" with North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum at the retreat, where Trump is also expected to speak.\n\nThe event represents a de-facto tryout for vice presidential contenders: Several Republicans seen as candidates to be Trump's running mate were also expected to appear, including Sens. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and J.D. Vance (R-Ohio).\n\nNoem has long been mentioned as a possible pick, though people close to the former president say her prospects waned even before controversial excerpts from her book began to appear.\n\nNoem has come under ongoing -- and bipartisan -- criticism for her decision to shoot and kill her dog. She has spent recent days defending her decision, describing Cricket as a threat to her family.\n\nNoem used much of her appearance to highlight her record as governor, a position she has held since 2019, and to praise Trump. She highlighted, among other things, her lopsided 2022 reelection win.\n\n\"Yes, you get a lot of criticism,\" Noem said at one point. \"Every day I dread reading what the press says and how they're twisting the facts and you just have to be OK with that.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Kristi Noem's recent faceplant is a memorable one.\n\nNoem is a Republican and a contender to be former President Donald Trump's vice presidential pick. She wrote a book, as many higher-office aspirants do to burnish their brand, with the release slated for next month. That literary effort backfired mightily.\n\nThe Guardian obtained an advance copy and recently shared a troubling excerpt. In the book, Noem details shooting a 14-month-old wire-haired pointer named Cricket because of behavioral issues. She justified the move by saying that the dog went out of its mind with excitement on a pheasant hunting trip, attacking another family's chickens and then biting Noem herself.\n\nNoem apparently thought the story showed her willingness to take tough but necessary actions. Much of social media thought differently over the weekend, with condemnations abounding and animal rights advocates denouncing her for not attempting to better train the dog or finding it a different home.\n\nNoem, however, doubled down on Sunday, adding some details, such as saying the dog's death happened 20 years ago and that putting it down wasn't the \"easy way\" to handle the situation. She then added, \"Often the easy way isn't the right way.\"\n\nWhomever is serving as Noem's crisis communications adviser either provided some bad advice or was ignored. Cricket's death went viral and inspired critical coverage around the world. Adding to the controversy, as she did with her tweet on Sunday, suggested a candidate and advisers not ready for prime time.\n\nMitt Romney, the 2012, Republican presidential candidate, was pilloried relentlessly for putting his dog in a carrier strapped to the roof of a car on a family trip. Noem ignored this history, an ill-advised move.\n\nYes, Cricket died 20 years ago, at a time when there may not have been as many rescue organizations willing to take on dogs with behavioral issues. In addition, Noem does come from a rural background, where it was more common in the past to dispatch dogs that attack chickens, for example.\n\nThat said, the dog's death is certainly not something to be proud of. Or, hold up as evidence of both character and decision-making abilities, particularly when dogs are the most popular American pet. About 65.1 million households own one, according to Forbes.\n\nForbes also estimated that Americans spent $136.8 billion on pets in 2022, evidence that dogs are considered family by many. That's a good thing.\n\nCricket died long ago, but it's still a disturbing incident. The backlash was entirely predictable and has been handled dubiously at best by a tone-deaf South Dakota governor and her advisers. That should give pause to those weighing her readiness for a bigger political role.\n\n-- Minneapolis Star-Tribune", "source": {"uri": "sentinelsource.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SentinelSource.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animal rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats_and_Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats and Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/sentinelsource.com/content/tncms/custom/image/7819b5a8-f0c2-11ec-85c6-cff09f7b972a.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Noem wrote that she stopped to speak with a family. The dog escaped from her truck and killed several of the family's chickens, acting like a \"trained assassin,\" she wrote, according to the Guardian's account.\n\nNoem wrote that the dog tried to bite when Noem grabbed her. She also wrote that she \"hated that dog,\" which she said was \"untrainable\" and \"dangerous to anyone she came in contact with.\" It was then that Noem decided she \"had to put her down.\" She took the dog to a gravel pit and shot her.\n\nNoem also wrote that she then decided to shoot a \"nasty and mean\" male goat the same day at the same gravel pit.\n\nNoem's story drew fury from liberals and conservatives. \"My blood is boiling,\" wrote Catturd, a popular conservative X account. \"The View\" host Whoopi Goldberg and her colleagues found common ground on an April 29 episode: If you can't train the dog, \"give it back,\" Goldberg said.\n\nNoem answered her critics in an April 26 X post, sharing the Guardian article and writing: \"We love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm. Sadly, we just had to put down 3 horses a few weeks ago that had been in our family for 25 years.\"\n\nNoem posted again April 28 on X, calling it a 20-year-old story and writing: \"South Dakota law states that dogs who attack and kill livestock can be put down. Given that Cricket had shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did.\"\n\nWe contacted Noem for comment but received no reply.\n\nSouth Dakota attorney general and governor's office weigh in\n\nSouth Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley said in a statement to PolitiFact that his office has received numerous questions about Noem's story, but the state's seven-year statute of limitations has lapsed. He did not answer specific questions about how the law would have applied at the time of the shooting.\n\n\"There have been requests for the attorney general's office to look further into the matter. In South Dakota, there is a seven-year statute of limitations on cases of this nature,\" Jackley said, referring to South Dakota Codified Law 23A-42-2. \"Accordingly, the attorney general's office has no jurisdiction on an incident that occurred a reported 20 years ago and well beyond the seven-year statute of limitations.\"\n\nIan Fury, Noem's communications chief, was quoted in an April 29 Guardian article and referred to two statutes from South Dakota state law 40-34 that cover dog licenses and regulations:\n\nWhat experts say about those laws\n\nDavid Favre, a Michigan State University law professor and editor of the Animal Legal and Historical Web Center, said that 40-34-1 is a law from the 1930s and similar laws are found in many states. They are meant to let farmers protect animals of economic value.\n\nHe doesn't think that particular statute applies in Noem's case. But he added that he doesn't believe the killing of a person's own dog by gunshot is illegal in South Dakota.\n\nRegarding 40-34-1, \"in South Dakota, a person would be allowed to kill a dog that comes onto their land and chases their cat,\" Favre said. \"It is not meant to deal with a person killing their own dog, but I guess an argument might be made if the dog was in the act of doing a bad thing.\"\n\nJustin Marceau, a University of Denver law professor and director of the school's Animal Law Program and Animal Activist Legal Defense Project, also doesn't think statute 40-34-1, which the governor's office cited, authorized Noem to kill the dog.\n\nThe law \"seems to allow for an animal to be killed if the animal is actively 'chasing' or killing an animal considered livestock,\" Marceau said, describing Cricket's chicken assault as a \"past act\" at the time the dog was killed.\n\n\"The laws of South Dakota also permit, as do most states, the euthanizing of dangerous animals in certain circumstances,\" Marceau said. \"But Gov. Noem has failed to note that determinations about whether to euthanize an animal are, by statute, assigned to peace officers and humane officers, not pet owners who determine that it would take extra work or money to properly train a young puppy.\"\n\nConley Wouters, a University of Illinois Chicago assistant law professor who practices animal law, took a different stance. He said he believes 40-34-1 \"does seem to permit killing a dog who has injured or killed\" another person's livestock or poultry.\" Because the law was enacted in 1939, it was on the books when Noem killed Cricket, he added.\n\nWouters said such laws are common in Western states and states with a lot of farming and ranching; he cited laws in Idaho and Ohio that allow dogs to be killed for attacking livestock or people.\n\nThe laws \"tend to favor livestock owners, with some of the laws setting a relatively low bar for when people are permitted to kill a dog.\"\n\n\"Based on my understanding of the law, (what Noem did) was legal then, and it would be legal today in South Dakota and in many other states,\" Wouters said.\n\nExperts say separate animal cruelty laws likely didn't apply\n\nAnti-cruelty provisions govern the humane treatment of animals, and experts told us Noem likely didn't violate those laws, either.\n\nFavre said no section of the state's animal cruelty laws makes the killing by an owner illegal unless pain and suffering is involved.\n\nUnder state law, it's not clear that shooting your own dog would be considered cruel, Favre said: \"Assuming the shot produced near instant death or unconsciousness, then the act would not be cruel.\"\n\nLassiter, from the Humane Society of the United States, agreed that South Dakota's law exempts the humane killing of an animal from its cruelty statute.\n\nA shooting that causes instant or near instant death could be considered exempt, at the discretion of local law enforcement, she said.\n\nMany states allow an animal to be killed as long as there is no prolonged suffering and it doesn't meet the state's definition of torture, Lassiter said.\n\nJames Oppenheimer, the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society's executive director, said South Dakota's animal cruelty laws let people humanely kill animals.\n\nCode 40-1-17 (2) \"permits the humane killing of an animal and exempts people from criminal code,\" Oppenheimer said. And 40-1-1 (6) defines humane killing as \"to cause the death of an animal in a manner to limit the pain or suffering of the animal as much as reasonably possible under the circumstances.\"\n\nShooting an animal isn't explicitly stated in the codes, Oppenheimer said. What Noem did is fairly common in South Dakota, although most people don't publicize it, he said.\n\n\"In a rural setting, farmers and ranchers do euthanize their own animals. That being said, we do wish she had looked at other options,\" Oppenheimer said.\n\nBehavior not uncommon for hunting dog\n\nOppenheimer said Cricket, at 14 months, was very young for a hunting dog and that hunting dogs \"exposed to chickens will generally attack the chickens. That is a dog being a dog. If you reach in to get the dog out of there, you might get bitten.\"\n\n\"Our overall take is that killing an animal with a single gunshot to the head is not illegal in South Dakota. However, this form of euthanasia is designed for large animals that get injured in the field so are difficult to transport,\" Oppenheimer said.\n\nWouters said he empathizes with the outrage about Noem's admission, but said in the U.S., animals are \"legally speaking, personal property.\"\n\n\"Most of us view our dog or cat as a family member, so it can be easy to forget that by and large, the law does not,\" Wouters said. \"It sees them as simple property. So, just like you would be free to dispose of your toaster if you weren't happy with it for some reason, you are often going to be free to destroy your dog.\"\n\nNotwithstanding anti-cruelty provisions, he said, \"the dog has the same legal status as the toaster.\"\n\nOur sources", "source": {"uri": "eu.statesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA TODAY"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\n\"The View's\" co-host, Alyssa Farah Griffin, trashed politicians desperate to be Donald Trump's vice presidential running mate Monday, saying they're compromising everything and lying about their background.\n\nAt the top of the show Monday, the hosts brought up the next installment of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem's disastrous unveiling of her new book. Not only did she confess to shooting a puppy and a goat, she also lied about meeting Kim Jong Un and canceling a meeting with French President Emanuel Macron. In a statement, Macron's office said it never happened.\n\nOver the weekend, Noem was faced with questions about the matter and refused to admit she lied. Instead, she blamed the media.\n\nALSO READ: A dangerous mental illness is spreading in the Trump cult\n\n\"Well, Sean, you know how the fake news works. They leave out some or most of the facts of a story. They put the worst spin on it. And that's what's happened in this case,\" Noem told Fox host Sean Hannity.\n\nMeanwhile another potential pick, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), refused to say if he would accept the results of the 2024 election over weekend.\n\nSpeaking to NBC's Kristen Welker, Scott pledged, \"At the end of the day, the 47th president will be Donald Trump.\"\n\nWelker asked him several times, \"Yes or no,\" whether he would accept the results.\n\n\"That is my statement,\" Scott replied.\n\n\"The View\" co-hosts couldn't figure out what was going on. Sara Haines couldn't understand why Noem didn't know what was in her own book. She then advised Noem that, when someone is in a hole, they should stop digging.\n\nAna Navarro explained that the governor's goal appeared to be that she wants to get her biography out as widely as possible to boost her chances of becoming vice president.\n\n\"That's probably also why she got new, fake teeth for free in Texas,\" quipped Navarro.\n\n\"Margaret Brennan does not play,\" Griffin said of another Noem interview over the weekend, on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\n\"Why she thought this was a good idea is bizarre to me. She comes off as unhinged at this point.\"\n\nShe mentioned a threat Noem made against President Joe Biden's dog, implying she would shoot the German Shepard Commander, who was re-homed after a number of biting incidents involving the Secret Service.\n\n\"She said, 'Say hello to Cricket for me. That's her dog she put down,'\" said Griffin. \"How cruel is that? Also, the North Korean lie is just so easily provable. We don't have diplomats you can do relations with in North Korea. It was a breaking of historic norms when President Trump met him. There would be so much documentation of this meeting, so much press around, and she thought she was going to be able to get away and lie about it?\"\n\n\"The Veepstakes right now feel like 'The Apprentice,' but proving how unprincipled and willing to grovel you are,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"[Scott is] a fairly young person. Elise Stefanik is fairly young. Kristi Noem. Do they not realize there's going to be a world in which Donald Trump is not the center of the Republican universe? You could just stand by your principles and wait it out until you can say things that you believe and not have to just bald-faced lie to get a job.\"", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType":

What a shocker. In her new book, Noem says she met with North Korea's dictator and, separately, that Nikki Haley threatened her; however, neither claim appears to be true. Noem's spokesperson seems to admit that the story about Kim wasn't true, according to Politico.\n\nHe said, \"We've been made aware that the publisher will be addressing conflated world leaders' names in the book before it is released.\"\n\nHaley's camp isn't too pleased with Noem's story where she claims that the former Ambassador threatened her when she reached out to the Republican Governor.\n\nVia Politico:\n\nThe way Noem tells the story, in the summer of 2021 she \"was hauling a trailer full of horses\" when she got word that Haley wanted to talk.\n\nHere's how Noem recounts the conversation:\n\n\"'Hi, Governor, this is Ambassador Nikki Haley, and I just wanted to introduce myself and have a conversation. I just wanted to let you know that I follow you quite a bit. I have heard quite a bit about you, and you are doing a good job there in South Dakota. I was thinking that maybe you might like a mentor, and maybe I could be someone who could do that for you. Because you're a governor, you've gone through some challenging things that I did as well. I would be more than willing to be a mentor, because you've never been in this type of role before.'\n\n\"She went on to tell me about her life story, her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and some of the challenges she faced in her legislature as governor and as ambassador to the United Nations reading daily talking points from the State Department. Once again, I recall, she offered to mentor me, as she was sure I was facing some decisions and situations I'd never seen before. ...\n\n\"After what seemed to me a bit of an awkward pause, she added, 'I ... just ... also want you to know one more thing ... I've heard a lot of really good things about you. But I also want you to know that if I hear something bad ... I will be sure to let you know.'\n\n\"There was a long pause.\n\n\"'Um, well, thanks for that, Ambassador.'\n\n\"'Let me be clear,' she added. 'I've heard many good things about you. But when I do hear bad things, I will make sure that you know. I've enjoyed talking to you. We will visit soon. Goodbye.' Click.\"\n\nSomehow, the Governor took that as a threat, and I have no idea why. So, she called her assistant to complain.\n\n'I think I was just threatened by Nikki Haley?'\n\n\"'What?!'\n\n\"'Yeah, I'm pretty sure I was just threatened by Nikki Haley. It was clear that she wanted me to know that there was only room for one Republican woman in the spotlight. It was weird.'\n\n\"Unsurprisingly, I never received any calls or 'mentoring' from her, but the message was clear. I'm the alpha female here, and you should know your place. I actually felt a little sad for her.\"\n\nShe's the \"alpha female\"? Republicans are so weird. At any rate, Politico contacted Haley's spokesperson, who \"was befuddled\" and was told the two women did have a conversation, but it was in 2020, not 2021.\n\n\"Nikki has long called and written notes supporting other women when they go through challenging times,\" Chaney Denton said. \"She called Governor Noem in 2020 to encourage her when she was criticized for keeping her state open during Covid. How she would twist that into a threat is just plain weird.\"\n\nNoem, who was seen as a possible VP pick for Trump, is in full damage control over her revelations of the brutal killing of her dog, which she said she hated, at a gravel pit.", "source": {"uri": "crooksandliars.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crooks and Liars"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conover_kennard@crooksandliars.com", "name": "Conover Kennard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Dakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denton,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denton, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denton, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://crooksandliars.com/files/primary_image/24/05/50751294353_ad51e0bbad_k_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

And now it appears that she wants President Joe Biden's German Shepherd to face a similar fate.\n\nThis weekend, the Republican showed no signs of backing down from the subject, and turned her attention to another badly-behaved dog: Commander, the president's German Shepherd.\n\nIn an interview on Sunday with CBS's morning show Face The Nation, Ms Noem was asked about a passage in her memoir, where she said that one of the first things she would do if she was in charge would be to make sure Mr Biden's dog was off the premises, and suggested the dog should be euthanized.\n\n\"What would I do if I was president on the first day in office in 2025? Thanks for asking. I happen to have a list. The first thing I'd do is make sure Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds ('Commander, say hello to Cricket for me'). But my dog, Foster, would sure be welcome. He comes with me to the capitol all the time and loves everyone,\" reads the excerpt, according to CNN.\n\n\"Are you doing this to try to look tough?\" CBS anchor Margaret Brennan asked Ms Noem about the passage.\n\n\"Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people,\" she replied. \"So how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog?\"\n\nDocuments released in February revealed that at least 24 incidents of biting took place at the White House and the president's Delaware residence over a 10-month period - including one where an agent required six stitches.\n\n\"Well, he's not living at the White House anymore,\" Ms Brennan said, referring to Commander, leading Ms Noem to respond: \"That's the question that the President should be held accountable to.\"\n\nMs Brennan then asked: \"You're saying he should be shot?\"\n\n\"That what's the president should be accountable to,\" Ms Noem replied.\n\nMs Noem also defended her decision to end Cricket's life, saying that it was a \"choice she made over 20 years ago\" to \"protect\" her family.\n\n\"This was a dangerous animal that was killing livestock and attacking people. And- and I had little children at the time, our operation had many kids running around and people in interaction with the public. And I made a difficult choice,\" she said on Sunday.\n\nSince the dog-killing revelations, Ms Noem has spent the past week defending her actions and faced criticism from political commentations, Democrats, and anti-Trump Republicans.\n\nPolitical strategists also suggested that the tale may have affected her chances at becoming Donald Trump's vice president pick.\n\n\"She's DOA,\" an ally of Mr Trump told The Hill last week, adding that it's \"not good\" if you have to respond multiple times to a story.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Shepherd", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "German Shepherd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Dakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euthanasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/28/20/newFile.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

(KELO) -- Ahead of the release of Governor Kristi Noem's new book, excerpts from early copies have kept the vice presidential hopeful in the news, though she has dodged coverage by journalists covering her in her home state.\n\nThe early scandal was Noem's decision to include a story in which she shoots her family's 14-month-old puppy, cricket, as well as a family goat, which she shot back-to-back on the same day.\n\nNext came questions of accuracy, the most glaring of which was an account Noem made of meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un -- a meeting which foreign policy experts say could not have occurred.\n\nThat passage of the book is being removed, with Noem telling CBS's \"Face the Nation\" host Margaret Brennan that \"as soon as it was brought to my attention, we went forward and have made some edits.\"\n\nThis stood out as interesting choice of words, as Noem posted to social media in March about narrating the audio version of her book, which presumably included the supposed meeting with Kim Jong Un.\n\nNoem's interview with Brennan came on May 5, a day before she was slated to speak on \"CBS This Morning.\"\n\nDuring the May 6 CBS appearance, CBS affiliates across the country, including KELOLAND, were given notice that there would be opportunities to interview Noem remotely.\n\nKELOLAND News secured a slot to interview Noem via CBS at 9:00 a.m. on May 6, confirmed via email on May 3. The interview was to be conducted by KELOLAND's Tom Hanson.\n\nHanson's interview with Noem through CBS was to be our first chance to speak with the Governor since news of the book began to circulate. This is despite KELOLAND's best effort.\n\nOn April 29, 2024, KELOLAND News reached out to Noem's office via email, requesting an interview with the governor, and sending along a handful of questions.\n\nWe were met with an emailed response from Noem's communications official, Ian Fury, directing us to Noem's then-recent social media posts promoting her book.\n\nOn April 30, 2024, KELOLAND again emailed Noem's office with a request for an interview.\n\nThis email went entirely unanswered.\n\nOn May 2, 2024, KELOLAND tried again, emailing Noem's office with a request for an interview and a copy of her book.\n\nFury replied by email, saying \"I believe you have the Governor's statements. The book publishes on Tuesday, so you can always obtain a copy then - but you can also reach out to the publisher to request one.\"\n\nWith no ability to speak with the governor ahead of her CBS appearances, KELOLAND News was prepared to interview Noem remotely during her time in New York. This did not come to pass.\n\nOn May 4, 2024, the day after KELOLAND's interview slot had been confirmed, CBS notified KELOLAND that Noem was declining to speak with KELOLAND, and that the governor would instead be reaching out to set up an interview in studio in Sioux Falls once she is back from promoting her book.\n\nSeeking further clarification on the matter, KELOLAND News was told by CBS that Noem's office said they would be reaching out directly after getting through Monday's appearances.\n\nKELOLAND News has yet to hear from Noem's office on an in-person interview.\n\nWhile Noem opted not to speak with KELOLAND via CBS on Monday, interviews were given with CBS affiliate stations in Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis and Baltimore.\n\nThis is not the first instance in which Noem has snubbed local media in South Dakota.\n\nIn 2023, South Dakota News Watch outlined the experience of South Dakota journalists who said Gov. Kristi Noem and her administration have significantly reduced access of journalists to information and interviews over the past few years.", "source": {"uri": "keloland.com", "dataType": "news",

She Did It Anyway.", "body": "In other words, they produced a typical pre-campaign book, where the first rule is to do no harm. Somewhat unusually for the genre, that book, 2022's Not My First Rodeo: Lessons from the Heartland, landed the South Dakota governor on the New York Times' bestseller list, adding to the consensus that the Donald Trump devotee had a big future in GOP politics.\n\nWhat it didn't do, of course, was spark a weeklong news cycle -- and a round of obituaries for that same political future -- by including a tale about Noem leading a 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket to a gravel pit and shooting him to death after he ruined a pheasant hunt and killed a neighbor's chickens.\n\nThis time around, Noem has a different team in place, as well as a different imprint, Hachette's conservative-leaning Center Street. And the folks behind her new book, No Going Back, didn't get in the way of sharing memories about gunning down an ill-trained puppy.\n\nA Noem spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt's been a busy week for that communications team, and not just for Cricket-related reasons. The book's fact-checking has also been called into question: Last week, the Dakota Scout reported on a passage of the book in which Noem claims to have met the dictator of North Korea while she was serving as a backbencher in Congress. The improbable meeting never happened.\n\nShortly afterward, Noem's spokesperson told my colleague Ryan Lizza that \"the publisher will be addressing conflated world leaders' names in the book before it is released.\" Still unspecified: Just which world leader Noem could possibly have conflated with Kim Jong Un. The 300-pound despot with the gravity-defying haircut is not exactly your run-of-the-mill interchangeable foreign statesman.\n\nAfter days of social-media mockery from fellow governors, headlines along the lines of NOEM DEFENDS DOG SLAYING, and awkward interviews like the one with an incredulous Margaret Brennan on Face the Nation, the book booboos more or less defined Noem's brand by the end of the weekend.\n\nThe governor, sticking to her political brand, didn't go back. She described the killing as the kind of tough decision you have to make on the farm -- and contrasted her decisiveness with Joe Biden's failure to act after his own chronically ill-behaved German Shepherd attacked Secret Service staffers.\n\nThe ongoing Noem spectacle is, to put it mildly, not the kind of roll-out that typically accompanies a look-at-me book by a national-politics wannabe. But it is an interesting window into the Washington industry of pre-campaign memoirs -- where the goal of defining a brand is often at odds with the goal of producing interesting copy, and where nobody puts a great deal of emphasis on quality control or literary drama.\n\nEven within the grandiose political-memoir category, the rising-national-candidate subgenre historically stood out in its formulaic dullness. A big shot at the end of a career can at least describe being in the room when important things happened, or use a book to settle scores with folks readers might actually have heard of. A governor trying to establish a national footprint doesn't have that kind of material to work with.\n\nWhich means that the tomes have typically been paint-by-numbers affairs in which a ghostwriter tries to spin some log-cabin yarns from the pol's childhood, dramatize otherwise obscure old clashes over local political issues, and maybe toss in a nod to the noble responsibility that came with commanding their state's National Guard.\n\n\"It was their calling card,\" said Larry Weissman, a New York-based literary agent who sells lots of political books and was involved with then-Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's (actually well-reviewed) 2016 memoir. \"It gave them an excuse to do more media and tour around the country. But they always play it incredibly safe and so they're boring AF. And so nobody really reads them.\"\n\nBut just because they're not usually meant to be read doesn't mean they're not meant to be purchased. Especially now, in an age when the line between cable-TV political provocateur and actual elected official has blurred, a book by a telegenic rising political star might sell for the same reason as a book by a talking-head figure like Mark Levin: People buy it as a sort of tribal emblem for their politics.\n\nNoem's first book is a case in point: It sold 100,000 copies across all formats and made the New York Times bestseller list, an easy win for its publisher. \"The industry doesn't think much of these books but they may make easy money for a publisher,\" is how one top agent put it to me, speaking anonymously, perhaps because the agency would like to keep working in this line of business.\n\nThanks to the economics of book publishing -- where a single smash hit balances out a string of mediocre sellers -- publishers also know that there's always a chance that the vicissitudes of politics could lead to gold even with mediocre sellers: Consider the memoir by the unknown Harvard Law School graduate Barack Obama, which became a bestseller years later when the future president's star rose.\n\nBut for every book like that, there are volumes by supposedly can't-miss candidates like Marco Rubio that disappear along with the politician's fortunes.\n\nNow the second Noem book is unintentionally highlighting that often-overlooked other factor in campaign books: Quality control.\n\nOrdinarily, few of the players have much motivation to care about excellence. For the publisher, it's the politician's name that's going to make a book sell or flop. For an ambitious pol trying to build a brand, repeating political nostrums often seems a better way to do so than pushing the literary envelope.\n\nIt doesn't help that the pols' production process can be hasty -- and facilitated by loyalists. \"They will often be crashed, so they come in late, and then they're edited quickly,\" said Weissman.\n\n\"There is this tendency among politicians to hire staffers or somebody who maybe doesn't have the wherewithal or stature to be able to push back and say, hey, the story you want to tell isn't imparting the point that you want to make,\" said Keith Urbahn of the Beltway literary agency Javelin, which has sold scores of political memoirs from pols ranging from Adam Schiff to Ted Cruz. (Javelin also represented Noem on her first book, though they declined comment on the behind-the-scenes processes for any specific authors.)\n\nThe campaign-book genre is so widely mocked that even its most convincing defense involves a calculus more interesting to journalists than to regular people who just want to curl up with a good book: The longtime book critic Carlos Lozada, whose recent collection, The Washington Book, is all about Beltway lit, has argued that campaign books are a place pols tell on themselves by the way they shade things or position stories. But that requires a kind of delving between the lines that for most civilians is different from actually reading for pleasure.\n\nNoem's new book -- which doesn't officially publish until May 7 -- meets that standard: Whatever you think of putting down a dog for attacking a neighbor's chickens, the decision to keep the story in the book also seems to show a political culture so devoted to shocking establishment nostrums that it fails to recognize how loving dogs is a pretty mainstream piece of American culture. (I wrote an entire book about the lengths Americans will go to for their pets, and found it's the rare factor in our national life that knows no party.)\n\nAnd beyond the Cricket story, possibly making up an easily disprovable memory about meeting Kim Jong Un -- or else confusing one of the world's most recognizable tyrants with some random other person -- is a quality-control problem altogether different from the usual one in which pols fill books with lame cliches. Newspapers and magazines stand behind the things they put out, but in book-publishing, the veracity of a work is entirely on the writer.\n\nJavelin's principals told me they thought the embarrassing round of publicity around Noem's new book might be a reminder that quality actually matters, whether the goal is selling books or selling a candidacy. \"You can't fake being a bestseller for weeks,\" Urbahn said.\n\n\"Somebody who has a big platform can get on TV the week their book comes out and sell a certain number of copies,\" said Matt Latimer, who runs the agency with Urbahn. \"But if your book isn't any good content, or there are all kinds of errors in it, you don't have that tail -- and what you really want, and what a publisher wants, is a book by someone prominent that lasts more than a week. And that's why content, fact-checking, research, saying something new and interesting, or having an argument matters.\"\n\nSounds good to me, but there's also an irony about the story that has Noem in so much hot water: If I were editing a memoir by some public figure in or out of politics, and it included a story about intentionally killing their dog, I would absolutely include it -- it's a fascinatingly unusual tale, so different from the typical self-aggrandizing autobiographer, one that raises huge questions and reveals something about character. I bet audiences would agree.\n\nOf course, thinking of the audience in terms of readers rather than voters is why I'm a writer, not a PR ace.\n\n\"We try to be a full service agency that is looking around corners, anticipating problems, ultimately creating the most commercial version of a book that is in keeping with the author's intended goals,\" Urbahn said.\n\nWe'll find out soon enough whether the Cricket story made the book more interesting to readers: It comes out Tuesday, but spent the last week on Amazon's top 1,000 even before publication day. As for what the choice means for her political future, we may need to wait just a little longer.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [],

To illustrate this, in her forthcoming book, she tells a story: that of shooting her hunting dog, Cricket.\n\nThis, as basically anyone could have predicted, did not have the intended impact of showcasing Noem as a bold leader. Instead, even Donald Trump Jr., who has shot many an endangered animal on his hunting trips, criticized the move.\n\nNoem has been on a frantic press circuit to try to put the story to bed, excusing her actions as necessary. She has explained that the 14-month-old dog was \"not a puppy,\" and that all criticism of her decision to shoot Cricket is \"fake news.\"\n\nHer reasons for shooting Cricket, according to the book, include that the puppy ruined a pheasant hunt by getting too excited about chasing the birds and that Cricket once tried to bite her. Noem also says that Cricket killed her neighbor's chickens -- something my boyfriend's puppy once did to his own chickens. (He did not shoot his dog.)\n\n\"I hated that dog,\" Noem wrote. She also, as it turns out, hated a billy goat that she shot in a gravel pit alongside Cricket. For the goat, her reasons were that it sometimes got her childrens' clothes dirty and smelled \"disgusting, musky, rancid.\"\n\nThere are many widely-accepted reasons to put down an animal, including illness and, yes, aggression, though the latter is controversial. Naturally-occuring smell and hunting skills are not among them. And usually, killing an animal is accompanied by sadness, not bragging\n\nSociety's taboo against cruelty to animals goes back to the time of the Talmud. According to the Jewish texts, \"unnecessary\" cruelty to animals is prohibited -- and, in fact, kindness is required. Animals, like people, are prohibited from working on Shabbat, owners are required to feed their animals, whether pets or livestock, before they themselves sit down for Shabbat dinner.\n\nWhile Noem might litigate whether her actions qualify as \"unnecessary\" cruelty, the Talmud also states that one should not own an animal unless they can properly care and provide for it.\n\nNoem states in her book that she was Cricket's second owner -- another family had gotten rid of the dog because she was aggressive and hard to control. Noem knew Cricket might be a handful when she adopted the dog, yet she did so anyway, even though she was evidently unprepared to handle it.\n\nHunting dogs often have strong prey drives, but they require work to control. As is a catchphrase among many dog advocates, there's no such thing as a bad dog, only bad owners.\n\nSimilarly, as someone who has worked on a goat farm, I can confirm that male goats stink; they pee on their beards as part of their mating instinct, to spread their pheromones. But if you want a fresh-smelling pet, it's your job not to get a billy goat -- or probably any goat at all.", "source": {"uri": "forward.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Forward"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mira_fox@forward.com", "name": "Mira Fox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(insect)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket (insect)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunting dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheasant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pheasant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talmud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shabbat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruelty to animals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aggression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheromone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pheromone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catchphrase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taboo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://forward.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2087318890.jpg?_t=1714766618", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

Kristi Noem bragged about shooting her puppy, then said Joe Biden should shoot his dog, too.\n\nAs you probably know, Noem made news again when she said that she didn't know how that story about meeting Kim Jong Un got into the same autobiography in which she'd bragged about shooting her puppy, and also a goat she didn't much like.\n\nWe can't even write this off as another writer who has somehow failed to read her own book, since that is her voice on the audio version of \"No Going Back,\" which is coming out on Tuesday.\n\nMaybe her impression that dog-killing is impressive is the natural progression from that time Iowa's Joni Ernst ran for the U.S. Senate by talking about her tough-gal history of hog castration.\n\nOr from Sarah Palin's efforts to allow the inhumane aerial gunning of grizzlies. During her brief tenure as governor of Alaska, Palin also authorized a program that gasses wolf puppies in their dens with carbon monoxide.\n\nKilling goats you don't like and dogs that won't hunt is just all part of life on a farm, says Noem, but no, it isn't. Just as cruelty, which always shows weakness rather than strength, has not always been a natural part of life in her party.\n\nRemember when Mitt Romney tried so hard to explain that his family dog kind of liked riding to Canada in a carrier on the top of their car? Seamus relaxed in the comfort of a windshield-equipped carrier.\n\nViolence is central to facism, though, and with MAGA, we have gone from a GOP whose nominee was horrified by the suggestion that he'd treated a family pet casually to one in which someone on the vice-presidential shortlist assumed that announcing \"I hated that dog,\" -- so bye, Cricket -- would enhance her chance of getting the nomination.\n\nA poll on puppycide does show partisan differences, with Republicans more accepting of what Noem did, and definite Trump voters even more so.\n\nBut the good news here, if you squint hard enough, is that most of those who were polled did see Noem more unfavorably after learning that her kids had to come home asking, \"Where's Cricket?\"\n\nAnd though she may have felt that her lie about meeting Kim Jong Un would be accepted in the same way that Donald Trump's endless cascade of baseless allegations and self-aggrandizing twaddle has been, it wasn't, because others just don't get away with what he does.\n\nIf you don't believe me, just try intimidating jurors, judges, their clerks and families in any court in the land and see if you, too, get off with endless reprimands and no real consequences.\n\nIt's unfortunate, of course, that the fact that we're sometimes still wary of whoppers and mostly still down on shooting dogs passes for good news, but Cruella is not going to be her party's vice presidential nominee.", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "melinda_henneberger@kansascity.com", "name":

But maybe we also need to ask the opposite: why are they telling us the truth?\n\nExhibit one: Kristi Noem, governor of South Dakota. She had been mentioned as a possible vice-presidential candidate for Donald Trump. So, as American politicians insist on doing, she is publishing an autobiography. Unfortunately for her, the book has already proved a little too honest.\n\nNoem recounts how she shot her puppy Cricket, because he was apparently untrainable and had bitten people. \"I hated that dog,\" she writes, disastrously misjudging the instincts of a country that spends $137bn a year on petcare. Noem adds that she shot her pet goat dead. She even details that the goat survived the first shot, so she had to dispatch him at the second attempt in the same gravel pit.\n\nHad someone else come up with this story, Noem could do the usual Republican thing and blame the media. But no, it's in her own book, and she actually tweeted approvingly of the extract, telling followers to pre-order the memoir \"if you want more real, honest, and politically INcorrect stories that'll have the media gasping\".\n\nVoters are likely to decide that the book is a lot more putdownable than the pets. In one poll, 81 per cent of those who were told of her actions disapproved of them. Noem's memoir is entitled No Going Back, and there really isn't.\n\nBut Noem is not alone in self-sabotaging. Former Chelsea footballer John Terry recently went on the type of podcast that is intended to make old pros look like legends. Terry, a hard-man central defender, is an acquired taste -- the sort you might acquire after, say, a head injury. On the Up Front podcast, he recounted how, on a pre-season flight, Chelsea's then new manager Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas had seated senior players in economy class, and young players in first. Terry boasts that he threw a tantrum until the seats were swapped: otherwise \"I promise you the plane wasn't going\". If you didn't know how arrogant he was, you do now.\n\nThere have been other baffling own goals. Former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan wrote in his memoir The Insider how he was told how phone-hacking worked and how he paid an investigator who stole documents from Elton John's bin. Five months ago, the book was cited in a High Court judgment, which concluded, against Morgan's denials, that he knew about illegal practices.\n\nSimilarly, Boris Johnson's aides leaked details of his birthday party in June 2020, seeing it as good colour about government during Covid. In fact, it was the seed of the scandal that would bring down his premiership.\n\nMore darkly, former Rolling Stones bass guitarist Bill Wyman admitted in his autobiography that he met his future wife Mandy Smith when she was underage: \"She was a woman at 13.\"\n\nWhat explains such disclosures? Clearly, the context is often different when these things are written. But another key point is that books are much less edited than, say, newspaper columns. In the books world, the author is assumed to be responsible for their own words; the publisher does not see its own reputation at stake in the same way that a newspaper does. If the author wants to embarrass themselves, that's on them. Podcasts have even less of a filter.\n\nThe overconfidence and lack of self-awareness of some public figures should also not be underestimated. When Gary Hart, the frontrunner for the 1988 Democratic nomination, faced questions of extramarital affairs, he told a journalist: \"Follow me around. I don't care. I'm serious. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They'd be very bored.\" In fact, the Miami Herald was already tailing Hart, and soon caught him in the act. In its story, it quoted his own invitation against him.\n\nIn other cases, self-incrimination can be a deliberate strategy. Barack Obama admitted in his book Dreams From My Father that he had taken marijuana and cocaine. It fit his narrative of troubled youth. It defused the ability of his opponents to weaponise his drug use, once he was on the campaign trail.\n\nEven outright gaffes are a strategy if they are the price of being interesting. Better to say some interesting things -- and have a few of them backfire -- than be so bland that no one wants to listen to you. Trump and Joe Biden get away with gaffes, because they build up enough credit with their supporters through their other comments. The interesting things you say act like stabilisers that help you to endure turbulence. (Someone please inform Keir Starmer.)\n\nNoem was aiming for something similar. She has argued that the pet-killing anecdotes show her ability to take \"difficult, messy and ugly\" decisions. \"I can understand why some people are upset,\" she wrote last week, once her misjudgement became clear. \"Whether running the ranch or in politics, I have never passed on my responsibilities to anyone else to handle.\"\n\nShe picked the wrong issue for honesty. The \"shoot-a-dog\" lobby in US politics is not a big one: 62 per cent have a pet, and 97 per cent of those say the pet is part of their family.\n\nSouth Dakota is the state with the second-biggest proportion of licensed hunters -- nearly one in four people -- which may explain Noem's myopia. But the best hunters don't shoot themselves in the foot. Even Teddy Roosevelt, the most trigger-happy US president, knew that there are limits to which animals voters want you to shoot dead. Famously, on one hunting trip, he spared a captured bear, sparking the craze for \"Teddy bears\".\n\nEqually famously, Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns were deflated by his admission that, during a 12-hour family car journey, he'd put their pet dog in a carrier on the roof-rack. Romney, like Noem, probably thought his pet-keeping would reflect well on him. \"He'd built a windshield for the carrier, to make the ride more comfortable for the dog,\" said the initial report in the Boston Globe.\n\nIf Noem really wanted to show her ability to take difficult decisions, she could start by standing up to Trump. Still, her experience provides a useful lesson: when people tell you who they are, it's sometimes worth believing them.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times

She looks like every other MAGA woman to me, like they've all been infected with the Kimberly Guilfoyle Variant. They all look Botoxed to hell, with cheap extensions and the same glassy-eyed wine-mom demeanor. Noem has been trying to distinguish herself from the herd by telling psychotic stories about how many animals she's killed. In her new memoir, she revealed that she murdered her family dog, Cricket, by shooting the 14-month-old puppy and leaving Cricket's body in a gravel pit. She also killed a family goat on the same day, and left the goat's body in the same gravel pit. She's so disgusting, even Donald Trump wants nothing to do with her.\n\nWell, Noem's book tour is just ramping up, and she's been making the rounds of various network and cable-news shows. She's too stupid (??) to figure out a way to just stop talking about dog-murder, which means that huge chunks of her interviews in the past week have been about Noem killing animals. Speaking of, Noem said that the Biden family should have put down Commander, their German shepherd who has been falsely accused of gnawing on Secret Service agents.\n\nGov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, already under fire for killing her family's 14-month-old dog and boasting about it, on Sunday took aim at another family's pet: Commander, President Biden's bite-prone German shepherd.\n\nAppearing on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Ms. Noem, a Republican, suggested that Commander, who was banished from the White House last fall after bloodying a number of Secret Service agents, should also have been put down.\n\n\"Joe Biden's dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people,\" she told her interviewer, Margaret Brennan. \"So how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog?\"\n\nCommander was sent to an undisclosed location after the Secret Service recorded 24 biting episodes involving him between October 2022 and July 2023, about half of which required medical attention.\n\n[From The NY Times]\n\nThis might sound pedantic, but I hate when people defame dogs. Commander was not accused of \"attacking\" Secret Service agents, a word which suggests some kind of sustained or motivated assault by the dog. Commander was accused of \"biting\" agents (and only agents, not staffers), and there's every reason to believe that many of those biting incidents were nips from a puppy. The Bidens also sent Commander away six months ago - the Bidens love dogs and they have chosen to rehome their bitey dogs rather than, you know, euthanize innocent dogs because MAGA Secret Service agents lied about the dogs.

Kristi Noem to the forefront of conversations on the 2024 presidential ticket had certainly succeeded, if only in a poor light. Now, after an ongoing cycle of backlash and distancing for recounting putting down a 14-month-old dog via gravel pit firing squad, Trump was said to be \"privately trashing\" Noem.\n\nCiting \"four sources familiar with the matter, and another two people briefed on it,\" Rolling Stone reported that the president has regularly raised the account from the forthcoming book, \"No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward.\"\n\n\"In recent days, the former president has discussed or brought up Noem's pup-execution in closed-door meetings, as well as over the phone,\" detailed the outlet. \"Trump, sources recount, has pointedly asked questions regarding her decision to kill the dog, including specifically, 'Why would she do that?' and 'What is wrong with her?'\"\n\n\"He has expressed bewilderment that she would have ever admitted to doing this, willingly and in her own writing, and has argued it demonstrates she has a poor grasp of 'public relations.' In these various conversations over the past week,\" continued the Rolling Stone piece, \"the ex-president has also mentioned that voters generally don't like politicians who kill dogs, two of the people familiar with the matter add.\"\n\nAccording to the report, \"Trump is privately trashing\" Noem, \"a matter that appears to have closed the book on the idea of selecting her as a vice presidential nominee.\"\n\nAhead of the Rolling Stone report, the governor had appeared on Fox News with host Sean Hannity as part of an ongoing effort at damage control where she reiterated, \"It was a dog that was extremely dangerous. It had come to us from a family who had found her way too aggressive.\"\n\n\"We were her second chance. And she was -- the day she was put down was a day that she massacred livestock that were part of our neighbors. She attacked me. And it was a hard decision,\" continued Noem who contended she had included the anecdote to demonstrate her ability to face tough challenges.\n\nAs she was instead viewed through the same lens that many saw the bane of beagles, Dr. Anthony Fauci, or the fictional demon to Dalmatians, Cruella de Vil, sources expressed multiple reasons for coming forward with Trump's behind-the-scene commentary including hopes to see her \"permanently eliminated\" from consideration as vice president.\n\n\"Some separately said they were discussing this simply because Trump had been talking about Noem's puppy slaying so frequently that it was, in the words of one of the sources, 'getting kind of ridiculous' how 'disgusted' the former president sounded about this and how much he has been 'taunting' Noem behind her back,\" detailed Rolling Stone.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Perhaps it might have worked for a portion of the network's audience to use the magic words \"fake news.\" But when you start getting desperate and dish even more hair-brained reasons to defend that you were in the right for killing your dog, only to get fact-checked by a social media platform, it's obvious that instead of using a firehose to douse the flames you sparked, you stoked it further with gasoline.\n\nKristi Noem's new excuse for having shot Cricket was that the dog bit her and was a danger to her children. While she screams that the actual chain of events has been twisted by the media and peddled as fake news, she forgets that the details weren't conjured out of thin air -- they come directly from her memoir, the book she wrote. There is no mention in the memoir of the puppy ever being a danger to anyone, only that her young daughter innocently asked for Cricket's whereabouts after Noem had already executed her in a gravel pit.\n\nThe community notes did the favor of reminding everyone that Noem only changed her story upon being hit with the tsunami of backlash.\n\nThough Cricket's life was unfairly cut short, even in death, she is still ensuring the cruelty of her former owner is exposed, thus effectively shooting down Noem's chances at a potential position as Trump's running mate.

But Did She Meet Kim Jong-un?", "body": "\"I've met with many, many world leaders; I've traveled around the world. I should not have put that anecdote in the book, and at my request, they have removed it.\" -- South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, speaking about an anecdote in her book describing a meeting with Kim Jong-un\n\nCricket who? The news of Noem shooting her 14-month-old dog in a gravel pit is old hat. Instead, the book prerelease scandal catching more attention over the past few days has been Noem's anecdote about meeting with the North Korean dictator.\n\n\"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,\" Noem writes in her book about her time on the House Armed Services Committee. \"I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all). Dealing with foreign leaders takes resolve, preparation, and determination.\"\n\nThe issue with this anecdote is that the meeting doesn't appear to have happened. Kim never had an opportunity to estimate her one way or another. Those born yesterday will be shocked to learn that Noem's compendium of veepstakes-timed fluff was written by a ghostwriter, on whom Noem's spokesperson Ian Fury initially laid part of the blame.\n\n\"It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book No Going Back has two small errors ... This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor. Kim Jong-un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn't have been,\" Fury said.\n\nHe shouldn't have been included because ... the meeting did not happen? Yes/no? Strangely, Noem, across a series of interviews, refuses to answer this question. One axle of the bus has already passed over the ghostwriter; why not finish the job? She could just say that she and the ghostwriter got lost in [crosstalk], and that she was really referring to meeting the dictator Barack Obama, for example. Instead, she repeats versions of the pablum highlighted at the top.\n\nHere is the relevant vignette from CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday, in conversation with host Margaret Brennan.\n\nNoem posted on social media afterward that Brennan had interrupted her too much during their interview. She then went on another CBS morning news show on Monday, where this same repetition of \"many, many world leaders\" occurred a couple more times, for good measure.\n\nTo avoid answering the question straightforwardly, Noem is attempting to put on airs of that's classified or this is a national security matter without quite saying so, because that would be absurd. In her interview with Brennan, she does confirm that she visited the Korean Demilitarized Zone and that there are \"specifics I'm willing to share.\" On the other hand, she says, \"there's some specifics I'm not willing to share with you.\" She's spinning the \"error\" her spokesperson had conceded, then, into something different. It's not that she didn't meet Kim Jong-un at all, but that access to that information, one way or another, was always above the readers' pay grade.\n\nThis is silly!\n\nAs for other developments on the Kristi Noem Book front ...\n\n* Dogs: Kristi Noem wants Joe Biden's dog Commander dead, too. (Slate nervously tugs its collar.) \"What would I do if I was president on the first day in office in 2025?\" Noem reportedly writes in her book. \"Thanks for asking. I happen to have a list. The first thing I'd do is make sure Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds ('Commander, say hello to Cricket for me').\" Rooting for dogs to join each other in hell -- could this book be good?\n\n* Manny Macron: Noem says she canceled a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron last year after he said something \"very pro-Hamas.\" Macron's office says that they never had a direct meeting scheduled, but that there's a chance they were supposed to bump into each other somewhere. Or maybe the meeting was classified!\n\n* Nikki Haley: Another episode involves a conversation Noem had with Nikki Haley (BOO!) in 2021. Noem argues that Haley threatened her in a phone call. Noem recalls Haley telling her twice in that phone call that \"I've heard many good things about you. But when I do hear bad things, I will make sure that you know.\" I don't understand either what Haley was saying here, or why Noem was threatened by it. The main thing to keep in mind is that Haley became a MAGA villain during the production of this book, so it was important to throw in some sort of dig at her.\n\nThe upshot of all of this is that Kristi Noem is not going to be your next vice president -- and hasn't really been a contender since before this funny book saga, anyway.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_newell@slate.com", "name": "Jim Newell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ghostwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sketch comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commander (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korean Demilitarized Zone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slate (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/9fe58c0a-c393-4dc0-b3ed-aabff7d8fb5c.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536484", "eventUri": "eng-9536484", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 452724689, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 227, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 227}}}

Noem described the dog as having an \"aggressive personality,\" and said that she killed many of a neighbor's chickens after the governor failed to control her, according to an advance copy of the book obtained by The Guardian.\n\nNoem wrote that she hated Cricket after the incident, and \"realized I had to put her down.\" She then took the dog to a gravel pit and shot her to death, later doing the same to a \"nasty and mean\" male goat her family had owned.\n\nEven after receiving bipartisan condemnation for her actions, the conservative did not relent or show remorse -- instead, she suggested that President Joe Biden's dog, Commander, should meet the same fate.\n\n\"What would I do if I was president on the first day in office in 2025?\" she wrote in her book's final passage, recently revealed by The Guardian. \"The first thing I'd do is make sure Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds.

Noem described the dog as having an \"aggressive personality,\" and said that she killed many of a neighbor's chickens after the governor failed to control her, according to an advance copy of the book obtained by The Guardian.\n\nNoem wrote that she hated Cricket after the incident, and \"realized I had to put her down.\" She then took the dog to a gravel pit and shot her to death, later doing the same to a \"nasty and mean\" male goat her family had owned.\n\nEven after receiving bipartisan condemnation for her actions, the conservative did not relent or show remorse -- instead, she suggested that President Joe Biden's dog, Commander, should meet the same fate.\n\n\"What would I do if I was president on the first day in office in 2025?\" she wrote in her book's final passage, recently revealed by The Guardian. \"The first thing I'd do is make sure Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds.

Tuition is expensive, and they will soon need to choose a college - potentially without knowing how they're going to pay for it due to delays in the rollout of the new FAFSA. CBS 2's Sabrina Franza reports.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The last thing standing between Ashnaelle Bijoux and her college dream is the FAFSA form -- a financial aid application that's supposed to help students go to college, but is blocking her instead. She has tried to submit it over and over. Every time, it fails to go through.\n\n\"I feel overwhelmed and stressed out,\" said Bijoux, 19. She came close to tears the last time she tried the form. \"I feel like I'm being held back.\"\n\nNormally a time of celebration for high school seniors, this spring has been marred by the federal government's botched rollout of the new FAFSA application. By May 1, students usually know where they're headed to college in the fall. This year, most still haven't received financial aid offers. Three months before the start of fall classes, many don't know where they're going to college, or how they're going to pay for it.\n\n\"We're asking them to make probably one of the biggest financial decisions -- and decisions that will have the biggest implications on their lives going forward -- without all of the information,\" said Justin Draeger, president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.\n\nThe FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, went through a massive overhaul that was supposed to make it simpler and shorter. But a series of blunders by the Education Department made it harder than ever, delaying college decisions by months and raising fears that hundreds of thousands of students will forgo college entirely.\n\nAcross the United States, the number of students who have successfully submitted the FAFSA is down 29% from this time last year, and it's even worse at schools with more low-income students, according to the National College Attainment Network.\n\nThe group's CEO, Kim Cook, warned members of Congress this month about a potentially \"catastrophic\" drop in college enrollments that would make the decreases of the pandemic seem mild.\n\nFor Bijoux, of Norwich, Connecticut, the FAFSA problems threaten to undermine the promise of higher education.\n\nTo her, college is a chance to seize the opportunities that weren't available to her mother, who immigrated from Haiti to the U.S. as an adult. Bijoux hopes to become a therapist and set a positive example for her three younger brothers.\n\nIf her FAFSA goes through, she should be eligible for enough financial aid to help with the $ 13,000-a-year tuition at Southern Connecticut State University. If not, she might go to a local community college, but even that would require loans if she can't complete the FAFSA.\n\nEducation\n\nFAFSA WOES DELAY COLLEGE DECISION DAYS (3pmET)\n\n\"That's why it hurts, because it's like you work so hard to go somewhere and do something and make something of yourself,\" Bijoux said. \"I thought I would start at a four-year (college) and then work hard continuously, like I've been doing basically my whole life. But that's not the case.\"\n\nThe updated FAFSA form has one section filled out by students and another by their parents. But when Bijoux finishes her part, nothing shows up on her mother's online account. She keeps trying, but nothing seems to change.\n\nSimilar problems have been reported across the country, along with numerous other bugs that the Education Department has scrambled to fix. Families who call for customer service have faced long wait times or say the call center hung up on them.\n\nIt \"drains all the momentum\" from families working to send their children to college, especially those navigating the process for the first time, said Anne Zinn, a counselor at Norwich Free Academy, where Bijoux goes to school.\n\n\"I can only say so many times, 'Just be patient, just be patient,' before they throw their hands up and they're like, 'Why am I doing this? I'm just gonna go get a job,'\" she said.\n\nThe rollout has attracted bipartisan criticism in Congress, and it's being investigated at the request of Republicans. Richard Cordray, the federal student loan chief who oversaw the FAFSA update, has announced he will step down at the end of June.\n\nFor colleges, too, the delays pose a major threat.\n\nEnrollment decreases like those being projected now could put many small colleges out of business, or necessitate deep cuts in staff. Some colleges are pushing for emergency relief just to stay afloat, said Angel P\u00e9rez, CEO of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\n\"If they don't get checks from the federal government to basically get them through next year, they will not survive,\" P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe FAFSA has been the linchpin of student financial aid for decades. It's used to determine eligibility for the federal Pell grant, a scholarship for low-income students, and it's required to receive federal student loans. Colleges and states also use FAFSA to distribute their own scholarships.\n\nFAFSA had long been maligned for being tedious, difficult and intimidating to families without college experience. Congress passed legislation in 2020 meant to simplify the form. The Education Department was ordered to reduce the number of questions from more than 100 to about 40, and change the formula to expand aid to more students.\n\nProblems started piling up as soon as the new form went online in December, already months overdue.\n\nThe first applications were incorrectly processed using an outdated calculation for inflation. Later, a federal contractor miscalculated a different formula on more than 200,000 applications. Each mistake added to delays, leaving students waiting longer to hear anything about financial aid.\n\nEven more worrisome is a misstep that blocked students from finishing the form if they have a parent without a Social Security number. Advocates say the system locked out hundreds of thousands of students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents but whose parents are not.\n\nFederal education officials say they're addressing lingering bugs and making progress. More than 8 million student applications have now been processed and sent to colleges, the agency said, and new applications are being processed within three days.\n\nSaving for your kids' college education?

She has tried to submit it over and over. Every time, it fails to go through.\n\n\"I feel overwhelmed and stressed out,\" said Bijoux, 19. She came close to tears the last time she tried the form. \"I feel like I'm being held back.\"\n\nNormally a time of celebration for high school seniors, this spring has been marred by the federal government's botched rollout of the new FAFSA application. By May 1, students usually know where they're headed to college in the fall. This year, most still haven't received financial aid offers. Three months before the start of fall classes, many don't know where they're going to college, or how they're going to pay for it.\n\n\"We're asking them to make probably one of the biggest financial decisions -- and decisions that will have the biggest implications on their lives going forward -- without all of the information,\" said Justin Draeger, president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.\n\nThe FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, went through a massive overhaul that was supposed to make it simpler and shorter. But a series of blunders by the Education Department made it harder than ever, delaying college decisions by months and raising fears that hundreds of thousands of students will forgo college entirely.\n\nAcross the United States, the number of students who have successfully submitted the FAFSA is down 29% from this time last year, and it's even worse at schools with more low-income students, according to the National College Attainment Network.\n\nThe group's CEO, Kim Cook, warned members of Congress this month about a potentially \"catastrophic\" drop in college enrollments that would make the decreases of the pandemic seem mild.\n\nFor Bijoux, of Norwich, Connecticut, the FAFSA problems threaten to undermine the promise of higher education.\n\nTo her, college is a chance to seize the opportunities that weren't available to her mother, who immigrated from Haiti to the U.S. as an adult. Bijoux hopes to become a therapist and set a positive example for her three younger brothers.\n\nIf her FAFSA goes through, she should be eligible for enough financial aid to help with the $ 13,000-a-year tuition at Southern Connecticut State University. If not, she might go to a local community college, but even that would require loans if she can't complete the FAFSA.\n\nEducation FAFSA WOES DELAY COLLEGE DECISION DAYS (3pmET)\n\n\"That's why it hurts, because it's like you work so hard to go somewhere and do something and make something of yourself,\" Bijoux said. \"I thought I would start at a four-year (college) and then work hard continuously, like I've been doing basically my whole life. But that's not the case.\"\n\nThe updated FAFSA form has one section filled out by students and another by their parents. But when Bijoux finishes her part, nothing shows up on her mother's online account. She keeps trying, but nothing seems to change.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSimilar problems have been reported across the country, along with numerous other bugs that the Education Department has scrambled to fix. Families who call for customer service have faced long wait times or say the call center hung up on them.\n\nIt \"drains all the momentum\" from families working to send their children to college, especially those navigating the process for the first time, said Anne Zinn, a counselor at Norwich Free Academy, where Bijoux goes to school.\n\n\"I can only say so many times, 'Just be patient, just be patient,' before they throw their hands up and they're like, 'Why am I doing this? I'm just gonna go get a job,'\" she said.\n\nThe rollout has attracted bipartisan criticism in Congress, and it's being investigated at the request of Republicans. Richard Cordray, the federal student loan chief who oversaw the FAFSA update, has announced he will step down at the end of June.\n\nFor colleges, too, the delays pose a major threat.\n\nEnrollment decreases like those being projected now could put many small colleges out of business, or necessitate deep cuts in staff. Some colleges are pushing for emergency relief just to stay afloat, said Angel P\u00e9rez, CEO of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\n\"If they don't get checks from the federal government to basically get them through next year, they will not survive,\" P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe FAFSA has been the linchpin of student financial aid for decades. It's used to determine eligibility for the federal Pell grant, a scholarship for low-income students, and it's required to receive federal student loans. Colleges and states also use FAFSA to distribute their own scholarships.\n\nFAFSA had long been maligned for being tedious, difficult and intimidating to families without college experience. Congress passed legislation in 2020 meant to simplify the form. The Education Department was ordered to reduce the number of questions from more than 100 to about 40, and change the formula to expand aid to more students.\n\nProblems started piling up as soon as the new form went online in December, already months overdue.\n\nThe first applications were incorrectly processed using an outdated calculation for inflation. Later, a federal contractor miscalculated a different formula on more than 200,000 applications. Each mistake added to delays, leaving students waiting longer to hear anything about financial aid.\n\nEven more worrisome is a misstep that blocked students from finishing the form if they have a parent without a Social Security number.

She has tried to submit it over and over. Every time, it fails to go through.\n\n\"I feel overwhelmed and stressed out,\" said Bijoux, 19. She came close to tears the last time she tried the form. \"I feel like I'm being held back.\"\n\nNormally a time of celebration for high school seniors, this spring has been marred by the federal government's botched rollout of the new FAFSA application. By May 1, students usually know where they're headed to college in the fall. This year, most still haven't received financial aid off ers. Three months before the start of fall classes, many don't know where they're going to college, or how they're going to pay for it.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But a series of blunders by the Education Department made it harder than ever, delaying college decisions by months and raising fears that hundreds of thousands of students will forgo college entirely.\n\nAcross the United States, the number of students who have successfully submitted the FAFSA is down 29% from this time last year, and it's even worse at schools with more low-income students, according to the National College Attainment Network.\n\nThe group's CEO, Kim Cook, recently warned members of Congress about a potentially \"catastrophic\" drop in college enrollments that would make the decreases of the pandemic seem mild.\n\nFor Bijoux, of Norwich, Connecticut, the FAFSA problems threaten to undermine the promise of higher education.\n\nTo her, college is a chance to seize the opportunities that weren't available to her mother, who immigrated from Haiti to the U.S. as an adult. Bijoux hopes to become a therapist and set a positive example for her three younger brothers.\n\nIf her FAFSA goes through, she should be eligible for enough financial aid to help with the $13,000-a-year tuition at Southern Connecticut State University. If not, she might go to a local community college, but even that would require loans if she can't complete the FAFSA.\n\n\"That's why it hurts, because it's like you work so hard to go somewhere and do something and make something of yourself,\" Bijoux said. \"I thought I would start at a four-year (college) and then work hard continuously, like I've been doing basically my whole life. But that's not the case.\"\n\nThe updated FAFSA form has one section filled out by students and another by their parents. But when Bijoux finishes her part, nothing shows up on her mom's online account. She keeps trying, but nothing seems to change.\n\nSimilar problems have been reported across the country, along with numerous other bugs that the Education Department has scrambled to fix. Families who call for customer service have faced long wait times or say the call center hung up on them.\n\nIt \"drains all the momentum\" from families working to send their children to college, especially those navigating the process for the first time, said Anne Zinn, a counselor at Norwich Free Academy, where Bijoux goes to school.\n\n\"I can only say so many times, 'Just be patient, just be patient,' before they throw their hands up and they're like, 'Why am I doing this? I'm just gonna go get a job,'\" she said.\n\nThe rollout has attracted bipartisan criticism in Congress, and it's being investigated at the request of Republicans. Last week, Richard Cordray, the federal student loan chief who oversaw the FAFSA update, announced he's stepping down at the end of June.\n\nFor colleges, too, the delays pose a major threat.\n\nEnrollment decreases like those being projected now could put many small colleges out of business, or necessitate deep cuts in staff. Some colleges are pushing for emergency relief just to stay afloat, said Angel P\u00e9rez, CEO of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\n\"If they don't get checks from the federal government to basically get them through next year, they will not survive,\" P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe FAFSA has been the linchpin of student financial aid for decades. It's used to determine eligibility for the federal Pell grant, a scholarship for low-income students, and it's required to receive federal student loans. Colleges and states also use FAFSA to distribute their own scholarships.\n\nFAFSA had long been maligned for being tedious, difficult and intimidating to families without college experience. Congress passed legislation in 2020 meant to simplify the form. The Education Department was ordered to reduce the number of questions from more than 100 to about 40, and change the formula to expand aid to more students.\n\nProblems started piling up as soon as the new form went online in December, already months overdue. The first applications were incorrectly processed using an outdated calculation for inflation. Later, a federal contractor miscalculated a different formula on more than 200,000 applications. Each mistake added to delays, leaving students waiting longer to hear anything about financial aid.\n\nEven more worrisome is a misstep that blocked students from finishing the form if they have a parent without a Social Security number. Advocates say the system locked out hundreds of thousands of students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents but whose parents are not.\n\nThe Education Department on Tuesday said it's giving those parents a new way to enter their tax information manually. But as recently as this week, some students said they were still blocked from submitting the form.\n\nFederal education officials say they're addressing lingering bugs but making progress. More than 8 million student applications have now been processed and sent to colleges, the agency said, and new applications are being processed within three days.\n\nStill, the wait is far from over. It usually takes weeks for schools to prepare financial aid offers. Some colleges have extended decision deadlines to give students more time to weigh their options. But some stuck to May 1, forcing students to choose a college -- and make a non refundable payment to hold their spot -- without knowing all their scholarship options.\n\nIn West Virginia, Gov. Jim Justice on Tuesday declared a state of emergency that allows students to receive state scholarships without having their FAFSA processed by the federal government. West Virginia has the lowest number of college graduates in the nation, and the state's high school FAFSA completion rates are currently down nearly 40%, said Justice, a Republican.\n\n\"Really and truly, a lot of kids are sitting on the side lines ... wondering, 'Am I going to be able to go to college?' \" he said during a news briefing.\n\nIn Baltimore, Camryn Carter is waiting to find out if he'll get a full ride to the University of Maryland or face tens of thousands of dollars in student loans.\n\nA top student and captain of his baseball and wrestling teams, Carter sees college as a step up in life. He thinks back to the times in the grocery store line when he had to put items back on the shelf because his mom couldn't afford the bill. A college degree would give him the stability he didn't always have, the 18-year-old said.\n\nBut when he looks at tuition, it's intimidating. Along with Maryland, he's also considering McDaniel College, a private school in Maryland. If he enrolls there, he expects to borrow almost $30,000 a year.\n\n\"I try to make the best decisions now so I can have a good future,\" he said. \"I'm a little nervous that things won't work out. But I'm faithful.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use

She has tried to submit it over and over. Every time, it fails to go through.\n\n\"I feel overwhelmed and stressed out,\" said Bijoux, 19. She came close to tears the last time she tried the form. \"I feel like I'm being held back.\"\n\nNormally a time of celebration for high school seniors, this spring has been marred by the federal government's botched rollout of the new FAFSA application. By May 1, students usually know where they're headed to college in the fall. This year, most still haven't received financial aid offers. Three months before the start of fall classes, many don't know where they're going to college, or how they're going to pay for it.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But a series of blunders by the Education Department made it harder than ever, delaying college decisions by months and raising fears that hundreds of thousands of students will forgo college entirely.\n\nAcross the United States, the number of students who have successfully submitted the FAFSA is down 29% from this time last year, and it's even worse at schools with more low-income students, according to the National College Attainment Network.\n\nThe group's CEO, Kim Cook, recently warned members of Congress about a potentially \"catastrophic\" drop in college enrollments that would make the decreases of the pandemic seem mild.\n\nFor Bijoux, of Norwich, Connecticut, the FAFSA problems threaten to undermine the promise of higher education.\n\nTo her, college is a chance to seize the opportunities that weren't available to her mother, who immigrated from Haiti to the U.S. as an adult. Bijoux hopes to become a therapist and set a positive example for her three younger brothers.\n\nIf her FAFSA goes through, she should be eligible for enough financial aid to help with the $13,000-a-year tuition at Southern Connecticut State University. If not, she might go to a local community college, but even that would require loans if she can't complete the FAFSA.\n\n\"That's why it hurts, because it's like you work so hard to go somewhere and do something and make something of yourself,\" Bijoux said. \"I thought I would start at a four-year (college) and then work hard continuously, like I've been doing basically my whole life. But that's not the case.\"\n\nThe updated FAFSA form has one section filled out by students and another by their parents. But when Bijoux finishes her part, nothing shows up on her mom's online account. She keeps trying, but nothing seems to change.\n\nSimilar problems have been reported across the country, along with numerous other bugs that the Education Department has scrambled to fix. Families who call for customer service have faced long wait times or say the call center hung up on them.\n\nIt \"drains all the momentum\" from families working to send their children to college, especially those navigating the process for the first time, said Anne Zinn, a counselor at Norwich Free Academy, where Bijoux goes to school.\n\n\"I can only say so many times, 'Just be patient, just be patient,' before they throw their hands up and they're like, 'Why am I doing this? I'm just gonna go get a job,'\" she said.\n\nThe rollout has attracted bipartisan criticism in Congress, and it's being investigated at the request of Republicans. Last week, Richard Cordray, the federal student loan chief who oversaw the FAFSA update, announced he's stepping down at the end of June.\n\nFor colleges, too, the delays pose a major threat.\n\nEnrollment decreases like those being projected now could put many small colleges out of business, or necessitate deep cuts in staff. Some colleges are pushing for emergency relief just to stay afloat, said Angel P\u00e9rez, CEO of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\n\"If they don't get checks from the federal government to basically get them through next year, they will not survive,\" P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe FAFSA has been the linchpin of student financial aid for decades. It's used to determine eligibility for the federal Pell grant, a scholarship for low-income students, and it's required to receive federal student loans. Colleges and states also use FAFSA to distribute their own scholarships.\n\nFAFSA had long been maligned for being tedious, difficult and intimidating to families without college experience. Congress passed legislation in 2020 meant to simplify the form. The Education Department was ordered to reduce the number of questions from more than 100 to about 40, and change the formula to expand aid to more students.\n\nProblems started piling up as soon as the new form went online in December, already months overdue. The first applications were incorrectly processed using an outdated calculation for inflation. Later, a federal contractor miscalculated a different formula on more than 200,000 applications. Each mistake added to delays, leaving students waiting longer to hear anything about financial aid.\n\nEven more worrisome is a misstep that blocked students from finishing the form if they have a parent without a Social Security number. Advocates say the system locked out hundreds of thousands of students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents but whose parents are not.\n\nThe Education Department on Tuesday said it's giving those parents a new way to enter their tax information manually. But as recently as this week, some students said they were still blocked from submitting the form.\n\nFederal education officials say they're addressing lingering bugs but making progress. More than 8 million student applications have now been processed and sent to colleges, the agency said, and new applications are being processed within three days.\n\nStill, the wait is far from over. It usually takes weeks for schools to prepare financial aid offers. Some colleges have extended decision deadlines to give students more time to weigh their options. But some stuck to May 1, forcing students to choose a college -- and make a nonrefundable payment to hold their spot -- without knowing all their scholarship options.\n\nIn West Virginia, Gov. Jim Justice on Tuesday declared a state of emergency that allows students to receive state scholarships without having their FAFSA processed by the federal government. West Virginia has the lowest number of college graduates in the nation, and the state's high school FAFSA completion rates are currently down nearly 40%, said Justice, a Republican.\n\n\"Really and truly, a lot of kids are sitting on the sidelines ... wondering, 'Am I going to be able to go to college?' \" he said during a news briefing.\n\nIn Baltimore, Camryn Carter is waiting to find out if he'll get a full ride to the University of Maryland or face tens of thousands of dollars in student loans.\n\nA top student and captain of his baseball and wrestling teams, Carter sees college as a step up in life. He thinks back to the times in the grocery store line when he had to put items back on the shelf because his mom couldn't afford the bill. A college degree would give him the stability he didn't always have, the 18-year-old said.\n\nBut when he looks at tuition, it's intimidating. Along with Maryland, he's also considering McDaniel College, a private school in Maryland. If he enrolls there, he expects to borrow almost $30,000 a year.\n\n\"I try to make the best decisions now so I can have a good future,\" he said. \"I'm a little nervous that things won't work out. But I'm faithful.\"\n\nTags Politics Education The Economy University Government Departments And Ministries Finance School Systems Job Market Medicine Trade Telephony Sports Be the first to

Three months before the start of fall classes, many don't know where they're going to college, or how they're going to pay for it.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But a series of blunders by the Education Department made it harder than ever, delaying college decisions by months and raising fears that hundreds of thousands of students will forgo college entirely.\n\nAcross the United States, the number of students who have successfully submitted the FAFSA is down 29% from this time last year, and it's even worse at schools with more low-income students, according to the National College Attainment Network.\n\nThe group's CEO, Kim Cook, recently warned members of Congress about a potentially \"catastrophic\" drop in college enrollments that would make the decreases of the pandemic seem mild.\n\nFor Bijoux, of Norwich, Connecticut, the FAFSA problems threaten to undermine the promise of higher education.\n\nTo her, college is a chance to seize the opportunities that weren't available to her mother, who immigrated from Haiti to the U.S. as an adult. Bijoux hopes to become a therapist and set a positive example for her three younger brothers.\n\nIf her FAFSA goes through, she should be eligible for enough financial aid to help with the $13,000-a-year tuition at Southern Connecticut State University. If not, she might go to a local community college, but even that would require loans if she can't complete the FAFSA.\n\n\"That's why it hurts, because it's like you work so hard to go somewhere and do something and make something of yourself,\" Bijoux said. \"I thought I would start at a four-year (college) and then work hard continuously, like I've been doing basically my whole life. But that's not the case.\"\n\nThe updated FAFSA form has one section filled out by students and another by their parents. But when Bijoux finishes her part, nothing shows up on her mom's online account. She keeps trying, but nothing seems to change.\n\nSimilar problems have been reported across the country, along with numerous other bugs that the Education Department has scrambled to fix. Families who call for customer service have faced long wait times or say the call center hung up on them.\n\nIt \"drains all the momentum\" from families working to send their children to college, especially those navigating the process for the first time, said Anne Zinn, a counselor at Norwich Free Academy, where Bijoux goes to school.\n\n\"I can only say so many times, 'Just be patient, just be patient,' before they throw their hands up and they're like, 'Why am I doing this? I'm just gonna go get a job,'\" she said.\n\nThe rollout has attracted bipartisan criticism in Congress, and it's being investigated at the request of Republicans. Last week, Richard Cordray, the federal student loan chief who oversaw the FAFSA update, announced he's stepping down at the end of June.\n\nFor colleges, too, the delays pose a major threat.\n\nEnrollment decreases like those being projected now could put many small colleges out of business, or necessitate deep cuts in staff. Some colleges are pushing for emergency relief just to stay afloat, said Angel P\u00e9rez, CEO of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\n\"If they don't get checks from the federal government to basically get them through next year, they will not survive,\" P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe FAFSA has been the linchpin of student financial aid for decades. It's used to determine eligibility for the federal Pell grant, a scholarship for low-income students, and it's required to receive federal student loans. Colleges and states also use FAFSA to distribute their own scholarships.\n\nFAFSA had long been maligned for being tedious, difficult and intimidating to families without college experience. Congress passed legislation in 2020 meant to simplify the form. The Education Department was ordered to reduce the number of questions from more than 100 to about 40, and change the formula to expand aid to more students.\n\nProblems started piling up as soon as the new form went online in December, already months overdue.\n\nThe first applications were incorrectly processed using an outdated calculation for inflation. Later, a federal contractor miscalculated a different formula on more than 200,000 applications. Each mistake added to delays, leaving students waiting longer to hear anything about financial aid.\n\nEven more worrisome is a misstep that blocked students from finishing the form if they have a parent without a Social Security number. Advocates say the system locked out hundreds of thousands of students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents but whose parents are not.\n\nThe Education Department on Tuesday said it's giving those parents a new way to enter their tax information manually. But as recently as this week, some students said they were still blocked from submitting the form.\n\nFederal education officials say they're addressing lingering bugs but making progress. More than 8 million student applications have now been processed and sent to colleges, the agency said, and new applications are being processed within three days.\n\nStill, the wait is far from over. It usually takes weeks for schools to prepare financial aid offers. Some colleges have extended decision deadlines to give students more time to weigh their options. But some stuck to May 1, forcing students to choose a college -- and make a nonrefundable payment to hold their spot -- without knowing all their scholarship options.\n\nIn West Virginia, Gov. Jim Justice on Tuesday declared a state of emergency that allows students to receive state scholarships without having their FAFSA processed by the federal government. West Virginia has the lowest number of college graduates in the nation, and the state's high school FAFSA completion rates are currently down nearly 40%, said Justice, a Republican.\n\n\"Really and truly, a lot of kids are sitting on the sidelines ... wondering, 'Am I going to be able to go to college?' \" he said during a news briefing.\n\nIn Baltimore, Camryn Carter is waiting to find out if he'll get a full ride to the University of Maryland or face tens of thousands of dollars in student loans.\n\nA top student and captain of his baseball and wrestling teams, Carter sees college as a step up in life. He thinks back to the times in the grocery store line when he had to put items back on the shelf because his mom couldn't afford the bill. A college degree would give him the stability he didn't always have, the 18-year-old said.\n\nBut when he looks at tuition, it's intimidating. Along with Maryland, he's also considering McDaniel College, a private school in Maryland. If he enrolls there, he expects to borrow almost $30,000 a year.\n\n\"I try to make the best decisions now so I can have a good future,\" he said. \"I'm a little nervous that things won't work out. But I'm faithful.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use

She has tried to submit it over and over. Every time, it fails to go through.\n\n\"I feel overwhelmed and stressed out,\" said Bijoux, 19. She came close to tears the last time she tried the form. \"I feel like I'm being held back.\"\n\nNormally a time of celebration for high school seniors, this spring has been marred by the federal government's botched rollout of the new FAFSA application. By May 1, students usually know where they're headed to college in the fall. This year, most still haven't received financial aid offers. Three months before the start of fall classes, many don't know where they're going to college, or how they're going to pay for it.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Washington University faculty placed on leave, students 'houseless' after Gaza protest Cardinals games dropped by Comcast after Bally Sports deal falls through Busch Stadium needs renovations.

'It's my university's turn.'\n\n\"We're asking them to make probably one of the biggest financial decisions -- and decisions that will have the biggest implications on their lives going forward -- without all of the information,\" said Justin Draeger, president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.\n\nThe FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, went through a massive overhaul that was supposed to make it simpler and shorter. But a series of blunders by the Education Department made it harder than ever, delaying college decisions by months and raising fears that hundreds of thousands of students will forgo college entirely.\n\nAcross the United States, the number of students who have successfully submitted the FAFSA is down 29% from this time last year, and it's even worse at schools with more low-income students, according to the National College Attainment Network.\n\nThe group's CEO, Kim Cook, warned members of Congress this month about a potentially \"catastrophic\" drop in college enrollments that would make the decreases of the pandemic seem mild.\n\nFor Bijoux, of Norwich, Connecticut, the FAFSA problems threaten to undermine the promise of higher education.\n\nTo her, college is a chance to seize the opportunities that weren't available to her mother, who immigrated from Haiti to the U.S. as an adult. Bijoux hopes to become a therapist and set a positive example for her three younger brothers.\n\nIf her FAFSA goes through, she should be eligible for enough financial aid to help with the $ 13,000-a-year tuition at Southern Connecticut State University. If not, she might go to a local community college, but even that would require loans if she can't complete the FAFSA.\n\n\"That's why it hurts, because it's like you work so hard to go somewhere and do something and make something of yourself,\" Bijoux said. \"I thought I would start at a four-year (college) and then work hard continuously, like I've been doing basically my whole life. But that's not the case.\"\n\nThe updated FAFSA form has one section filled out by students and another by their parents. But when Bijoux finishes her part, nothing shows up on her mother's online account. She keeps trying, but nothing seems to change.\n\nSimilar problems have been reported across the country, along with numerous other bugs that the Education Department has scrambled to fix. Families who call for customer service have faced long wait times or say the call center hung up on them.\n\nIt \"drains all the momentum\" from families working to send their children to college, especially those navigating the process for the first time, said Anne Zinn, a counselor at Norwich Free Academy, where Bijoux goes to school.\n\n\"I can only say so many times, 'Just be patient, just be patient,' before they throw their hands up and they're like, 'Why am I doing this? I'm just gonna go get a job,'\" she said.\n\nThe rollout has attracted bipartisan criticism in Congress, and it's being investigated at the request of Republicans. Richard Cordray, the federal student loan chief who oversaw the FAFSA update, has announced he will step down at the end of June.\n\nFor colleges, too, the delays pose a major threat.\n\nEnrollment decreases like those being projected now could put many small colleges out of business, or necessitate deep cuts in staff. Some colleges are pushing for emergency relief just to stay afloat, said Angel P\u00e9rez, CEO of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\n\"If they don't get checks from the federal government to basically get them through next year, they will not survive,\" P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe FAFSA has been the linchpin of student financial aid for decades. It's used to determine eligibility for the federal Pell grant, a scholarship for low-income students, and it's required to receive federal student loans. Colleges and states also use FAFSA to distribute their own scholarships.\n\nFAFSA had long been maligned for being tedious, difficult and intimidating to families without college experience. Congress passed legislation in 2020 meant to simplify the form. The Education Department was ordered to reduce the number of questions from more than 100 to about 40, and change the formula to expand aid to more students.\n\nProblems started piling up as soon as the new form went online in December, already months overdue.\n\nThe first applications were incorrectly processed using an outdated calculation for inflation. Later, a federal contractor miscalculated a different formula on more than 200,000 applications. Each mistake added to delays, leaving students waiting longer to hear anything about financial aid.\n\nEven more worrisome is a misstep that blocked students from finishing the form if they have a parent without a Social Security number. Advocates say the system locked out hundreds of thousands of students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents but whose parents are not.\n\nFederal education officials say they're addressing lingering bugs and making progress. More than 8 million student applications have now been processed and sent to colleges, the agency said, and new applications are being processed within three days.\n\n0 Comments Tags Dcc Wire

She came close to tears the last time she tried the form. \"I feel like I'm being held back.\"\n\nNormally a time of celebration for high school seniors, this spring has been marred by the federal government's botched rollout of the new FAFSA application. By May 1, students usually know where they're headed to college in the fall. This year, most still haven't received financial aid offers.

But a series of blunders by the Education Department made it harder than ever, delaying college decisions by months and raising fears that hundreds of thousands of students will forgo college entirely.\n\nAcross the United States, the number of students who have successfully submitted the FAFSA is down 29% from this time last year, and it's even worse at schools with more low-income students, according to the National College Attainment Network.\n\nThe group's CEO, Kim Cook, warned members of Congress this month about a potentially \"catastrophic\" drop in college enrollments that would make the decreases of the pandemic seem mild.\n\nFor Bijoux, of Norwich, Connecticut, the FAFSA problems threaten to undermine the promise of higher education.\n\nTo her, college is a chance to seize the opportunities that weren't available to her mother, who immigrated from Haiti to the U.S. as an adult. Bijoux hopes to become a therapist and set a positive example for her three younger brothers.\n\nIf her FAFSA goes through, she should be eligible for enough financial aid to help with the $ 13,000-a-year tuition at Southern Connecticut State University. If not, she might go to a local community college, but even that would require loans if she can't complete the FAFSA.\n\nEducation FAFSA WOES DELAY COLLEGE DECISION DAYS (3pmET)\n\n\"That's why it hurts, because it's like you work so hard to go somewhere and do something and make something of yourself,\" Bijoux said. \"I thought I would start at a four-year (college) and then work hard continuously, like I've been doing basically my whole life. But that's not the case.\"\n\nThe updated FAFSA form has one section filled out by students and another by their parents. But when Bijoux finishes her part, nothing shows up on her mother's online account. She keeps trying, but nothing seems to change.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSimilar problems have been reported across the country, along with numerous other bugs that the Education Department has scrambled to fix. Families who call for customer service have faced long wait times or say the call center hung up on them.\n\nIt \"drains all the momentum\" from families working to send their children to college, especially those navigating the process for the first time, said Anne Zinn, a counselor at Norwich Free Academy, where Bijoux goes to school.\n\n\"I can only say so many times, 'Just be patient, just be patient,' before they throw their hands up and they're like, 'Why am I doing this? I'm just gonna go get a job,'\" she said.\n\nThe rollout has attracted bipartisan criticism in Congress, and it's being investigated at the request of Republicans. Richard Cordray, the federal student loan chief who oversaw the FAFSA update, has announced he will step down at the end of June.\n\nFor colleges, too, the delays pose a major threat.\n\nEnrollment decreases like those being projected now could put many small colleges out of business, or necessitate deep cuts in staff. Some colleges are pushing for emergency relief just to stay afloat, said Angel P\u00e9rez, CEO of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\n\"If they don't get checks from the federal government to basically get them through next year, they will not survive,\" P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe FAFSA has been the linchpin of student financial aid for decades. It's used to determine eligibility for the federal Pell grant, a scholarship for low-income students, and it's required to receive federal student loans. Colleges and states also use FAFSA to distribute their own scholarships.\n\nFAFSA had long been maligned for being tedious, difficult and intimidating to families without college experience. Congress passed legislation in 2020 meant to simplify the form. The Education Department was ordered to reduce the number of questions from more than 100 to about 40, and change the formula to expand aid to more students.\n\nProblems started piling up as soon as the new form went online in December, already months overdue.\n\nThe first applications were incorrectly processed using an outdated calculation for inflation. Later, a federal contractor miscalculated a different formula on more than 200,000 applications. Each mistake added to delays, leaving students waiting longer to hear anything about financial aid.\n\nEven more worrisome is a misstep that blocked students from finishing the form if they have a parent without a Social Security number. Advocates say the system locked out hundreds of thousands of students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents but whose parents are not.\n\nFederal education officials say they're addressing lingering bugs and making progress. More than 8 million student applications have now been processed and sent to colleges, the agency said, and new applications are being processed within three days.\n\nSaving for your kids' college education?

She has tried to submit it over and over. Every time, it fails to go through.\n\n\"I feel overwhelmed and stressed out,\" said Bijoux, 19. She came close to tears the last time she tried the form. \"I feel like I'm being held back.\"\n\nNormally a time of celebration for high school seniors, this spring has been marred by the federal government's botched rollout of the new FAFSA application. By May 1, students usually know where they're headed to college in the fall. This year, most still haven't received financial aid offers. Three months before the start of fall classes, many don't know where they're going to college, or how they're going to pay for it.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But a series of blunders by the Education Department made it harder than ever, delaying college decisions by months and raising fears that hundreds of thousands of students will forgo college entirely.\n\nAcross the United States, the number of students who have successfully submitted the FAFSA is down 29% from this time last year, and it's even worse at schools with more low-income students, according to the National College Attainment Network.\n\nThe group's CEO, Kim Cook, recently warned members of Congress about a potentially \"catastrophic\" drop in college enrollments that would make the decreases of the pandemic seem mild.\n\nFor Bijoux, of Norwich, Connecticut, the FAFSA problems threaten to undermine the promise of higher education.\n\nTo her, college is a chance to seize the opportunities that weren't available to her mother, who immigrated from Haiti to the U.S. as an adult. Bijoux hopes to become a therapist and set a positive example for her three younger brothers.\n\nIf her FAFSA goes through, she should be eligible for enough financial aid to help with the $13,000-a-year tuition at Southern Connecticut State University. If not, she might go to a local community college, but even that would require loans if she can't complete the FAFSA.\n\n\"That's why it hurts, because it's like you work so hard to go somewhere and do something and make something of yourself,\" Bijoux said. \"I thought I would start at a four-year (college) and then work hard continuously, like I've been doing basically my whole life. But that's not the case.\"\n\nThe updated FAFSA form has one section filled out by students and another by their parents. But when Bijoux finishes her part, nothing shows up on her mom's online account. She keeps trying, but nothing seems to change.\n\nSimilar problems have been reported across the country, along with numerous other bugs that the Education Department has scrambled to fix. Families who call for customer service have faced long wait times or say the call center hung up on them.\n\nIt \"drains all the momentum\" from families working to send their children to college, especially those navigating the process for the first time, said Anne Zinn, a counselor at Norwich Free Academy, where Bijoux goes to school.\n\n\"I can only say so many times, 'Just be patient, just be patient,' before they throw their hands up and they're like, 'Why am I doing this? I'm just gonna go get a job,'\" she said.\n\nThe rollout has attracted bipartisan criticism in Congress, and it's being investigated at the request of Republicans. Last week, Richard Cordray, the federal student loan chief who oversaw the FAFSA update, announced he's stepping down at the end of June.\n\nFor colleges, too, the delays pose a major threat.\n\nEnrollment decreases like those being projected now could put many small colleges out of business, or necessitate deep cuts in staff. Some colleges are pushing for emergency relief just to stay afloat, said Angel P\u00e9rez, CEO of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\n\"If they don't get checks from the federal government to basically get them through next year, they will not survive,\" P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe FAFSA has been the linchpin of student financial aid for decades. It's used to determine eligibility for the federal Pell grant, a scholarship for low-income students, and it's required to receive federal student loans. Colleges and states also use FAFSA to distribute their own scholarships.\n\nFAFSA had long been maligned for being tedious, difficult and intimidating to families without college experience. Congress passed legislation in 2020 meant to simplify the form. The Education Department was ordered to reduce the number of questions from more than 100 to about 40, and change the formula to expand aid to more students.\n\nProblems started piling up as soon as the new form went online in December, already months overdue.\n\nThe first applications were incorrectly processed using an outdated calculation for inflation. Later, a federal contractor miscalculated a different formula on more than 200,000 applications. Each mistake added to delays, leaving students waiting longer to hear anything about financial aid.\n\nEven more worrisome is a misstep that blocked students from finishing the form if they have a parent without a Social Security number. Advocates say the system locked out hundreds of thousands of students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents but whose parents are not.\n\nThe Education Department on Tuesday said it's giving those parents a new way to enter their tax information manually. But as recently as this week, some students said they were still blocked from submitting the form.\n\nFederal education officials say they're addressing lingering bugs but making progress. More than 8 million student applications have now been processed and sent to colleges, the agency said, and new applications are being processed within three days.\n\nStill, the wait is far from over. It usually takes weeks for schools to prepare financial aid offers. Some colleges have extended decision deadlines to give students more time to weigh their options. But some stuck to May 1, forcing students to choose a college -- and make a nonrefundable payment to hold their spot -- without knowing all their scholarship options.\n\nIn West Virginia, Gov. Jim Justice on Tuesday declared a state of emergency that allows students to receive state scholarships without having their FAFSA processed by the federal government. West Virginia has the lowest number of college graduates in the nation, and the state's high school FAFSA completion rates are currently down nearly 40%, said Justice, a Republican.\n\n\"Really and truly, a lot of kids are sitting on the sidelines ... wondering, 'Am I going to be able to go to college?' \" he said during a news briefing.\n\nIn Baltimore, Camryn Carter is waiting to find out if he'll get a full ride to the University of Maryland or face tens of thousands of dollars in student loans.\n\nA top student and captain of his baseball and wrestling teams, Carter sees college as a step up in life. He thinks back to the times in the grocery store line when he had to put items back on the shelf because his mom couldn't afford the bill. A college degree would give him the stability he didn't always have, the 18-year-old said.\n\nBut when he looks at tuition, it's intimidating. Along with Maryland, he's also considering McDaniel College, a private school in Maryland. If he enrolls there, he expects to borrow almost $30,000 a year.\n\n\"I try to make the best decisions now so I can have a good future,\" he said. \"I'm a little nervous that things won't work out. But I'm faithful.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Politics Education The Economy University Government Departments And Ministries Finance School Systems Job Market Medicine Trade

By May 1, students usually know where they're headed to college in the fall. This year, most still haven't received financial aid offers.

But a series of blunders by the Education Department made it harder than ever, delaying college decisions by months and raising fears that hundreds of thousands of students will forgo college entirely.\n\nAcross the United States, the number of students who have successfully submitted the FAFSA is down 29% from this time last year, and it's even worse at schools with more low-income students, according to the National College Attainment Network.\n\nThe group's CEO, Kim Cook, warned members of Congress this month about a potentially \"catastrophic\" drop in college enrollments that would make the decreases of the pandemic seem mild.\n\nFor Bijoux, of Norwich, Connecticut, the FAFSA problems threaten to undermine the promise of higher education.\n\nTo her, college is a chance to seize the opportunities that weren't available to her mother, who immigrated from Haiti to the U.S. as an adult. Bijoux hopes to become a therapist and set a positive example for her three younger brothers.\n\nIf her FAFSA goes through, she should be eligible for enough financial aid to help with the $ 13,000-a-year tuition at Southern Connecticut State University. If not, she might go to a local community college, but even that would require loans if she can't complete the FAFSA.\n\nEducation FAFSA WOES DELAY COLLEGE DECISION DAYS (3pmET)\n\n\"That's why it hurts, because it's like you work so hard to go somewhere and do something and make something of yourself,\" Bijoux said. \"I thought I would start at a four-year (college) and then work hard continuously, like I've been doing basically my whole life. But that's not the case.\"\n\nThe updated FAFSA form has one section filled out by students and another by their parents.

Families who call for customer service have faced long wait times or say the call center hung up on them.\n\nIt \"drains all the momentum\" from families working to send their children to college, especially those navigating the process for the first time, said Anne Zinn, a counselor at Norwich Free Academy, where Bijoux goes to school.\n\n\"I can only say so many times, 'Just be patient, just be patient,' before they throw their hands up and they're like, 'Why am I doing this? I'm just gonna go get a job,'\" she said.\n\nThe rollout has attracted bipartisan criticism in Congress, and it's being investigated at the request of Republicans. Richard Cordray, the federal student loan chief who oversaw the FAFSA update, has announced he will step down at the end of June.\n\nFor colleges, too, the delays pose a major threat.\n\nEnrollment decreases like those being projected now could put many small colleges out of business, or necessitate deep cuts in staff. Some colleges are pushing for emergency relief just to stay afloat, said Angel P\u00e9rez, CEO of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\n\"If they don't get checks from the federal government to basically get them through next year, they will not survive,\" P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe FAFSA has been the linchpin of student financial aid for decades. It's used to determine eligibility for the federal Pell grant, a scholarship for low-income students, and it's required to receive federal student loans. Colleges and states also use FAFSA to distribute their own scholarships.\n\nFAFSA had long been maligned for being tedious, difficult and intimidating to families without college experience. Congress passed legislation in 2020 meant to simplify the form. The Education Department was ordered to reduce the number of questions from more than 100 to about 40, and change the formula to expand aid to more students.\n\nProblems started piling up as soon as the new form went online in December, already months overdue.\n\nThe first applications were incorrectly processed using an outdated calculation for inflation. Later, a federal contractor miscalculated a different formula on more than 200,000 applications. Each mistake added to delays, leaving students waiting longer to hear anything about financial aid.\n\nEven more worrisome is a misstep that blocked students from finishing the form if they have a parent without a Social Security number. Advocates say the system locked out hundreds of thousands of students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents but whose parents are not.\n\nFederal education officials say they're addressing lingering bugs and making progress. More than 8 million student applications have now been processed and sent to colleges, the agency said, and new applications are being processed within three days.\n\nSaving for your kids' college education?

She has tried to submit it over and over. Every time, it fails to go through.\n\n\"I feel overwhelmed and stressed out,\" said Bijoux, 19. She came close to tears the last time she tried the form. \"I feel like I'm being held back.\"\n\nNormally a time of celebration for high school seniors, this spring has been marred by the federal government's botched rollout of the new FAFSA application. By May 1, students usually know where they're headed to college in the fall. This year, most still haven't received financial aid offers. Three months before the start of fall classes, many don't know where they're going to college, or how they're going to pay for it.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But a series of blunders by the Education Department made it harder than ever, delaying college decisions by months and raising fears that hundreds of thousands of students will forgo college entirely.\n\nAcross the United States, the number of students who have successfully submitted the FAFSA is down 29% from this time last year, and it's even worse at schools with more low-income students, according to the National College Attainment Network.\n\nThe group's CEO, Kim Cook, recently warned members of Congress about a potentially \"catastrophic\" drop in college enrollments that would make the decreases of the pandemic seem mild.\n\nFor Bijoux, of Norwich, Connecticut, the FAFSA problems threaten to undermine the promise of higher education.\n\nTo her, college is a chance to seize the opportunities that weren't available to her mother, who immigrated from Haiti to the U.S. as an adult. Bijoux hopes to become a therapist and set a positive example for her three younger brothers.\n\nIf her FAFSA goes through, she should be eligible for enough financial aid to help with the $13,000-a-year tuition at Southern Connecticut State University. If not, she might go to a local community college, but even that would require loans if she can't complete the FAFSA.\n\n\"That's why it hurts, because it's like you work so hard to go somewhere and do something and make something of yourself,\" Bijoux said. \"I thought I would start at a four-year (college) and then work hard continuously, like I've been doing basically my whole life. But that's not the case.\"\n\nThe updated FAFSA form has one section filled out by students and another by their parents. But when Bijoux finishes her part, nothing shows up on her mom's online account. She keeps trying, but nothing seems to change.\n\nSimilar problems have been reported across the country, along with numerous other bugs that the Education Department has scrambled to fix. Families who call for customer service have faced long wait times or say the call center hung up on them.\n\nIt \"drains all the momentum\" from families working to send their children to college, especially those navigating the process for the first time, said Anne Zinn, a counselor at Norwich Free Academy, where Bijoux goes to school.\n\n\"I can only say so many times, 'Just be patient, just be patient,' before they throw their hands up and they're like, 'Why am I doing this? I'm just gonna go get a job,'\" she said.\n\nThe rollout has attracted bipartisan criticism in Congress, and it's being investigated at the request of Republicans. Last week, Richard Cordray, the federal student loan chief who oversaw the FAFSA update, announced he's stepping down at the end of June.\n\nFor colleges, too, the delays pose a major threat.\n\nEnrollment decreases like those being projected now could put many small colleges out of business, or necessitate deep cuts in staff. Some colleges are pushing for emergency relief just to stay afloat, said Angel P\u00e9rez, CEO of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\n\"If they don't get checks from the federal government to basically get them through next year, they will not survive,\" P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe FAFSA has been the linchpin of student financial aid for decades. It's used to determine eligibility for the federal Pell grant, a scholarship for low-income students, and it's required to receive federal student loans. Colleges and states also use FAFSA to distribute their own scholarships.\n\nFAFSA had long been maligned for being tedious, difficult and intimidating to families without college experience. Congress passed legislation in 2020 meant to simplify the form. The Education Department was ordered to reduce the number of questions from more than 100 to about 40, and change the formula to expand aid to more students.\n\nProblems started piling up as soon as the new form went online in December, already months overdue.\n\nThe first applications were incorrectly processed using an outdated calculation for inflation. Later, a federal contractor miscalculated a different formula on more than 200,000 applications. Each mistake added to delays, leaving students waiting longer to hear anything about financial aid.\n\nEven more worrisome is a misstep that blocked students from finishing the form if they have a parent without a Social Security number. Advocates say the system locked out hundreds of thousands of students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents but whose parents are not.\n\nThe Education Department on Tuesday said it's giving those parents a new way to enter their tax information manually. But as recently as this week, some students said they were still blocked from submitting the form.\n\nFederal education officials say they're addressing lingering bugs but making progress. More than 8 million student applications have now been processed and sent to colleges, the agency said, and new applications are being processed within three days.\n\nStill, the wait is far from over. It usually takes weeks for schools to prepare financial aid offers. Some colleges have extended decision deadlines to give students more time to weigh their options. But some stuck to May 1, forcing students to choose a college -- and make a nonrefundable payment to hold their spot -- without knowing all their scholarship options.\n\nIn West Virginia, Gov. Jim Justice on Tuesday declared a state of emergency that allows students to receive state scholarships without having their FAFSA processed by the federal government. West Virginia has the lowest number of college graduates in the nation, and the state's high school FAFSA completion rates are currently down nearly 40%, said Justice, a Republican.\n\n\"Really and truly, a lot of kids are sitting on the sidelines ... wondering, 'Am I going to be able to go to college?' \" he said during a news briefing.\n\nIn Baltimore, Camryn Carter is waiting to find out if he'll get a full ride to the University of Maryland or face tens of thousands of dollars in student loans.\n\nA top student and captain of his baseball and wrestling teams, Carter sees college as a step up in life. He thinks back to the times in the grocery store line when he had to put items back on the shelf because his mom couldn't afford the bill. A college degree would give him the stability he didn't always have, the 18-year-old said.\n\nBut when he looks at tuition, it's intimidating. Along with Maryland, he's also considering McDaniel College, a private school in Maryland. If he enrolls there, he expects to borrow almost $30,000 a year.\n\n\"I try to make the best decisions now so I can have a good future,\" he said. \"I'm a little nervous that things won't work out. But I'm faithful.\"\n\nTags Politics Education The Economy University Government Departments And Ministries Finance School Systems Job Market Medicine Trade Telephony Sports Be the first to

She has tried to submit it over and over. Every time, it fails to go through.\n\n\"I feel overwhelmed and stressed out,\" said Bijoux, 19. She came close to tears the last time she tried the form. \"I feel like I'm being held back.\"\n\nNormally a time of celebration for high school seniors, this spring has been marred by the federal government's botched rollout of the new FAFSA application. By May 1, students usually know where they're headed to college in the fall. This year, most still haven't received financial aid offers. Three months before the start of fall classes, many don't know where they're going to college, or how they're going to pay for it.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But a series of blunders by the Education Department made it harder than ever, delaying college decisions by months and raising fears that hundreds of thousands of students will forgo college entirely.\n\nAcross the United States, the number of students who have successfully submitted the FAFSA is down 29% from this time last year, and it's even worse at schools with more low-income students, according to the National College Attainment Network.\n\nThe group's CEO, Kim Cook, warned members of Congress this month about a potentially \"catastrophic\" drop in college enrollments that would make the decreases of the pandemic seem mild.\n\nFor Bijoux, of Norwich, Connecticut, the FAFSA problems threaten to undermine the promise of higher education.\n\nTo her, college is a chance to seize the opportunities that weren't available to her mother, who immigrated from Haiti to the U.S. as an adult. Bijoux hopes to become a therapist and set a positive example for her three younger brothers.\n\nIf her FAFSA goes through, she should be eligible for enough financial aid to help with the $ 13,000-a-year tuition at Southern Connecticut State University. If not, she might go to a local community college, but even that would require loans if she can't complete the FAFSA.\n\nCnn FAFSA WOES DELAY COLLEGE DECISION DAYS (3pmET)\n\n\"That's why it hurts, because it's like you work so hard to go somewhere and do something and make something of yourself,\" Bijoux said. \"I thought I would start at a four-year (college) and then work hard continuously, like I've been doing basically my whole life. But that's not the case.\"\n\nThe updated FAFSA form has one section filled out by students and another by their parents. But when Bijoux finishes her part, nothing shows up on her mother's online account. She keeps trying, but nothing seems to change.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSimilar problems have been reported across the country, along with numerous other bugs that the Education Department has scrambled to fix. Families who call for customer service have faced long wait times or say the call center hung up on them.\n\nIt \"drains all the momentum\" from families working to send their children to college, especially those navigating the process for the first time, said Anne Zinn, a counselor at Norwich Free Academy, where Bijoux goes to school.\n\n\"I can only say so many times, 'Just be patient, just be patient,' before they throw their hands up and they're like, 'Why am I doing this? I'm just gonna go get a job,'\" she said.\n\nThe rollout has attracted bipartisan criticism in Congress, and it's being investigated at the request of Republicans. Richard Cordray, the federal student loan chief who oversaw the FAFSA update, has announced he will step down at the end of June.\n\nFor colleges, too, the delays pose a major threat.\n\nEnrollment decreases like those being projected now could put many small colleges out of business, or necessitate deep cuts in staff. Some colleges are pushing for emergency relief just to stay afloat, said Angel P\u00e9rez, CEO of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\n\"If they don't get checks from the federal government to basically get them through next year, they will not survive,\" P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe FAFSA has been the linchpin of student financial aid for decades.

But a series of blunders by the Education Department made it harder than ever, delaying college decisions by months and raising fears that hundreds of thousands of students will forgo college entirely.\n\nAcross the United States, the number of students who have successfully submitted the FAFSA is down 29% from this time last year, and it's even worse at schools with more low-income students, according to the National College Attainment Network.\n\nThe group's CEO, Kim Cook, recently warned members of Congress about a potentially \"catastrophic\" drop in college enrollments that would make the decreases of the pandemic seem mild.\n\nFor Bijoux, of Norwich, Connecticut, the FAFSA problems threaten to undermine the promise of higher education.\n\nTo her, college is a chance to seize the opportunities that weren't available to her mother, who immigrated from Haiti to the U.S. as an adult. Bijoux hopes to become a therapist and set a positive example for her three younger brothers.\n\nIf her FAFSA goes through, she should be eligible for enough financial aid to help with the $13,000-a-year tuition at Southern Connecticut State University. If not, she might go to a local community college, but even that would require loans if she can't complete the FAFSA.\n\n\"That's why it hurts, because it's like you work so hard to go somewhere and do something and make something of yourself,\" Bijoux said. \"I thought I would start at a four-year (college) and then work hard continuously, like I've been doing basically my whole life. But that's not the case.\"\n\nThe updated FAFSA form has one section filled out by students and another by their parents. But when Bijoux finishes her part, nothing shows up on her mom's online account. She keeps trying, but nothing seems to change.\n\nSimilar problems have been reported across the country, along with numerous other bugs that the Education Department has scrambled to fix. Families who call for customer service have faced long wait times or say the call center hung up on them.\n\nIt \"drains all the momentum\" from families working to send their children to college, especially those navigating the process for the first time, said Anne Zinn, a counselor at Norwich Free Academy, where Bijoux goes to school.\n\n\"I can only say so many times, 'Just be patient, just be patient,' before they throw their hands up and they're like, 'Why am I doing this? I'm just gonna go get a job,'\" she said.\n\nThe rollout has attracted bipartisan criticism in Congress, and it's being investigated at the request of Republicans. Last week, Richard Cordray, the federal student loan chief who oversaw the FAFSA update, announced he's stepping down at the end of June.\n\nFor colleges, too, the delays pose a major threat.\n\nEnrollment decreases like those being projected now could put many small colleges out of business, or necessitate deep cuts in staff. Some colleges are pushing for emergency relief just to stay afloat, said Angel P\u00e9rez, CEO of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\n\"If they don't get checks from the federal government to basically get them through next year, they will not survive,\" P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe FAFSA has been the linchpin of student financial aid for decades. It's used to determine eligibility for the federal Pell grant, a scholarship for low-income students, and it's required to receive federal student loans. Colleges and states also use FAFSA to distribute their own scholarships.\n\nFAFSA had long been maligned for being tedious, difficult and intimidating to families without college experience. Congress passed legislation in 2020 meant to simplify the form. The Education Department was ordered to reduce the number of questions from more than 100 to about 40, and change the formula to expand aid to more students.\n\nProblems started piling up as soon as the new form went online in December, already months overdue. The first applications were incorrectly processed using an outdated calculation for inflation. Later, a federal contractor miscalculated a different formula on more than 200,000 applications. Each mistake added to delays, leaving students waiting longer to hear anything about financial aid.\n\nEven more worrisome is a misstep that blocked students from finishing the form if they have a parent without a Social Security number. Advocates say the system locked out hundreds of thousands of students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents but whose parents are not.\n\nThe Education Department on Tuesday said it's giving those parents a new way to enter their tax information manually. But as recently as this week, some students said they were still blocked from submitting the form.\n\nFederal education officials say they're addressing lingering bugs but making progress. More than 8 million student applications have now been processed and sent to colleges, the agency said, and new applications are being processed within three days.\n\nStill, the wait is far from over. It usually takes weeks for schools to prepare financial aid offers. Some colleges have extended decision deadlines to give students more time to weigh their options. But some stuck to May 1, forcing students to choose a college -- and make a nonrefundable payment to hold their spot -- without knowing all their scholarship options.\n\nIn West Virginia, Gov. Jim Justice on Tuesday declared a state of emergency that allows students to receive state scholarships without having their FAFSA processed by the federal government. West Virginia has the lowest number of college graduates in the nation, and the state's high school FAFSA completion rates are currently down nearly 40%, said Justice, a Republican.\n\n\"Really and truly, a lot of kids are sitting on the sidelines ... wondering, 'Am I going to be able to go to college?' \" he said during a news briefing.\n\nIn Baltimore, Camryn Carter is waiting to find out if he'll get a full ride to the University of Maryland or face tens of thousands of dollars in student loans.\n\nA top student and captain of his baseball and wrestling teams, Carter sees college as a step up in life. He thinks back to the times in the grocery store line when he had to put items back on the shelf because his mom couldn't afford the bill. A college degree would give him the stability he didn't always have, the 18-year-old said.\n\nBut when he looks at tuition, it's intimidating. Along with Maryland, he's also considering McDaniel College, a private school in Maryland. If he enrolls there, he expects to borrow almost $30,000 a year.\n\n\"I try to make the best decisions now so I can have a good future,\" he said. \"I'm a little nervous that things won't work out. But I'm faithful.\"\n\nTags Politics Education The Economy University Government Departments And Ministries Finance School Systems Job Market Medicine Trade Telephony Sports Be the first to

Each mistake added to delays, leaving students waiting longer to hear anything about financial aid.\n\nEven more worrisome is a misstep that blocked students from finishing the form if they have a parent without a Social Security number. Advocates say the system locked out hundreds of thousands of students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents but whose parents are not.\n\nFederal education officials say they're addressing lingering bugs and making progress. More than 8 million student applications have now been processed and sent to colleges, the agency said, and new applications are being processed within three days.\n\nSaving for your kids' college education?

And additional errors in calculations meant hundreds of thousands of already-submitted forms would need to be reprocessed.\n\nSince January, more than 30 issues have been reported with the new application. As of May, more than a dozen problems remain and many students have still not been able to submit their applications.\n\nThe money announced Monday comes too late to help many students applying for college this fall, but should provide some relief for those applying next year. The new FAFSA Student Support Strategy will provide up to $50 million to grantees and be implemented by the Educational Credit Management Corporation, a Minnesota-based nonprofit that oversees student loan repayments and provides financial education.\n\nThe announcement also comes on the heels of a congressional hearing titled \"FAFSA Fail,\" where the Republican chair of the House Higher Education subcommittee, Utah Rep. Burgess Owens, said the \"botched implementation\" of aid application could cause colleges and universities to see a 20% drop in enrollment this year.\n\nMark Kantrowitz, president of Cerebly, Inc., a consulting firm specializing in student financial aid, said at the hearing \"that the drop in college enrollment may be worse than the pandemic, causing some colleges to close.\"\n\nThe Department of Education said funds will be prioritized for organizations currently working with schools and districts, as well as those that have \"deep ties\" with students and families and have the capacity to help decrease barriers and increase FAFSA submissions.\n\nThe department said its new FAFSA Student Support Strategy funds will help schools and organizations add advisers, counselors and coaches to support students and families complete their applications through extended evening, weekend and summer hours.\n\nThe funds will also help pay for FAFSA submission clinics through partnerships with schools and districts and will provide transportation support as needed. The program will also improve communication and help organizations utilize texting, phone calls and video conferences in multiple languages to help families complete their forms.\n\nThe department said the investment builds on its existing efforts to help students and families complete their FAFSA, including the FAFSA College Support Strategy - another $50 million program which launched in February 2024 and focused on providing funding and advising for lower-resourced colleges and help them process students' financial aid information.\n\nThe Department of Education said that nearly 9 million applications have been successfully submitted since the new forms were launched on Dec. 30. That's a 24% drop from last year at this time.", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "molly_gibbs@mercurynews.com", "name": "Molly Gibbs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_financial_aid_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Student financial aid (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAFSA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FAFSA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Marten", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cindy Marten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgess_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burgess Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Student loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SJM-FAFSALIMBO-4.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538877", "eventUri": "eng-9538877", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-30", "textStart": 3857, "textEnd": 3864}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Of the 45,883 new and continuing students who have submitted a FAFSA this year, 9,764 were rejected because the applicants had missing information, while 17,962 have had to be reprocessed because of technical issues.\n\nJodi Vanden Berge, the director of college planning and outreach at EducationQuest, a nonprofit organization that works to improve access to higher education, said Congress' goal of simplifying the FAFSA and reducing the number of questions it asked from 100 to about 30 was admirable, but the implementation has been flawed.\n\n\"(Congress) wanted to simplify it so there were less questions and it was less daunting for parents and students to complete,\" Vanden Berge said. \"They also wanted to make the transition easier for pulling (Internal Revenue Service) information over into the FAFSA.\n\n\"(The U.S. Department of Education) made some good changes, I just think they released it before they actually had time to properly test the system and make sure it was going to work,\" Vanden Berge added.\n\nThe problems have forced many colleges and universities to push back the traditional May 1 deadline for accepted students to commit -- what's known as National College Decision Day.\n\nThe University of Nebraska-Lincoln, for example, extended its enrollment deposit deadline to May 15 to \"provide students and their families with necessary time to evaluate financial aid offers.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Although the delays are beyond the university's control, UNL is doing its utmost to minimize confusion and disruption to the financial aid process for Husker students and their families,\" the university said in a statement. \"We fully expect the issues to be resolved in ample time for students to make informed decisions about their college choices.\"\n\nUNL said it did not expect the delays in FAFSA submissions to affect enrollment figures for the 2024-25 school year, although other colleges and universities have expressed concern that some students might not matriculate if they do not have a financial award letter in time.\n\nNebraska Wesleyan has seen the delay in FAFSA processing affect the number of students who have received a financial aid award this year amid a \"strong\" first-year applicant pool that has exceeded previous years by several hundred students.\n\nBill Motzer, vice president for enrollment management, said the liberal arts university in northeast Lincoln has sent financial aid award letters to about 900 new students so far this year. Normally, NWU would expect to make offers to 1,300 by this point in the enrollment process.\n\n\"My biggest concern is students are dissuaded from completing the FAFSA, particularly students most at risk: low-income, first-generation students who would benefit the most,\" Motzer said.\n\nBut Nebraska Wesleyan hasn't been sitting idle. While the university did not move its May 1 deadline, it has hosted events and conducted outreach to help students and parents navigate the FAFSA, even developing its own FAFSA form to help families in making a decision.\n\nTom Oschner, director of scholarships and financial aid, repurposed an old \"early action program\" form used by Nebraska Wesleyan to give students and their families an idea of what kind of financial aid they could expect before the FAFSA filing window was opened.\n\nHe also used worksheets detailing how the Education Department planned to calculate its \"Student Aid Index\" -- formerly known as Expected Family Contribution -- to create his own spreadsheet giving families a preview of what their financial award letters would look like.\n\n\"Families want to make decisions and they need time to look at that and are being left in limbo,\" Oschner said. \"The biggest problem is if those families are waiting for offers from other schools who are waiting on FAFSA information.\"\n\nThe mock award letters from Nebraska Wesleyan spell out to families that the information is preliminary and could change based upon the actual FAFSA information, Oschner said.\n\n\"We hope it's helpful for those who want to make a decision,\" he added.\n\nOn Tuesday, Education Department officials said they are continuing to make progress in correcting the issues that many students and families have faced while also partnering with regional and local leaders to bring FAFSA completions up.\n\nDeputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten, a former school administrator, said the department has reached out directly to 700 superintendents nationwide to offer support and resources for the FAFSA as part of an awareness campaign.\n\n\"We want to continue to raise awareness about the importance of encouraging all high school seniors to submit FAFSA forms so they don't leave money on the table,\" Marten told reporters in a conference call.\n\nJames Kvaal, undersecretary of education, said \"it's been a challenging year for the FAFSA,\" but the department has made strides in recent weeks, processing 8.3 million submissions, and has made 1 million corrections, mostly to the most commonly seen issues.\n\nEducation Department officials said students can expect their FAFSAs to be processed and information to be sent to prospective colleges within 1-3 days.\n\nPorto said she was able to complete the FAFSA on Sunday evening, a milestone she thought would arrive a lot sooner in her college-going process. Other soon-to-be college students have said the same thing.\n\n\"We're all kind of struggling in the same way,\" she said. \"I thought it all was going to be super easy. I knew (the FAFSA) was kind of complicated before these changes, but this has made me really nervous.\"\n\nBest colleges in Nebraska Best colleges in Nebraska #10. Doane University #9.

The Department is launching a multi-million-dollar program as part of the FAFSA Student Support Strategy to help school districts, state, nonprofits and other public and private organizations with efforts to boost FAFSA completion. Since the new 2024-25 FAFSA form became available on Dec. 30, more than 8.95 million forms have been successfully submitted.\n\nThe FAFSA Student Support Strategy funds will help grow capacity for organizations to expand the availability of advisers, counselors, and coaches to support students and contributors through the FAFSA applications, including during extended hours through evenings, weekends, and the summer weeks. It will also facilitate FAFSA submission clinics, including through partnerships with schools and districts, and provide transportation support as needed. Additionally, these funds will provide communication supports to help organizations communicate with parents and students via text, phone calls, and videoconferences, in multiple languages as needed, to help them complete their forms.\n\nThe FAFSA Student Support Strategy aims to continue increasing the number of high school students who complete a 2024-25 FAFSA and enroll in college, particularly first-time college students and students of color. This investment builds on the Department's efforts to help students, families, and institutions through the 2024-25 FAFSA application cycle, in addition to the College Support Strategy, the FAFSA Fast Break campaign, and direct communication efforts with institutions and stakeholders via the FAFSA Fast News blog.\n\nOver the past few months, the Department has sent approximately 70 million emails to students encouraging them to complete the Better FAFSA form, as well as engaged with hundreds of superintendents and principals to help drive submission efforts, garnering over 200 commitments from companies, non-profits, and community organizations to help boost FAFSA submissions. Last week, the Department kicked-off a series of regional and local media engagement in media markets across the country to drive awareness and increase completion rates, targeting states with the largest high school senior FAFSA submission gaps.\n\n\"We are determined to close the FAFSA completion gap,\" said U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten. \"The funding we're announcing today will support states, districts, and community-based groups build capacity and leverage their power to ensure that every student who needs help paying for college turns in their FAFSA form.\"\n\nThe program will provide up to $50 million for grantees and will be implemented by ECMC to support organizations with demonstrated experience expanding college access and enrollment. The funding will be prioritized for organizations currently working with schools and districts, and those that have deep ties with students and families which have the reach and capacity to help decrease barriers and increase FAFSA submissions.\n\nThe Department continues to create and share resources for schools, students, families, and institutions of higher education to ensure they have the tools and information they need to receive and award financial aid. More information can be found at Ed.gov/better-FAFSA.\n\nThis announcement comes as the Department has made significant progress to address known issues with the 2024-25 FAFSA form and transmitted the Institutional Student Information Records (ISIRs) from more than 8.95 million applications to schools, states, and designated scholarship organizations. Most four-year institutions are now sending student aid offers, including the vast majority of schools with upcoming admissions deadlines.", "source": {"uri": "bossierpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Bossier Press-tribune          "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAFSA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FAFSA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Marten", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cindy Marten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_financial_aid_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Student financial aid (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Deputy_Secretary_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Deputy Secretary of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Students", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Students", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538877", "eventUri": "eng-9538877", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-30", "textStart": 426, "textEnd": 433}], "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Typically, more than 17 million families fill out FAFSA by Oct. 1, nearly a year before the next academic year and seven months before Decision Day on May 1, the deadline for students across the country to decide on the college they plan to attend. Schools use FAFSA calculations to determine financial aid packages for prospective students. Despite having three years to implement the new FAFSA application, the updated 2024-2025 version wasn't released by the Biden administration until late January -- three months late. And to make matters worse, the online application process experienced significant glitches that have fueled heartache and hardship for millions of families. In December, I put the Biden administration on notice to get on the stick and focus on fixing FAFSA, instead of abusing its executive power and devoting efforts to transfer student loan debt to the taxpayer. By all accounts, the U.S. Department of Education's botched job unnecessarily put high school graduates and their families in a pickle. For months, I've tracked feedback from Iowans and kept in close touch with Iowa college admissions officers to ensure their concerns are heard at the Department of Education. Iowans are exasperated and many feel at their wits' end. Instead of enjoying a special moment in their lives as they graduate from high school and look forward to their futures, the blundered rollout by the Biden administration has real consequences for many Iowa families. Here's a bit of feedback I'm hearing from Iowans:\n\n\"As a single parent to three college kids, this is a major issue for my family. They are standing in the way of kids heading to college.\" - A single parent from Altoona\n\n\"When we try to contact the Department of Education [about] FAFSA, there is no reply and an automatic hang up. We have been doing this since January. This is beyond frustration. Does the Department of Education even know that their system is messed up?\" -- A family from Bettendorf\n\n\"As a student whose family owns a family farm, as well as a small business, the FAFSA Simplification Act will significantly affect my ability to receive the necessary financial aid as I continue college.\" - Student from Vinton\n\nQ: What are you doing to help families who are waiting for answers?\n\nA: For starters, I'm working to help ensure farm families and family-owned businesses aren't penalized by changes to FAFSA that require applicants to list non-liquid assets. On behalf of tens of thousands of Iowa families, I've worked to educate federal bureaucrats that farmland and equipment is not like cash in a savings account. For example, farm families can't sell off their combine and use the cash to pay for college without jeopardizing their livelihoods. In Rural America, that's called cash-poor, asset-rich. I've been in contact with the Education Department to make sure for-profit \"investment farms\" aren't lumped in with farming operations on which a family lives and works. In February as deadlines drew near, I teamed up with Sen. Joni Ernst to provide answers and clarity for Iowa families. And still, the FAFSA delays put too many families in limbo. On May 2, we convened a roundtable discussion on Capitol Hill with leadership of the Office of Federal Student Aid to discuss the problems many families are facing and fix these issues that are creating obstacles for students to attend college in the fall.We need to make sure this is straightened out so it doesn't happen again. A number of schools in Iowa have extended Decision Day to accommodate the FAFSA fiasco. I'll continue pressing the Biden administration to stop ratcheting up the national debt by unloading student debt onto the taxpayer. Through executive orders, President Biden has already canceled $620 billion in student debt and is on track to cancel up to $1.4 trillion, digging a bigger hole in the budget and forcing taxpayers to pay for someone else's debt.

Of the 45,883 new and continuing students who have submitted a FAFSA this year, 9,764 were rejected because the applicants had missing information, while 17,962 have had to be reprocessed because of technical issues.\n\nJodi Vanden Berge, the director of college planning and outreach at EducationQuest, a nonprofit organization that works to improve access to higher education, said Congress' goal of simplifying the FAFSA and reducing the number of questions it asked from 100 to about 30 was admirable, but the implementation has been flawed.\n\n\"(Congress) wanted to simplify it so there were less questions and it was less daunting for parents and students to complete,\" Vanden Berge said. \"They also wanted to make the transition easier for pulling (Internal Revenue Service) information over into the FAFSA.\n\n\"(The U.S. Department of Education) made some good changes, I just think they released it before they actually had time to properly test the system and make sure it was going to work,\" Vanden Berge added.\n\nThe problems have forced many colleges and universities to push back the traditional May 1 deadline for accepted students to commit -- what's known as National College Decision Day.\n\nThe University of Nebraska-Lincoln, for example, extended its enrollment deposit deadline to May 15 to \"provide students and their families with necessary time to evaluate financial aid offers.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Although the delays are beyond the university's control, UNL is doing its utmost to minimize confusion and disruption to the financial aid process for Husker students and their families,\" the university said in a statement. \"We fully expect the issues to be resolved in ample time for students to make informed decisions about their college choices.\"\n\nUNL said it did not expect the delays in FAFSA submissions to affect enrollment figures for the 2024-25 school year, although other colleges and universities have expressed concern that some students might not matriculate if they do not have a financial award letter in time.\n\nNebraska Wesleyan has seen the delay in FAFSA processing affect the number of students who have received a financial aid award this year amid a \"strong\" first-year applicant pool that has exceeded previous years by several hundred students.\n\nBill Motzer, vice president for enrollment management, said the liberal arts university in northeast Lincoln has sent financial aid award letters to about 900 new students so far this year. Normally, NWU would expect to make offers to 1,300 by this point in the enrollment process.\n\n\"My biggest concern is students are dissuaded from completing the FAFSA, particularly students most at risk: low-income, first-generation students who would benefit the most,\" Motzer said.\n\nBut Nebraska Wesleyan hasn't been sitting idle. While the university did not move its May 1 deadline, it has hosted events and conducted outreach to help students and parents navigate the FAFSA, even developing its own FAFSA form to help families in making a decision.\n\nTom Oschner, director of scholarships and financial aid, repurposed an old \"early action program\" form used by Nebraska Wesleyan to give students and their families an idea of what kind of financial aid they could expect before the FAFSA filing window was opened.\n\nHe also used worksheets detailing how the Education Department planned to calculate its \"Student Aid Index\" -- formerly known as Expected Family Contribution -- to create his own spreadsheet giving families a preview of what their financial award letters would look like.\n\n\"Families want to make decisions and they need time to look at that and are being left in limbo,\" Oschner said. \"The biggest problem is if those families are waiting for offers from other schools who are waiting on FAFSA information.\"\n\nThe mock award letters from Nebraska Wesleyan spell out to families that the information is preliminary and could change based upon the actual FAFSA information, Oschner said.\n\n\"We hope it's helpful for those who want to make a decision,\" he added.\n\nOn Tuesday, Education Department officials said they are continuing to make progress in correcting the issues that many students and families have faced while also partnering with regional and local leaders to bring FAFSA completions up.\n\nDeputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten, a former school administrator, said the department has reached out directly to 700 superintendents nationwide to offer support and resources for the FAFSA as part of an awareness campaign.\n\n\"We want to continue to raise awareness about the importance of encouraging all high school seniors to submit FAFSA forms so they don't leave money on the table,\" Marten told reporters in a conference call.\n\nJames Kvaal, undersecretary of education, said \"it's been a challenging year for the FAFSA,\" but the department has made strides in recent weeks, processing 8.3 million submissions, and has made 1 million corrections, mostly to the most commonly seen issues.\n\nEducation Department officials said students can expect their FAFSAs to be processed and information to be sent to prospective colleges within 1-3 days.\n\nPorto said she was able to complete the FAFSA on Sunday evening, a milestone she thought would arrive a lot sooner in her college-going process. Other soon-to-be college students have said the same thing.\n\n\"We're all kind of struggling in the same way,\" she said. \"I thought it all was going to be super easy. I knew (the FAFSA) was kind of complicated before these changes, but this has made me really nervous.\"\n\nReach the writer at 402-473-7120 or cdunker@journalstar.com.\n\nOn Twitter

The awards are also intended to support schools amid unique nationwide challenges with this year's FAFSA. As of April 2024, 168,489 students or prospective students in Massachusetts have completed the FAFSA, a decrease from 232,560 in April 2023.\n\n\"We want high school seniors to know that there is still time to complete the FAFSA and pursue higher education this coming fall,\" said Governor Maura Healey. \"These additional funds will help reach students who have yet to complete the FAFSA but who aspire to attend college and may benefit from the significant financial aid programs available in Massachusetts.\"\n\nThese grants allow the state to support schools in a final push to reach seniors before they graduate, said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll.\n\n\"Students may have considered a college education but not begun or completed the FAFSA,\" said Driscoll. \"We know how dedicated our school counselors are to helping these students, and the Administration is working to support them through these funds and by shifting the priority deadline for state financial aid.\"\n\nThe FAFSA completion grants will be issued to public high schools at which 70 percent or more of the students served are from Gateway Cities. The funds are also granted to Massachusetts high schools taking part in the federal Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) program.

At some schools, that figure is north of 80%.\n\n\"We're seeing students who are saying, 'well, I'm not going to school,' because the national narrative is that school is too expensive and they won't be be able to afford it,\" said Derek Sporbert, who directs the federally-funded TRIO programs for first-generation and Pell Grant-eligible students at the University of North Dakota.\n\nFAFSA completions are down significantly across the country this year, in part due to\n\na widely-publicized debacle surrounding the rollout\n\nof a \"simplified\" version of the financial aid form.\n\nSchools where more than half of students qualify for free or reduced-price meals represent less than 5% of North Dakota's high school seniors, but a decile breakdown of completion rates at high schools across the state show completion rates falling faster at lower-income schools.\n\nAt schools where 40% to 49% of students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, completions are down 46.1%.\n\nConversely, schools where less than 10% of students qualify for the federal meals program have seen completions drop by only 7.5%.\n\nTo qualify for the National School Lunch Program, families must have a household income between 185% and 130% of the federal poverty level for reduced-price meals and below 130% for free meals.\n\nFor low-income students, the FAFSA delays are \"another brick in the wall,\" Sporbert said.\n\nHe noted first-generation and low-income students were likelier to report difficulties completing the FAFSA form, while at the same time being likelier to report filling it out on their own.\n\n\"(Students) are looking at their return on investment -- 'can I just stay here and work in my community and I won't be in debt? Or do I take a chance, take out some student loans and do a thing that nobody's ever done in my family before?'\" Sporbert said. \"That can be a difficult decision for students (and) that can be a difficult decision for parents, especially parents who aren't familiar with the postsecondary system.\"\n\nThose students are also dogged by misinformation, like horror stories about runaway student debt linked to private loans -- instead of federal aid -- and claims that nobody will be getting federal student aid this year.\n\n\"It's really disheartening because low-income students disproportionately benefit from financial aid,\" said Bill DeBaun, senior director of data and strategic initiatives at NCAN.\n\nLower-income students in North Dakota already lagged behind their wealthier peers when it comes to completing the FAFSA.\n\nThis time last year, there was a 13-point gap in FAFSA completion between the share of students at the wealthiest schools in North Dakota and the poorest. Now, there's a more than 36-point gap.\n\n\"This isn't a new phenomenon for the class of 2024,\" said DeBaun. \"There's always been an equity concern of 'are we getting FAFSAs completed by the students who would benefit most?'\"\n\nMore broadly, he said the FAFSA debacle was part of a trend of issues disrupting students' college plans nationwide in recent years, pointing to the COVID-19 pandemic as the start.\n\nThose disruptions fall harder on students who are already less likely to attend college, he said.\n\n\"We talk a lot about self-belief and seeing yourself as a college student,\" DeBaun said. \"When we see something like the FAFSA delays, students take that as a sign that I should wait and go later or I won't go at all.\"\n\nSporbert says he's not worried about high school seniors who have access to TRIO's pre-college programs -- for instance, at Grafton High School, FAFSA completions have actually increased this year, which counselor Nicole Warren credited in part to TRIO's presence.\n\nSporbert is concerned about those the program doesn't reach.\n\n\"We're limited in our grants and funding, so we can only work in certain areas,\" he said. \"So I worry about students ... that aren't getting the help that we're able to provide or attend schools that aren't able to provide additional college readiness.\"\n\nAt Minto (N.D.)

Walthers: Facing FAFSA frustration? Bulldog Express has your back", "body": "If you live with or know any high school seniors, you're likely aware of the unusual stress they are facing this year when it comes to committing to college.\n\nYou've heard the news about the major crisis with the U.S. Department of Education's cumbersome rollout of the updated Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).\n\nThe FAFSA application is the most important document a student can send to a college or university as they apply for admission. The FAFSA is used not only for federal financial aid; it's also a vital tool for colleges and universities to determine locally funded student aid.\n\nWithout accurate FAFSA information from a family, it's almost impossible to provide families with the actual cost they will pay to start college.\n\nAllan Hancock College faces the same struggles as other colleges and universities this year when it comes to providing up-to-date financial information to potential students.\n\nStudent information is arriving late from the federal government and, thus far, it's plagued with errors that must be corrected manually by our amazing financial aid team.\n\nFortunately, Hancock differs from large universities that are not integrated with their local communities.\n\nWe serve local students, we know our local high schools, and we are our community's college. Our faculty, staff, and administrators are singularly focused on ensuring that local students have access to affordable, quality education.\n\nSo, how do we overcome the FAFSA problem?\n\nThe first step: commit to working around it. Regardless of the situation, our incoming freshmen are eligible for the Hancock Promise if they sign up for 12 or more units, take math and English, get an abbreviated education plan, and fill out the FAFSA.\n\nThis year, we are allowing students to postpone their FAFSA application until the kinks are worked out as long as they meet all the other steps.\n\nGetting this message through the layers of panic, frustration, and confusion is no easy task.\n\nTo cut through the noise, Hancock is hosting a new outreach initiative called Bulldog Express. Launching in June, students can come onto campus on Monday and Tuesday afternoons for FAFSA assistance and help with completing all the enrollment steps. Bulldog Express will run through late July (be on the watch for more information coming soon).\n\nRecently, dozens of Hancock counselors, staff, and administrators visited local high schools from Santa Ynez to Lompoc to Santa Maria, including our local private schools and continuation schools.\n\nThe goal: to provide one-on-one assistance with FAFSA and course registration. The effort resulted in more than 1,100 high school seniors finalizing their Hancock application, completing an abbreviated student education plan, and registering for fall classes.\n\nThis is how you build a college-going culture in our community, but more importantly it's how you stave off the questionable practices of predatory for-profit colleges that often confuse students into accepting large loans to attend programs of questionable quality.\n\nIf decision day for college admission nears and a student you know doesn't have a clear picture of their financial commitments for college, remind them that Hancock is a great option for starting their higher education career.\n\nThe newly announced second year of the Hancock Promise creates the opportunity to earn a transfer degree or career education degree for no tuition cost. If students carefully select their courses, they can also navigate the two years without ever having to buy a textbook.\n\nOur staff is working hard to provide local options to this national problem, and Hancock remains committed to being our community's college. Picking a college is stressful enough. Paying for it shouldn't be. This is just another way that Hancock is Changing the Odds.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_financial_aid_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Student financial aid (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAFSA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FAFSA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Hancock_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allan Hancock College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Community college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For-profit_higher_education_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "For-profit higher education in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_admissions_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College admissions in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools_of_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools of Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/santamariatimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/40/f408191e-0cca-50d9-9f82-f460a65fd07d/663532cbdf166.preview.jpg?crop=1000%2C525%2C0%2C71&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538877", "eventUri": "eng-9538877", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

May 1 is sometimes called \"decision day,\" the day that many students formally commit to their chosen college or university.\n\nThis year, unfortunately, there is a new -- and unnecessary -- worry for many students and their parents. Because of several problems with a revised federal student financial aid system, many students and their families still don't know how much they will be expected to pay for college next year. That is unacceptable, and, unfortunately for some, could delay, or even derail, their plans for higher education.\n\nFor decades, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid has been unnecessarily complex and unwieldy. So, Congress ordered the Department of Education to improve it.\n\nThat improvement is underway, but not without too many missteps and mistakes from the Education Department.\n\nThe application has been shortened and streamlined. But that's the end of the good news. Although the FAFSA is usually available for families to fill out in October, it was not available until January. Then, many families reported problems completing and submitting the form.\n\nAs a result, colleges and universities didn't get FAFSA information until March, dramatically shortening the amount of time available to make financial aid decisions. In a typical year, more than 17 million students fill out the FAFSA. The information they submit is used to determine financial aid from schools and the federal government. It is also used to determine eligibility for loans and work-study programs.\n\nNot having this information is a big detriment to students, especially those most in need of financial support. Kim Cook, the CEO of the National College Attainment Network, warned members of Congress about a potentially \"catastrophic\" drop in college enrollments, the Associated Press reported. Such a drop could also harm small colleges, which could face layoffs and even closures.\n\nMany schools, especially those with financial resources, have extended the time for students to make enrollment decisions, and have increased their financial aid awards.\n\nLast week, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice declared a state of emergency that allows students at the state's public schools to receive state scholarships without having their FAFSA processed by the federal government. West Virginia has the lowest number of college graduates based on population in the nation.\n\n\"Really and truly, a lot of kids are sitting on the sidelines ... wondering, 'Am I going to be able to go to college?'\" Justice said during a news briefing, according to the AP.\n\nThis situation is unacceptable for students in any state.\n\nSen. Susan Collins had stern words for U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona during a recent Appropriations Committee hearing. \"I have heard from countless families, students, financial aid counselors, and administrators who have expressed their extreme frustration with the system. And I believe the department owes them an apology,\" she said. \"This wasn't something that was dropped on the department at the last moment. It goes back four years. So, there was plenty of time to get this right.\"\n\nCollins and others are right to press the department on what went wrong and to push for immediate fixes. For some students, unfortunately, the harm may already have been done. It is incumbent upon educators and others to work to identify these students and to find ways to ensure their higher education plans are not derailed by bureaucratic incompetence.", "source": {"uri": "bangordailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangor Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bdn_editorial_board@bangordailynews.com", "name": "Bdn Editorial Board", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_financial_aid_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Student financial aid (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAFSA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FAFSA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Work-Study_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Work-Study Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Cardona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miguel Cardona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Justice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Susan Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scholarship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Appropriations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Appropriations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/05/Education-Financial-Aid.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538877", "eventUri": "eng-9538877", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 295, "textEnd": 300}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

This year, that's not necessarily the case.\n\nBecause of a disastrous rollout of the new application for federal tuition aid, many still don't know how much tuition they would be paying and so have not decided where they can afford to go.\n\nThe Education Department's redesigned form for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid was supposed to make applying for tuition aid easier and more accessible. But faced with a bureaucratic mess caused by technical meltdowns and severe delays in processing information and receiving aid packages, students say the new system has been anything but clear or streamlined.\n\nThe first signs of trouble began in December with the form's release and have cascaded since, creating uncertainties for students -- with graduation right around the corner.\n\n\"It's been a nightmare from point A to point B,\" said Reyna Atkinson, a 17-year-old from Michigan, who ultimately committed to Michigan State University after months of waiting.\n\nFAFSA is a free, standardized application for federal aid for college tuition that millions rely on. Students fill out one form, with details on their background and household income, to request tuition information for the schools they list.\n\nBefore the overhaul, applicants typically received their financial aid packages within 72 hours of submission. But this year, the Education Department has to reprocess more than 500,000 applications, and students have been waiting for two, three months -- and counting.\n\nStudents typically must commit to a college by May 1. Some colleges have extended their decision days until May 15 or early June because of the FAFSA problems.\n\nEven so, several students interviewed by The New York Times said they were making decisions without getting a full picture of tuition costs, a move financial aid experts discourage. Others said they couldn't commit without knowing how much their chosen college would cost.\n\nKenneth Seinshin, a 17-year-old from New York City who hopes to be the first in his family to go to college, started filling out his application the first week it came out. But it took months to troubleshoot the glitches he encountered; he finally submitted in March.\n\nSo far, he has received only one aid package, for Union College in New York, and he has yet to make a decision. \"The whole process just really stressed me out,\" Kenneth said.\n\nClover Schwalm, an 18-year-old from Michigan, was in a similar situation. As a disabled and transgender student, she wanted a school with an accessible and inclusive environment. She still hasn't received all of her packages, including from schools of higher priority such as Savannah College of Art and Design, but committed to Arizona State.\n\nShe said she has \"reservations\" about moving to Arizona, but was comforted by the fact that it doesn't have a ban on transgender care for adults. \"It's not the best, but I also recognize that there are states that could be less safe,\" she said.\n\nSimply completing the application has been a frustrating task for many. Some have not been able to save their changes or make corrections, while others could not submit their form at all.\n\nSo far this year, there has been a noticeable dip in the number of students who have completed the form, compared with last year. Among high schoolers graduating this year, 35.6% had completed financial aid applications through April 26, compared with 48.2% in the same period for the previous class, data analysis by the National College Attainment Network shows.\n\n\"The data on FAFSA completion takes a bad story and makes it even worse,\" said Bill DeBaun, a senior director at NCAN, which tracks FAFSA applications.\n\nReyna, the Michigan student, submitted her FAFSA form in January, but it wasn't processed until late March. She was accepted to several schools, but the FAFSA system wouldn't let her add them to her application, so she gave up on trying to get financial aid from them.\n\nAva James, 17, from California, faced different, but still frustrating, hurdles. When she tried to add her mother's first name, Janice Cheryl, the system could not process the double name. She eventually figured it out, but then the system prematurely submitted the form without her signature. It took her six weeks to fix it.\n\nAnother wrinkle has been the form's convoluted language.\n\nVanessa Farris, a counselor for the Ayers Foundation Trust in McMinnville, Tennessee, said several of her students tripped over one particular question:\n\n\"Are the student's parents unwilling to provide their information, but the student doesn't have an unusual circumstance, such as those listed in question 7, that prevents them from contacting the parents or obtaining their information?\"\n\n\"Such a little thing, but it has a cost,\" Farris said. Several students provided wrong answers, and they were not able to amend their mistake for months.\n\nThe debacle affects some more than others. Agnes Cesare, a college counselor at UCLA Community School, said she was worried about its effects on students from low-income families or racial minority groups -- the ones the new form was meant to help.\n\nCesare said that because of the arduous process, some students at her school had decided to pursue an associate degree and save up for a bachelor's later. But she worries that once they are out of high school, they may not get the help they need to transfer to a four-year school.\n\n\"It feels like the roadblocks are insurmountable\" for those students, Cesare said.\n\nThe process has been especially difficult for students with parents who are in the country illegally. The new system asks parents for their Social Security numbers, which people in the country illegally don't have.\n\nThat was the case for Elizabeth Templos-Galindo, a 17-year-old in Tennessee, and her parents. They called the Education Department for assistance but were put on hold for five hours before learning of other forms of identification her parents could submit.\n\nEducation Department officials have acknowledged the glitches, and on a recent call with reporters, the deputy secretary of education, Cindy Marten, said they had been \"working tirelessly to resolve those issues.\" Officials added that students were now able to make corrections to their forms and that updated financial records were being sent to schools. Last month, the department announced that the leader of the Federal Student Aid office, Richard Cordray, would step down.\n\nWhile FAFSA is used by every school in the country, a small group of institutions -- a lot of them private and elite schools with a larger endowment and more students from wealthier backgrounds -- also uses the College Scholarship Service Profile, a financial aid application administered by the College Board.\n\nThe CSS profile costs $25 per application, and schools that use it provide aid estimates using a different formula. Because that form didn't have a bevy of glitches, students received estimates more quickly from CSS-affiliated schools than ones that use FAFSA.\n\nOwen Keller, 18, from Maine, can speak to that. He filled out both FAFSA and CSS forms in December, and received tuition details from CSS-affiliated schools such as Bowdoin College well before his first FAFSA package arrived in late April. Owen decided on Bowdoin even before receiving all of his packages.\n\nThe FAFSA blunder has made some reconsider their plans.\n\nYajaira Vargas, 18, from Reno, Nevada, wants to study political science and become an immigration lawyer. She got into her top choice, the University of Nevada, Reno, but wasn't able to apply for aid until May.\n\nNow, she is considering not going to college immediately and taking a gap year. \"But I don't want to do that,\" she said.\n\nUniversities are also feeling the stress of the FAFSA disaster, said Christopher Murr, assistant vice president for financial aid and scholarships at Texas State University.\n\n\"I know the U.S. Department of Education is doing their best at this point,\" Murr said, \"but it seems every couple of days there's a new wrinkle, a new challenge that we have to adapt to.\"\n\nExperts are worried things may get worse this summer, when this debacle could collide with the \"summer melt\": a period when students who took all the necessary steps to go to college, including putting down a deposit, decide not to enroll by fall semester.\n\nBecause of that, DeBaun said June 30 was seen as a crucial milestone, when the school year ends and high school students will no longer get access to counseling.\n\n\"Will we be able to connect students with the assistance they need to finish the process out?\" he asked.", "source": {"uri": "sunherald.com", "dataType":

This year, that's not necessarily the case.\n\nBecause of a disastrous rollout of the new application for federal tuition aid, many still don't know how much tuition they would be paying and so have not decided where they can afford to go.\n\nThe Education Department's redesigned form for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid was supposed to make applying for tuition aid easier and more accessible. But faced with a bureaucratic mess caused by technical meltdowns and severe delays in processing information and receiving aid packages, students say the new system has been anything but clear or streamlined.\n\nThe first signs of trouble began in December with the form's release and have cascaded since, creating uncertainties for students -- with graduation right around the corner.\n\n\"It's been a nightmare from point A to point B,\" said Reyna Atkinson, a 17-year-old from Michigan, who ultimately committed to Michigan State University after months of waiting.\n\nFAFSA is a free, standardized application for federal aid for college tuition that millions rely on. Students fill out one form, with details on their background and household income, to request tuition information for the schools they list.\n\nBefore the overhaul, applicants typically received their financial aid packages within 72 hours of submission. But this year, the Education Department has to reprocess more than 500,000 applications, and students have been waiting for two, three months -- and counting.\n\nStudents typically must commit to a college by May 1. Some colleges have extended their decision days until May 15 or early June because of the FAFSA problems.\n\nEven so, several students interviewed by The New York Times said they were making decisions without getting a full picture of tuition costs, a move financial aid experts discourage.

This is what you must know about the scholarship plan", "body": "US. Donald Trump's plan to deport 'nearly 20 million' illegal immigrants from the US\n\nFor students and parents in the United States, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) offers a vital government service in paving the path to attending college or a university.\n\nTo be considered for federal student aid, you must meet these basic eligibility requirements, including financial need, being a U.S citizen and possessing a valid Social Security number.\n\nThe good news for many students is that much of the money you are awarded through the FAFSA does not need to be paid back. This includes needs-based financial aid grants that are awarded by individual colleges, as well as federal and state grants like the Pell Grant or Federal SEOG Grants.\n\nThe type of aid you receive after filling out the FAFSA determines if you need to pay it back. In the case of grants, scholarships, and work-study money, these don't need to be repaid.\n\nAll of this money is free for you to use on your education. There may be a requirement to maintain a specific number of credit hours or minimum GPA to remain eligible for your need-based grants.\n\nYou need to complete the FAFSA to determine what type of assistance you qualify for, though you don't have to accept all the financial aid offered to you.\n\nThe deadline for the for school year 2024-25 is June 30, 2025. However, it is crucial to do this as early possible as the pool of money is limited.\n\nSubsidized, unsubsidized, and Direct Plus Loans do need to be repaid, with a fixed interest rate on federal loans.\n\nIf your college costs aren't covered completely by the aid offered through the FAFSA, you may have to take out private loans as well. You will have to pay those back, and these should be your last resort as private loans often come with worse terms and protections than federal loans.\n\nStudent loan repayment can vary according to your loan terms and repayment plan, and it may be wise to plan out the best repayment option for your own individual situation before agreeing to the terms.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAFSA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FAFSA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_financial_aid_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Student financial aid (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social Security number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Work-Study_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Work-Study Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell_Grant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pell Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scholarship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Student loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/682f7712412347713ce638a9b11b85db/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2023/04/24/16823224831991.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538877", "eventUri": "eng-9538877", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

It could be a scam.\"\n\nWhen completing the FAFSA online, applicants should consult the in-form resources if help is needed. Look for the question mark icons embedded in the form.\n\nEvery student, even those who think they may not qualify for federal grants, should apply. Many colleges and states use the FAFSA to award other grants and scholarships.\n\nStudents, parents and caregivers should refer to www.StudentAid.gov to apply. People with questions or needing assistance can check out the Help Center tab on the Federal Student Aid website or contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-433-3243.\n\nConsumers who believe they may have been the victim of identity theft or of a federal student aid or scholarship scam can contact the Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division at 800-368-8808 or visit the office online at www.ago.wv.gov.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAFSA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FAFSA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Morrisey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Morrisey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scholarship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social Security number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Student_Aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Student Aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Identity theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_(money)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grant (money)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Students", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Students", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b87268c4-7873-11e7-af9a-f3a04545878a.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538877", "eventUri": "eng-9538877", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

The lead-up to the summit has been dominated by pressure on Biden to step down as the Democrats' candidate for President in the November elections - and by Biden's return fire, disputing rumours he is unwell and saying he is determined to stay to try to fend off Donald Trump as he faces ongoing pressure. Biden has repeatedly said he will not stand down.\n\nNor could the senators escape it from visiting media: as he waited for Luxon to arrive, US Senator Jon Ossoff (Democrat, Georgia) was asked if he thought Biden had what was needed for a second term as PM.\n\nOssoff responded that he supported the President's campaign for re-election.\n\nLuxon greeted Ossoff by saying he had heard he was \"an afficionado\" of New Zealand - a remark apparently sparked by Ossoff speaking of his fondness for the country on a previous meeting with PM Jacinda Ardern in 2022.\n\nOssoff replied he was and would remain a friend of New Zealand.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to building a relationship with you and working with you in the interests of both of our countries.\"\n\nLuxon said he had had a good morning of meetings \"and there are a lot of things we want to do to continue to deepen the relationship with the United States\".\n\nEarlier, Luxon met with senators on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He is due to meet high-profile Republican Ted Cruz tomorrow.\n\nHowever, it remains unclear whether he will get any face-to-face time with Biden beyond major events such as the Nato Summit dinner at the White House.\n\nTomorrow Luxon will chair a meeting of the four Indo-Pacific countries, which is expected to be attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThe Nato Summit will focus on support for Ukraine. Ukraine is the most urgent business at the Summit and a range of measures are expected to be announced over coming days.\n\nNew Zealand's extra $16m consists of $10m in humanitarian aid and $6 million in military help. A further round of sanctions against Russia is also expected to be announced in the near future.\n\nOf the military assistance, $2m will support military healthcare for Ukraine, and $4m will go to a drone capability coalition for Ukraine led by the United Kingdom and Latvia.\n\nNew Zealand will have contributed about $130m to Ukraine since Russia's invasion two and a half years ago. About $80m of that is in the deployment of New Zealand troops to help train Ukrainian forces from other bases in Europe - that deployment of 97 personnel was recently extended to mid-2025.\n\n\"New\u202fZealand understands that while we are distant from Ukraine, what happens there affects us all, and we are prepared to stand with Ukraine for the long haul,\" Luxon said.\n\nThe coalition's aim is to supply tens of thousands of drones to Ukraine for use in the war.\n\nAhead of the announcement, Luxon had tweeted about a Russian attack on the children's hospital in Kyiv, saying \"Putin's gruesome attack on Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv underlines his appalling tactics\". He said in Washington he intended to underline that New Zealand continued to stand with Ukraine.\n\nIt is the first time DC has hosted the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) Summit in 25 years, and the timing ensures there will be a lot of focus on Biden's hosting of it - from the dinner at the White House to the main summit event and press conference. The leaders inside will also be focused on Biden and Trump, due to Trump's less enthusiastic views of Nato.\n\nIt will be attended by leaders from the 32 member states, as well as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nLuxon can expect formal bilateral meetings with a number of those leaders, including two who knew former PM Jacinda Ardern well - Canada's PM Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron, who partnered with Ardern on the Christchurch Call. It is uncertain whether new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will see him.\n\nThe Russian war on Ukraine will again be the focus of the summit - the recent bombing of a children's hospital in Kyiv has been highlighted ahead of the Summit as reinforcing the need for support for Ukraine.\n\nLeaders are expected to sign off on commitments to maintain existing levels of support for Ukraine at a minimum, as well as for Nato to take over handling the co-ordination of that support. New Zealand is expected to make an announcement on further support, on top of its renewal of troop deployments to train Ukrainian forces until mid-2025.\n\nLuxon will also chair the meeting of the Indo-Pacific 4 - Australia, Japan, Korea and New Zealand. Zelenskyy is expected to attend that meeting.\n\nThe Indo-Pacific 4 have only been invited to attend the summit for the past three years.\n\nAhead of the summit, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Ukraine had showed security was not regional but global, and pointed to actions of Iran, North Korea and China in dealing with Russia.\n\n\"The closer that authoritarian actors align, the more important it is that we work closely with our friends in the Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nHe said the focus would be on flagship projects on Ukraine, cyber, and new technologies.", "source": {"uri":

He was like a kid in a candy shop - although he couldn't choose his own pick-and-mix.\n\nThe Oval Office meeting was out of his reach on this occasion. It would have been little short of a miracle if Luxon had been on US President Joe Biden's crowded schedule for anything more than a hello in passing.\n\nAs Luxon quite fairly pointed out, he was facing pretty stiff competition from the 32 Nato leaders also in town ahead of the Nato Summit - leaders of much bigger countries than his.\n\nHis visit also coincided with the return of politicians to Congress after a long recess - meaning the US media were focusing on chasing those politicians to ask them about the ongoing debate around Biden's re-election bid and his rival Donald Trump's bid.\n\nIn the corridors near the senators' offices, they bailed up senators along the pathways, holding open lift doors to continue the questions.\n\nAll eyes were also on Biden to see if he would stumble as he went about his business, delivering a speech to open the Nato Summit in which he spoke of the significance Nato had played and the boost in defence spending during Russia's war on Ukraine, an apparent reminder that Trump was a Nato-sceptic.\n\nVisiting leaders - including Luxon - were also being asked questions they didn't particularly want to answer about the prospect of a second Trump administration.\n\nAs Taylor Swift might put it, they've seen this film before and they didn't like the ending.\n\nLuxon certainly didn't want to answer the questions. He was asked whether he thought Biden was fit to serve a further term, or whether he was worried about what a second Trump presidency might mean for the world and for New Zealand.\n\nHe had no views he was willing to share.\n\nMedia hoping the heat or lack of sleep would result in a weak moment were disappointed - he managed to maintain his line that he would not talk about US politics all the way through a 15-minute interrogation under the beating sun in front of the Capitol building in intense 38C heat.\n\nIt's the only answer he really can give.\n\nLuxon will very much hope he gets to sit down with an American President at some point while he is Prime Minister.\n\nThat is not so critical this time around: Luxon has a smorgasbord of other powerful leaders to meet with at Nato today.\n\nThe point of meeting leaders is partly to form a relationship that might come in handy a bit later on. As things stand, it's not clear who the US President will be after the November election.\n\nLuxon's hopes of a future White House invite may depend on the result of that.\n\nThere is a notable gap between when Sir John Key last went to the White House in 2014 (he was invited twice by Barack Obama) and when Dame Jacinda Ardern went to meet Biden in 2022. That gap was the Trump presidency, during which Ardern was PM and little old New Zealand didn't get a look-in.\n\nShould Trump get a second term, Luxon might fare a bit better than Ardern on the invite front. Ardern was swiftly portrayed as the anti-Trump - young and liberal and fast getting a global profile as a result of it.\n\nLuxon's CEO vibe might be more appealing to a Trump administration.\n\nHis meetings were with a mix of Republicans and Democrats.\n\nOn Wednesday, he gets one last Republican in: Ted Cruz, the Senator for Texas, who stood against Trump in 2016 but now backs him. Both Luxon and Cruz are the same age at 53, both are conservative although Cruz is quite a lot more conservative in many respects.\n\nThat meeting will be intriguing for Luxon, given Cruz's long political history.\n\nThat same day, the American political junkie will turn his attentions to the issues and the leaders that await at the Nato Summit.\n\nTop of that list is Ukraine: Luxon announced a further $16 million of support for Ukraine as other leaders also announced new packages. While New Zealand's is small change compared to most others, all countries want to be seen to do their bit.\n\nHe has a long string of meetings with the Nato leaders, including French President Emmanual Macron and Canada's Justin Trudeau. Both were friendly with Ardern.\n\nHowever, he may have to rely on his resourcefulness at a dinner or on the sidelines to try to get that word in with Biden.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz",

leaders as issues in Europe simmer", "body": "Analysis - The prime minister will meet with the leaders of France, Canada, and Estonia today as his first big diplomatic test continues in Washington DC.\n\nChristopher Luxon attended the NATO 75th anniversary dinner where he used his time well, getting introductions with 13 different leaders.\n\nHe is yet to meet with either US President Joe Biden or new UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, but it's expected he'll get that chance at the White House dinner later today.\n\nAhead of the dinner the prime minister will have a meeting with senior Republican Ted Cruz.\n\nThe Senator for Texas ran against Donald Trump in the 2016 Republican primaries and is expected to be a big player in any future Trump administration.\n\nIt's a big day of Republican catch-ups for Luxon to balance out the lunch and talks he had with senior Democrat Jon Ossoff yesterday.\n\nAlong with Cruz, Luxon will meet with Senator Bill Haggerty, a former US ambassador to Japan under Trump's administration.\n\nHaggerty is being tipped as Secretary of State if Trump wins the presidency later this year.\n\nThe New Zealand government's Washington office has made sure the prime minister has got face time with some pivotal politicians of both stripes, and Luxon has certainly brought high business energy to those meetings.\n\nLater today Luxon will move his attention away from a US focus and sit down for bilateral talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Estonia Prime Minister Kaja Kallas.\n\nLike New Zealand, Estonia is a small-advanced economy, and Luxon will be keen to hear from Kallas about how they do business.\n\nMostly though he'll be interested in any insights to the situation in Russia and Ukraine.\n\nEstonia shares a border with Russia and Kallas will have crucial intel on the neighbouring countries that Luxon will be keen to get briefed on.\n\nThe big issue being discussed this week between the North-Atlantic leaders is Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and both NATO and New Zealand have already committed more funding and resources this week to help Ukraine in its defence.\n\nThere's a real feeling within the Indo-Pacific that what happens in Europe significantly impacts everyone else.\n\nNew Zealand, Japan, Australia and Korea will be keen to discuss the rules-based order with US and European leaders, and how it's being felt in the Indo-Pacific with the cost of living crisis and pressures from the likes of China - a friend of Russia.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's determination to contest the presidency later this year continues to be a feature of talks, at least on the sidelines, here in the US.\n\nWhile Biden put on a reasonable show in his NATO opening speech yesterday, he was relying very much on a teleprompter and was difficult to understand in places.\n\nHe might have hoped the debate about his health would simmer - at least while world leaders are in the US and there's other issues to focus on.\n\nIt seems that won't be the case after George Clooney penned an opinion piece for the New York Times that has landed on the eve of the council meeting of leaders.\n\nIn it he calls for Biden to stand down, saying he doesn't believe the Democrats will win if he continues.\n\nThe pressure is on Biden to put on a good performance in all his public-facing appearances this week, as he tries to convince his party and the public that he's still up to the job.\n\nLuxon might have some of his own insights on that after he meets, albeit briefly, with Biden.\n\nWhatever his assessment is, it won't be one he will be sharing publicly.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This is a place of large egos.\"\n\nAnd as he met with the Republicans, Luxon was again confronted with questions about US President Joe Biden after an opinion piece by George Clooney - a lifelong Democrat - calling on Biden to step aside and make way for a new nominee.\n\nLuxon deflected the question by suggesting Clooney be cast as his Police Minister Mark Mitchell in the event there was a movie about Mitchell's life.\n\nHagerty and Cruz are Trump supporters and have been mentioned on the admittedly long list of potential running mates for Donald Trump. Cruz is also considered likely to run for selection for the presidency again in the future, after first standing against Trump in 2016.\n\nHagerty is considered a potential future Secretary of State - he was previously the US Ambassador in Tokyo.\n\nAsked whether he was courting politicians who would be influential in a future Trump presidency, Luxon said he was meeting with both Democrats and Republicans because it was important to position New Zealand well with key figures - and those who could be key in the future.\n\n\"Senators and committees in the system are really powerful, really influential and it's really important to have direct relationships with them. I'm meeting with everybody, because my job is, irrespective of who wins the election in November, I have to work with everybody.\"\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee handles the budget, taxation and trade and is one of the most powerful committees.\n\nTrump has proposed new tariffs on trade. Luxon said he would emphasise to that committee that New Zealand was a trading nation and \"big champions\" of free trade.\n\nIt is chaired by Jason Smith, who visited New Zealand in January. Luxon's path was smoothed by Foreign Minister Winston Peters, who had taken Smith fishing in Northland during his stay.\n\nHe will head to the Nato Summit later this morning for a long line-up of bilateral meetings, including with Macron, Canada's Justin Trudeau, and Kallas.\n\nHe said he would talk to Trudeau about the CPTPP, and confirmed he would raise the ongoing dispute New Zealand has with Canada over the access for dairy products. The pair are also likely to discuss Pillar 2 of the Aukus agreement.\n\nHe expected the situation in New Caledonia to be a topic of conversation with Macron, after recent civil unrest there over a proposal to extend voting rights for French citizens, opposed by the local Kanaks. That reform was suspended due to the French elections.\n\nHe had not yet had a chance to talk to new British PM Keir Starmer, but he said he had also met about 13 leaders at the 75th Anniversary dinner last night.\n\n\"I spoke to everyone from the German Chancellor right down to the Iceland Prime Minister.\" He said those meetings were quite informal and relaxed.\n\n\"I enjoy meeting the leaders because at the end of the day we're all wrestling with the same problems. As an extrovert I enjoy those forums and it's a good opportunity to get a sense of what's going on in their country, what they're wrestling with.\"\n\nTomorrow Luxon will be chairing the meeting of the Indo-Pacific Four with Nato - Australia, Korea, Japan and New Zealand, attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nLuxon said it was important New Zealand took a stand on Ukraine.\n\nNew Zealand has so far contributed about $130 million in support for Ukraine and Luxon said it would likely increase.\n\n\"We want to ensure the rules-based system is maintained. The reality is New Zealand has done exceptionally well since World War II because there has been peace and stability under that system. But that is under threat.\"\n\nHe said that was why there was a determination to stand up for those values.\n\n\"People say to me, 'you're so far away from Ukraine, why have you invested $130 million of Kiwi taxpayers dollars into that?' Because we believe in these principles, and if you believe in things you should do something about it.\"\n\nHe said they would continue to hold that conversation and look for opportunities to support Ukraine. He said there was confidence that Ukraine could win that, backed by Nato and other supporters.\n\n\"We have to win this. It's actually quite seminal and quite critical to our collective values that we all believe in. That's why we are here as part of the I-P 4.\"\n\nHe said there were also flashpoints in the Indo-Pacific and those raised similar concerns.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news",

Luxon arrives in Washington, spends time at Capitol Hill", "body": "Christopher Luxon has arrived in Washington DC for his first political visit to the United States where he will spend three days meeting with US and European leaders and attend the NATO summit.\n\nThe US capital is in high security mode and many of the streets are shut down as motorcades transporting European and Indo-Pacific prime ministers and presidents make their way through the city.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida are just some of the many big names in town this week.\n\nA perimeter of concrete and steel fencing has been erected several streets back from the White House, where a dinner for world leaders will be held along with other meetings this week.\n\nOn Wednesday morning NZT, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon spent several hours at Capitol Hill making his way around offices meeting with representatives from both the Republicans and the Democrats.\n\nHe was welcomed first by Republican representative Michael McCaul and Democrat representative Gregory Meeks, the chairperson and ranking member respectively of the House Foreign Relations committee.\n\nThe New Zealand media delegation was due to be at the Capitol for the meeting to capture photos and some remarks, but with traffic at a standstill across the city it was impossible to make it on time.\n\nThe prime minister and his staff are being fast-tracked across town in a motorcade.\n\nLuxon's second meeting of the day was with the chairperson of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Democrat representative Ben Cardin, and ranking member, Republican representative Jim Risch.\n\nLuxon marched into the meeting giving a thumbs-up to the media, saying \"it's going great\" in response to a question about how he was finding his first day in Washington.\n\nHe also sat down for an extended meeting and lunch with Democrat Senator for Georgia, Jon Ossoff.\n\nOssoff has served since 2021 and is currently on Senate committees for the judiciary, intelligence, and home security.\n\nOssoff met with former prime minister Jacinda Ardern in 2022 when she visited Capitol Hill ahead of a White House visit with President Joe Biden.\n\nOssoff and Ardern spent a lot of time discussing gun law reform as her visit coincided with the Texas elementary school shooting in Uvalde where 19 students and two teachers were killed.\n\nLater on Wednesday morning, Luxon will attend the NATO 75th anniversary commemorative dinner, which could be his first opportunity to meet Biden informally, though no plans have been confirmed.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title":

Trump presidency could mean for NZ", "body": "Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has remained tight-lipped on what a potential Donald Trump presidency could mean for New Zealand as he meets with US lawmakers in Washington DC.\n\nThe PM is currently in the US, where he had several meetings with senators and congresspeople on Capitol Hill before attending the 75th NATO Summit.\n\nHis visit comes at a tumultuous time for US politics, which is gearing up for a second election showdown between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nA disastrous TV debate saw Biden lose his train of thought and struggle to speak coherent sentences and has led many to see a second Trump presidency as a conceivable prospect.\n\nInternational relations expert Alexander Gillespie told 1News that a second Trump presidency could mean big changes for New Zealand's relationship with the US.\n\nHe said it would likely include increased pressure to join AUKUS, Trump's proposed 10% trade tariff, as well as if a Trump presidency would continue the same level of outreach in the Pacific as the Biden administration.\n\n\"Each and every one of those has a direct implication for us,\" he said.\n\nFollowing his meetings, Luxon was asked what a trade tariff under Trump could mean for New Zealand businesses.\n\nHe chose to remain tight-lipped, saying: \"I'm not gonna interfere with US domestic politics.\n\n\"That is ultimately a decision for the American people about their leadership and who represents them as president.\n\n\"My job is to make sure I can work to the very best of my ability with whoever is in power after November 5.\"\n\nHe was asked if he had seen the debate between Biden and Trump and if the 81-year-old would still be a candidate before the election; Luxon again said he was in the US to \"make sure I'm advancing New Zealand's national interests.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister was also asked if he would get a chance to meet with Biden while in the US.\n\nHe said that because the president was hosting so many leaders, \"We won't have a formal Oval Office meeting as such.\n\n\"I'm sure over the coming days, there will be a moment for us to catch up.\"\n\nLuxon met with leaders from across the aisles of Congress today with the goal of making new friends for the country and boosting New Zealand's presence at the Capitol.\n\nHe met with Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair, Democrat representative Ben Cardin, ranking member, Republican representative Jim Risch, and Democrat Senator for Georgia Jon Ossoff.\n\nHe said the discussions had mostly been about what's going on in the Pacific region.\n\n\"I think they've really appreciated the engagement,\" he said about the meetings.\n\n\"They've appreciated hearing what our new Government wants to achieve, particularly our stepped-up role within the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n\"It's been a good opportunity to actually make sure that they understand that New Zealand is a trusted partner.\n\n\"And part of it is making sure that in a big country like this, with a very large political system, you need to make sure that you've got multiple relationships across the system.\"\n\nHe said the \"quality\" of the visits today was a \"testament to the great work of our ambassadorial team and the standard that was held here in Washington, which is very, very good.\"\n\nLuxon said he has \"really enjoyed the stimulation\" of promoting NZ in the US, and as an \"American political junkie\", it's \"always cool to be in Washington DC\".\n\nHe is now gearing up for five bilateral meetings with other NATO leaders tomorrow before jetting off to San Francisco in California, where he will promote New Zealand business.", "source": {"uri": "1news.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title":

He said he had not been focused on it anyway.\n\n\"No, no that has not been our focus. We are here genuinely as guests of NATO and President Biden is hosting the whole of Nato here - obviously 32 countries plus the six others that are here as well - so that has not been a goal or objective of ours.\n\n\"I just put to you that we are actually here as guests of Nato, President Biden is hosting Nato here in DC and we have been invited as one of the IP4 along with Japan, Korea, Australia and ourselves to be here as well.\"\n\nThe US Presidential election had also not been a focus of his conversations, he said.\n\n\"Our focus has been around making sure we talk about issues that are common interest between the US and New Zealand, a lot of it about the rules-based system and making sure that our alignment on our values, and the joint programmes of work that we have.\"\n\nHe said whether Biden would continue as a candidate in the US election was a matter for the American people.\n\n\"My job as prime minister is to make sure that I can work with whoever the people of America select as their president.\n\n\"But this is not a bilateral visit here, this is about us using the opportunity to build a bilateral relationship and deepen that across a number of different leaders across the US system, doing the same obviously seeing a number of European leaders in one place.\"\n\nHe said he would confirm official meetings with leaders tomorrow.\n\nIn the meantime, Luxon spent several hours meeting with Senators and Congress members on Wednesday morning (local time), discussing what he said were \"consistent themes\".\n\n\"Issues within the Indo-Pacific region, global themes particularly with NATO in mind - the reason we're here this week - and it was a good chance for us to talk about the Ukraine.\n\n\"I've really enjoyed the stimulation of getting in the room with senators and congresspeople who are actually really deeply thinking about these issues.\"\n\nHe has announced a further $16 million in support for Ukraine, bringing New Zealand's total contribution to more than $130m.\n\nGiven New Zealand's distance from Ukraine and the stance alongside that country from day one of Russia's invasion, showed New Zealand had made a \"really valuable contribution that is appreciated by Ukraine,\" Luxon said, and the government would continue to monitor and assess whether more support was needed.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's meeting with India's recently re-elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi stands as something of a counterpoint to Biden's NATO meeting.\n\nModi said every Indian \"considers Russia to be India's friend in good and bad times\".\n\nDuring the election campaign last year, Luxon promised to secure a free trade deal with India and work towards a deeper relationship with the country.\n\n\"India has its own national interests that it obviously advances, I'm here to advance New Zealand's national interests,\" he said when questioned about the Putin-Modi meeting.\n\n\"For us it is about making sure that we actually can deepen and build a relationship with India, it doesn't mean that we agree with every country we have trading relationships with .... and it's the same here.\n\n\"India's had a long-standing to Russia, clearly I think, you know, when you've seen President Putin in that illegal war in Ukraine, and we've seen damage done to a hospital today with Ukrainian school children in it, it's not great.\"\n\nPrompted by journalists, Luxon refused to get involved in the Darleen Tana situation.\n\n\"Those are issues for the Green Party, every party handles its personnel issues differently and it's been certainly a long time coming for whatever, um, but, I appreciate that's an issue for the Greens,\" he said.\n\nTana was elected to Parliament on the Green Party list but has faced accusations relating to her husband's e-bike company of worker exploitation, including of migrants.\n\nThe Greens commissioned an independent investigation in March after those accusations came to light, and voted to eject Tana after the final report was delivered this weekend.\n\nHowever, Tana chose to quit the party first and is now able to remain an independent MP with a full salary and voting rights until the next election unless the party chooses to use the party-hopping law it has opposed as a matter of principle.\n\nLuxon - questioned on whether Tana should be able to remain - said it was still a matter for the Greens and the Speaker to sort out.\n\n\"It's not someone in my party, right? And I've managed my personnel issues as you've seen, over the last three years and I'll continue to do so. I just have been amazed at how long it has taken to get to this resolution, and so those are obviously issues for the Green Party, they're obviously issues for the Speaker and Parliament.\"",

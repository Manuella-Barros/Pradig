Vijayan, at a press conference here, said Modi's visit to Wayanad on Saturday comes amidst the state government's request to treat the landslides as a 'national or severe disaster'.\n\nHe further said that following the state's request, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has appointed a nine-member committee to examine the severity of the disaster and submit a report in this regard.\n\nVijayan said that the state hopes to receive a comprehensive rehabilitation package and, so far, the Central government has been very cooperative and helpful.\n\n\"Considering the seriousness of the disaster, it is hoped that assistance will be available from the Central government to help the families of the disaster victims and for the rehabilitation and township projects.\n\n\"It is hoped that there will be a favourable decision from Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard. We have already written to him on the issue and thanked him for the help and support provided till now,\" the CM said.\n\nVijayan, during the press conference, also said that the exact number of people who died in the landslides can be confirmed only after the DNA test results of the body parts and unidentified bodies are received.\n\nHe said that remains are only considered a full body if 90 per cent or more of the body parts are recovered. Otherwise, it is considered as a body part only, he added.\n\nTherefore, it is scientifically incorrect to count the number of body parts recovered as the number of dead, the CM said and added that the search operations are not complete. Currently, 131 people are missing, he further said.\n\nFrom Friday onwards, survivors living in relief camps and homes of their relatives will also take part in the search operations in the disaster-hit Mundakkai and Chooralmala areas, which have been divided into six zones, the CM said.\n\nThese people are being made part of the search operations as a \"last ditch effort\" to find people who are still missing as all other possible means have been exhausted, Vijayan said.\n\nIn his press conference, he also referred to the donations flowing into the Chief Minister's Disaster Relief Fund (CMDRF) from various quarters and thanked all who have contributed to the fund.\n\nThe landslides that hit various hilly areas of Wayanad on July 30 have claimed hundreds of lives till now.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinarayi_Vijayan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinarayi Vijayan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayanad_district", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Township", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Township"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112380896,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-449564,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801071", "eventUri": "eng-9801071", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 129, "textEnd": 138, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 2930, "textEnd": 2937}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Mr Modi would also conduct an aerial survey of the disaster area. He would arrive at Kannur airport by a special flight and fly in an IAF helicopter to Wayanad.\n\nMr Modi met the survivors and the injured before leaving for New Delhi at 4pm the same day.\n\nThe Kerala Cabinet subcommittee overseeing the Wayanad disaster response and the district administration are said to welcome Mr Modi.\n\nOn Thursday, August 8, an advance team of the Special Protection Group (SPG) reached Wayanad and scouted for a safe landing zone for Mr Modi's helicopter. The Kerala Police worked closely with the SPG to streamline the Prime Minister's visit.\n\nMr Modi's visit is crucial for the rehabilitation of the people devastated by the landslides. The ruling party and the opposition had demanded the central government to declare the July 30 landfall that levelled the towns of Chooralmala, Mundakkai and Attamala as a national disaster.\n\nSuch a declaration would potentially open the door to the inflow of huge central funds into Kerala. Opposition leader VD Satheesan had demanded that the scale of the disaster warrant at least an L3 categorisation.\n\nKerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the scale of the disaster was unparalleled in the country in recent times. He hoped that the central government would declare the Wayanad landslide as a natural disaster.\n\nHowever, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in Kerala have not given any response. Union Minister of State for Tourism and BJP MP from Thrissur Lok Sabha constituency Suresh Gopi said the Centre was assessing the legality of Kerala's demand. He said the Centre had to consider various parameters before committing to such a statement. Mr Gopi also said the Centre had sought a report from the state.\n\nUnion Minister of State for Fisheries George Kurian said he visited the disaster-hit area and interacted with the district administration and the Cabinet sub-committee before submitting a report to Mr Modi.\n\nMr Modi's visit also comes amid what is likely to be a tense political climate.\n\nOn the one hand, Union Minister for Forests, Environment and Climate Change Bhupendra Yadav's accusation that the Kerala government had prepared the ground for the July 30 disaster by encouraging illegal habitation and mining in the forest locality had become a sore point between the Centre and the state ahead of Mr Modi's visit.\n\nEarlier, the Centre had pinned the blame for the disaster on the Kerala government, saying the provincial administration had ignored weather warnings of heavy rains that could trigger landslides in Wayanad in the days leading up to July 30.\n\nHome Minister Amit Shah told the Lok Sabha that the Kerala government should have taken a leaf out of the book by arriving nine teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) a week before the disaster struck Wayanad on July 30.\n\nThe damning statements by Mr Shah and Mr Yadav drew a sharp reaction from Mr Vijayan. He said the Centre's weather warnings were far from accurate. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted normal rainfall for Wayanad in the days leading up to the disaster.\n\nMr Vijayan said the Central Water Commission (CWC) and the Geological Survey of India (GSI) saw no reason to sound alarm about flood or landslide, respectively.\n\nIn view of the strengthening monsoon, Mr Vijayan said the state government had requisitioned the services of the NDRF.\n\nHe strongly urged the Centre to modernize weather forecasting models and methods so that the provincial government can take preventive measures to mitigate loss of life and property.\n\nMr Vijayan hit back at Mr Yadav, accusing the Union minister of denigrating the affected people, including the dead and missing, by calling them illegal occupants.\n\nHe pointed out that the nearest granite quarry was about 10.5 km from the disaster area. Moreover, the razed villages were not in a risk zone. The source of the massive landslide was 6.5 km from the devastated villages.\n\nUnusually heavy rainfall caused the distant hill to collapse and wash away villages into the nearby Iruvanipuzha River.\n\nMr Vijayan called the landslide victims \"sons of the country\" who had braved great odds to forge a life in a harsh and remote environment.\n\nHe said Mr Yadav had no idea about the tradition, culture and sacrifices of farmers and plantation workers of Kerala, which is over 100 years old. Mr Vijayan said Mr Yadav had denigrated a people reeling from the catastrophic landslide.\n\nThe INDIA bloc also moved a breach of privilege motion in the Rajya Sabha against Mr Shah and Mr Yadav.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Protection_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Special Protection Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayanad_district", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannur_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kannur International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kerala Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suresh_Gopi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suresh Gopi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bailey bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Kerala", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Kerala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrissur_Lok_Sabha_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thrissur Lok Sabha constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._M._Vijayan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "I.

It warranted an apt response from the Central government.\n\nLeader of the Opposition V.D.

He said the Centre had yet to provide the State with significant financial assistance.\n\nHe urged the Centre to modernise its weather forecast and warning systems to pre-empt largescale loss of life and property.\n\nMr. Vijayan said the Centre had dispatched an inter-ministerial team to assess the severity of the Wayanad landslides and their long-term economic, ecological, and social fallout.\n\nHe said the lead officer, Union Home Department joint secretary Rajiv Kumar, had called on him at his office in the Secretariat.\n\nMr Vijayan said he had written to Mr. Modi about the disaster and what Wayanad required in its aftermath. \"The Central government has responded empathetically to the State's needs.

We have already written to him on the issue and thanked him for the help and support provided till now,\" the CM said.\n\nVijayan, during the press conference, also said that the exact number of people who died in the landslides can be confirmed only after the DNA test results of the body parts and unidentified bodies are received.\n\nHe said that remains are only considered a full body if 90 per cent or more of the body parts are recovered. Otherwise, it is considered as a body part only, he added.\n\nTherefore, it is scientifically incorrect to count the number of body parts recovered as the number of dead, the CM said and added that the search operations are not complete. Currently, 131 people are missing, he further said.\n\nFrom Friday onwards, survivors living in relief camps and homes of their relatives will also take part in the search operations in the disaster-hit Mundakkai and Chooralmala areas, which have been divided into six zones, the CM said.\n\nThese people are being made part of the search operations as a \"last ditch effort\" to find people who are still missing as all other possible means have been exhausted, Vijayan said.\n\nIn his press conference, he also referred to the donations flowing into the Chief Minister's Disaster Relief Fund (CMDRF) from various quarters and thanked all who have contributed to the fund.\n\nThe landslides that hit various hilly areas of Wayanad on July 30 have claimed hundreds of lives till now.

He respected the spirit of volunteerism displayed by various organisations in crisis times. However, he requested that voluntary organisations not render Wayanad a dumping zone for surplus goods, especially clothes.\n\nUsed, discarded clothes\n\n\"We had to dispose of seven tonnes of used and discarded clothes collected by voluntary organisations and dispatched to Wayanad. The need of the hour is financial assistance and not material help,\" said Mr. Vijayan.\n\nMr. Vijayan said Suchitwa Mission volunteers were instrumental in ridding the disaster zone and relief camps of waste, including untreated sewage and non-biodegradable refuse.

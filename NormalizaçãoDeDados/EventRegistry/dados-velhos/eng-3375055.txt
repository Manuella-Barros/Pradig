He dropped to 1-9 with a 6.98 ERA in 13 starts at SunTrust Park.\n\nGennett's 21st homer, his third grand slam this season and fourth of career, made it 11-4 in the ninth. The Braves scored four runs in the bottom half, but Michael Lorenzen, the second Cincinnati pitcher of the inning, earned his second save after Blake Wood failed to retire a batter and allowed the four runs.\n\nRobert Stephenson (1-4) gave up three hits, three walks and two runs -- one earned -- in five innings. He struck out five, but had some struggles, dropping a ball at first base, hitting a batter and throwing a bunt attempt into the Atlanta dugout.\n\nCincinnati took a 4-1 lead in the fourth on singles by Eugenio Suarez and Scott Schebler. Braves center fielder Ender Inciarte overran Suarez's hit and the ball got past him for a two-base error that scored another run.\n\nSchebler went 3 for 4. Billy Hamilton and Joey Votto each added an RBI.\n\nTeheran (7-11) allowed eight hits, three walks and five runs -- four earned. He struck out seven and has dropped five straight decisions overall.\n\nThe Braves scored on Brandon Phillips' 11th homer, Inciarte's sacrifice fly, Kurt Suzuki's 13th homer and Matt Adams' three-run, pinch-hit homer in the ninth.\n\nTeheran topped the Atlanta mark held by Craig McMurtry in 1984 and tied by Shelby Miller in 2015. The Braves dropped to 9-22 since reaching .500 on July 16.\n\nGOOD MOVES\n\nPhillips fielded a grounder barehanded on the third-base line and Freddie Freeman dug out his throw on a nice play by corner infielders in the sixth. ... Reds LF Adam Duvall robbed Matt Kemp of a hit, running forward to make a diving catch in the third. ... Braves RF Nick Markakis stretched out to catch Hamilton's liner against the grass in the sixth.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nReds: SS Zack Cozart is limping considerably after getting hit in the leg with a pitch Friday and leaving the game early. Manager Bryan Price indicated that Cozart is likely to avoid the disabled list and could return to the lineup Tuesday against the Cubs. Cozart has been on the DL twice this year with strained right quad.\n\nBraves: Kemp was reinstated from the disabled list and went 1 for 5. ... LHP Luke Jackson was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a right shoulder strain. RHP Matt Wisler was called up to take his spot.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nReds: RHP Luis Castillo (2-5, 3.39 ERA) will make his 12th career start and face the Braves for the first time. He pitched six scoreless innings of a no-decision last Tuesday against the Cubs.\n\nBraves: LHP Sean Newcomb (1-7, 4.45 ERA) will make his 13th career start and face Cincinnati for the first time.

He dropped to 1-9 with a 6.98 ERA in 13 starts at SunTrust Park.\n\nGennett's 21st homer, his third grand slam this season and fourth of career, made it 11-4 in the ninth.

He struck out five, but had some struggles, dropping a ball at first base, hitting a batter and throwing a bunt attempt into the Atlanta dugout.\n\nSponsored Content: Sign up for a free webinar as DoD, Air Force and VA offer insights on cybersecurity strategies.\n\nCincinnati took a 4-1 lead in the fourth on singles by Eugenio Suarez and Scott Schebler.

Billy Hamilton and Joey Votto each added an RBI.\n\nTeheran (7-11) allowed eight hits, three walks and five runs -- four earned. He struck out seven and has dropped five straight decisions overall.\n\nThe Braves scored on Brandon Phillips' 11th homer, Inciarte's sacrifice fly, Kurt Suzuki's 13th homer and Matt Adams' three-run, pinch-hit homer in the ninth.\n\nTeheran topped the Atlanta mark held by Craig McMurtry in 1984 and tied by Shelby Miller in 2015.

We're all human. We all make mistakes.\"\n\nScooter Gennett hit a grand slam, Robert Stephenson won for the first time in eight decisions and the Cincinnati Reds beat the Braves 11-8 on Saturday night.\n\nTeheran, expected to be the Braves' ace for a fifth straight year, set an Atlanta record by losing his ninth straight home decision. He dropped to 1-9 with a 6.98 ERA in 13 starts at SunTrust Park.\n\n\"I think it's part of baseball,\" he said \"Every time I get the ball I try to win. I haven't won since the first game but it's not like I'm going to worry about it. I'm just trying to get better.\"\n\nGennett's 21st homer, his third grand slam this season and fourth of his career, made it 11-4 in the ninth. The Braves scored four runs in the bottom half, but Michael Lorenzen, the second Cincinnati pitcher of the inning, earned his second save after Blake Wood failed to retire a batter and allowed the four runs.\n\nStephenson (1-4) gave up three hits, three walks and two runs -- one earned -- in five innings. Winning for the first time since April 2016, the converted reliever struck out five but had some struggles, dropping a ball at first base, hitting a batter with a pitch and throwing a bunt attempt into the Atlanta dugout.\n\n\"It's nice to see something other than a zero up there,\" Stephenson said of his record.\n\nGennett joined Frank Robinson, Lee May, Ray Knight, Eric Davis, Chris Sabo and Devin Mesoraco as the only Reds to hit three grand slams in a season.\n\n\"I don't think anybody could have expected this,\" Reds manager Bryan Price said. \"The numbers speak for themselves.\"\n\nGennett loves the pressure of getting a chance to hit with the bases loaded.\n\n\"It's not like I'm trying to hit homers, but you want to come through,\" he said. \"To get some more runs there was huge, especially the way the game ended up.\"\n\nCincinnati took a 4-1 lead in the fourth on singles by Eugenio Suarez and Scott Schebler. Braves center fielder Ender Inciarte overran Suarez's hit and the ball got past him for a two-base error that scored another run.\n\nSchebler went 3 for 4. Billy Hamilton and Joey Votto each added an RBI.\n\nTeheran (7-11) allowed eight hits, three walks and five runs -- four earned. He struck out seven and has dropped five straight decisions overall.\n\nThe Braves scored on Brandon Phillips' 11th homer, Inciarte's sacrifice fly, Kurt Suzuki's 13th homer and Matt Adams' three-run, pinch-hit homer in the ninth.\n\nTeheran topped the Atlanta mark held by Craig McMurtry in 1984 and tied by Shelby Miller in 2015.\n\nPhillips fielded a grounder barehanded on the third-base line and Freddie Freeman dug out his throw on a nice play by corner infielders in the sixth. ... Reds LF Adam Duvall robbed Matt Kemp of a hit, running forward to make a diving catch in the third. ... Braves RF Nick Markakis stretched out to catch Hamilton's liner against the grass in the sixth.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nReds: SS Zack Cozart is limping considerably after getting hit in the leg with a pitch Friday and leaving the game early. Manager Bryan Price indicated that Cozart is likely to avoid the disabled list and could return to the lineup Tuesday against the Cubs. Cozart has been on the DL twice this year with strained right quad.\n\nBraves: Kemp was reinstated from the disabled list and went 1 for 5. He grounded into a fielder's choice to end the game. ... LHP Luke Jackson was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a right shoulder strain. RHP Matt Wisler was called up to take his spot.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nReds: RHP Luis Castillo (2-5, 3.39 ERA) will make his 12th career start and face the Braves for the first time. He pitched six scoreless innings of a no-decision last Tuesday against the Cubs.\n\nBraves: LHP Sean Newcomb (1-7, 4.45 ERA) will make his 13th career start and face Cincinnati for the first time. Since starting his career 1-2 with a 1.48 ERA in four starts, Newcomb has given up 28 earned runs and 29 walks in his last 40 1/3 innings.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:05:00Z", "extractedDates":

The final pitch was 96 mph, not the hardest pitch he threw of the night, but hard enough. It was only his third strikeout, but Romano had just completed the best start of his young career, allowing just one run in a career-high seven innings as the Reds beat the Braves 5-3.\n\n\"Tucker (Barnhart) wanted to go fastball in and I threw that come-back two-seam that I've worked on since spring training,\" Romano said. \"It worked out.\"\n\nMORE: Reds Recap: Romano gets it done\n\nRomano gave up seven runs (six earned) in his last start, a loss to the Brewers in Milwaukee last Sunday. After that start, he sounded not defeated, but encouraged. He talked about finding his changeup, figuring things out. It was easy to scoff -- and many did -- about the response to his third straight loss in August, but it did mean something to Romano.\n\nAt just 23, each outing is new for Romano. The Reds have lost six of his first eight starts, but there has been some progress, even if it takes more than a glance at the box score to see it.\n\nHe saw it against the Brewers, and more importantly, he felt it. He believed it.\n\nMORE: Kris Bryant: Joey Votto is 'the best player ever'\n\n\"The one challenge is, do you trust your stuff and believe it's good enough to get these hitters out?,\" Reds manager Bryan Price said of the difficulty of rookies finding their way at the big-league level. \"Name recognition, I think, plays a lot in this game. Realizing who you are pitching against, guys that are really credible in this game, established, good, players. You have to trust your stuff and let it play out and see what you can learn through the process.\"\n\nRomano said he's not just learning every start, but every day. He's throwing two bullpens between starts with pitching coach Mack Jenkins and bullpen coach Ted Power. The double-time work is less about velocity than it is command.\n\nFriday night, he averaged 95 mph on his four-seam fastball, but it was where he was throwing it, down in the zone, that translated into results. The Braves' lone run came on a second inning homer by Reds killer Matt Adams, who launched his fourth homer of the season against the Reds and 15th of his career.\n\nBesides that? Romano didn't allow another runner to touch third.\n\nBefore every pitch, he'd take a deep breath and try to throw it where Barnhart placed his mitt.\n\nRomano threw 16 changeups and 19 sliders in his 102 pitches. He talked about his confidence in his fastball after his start against the Brewers and it carried over against the Braves. He still had that big fastball, but that wasn't it. There was more there, more pitching than throwing -- until the last pitch, at least.\n\n\"Almost every pitcher comes up very proud of their fastball. That's typically what gets them noticed as an amateur player, body type, arm strength, things of that nature,\" Price said. \"You get up here and there are so many pitches that are getting hit that are in the mid-to-upper-90s, 100, that are getting squared up and put in play hard. His ability to focus more on command, movement, change of speed, as opposed to the muscling of the baseball is going to serve him well.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T04:29:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.3725490272045135, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375055", "time": "04:29:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375055", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "303571", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 3}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "305023", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "score": 5}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 2}, {"id": "305799", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "score": 3}, {"id": "305865", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "score": 2}, {"id": "307683", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "310293", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310507", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "score": 4}, {"id": "310537", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "score": 3}, {"id": "310539", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "score": 3}, {"id": "310548", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "score": 5}, {"id": "310551", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "score": 5}, {"id": "310663", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kris Bryant"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Bryant", "score": 2}, {"id": "314176", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "score": 3}, {"id": "314182", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "319498", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "score": 5}, {"id": "340434", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Coach (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "356285", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Four-seam fastball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-seam_fastball", "score": 2}, {"id": "380021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Two-seam fastball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-seam_fastball", "score": 4}, {"id": "383510", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Joey Votto"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Votto", "score": 2}, {"id": "386847", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bryan Price"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Price", "score": 2}, {"id": "408012", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of Mad Men characters"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mad_Men_characters", "score": 4}, {"id": "504133", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Matt Adams"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Adams", "score": 2}, {"id": "626974", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ted Power"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Power", "score": 2}, {"id": "1277495", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Micah Johnson (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Johnson_(baseball)", "score": 3}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "timeCrawl": "04:29:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Sal Romano believing in his progress", "originalArticle": null}

Lakers star LeBron James added seven points, five rebounds, three assists and three steals in 19 minutes that included a dunk off a lob pass from Curry.\n\nRJ Barrett scored 12 points for Canada, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dillon Brooks each had 10.\n\nPresident Barack Obama was at the game, as were many NBA coaches and dozens of USA Basketball dignitaries in town for the federation's 50th anniversary celebration. Among them: Jerry Colangelo, Mike Krzyzewski, Jim Boeheim, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Dawn Staley, Lisa Leslie, Teresa Edwards, Swin Cash, Lindsay Whalen and many more.\n\nThe total attendance was 20,757, a record for any game at T-Mobile Arena, USA Basketball said.\n\nThe U.S. was down 11-1 midway through the first quarter, having missed its first six shot attempts. The rest of the half: U.S. 40, Canada 22, and the Americans shot 18 for 28 - 64.3% - in that span. The lead was 41-33 at the break and the Americans stretched it to 69-54 going into the fourth.\n\nIt was easy to see where the Americans, who have been together for less than a week, still are figuring things out; there were at least four occasions where simple passes ended up in the first row of seats because someone thought a zig was coming instead of a zag.\n\n\"Good first game for us,\" U.S. coach Steve Kerr said. \"We are just starting with four days of practice. You could see the rust on us offensively early. We had a lot of turnovers in the first half. I loved the defensive intensity, and the work on the glass. It was a good first effort on how we want to establish to play moving forward.\"\n\nThe second unit for the U.S. - Davis, Bam Adebayo, Edwards, Tyrese Haliburton and Jayson Tatum - was particularly impressive. Each of those five players had a plus-minus of plus-10 or better, meaning the U.S. outscored Canada by at least 10 points with them on the floor.\n\nAnd that's as it should be. Only the Americans can trot out a lineup of \"bench players\" at the Olympics, all of them being All-Stars. That fivesome has 21 combined All-Star nods, two NBA champions in Davis and Tatum, and two perennial All-Defense players in Davis and Adebayo. It's clearly not a typical second unit.\n\n\"They were great,\" Kerr said of the second unit. \"The slow start wasn't surprising. I loved the second group and the defense picking up the pace for us in transition. They made a couple plays defensively that jump-started our offense that got us into the game.\"\n\nOh, and remember: The U.S. didn't have Kevin Durant (calf strain) and Derrick White (not yet with the team) available Wednesday.\n\nThe first starting lineup of the summer rolled out by Kerr: Joel Embiid, Devin Booker, Curry, James and Holiday.\n\nIt certainly could change going forward. But if last year is any indication, it's a clear view into Kerr's thinking right now.\n\nKerr has cautioned in the past about not reading too much into lineups, especially from the first scrimmage. That said, the first five he had in the first exhibition game last summer going into the World Cup - Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson, Jaren Jackson Jr., Brandon Ingram and Edwards - were the starters in the tournament opener against New Zealand.\n\nThe U.S. plays Australia in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange

Grant Hill responds to \"theories\"", "body": "LAS VEGAS -- Team USA executive director Grant Hill denied speculation that NBA Finals MVP Jaylen Brown was left off of the Olympic team because of the Celtics star's past criticism of Nike.\n\nBrown's teammate Derrick White was named to Team USA on Wednesday as a replacement for Kawhi Leonard.\n\nMany were surprised that Brown was not selected for the roster opening, apparently including Brown himself. He first shared a cryptic post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Brown later tagged Nike and said \"this what we doing ?\"\n\nWhen Nike's founder was critical of Kyrie Irving in 2022, Brown commented \"Since when did Nike care about ethics?\" In the past, Brown has worn Nike sneakers at times, but on Christmas Day did so without the iconic swoosh.\n\nSome in the basketball world speculated that was why Brown was left off Team USA. Following the team's first exhibition game Wednesday night, Hill said that was not the case.\n\n\"You get 12 spots, and you have to build a team,\" Hill said. \"And one of the hardest things is leaving people off the roster that I'm a fan of that I look forward to watching throughout the season, throughout the playoffs. Guys who've been Finals MVPs, guys who've been a part of the program, guys who've won gold medals, guys who I respect, admire and enjoy watching. But the responsibility that I have is to put together a team and a team that complements each other, a team that fits a team that will give us the best opportunity for success,\" Hill told reporters, via ESPN. \"And, so, whatever theories that might be out there, they're just that. But that's my responsibility. And it's tough. It's tough to have conversations, tell people that they're not on the team.\"\n\nHill joked that he wore FILA for much of his career but was still an Olympian himself. He said decisions were made with one thing in mind - winning a gold medal.\n\n\"I'm trying to win and I'm trying to put together the right pieces that fit and give us a chance to win,\" Hill said.\n\nOn the court, the road to the Paris Olympics started with a win for USA Basketball.\n\nAnthony Davis scored 13 points, Stephen Curry added 12 and the United States opened its tune-up schedule for the Paris Games by topping Canada 86-72 on Wednesday night.\n\nJrue Holiday of the Celtics scored 11 points and Anthony Davis finished with 10 for the U.S., which has four more exhibitions before getting to France.\n\nRJ Barrett scored 12 points for Canada, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dillon Brooks each had 10.\n\nPresident Barack Obama was at the game, as were many NBA coaches and dozens of USA Basketball dignitaries in town for the federation's 50th anniversary celebration. Among them: Jerry Colangelo, Mike Krzyzewski, Jim Boeheim, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Dawn Staley, Lisa Leslie, Teresa Edwards, Swin Cash, Lindsay Whalen and many more.\n\nAnd the total attendance was 20,757, a record for any game at T-Mobile Arena, USA Basketball said.\n\nThe U.S. was down 11-1 midway through the first quarter, having missed its first six shot attempts. The rest of the half: U.S. 40, Canada 22, and the Americans shot 18 for 28 -- 64.3% -- in that span. The lead was 41-33 at the break and the Americans stretched it to 69-54 going into the fourth.\n\nIt was easy to see where the Americans, who have been together for less than a week, still are figuring things out; there were at least four occasions where simple passes ended up in the first row of seats because someone thought a zig was coming instead of a zag.\n\nThe second unit for the U.S. -- Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Anthony Edwards, Tyrese Haliburton and Jayson Tatum -- was particularly impressive. Each of those five players had a plus-minus of plus-10 or better, meaning the U.S. outscored Canada by at least 10 points with them on the floor.\n\nAnd that's as it should be. Only the Americans can trot out a lineup of \"bench players\" at the Olympics, all of them being All-Stars. That fivesome has 21 combined All-Star nods, two NBA champions in Davis and Tatum, and two perennial All-Defense players in Davis and Adebayo. It's clearly not a typical second unit.\n\nOh, and remember: The U.S. didn't have Kevin Durant (calf strain) and Derrick White (not yet with the team) available Wednesday.\n\nThe first starting lineup of the summer rolled out by U.S. coach Steve Kerr: Stephen Curry, Jrue Holiday, Devin Booker, LeBron James and Joel Embiid.\n\nIt certainly could change going forward. But if last year is any indication, it's a clear view into Kerr's thinking right now.\n\nKerr has cautioned in the past about not reading too much into lineups, especially from the first scrimmage. That said, the first five he had in the first exhibition game last summer going into the World Cup -- Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson, Jaren Jackson Jr., Brandon Ingram and Anthony Edwards -- were the starters in the tournament opener against New Zealand.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Still, Canada's Olympics team features many of the players who were on the team that beat the U.S. in last year's FIBA World Cup bronze-medal game.\n\nIt was a solid start to the U.S. exhibition schedule which includes games against Australia, Serbia, South Sudan and Germany.\n\n\"You kind of can't go wrong picking a starting lineup with this group, and I think I told you guys the other day, I'm going to do something different the next two games,\" Kerr said. \"We're going to just look at a few different combinations before we settle on anything.\"\n\nYou will hear over and over how the rest of the world has caught up with the U.S. in basketball. And individually, there's a case to be made with three players born outside of the U.S. winning the past six regular-season MVPs.\n\nHowever, when the U.S. assembles its best players, it is the favorite to win gold as it has in the past four Olympics. No other country can match the U.S. depth. Serbia has three-time MVP Nikola Jokic and Greece has two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, but no country has what the U.S. has talent-wise (player one through player 12) for this Olympics.\n\nAfter the U.S. fell behind early, including 11-1, the second five eliminated that deficit and helped build a 28-23 lead. The U.S. led the rest of the game.\n\n\"I love the second group and the defense picking up the pace for us in transition,\" Kerr said. \"They made a few good plays there defensively to really kind of jump-start our offense and that got us into the game.\"\n\nJames, Embiid and Curry were outscored when on the court, but the U.S. bench outscored Canada's 42-27.\n\n\"You get this collection of guys together and it is a test and it's a challenge to try to figure out - just the chemistry, just the flow and the rhythm, especially on offense because there's a temptation to defer,\" Curry said. \"There's a temptation to overthink every possession because everybody can make a play and when you have an advantage, you just try to keep the game as simple as possible.\n\n\"That first unit, we struggled with that, but then once we got settled in, it seemed like everybody got a little bit more comfortable as we got deeper into the game and hopefully the next four exhibition games we have to see more progress.\"\n\nUS uses size advantage vs. Canada\n\nWhen the U.S. failed to medal at the FIBA World Cup last year, its lack of size at the center and power forward spots were exposed.\n\nThat's not the case this year with Embiid, Davis and Adebayo. The final rebounding total (53-48) was not indicative of how the U.S. controlled that category - it had a 39-23 edge headed into the fourth quarter. Davis was dominant on the glass, and James, Embiid and Holiday each had at least five rebounds. Nine blocked shots gave the U.S. rim protection that was missing last year, and the U.S. outscored Canada 50-32 in points in the paint.\n\nStrengthening the interior play was a focal point when building the roster, and it was addressed. Now, Canada isn't big so let's see how the U.S. handles a team with size, like Serbia and Germany in exhibition games.\n\nUS defense stifles Canada\n\nThe U.S. has scorers. Putting up enough points shouldn't be an issue. But defensive-minded U.S. assistant coach Ty Lue wants intense pressure on the opponent's offene. There are multiple All-Defensive players on the roster, and with Derrick White replacing Kawhi Leonard, the U.S. is adding another.\n\nThe U.S. held Canada to 33.8% shooting from the field and 21.2% on 3-pointers, had 11 steals and Davis blocked four shots.\n\nHaliburton had four steals and James had three, and those Canada turnovers helped the U.S. own a 16-2 edge in fastbreak points. The U.S. held MVP runner-up Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to 10 points on 3-for-10 shooting and Jamal Murray to five points on 2-for-8 shooting.\n\n\"One of the keys to the game was just the collective ball pressure that our guys had out there, and Jrue obviously leads the way in that regard,\" Kerr said. \"But if we can get all of our guys pressuring the ball, we've got big guys behind the play who can clean things up and it should be a good combination for our defense.\"\n\nUSA Basketball injury updates\n\nThe U.S. was down to 10 Olympians - Kevin Durant sat out with a sore calf, and White wasn't available. He will join the team in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\"He has been working (and) rehabbing,\" U.S. men's national team managing director Grant Hill said of Durant. \"He's looked great. I think we're just being cautious and conservative and I think we expect to see him on the court when we're in Abu Dhabi.\"\n\nAfter watching Leonard practice Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, USA Basketball team staffers, led by Hill and in consultation with the Los Angeles Clippers, decided it was best to go in another direction. Leonard missed games at the end of the regular season and playoffs with right knee inflammation. Even though Leonard told reporters he was good to go, USA Basketball had reason to believe he wasn't ready for the Olympics.\n\n\"Kawhi gave it everything he had when he was preparing and those last three days of camp,\" Curry said. \"Obviously they're tough decisions and I know he wanted to play, but it's one of those things where he wished us luck and he wanted us to go get the gold.\n\n\"And you love that kind of support from a guy that's in a tough situation like that, but hopefully for the long term he's in a good place because the game needs him and when he's not out there, you miss an all-time great player. So we hope that he's ready for this season.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The U.S. opens Olympic play July 28 against Serbia.\n\nIt was a good start to the exhibition schedule for the U.S. considering its roster has practiced together just four times and given Canada's potential to medal.\n\nU.S. coach Steve Kerr started James, Curry, Holiday, Devin Booker and Joel Embiid, and the Americans fell behind 11-1.\n\nBut the luxury Kerr has that no other team has is his next five were Anthony Edwards, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo, Davis and Tyrese Haliburton. They helped jump-start a 14-3 run for a 28-23 U.S. lead.\n\nThe U.S. owned a 41-33 halftime lead and opened a 50-37 advantage on nine consecutive points, including two 3-pointers, by Curry. Edwards' buzzer-beating 3 at the end of the third quarter put the U.S. ahead 69-54.\n\nThe Americans' much-needed size and defense were on display. They outrebounded Canada 53-48, blocked nine shots and held Canada to 33.8% shooting. The U.S. shot 50.7% from the field despite making just 7-of 23 3-pointers.\n\n\"It's a good first game for us,\" Kerr said. \"We're really just getting started - four days of practice. You could see the rust on the offensive end (and) a lot of turnovers in that first half especially. But I love the defensive intensity and the work on the glass.\n\n\"So, it was a good first effort, and we needed to set a tone for how we want to play and I think we did that.\"\n\nThe U.S. was down to 10 players. Kevin Durant missed the game with a sore calf, and the U.S. replaced Kawhi Leonard with Derrick White, who will join the team in Abu Dhabi.\n\nBarrett led Canada with 12 points, and Dillon Brooks and

Still, Canada's Olympics team features many of the players who were on the team that beat the U.S. in last year's FIBA World Cup bronze-medal game.\n\nIt was a solid start to the U.S. exhibition schedule which includes games against Australia, Serbia, South Sudan and Germany.\n\n\"You kind of can't go wrong picking a starting lineup with this group, and I think I told you guys the other day, I'm going to do something different the next two games,\" Kerr said. \"We're going to just look at a few different combinations before we settle on anything.\"\n\nBreaking down the U.S. victory over Canada:\n\nYou will hear over and over how the rest of the world has caught up with the U.S. in basketball. And individually, there's a case to be made with three players born outside of the U.S. winning the past six regular-season MVPs.\n\nHowever, when the U.S. assembles its best players, it is the favorite to win gold as it has in the past four Olympics. No other country can match the U.S. depth. Serbia has three-time MVP Nikola Jokic and Greece has two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, but no country has what the U.S. has talent-wise (player one through player 12) for this Olympics.\n\nAfter the U.S. fell behind early, including 11-1, the second five eliminated that deficit and helped build a 28-23 lead. The U.S. led the rest of the game.\n\n\"I love the second group and the defense picking up the pace for us in transition,\" Kerr said. \"They made a few good plays there defensively to really kind of jump-start our offense and that got us into the game.\"\n\nJames, Embiid and Curry were outscored when on the court, but the U.S. bench outscored Canada's 42-27.\n\n\"You get this collection of guys together and it is a test and it's a challenge to try to figure out - just the chemistry, just the flow and the rhythm, especially on offense because there's a temptation to defer,\" Curry said. \"There's a temptation to overthink every possession because everybody can make a play and when you have an advantage, you just try to keep the game as simple as possible.\n\n\"That first unit, we struggled with that, but then once we got settled in, it seemed like everybody got a little bit more comfortable as we got deeper into the game and hopefully the next four exhibition games we have to see more progress.\"\n\nWhen the U.S. failed to medal at the FIBA World Cup last year, its lack of size at the center and power forward spots were exposed.\n\nThat's not the case this year with Embiid, Davis and Adebayo. The final rebounding total (53-48) was not indicative of how the U.S. controlled that category - it had a 39-23 edge headed into the fourth quarter. Davis was dominant on the glass, and James, Embiid and Holiday each had at least five rebounds. Nine blocked shots gave the U.S. rim protection that was missing last year, and the U.S. outscored Canada 50-32 in points in the paint.\n\nStrengthening the interior play was a focal point when building the roster, and it was addressed. Now, Canada isn't big so let's see how the U.S. handles a team with size, like Serbia and Germany in exhibition games.\n\nThe U.S. has scorers. Putting up enough points shouldn't be an issue. But defensive-minded U.S. assistant coach Ty Lue wants intense pressure on the opponent's offene. There are multiple All-Defensive players on the roster, and with Derrick White replacing Kawhi Leonard, the U.S. is adding another.\n\nThe U.S. held Canada to 33.8% shooting from the field and 21.2% on 3-pointers, had 11 steals and Davis blocked four shots.\n\nHaliburton had four steals and James had three, and those Canada turnovers helped the U.S. own a 16-2 edge in fastbreak points. The U.S. held MVP runner-up Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to 10 points on 3-for-10 shooting and Jamal Murray to five points on 2-for-8 shooting.\n\n\"One of the keys to the game was just the collective ball pressure that our guys had out there, and Jrue obviously leads the way in that regard,\" Kerr said. \"But if we can get all of our guys pressuring the ball, we've got big guys behind the play who can clean things up and it should be a good combination for our defense.\"\n\nThe U.S. was down to 10 Olympians - Kevin Durant sat out with a sore calf, and White wasn't available. He will join the team in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\"He has been working (and) rehabbing,\" U.S. men's national team managing director Grant Hill said of Durant. \"He's looked great. I think we're just being cautious and conservative and I think we expect to see him on the court when we're in Abu Dhabi.\"\n\nAfter watching Leonard practice Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, USA Basketball team staffers, led by Hill and in consultation with the Los Angeles Clippers, decided it was best to go in another direction. Leonard missed games at the end of the regular season and playoffs with right knee inflammation. Even though Leonard told reporters he was good to go, USA Basketball had reason to believe he wasn't ready for the Olympics.\n\n\"Kawhi gave it everything he had when he was preparing and those last three days of camp,\" Curry said. \"Obviously they're tough decisions and I know he wanted to play, but it's one of those things where he wished us luck and he wanted us to go get the gold.\n\n\"And you love that kind of support from a guy that's in a tough situation like that, but hopefully for the long term he's in a good place because the game needs him and when he's not out there, you miss an all-time great player. So we hope that he's ready for this season.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Before the games start to matter, though, the U.S. men's national team has a flurry of exhibition games before Paris. To start off, the Americans blew out Canada 86-72 in Las Vegas in their exhibition opener, overcoming a slow start.\n\nThe U.S. squad was disjointed to start the game, missing its first six shots and finding itself down 11-1 to the Canadians. But the Americans quickly settled down from there, holding a 41-33 halftime lead. The U.S. cruised to the win, wrapping up its short stay in Las Vegas.\n\nNotably, USA Basketball was a bit shorthanded as Kevin Durant nurses a calf injury. Derrick White also didn't play since he was just added to the 12-man roster, replacing Kawhi Leonard. But those two should be on the court as the team now heads to Abu Dhabi.\n\nUSA Basketball was led by Anthony Edwards, who scored 13 points as he was unafraid to take shots playing with some of the game's best players. Stephen Curry put up 12 points himself as he caught fire to start the third quarter. Anthony Davis also added 10 points and 11 rebounds. For the Canadians, they were led by RJ Barrett, who put up 12 points and five rebounds, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had 10 points. The Americans did finish with 15 turnovers, so they'll look to clean that up as they develop more chemistry.\n\nThe Americans have four more exhibition games on the schedule ahead of heading to Paris. They play Australia on July 15 then Serbia on July 17, with both those games in Abu Dhabi. Then they take on South Sudan on July 20 then Germany on July 22, with those games being played in London. So it's a busy schedule ahead of the actual Olympics, which opens July 28 against Serbia.\n\nHere are four takeaways from USA Basketball's opening win over Canada:\n\nDefense steps up: While it's still early for everyone, it was clear the Americans had some juice behind their roster. Their defense shined as Canada shot 33.8% from the field, resulting in the 72 points. USA Basketball's size upfront will be one of its biggest strengths, which the big men showed off in the game. So that's a positive as the Americans will continue to gel going forward from this exhibition opener.\n\nCeltics shine: There are only so many shots to go around in the shortened international game, but the Celtics players in Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday had their moments throughout the game. Tatum finished with eight points and two assists in his 17 minutes. Holiday put up 11 points, five rebounds, four assists and two blocks in 20 minutes as he also had multiple impressive defensive plays.\n\nSlight surprise: Considering the talent level, multiple All-Stars would have to come off the bench for the Americans. But it was still slightly unexpected to see Tatum coming off the bench. USA coach Steve Kerr elected to go with a starting lineup of Holiday, Devin Booker, Stephen Curry, LeBron James and Joel Embiid. Kerr and his coaching staff could still shake up the starting lineup, so that's something to monitor.\n\nForgettable debut: Embiid got the start for the Americans, but it was a tough debut on this stage for the big man. He fouled out in the third quarter, finishing with five points, six rebounds, two assists and four turnovers in his 12 minutes. Embiid looked a bit slow out there, but it's just the first game, so he'll look to have a bounce-back performance.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"},

Loaded with future Hall of Famers and NBA All-Stars, this group will enter the 2024 Paris Games as the heavy favorite to bring home their fifth consecutive gold medal.\n\nWith former U.S. President Barack Obama sitting courtside, they showed why in an 86-72 win against Canada in an exhibition Wednesday at T-Mobile Arena.\n\nAnthony Edwards led the U.S. with 13 points on 6-for-10 shooting. Steph Curry added 12 points and hit three 3-pointers. Anthony Davis made his presence felt in the post with 10 points and 11 rebounds, while LeBron James had 7 points on 3-for-7 from the field.\n\nRJ Barrett paced Canada with 12 points and 5 rebounds.\n\n\"It was a good first game for us,\" U.S. coach Steve Kerr said. \"We're really just getting started -- four days of practice. You could see the rust on the offensive end with a lot of turnovers in that first half especially. But I loved that defensive intensity and the work on the glass. It was a good first effort and we needed to set a tone for how we play and I think we did that.\"\n\nThe U.S. team took a bit to find their rhythm early on. Despite the incredible amount of talent on the floor, it was their first competitive game as a collective unit -- and it showed.\n\nBad turnovers and missed shots allowed Canada to open the game up 11-1.\n\nIt wasn't until Curry's 3-pointer nearly five minutes into the matchup that they made a field goal attempt. Canada even led 21-14 after the first quarter.\n\nBut those struggles didn't last long. The Americans started the second quarter on a 7-0 run and never looked back. Their second unit -- led by Edwards and Davis -- was a key factor in turning everything around.\n\n\"It was a slow start, which wasn't surprising given that we're just getting started here, but I love the second group,\" Kerr said. \"Then the defense, picking up the pace for us in transition, made a few good plays there to really kind of jumpstart our offense and that got us into the game.\"\n\nUSA Basketball, which will celebrate its 50th anniversary this summer, paid tribute to past legends by bringing out members of squads that won medals during a break in the action. Those on hand in Las Vegas included Patrick Ewing, John Stockton, Grant Hill, Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony.\n\nObama, who spoke with the team prior to the game, also received a loud cheer when he walked to his seat on the floor.\n\nCurry said the former president was \"really inspiring with his words.\"\n\n\"It was cool to send us off into this journey celebrating 50 years of USAB and what we're trying to do this summer,\" Curry said. \"I got goosebumps while he was talking. It makes you feel good about who you're representing.\"\n\nThe U.S. will begin their quest for another gold medal on July 28 against Serbia, which features former NBA MVP Nikola Joki\u0107. Unlike Wednesday night, it's not a matchup they can afford to start slowly.\n\nJames said that cohesion will come in time.\n\n\"It's easy to gel when you have one common goal, and our common goal is to play hard and win gold,\" he said. \"It shouldn't take long.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJ_Barrett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RJ Barrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stockton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Stockton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grant Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/24711-basketball-usa-canada-rc-1215a-fd3409.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723560", "eventUri": "eng-9723560", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "textStart": 2797, "textEnd": 2804}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

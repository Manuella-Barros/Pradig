It never was and it is not now. No one, NO ONE, has the right to express hate and violence. Stop it now.\"\n\nIn Liverpool, Merseyside Police said about 300 people were involved in violent disorder on County Road, Walton, which included community facilities being set on fire.\n\nThe Spellow Lane Library Hub, which was opened last year to provide support for one of the most deprived communities in the country, suffered severe damage to the ground floor.\n\nPolice said rioters tried to prevent firefighters from accessing the fire, throwing a missile at the fire engine and breaking the rear window of the cab.\n\nA total of 23 people were arrested on Saturday, Merseyside Police said, including 12 arrests for the disorder in the city centre, nine arrests for the disorder on County Road and two arrests in connection with the disorder in Southport.\n\nOne officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss called the behaviour of protesters \"deplorable\", adding: \"The impact of the disorder will be devastating for the people of Walton, but I promise that we are doing everything in our power to arrest those involved and bring them to justice.\"\n\nMerseyside Police also said a 58-year-old man has been charged with two offences following the violent disorder in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nDerek Drummond of Pool Street, Southport, has been charged with violent disorder and assault on an emergency worker. He will appear at Wirral Magistrates Court on Monday, August 5, police said.\n\nIn Hull, Humberside Police said there were 20 people arrested, three police officers injured and shops looted and burned after a mob attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Mike Walker said: \"The right to lawful protest is a part of democracy, which my officers upheld, however, we will not accept the senseless vandalism, antisocial behaviour and sheer violence that has been brought to our streets.\"\n\nBusinesses were targeted in Belfast where police mounted a significant security operation during a lengthy confrontation between anti-Islamic protesters and those taking part in an anti-racist rally at Belfast City Hall during which fireworks and other missiles were thrown.\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre, which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nLancashire Police said more than 20 people were arrested and dispersal orders were issued in parts of Blackpool, Preston and Blackburn.\n\nAnd Staffordshire Police said 10 people were also arrested following disorder in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nFurther protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.\n\n\"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n\"There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy.\n\n\"So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you.\"", "source": {"uri":

He will appear at Wirral Magistrates Court on Monday, August 5, police said.\n\nIn Hull, Humberside Police said there were 20 people arrested, three police officers injured and shops looted and burned after a mob attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Mike Walker said: \"The right to lawful protest is a part of democracy, which my officers upheld, however, we will not accept the senseless vandalism, antisocial behaviour and sheer violence that has been brought to our streets.\"\n\nBusinesses were targeted in Belfast where police mounted a significant security operation during a lengthy confrontation between anti-Islamic protesters and those taking part in an anti-racist rally at Belfast City Hall during which fireworks and other missiles were thrown.\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre, which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nLancashire Police said more than 20 people

It never was and it is not now. No one, NO ONE, has the right to express hate and violence. Stop it now.\"\n\nIn Liverpool, Merseyside Police said about 300 people were involved in violent disorder on County Road, Walton, which included community facilities being set on fire.\n\nThe Spellow Lane Library Hub, which was opened last year to provide support for one of the most deprived communities in the country, suffered severe damage to the ground floor.\n\nPolice said rioters tried to prevent firefighters from accessing the fire, throwing a missile at the fire engine and breaking the rear window of the cab.\n\nA total of 23 people were arrested on Saturday, Merseyside Police said, including 12 arrests for the disorder in the city centre, nine arrests for the disorder on County Road and two arrests in connection with the disorder in Southport.\n\nOne officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nAssistant chief constable Alex Goss called the behaviour of protesters \"deplorable\", adding: \"The impact of the disorder will be devastating for the people of Walton, but I promise that we are doing everything in our power to arrest those involved and bring them to justice.\"\n\nMerseyside Police also said a 58-year-old man has been charged with two offences following the violent disorder in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nDerek Drummond of Pool Street, Southport, has been charged with violent disorder and assault on an emergency worker. He will appear at Wirral Magistrates Court on Monday, August 5, police said.\n\nIn Hull, Humberside Police said there were 20 people arrested, three police officers injured and shops looted and burned after a mob attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers.\n\nAssistant chief constable Mike Walker said: \"The right to lawful protest is a part of democracy, which my officers upheld, however, we will not accept the senseless vandalism, antisocial behaviour and sheer violence that has been brought to our streets.\"\n\nBusinesses were targeted in Belfast where police mounted a significant security operation during a lengthy confrontation between anti-Islamic protesters and those taking part in an anti-racist rally at Belfast City Hall during which fireworks and other missiles were thrown.\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre, which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nLancashire Police said more than 20 people were arrested and dispersal orders were issued in parts of Blackpool, Preston and Blackburn.\n\nAnd Staffordshire Police said 10 people were also arrested following disorder in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nFurther protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.\n\n\"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n\"There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy.\n\n\"So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you.\"", "source": {"uri":

violent protests across UK cities continue", "body": "Police officers were attacked and forced to draw their batons as they struggled to control violent protesters\n\nPolice officers have been taken to hospital after violent protests across the UK which saw officers being pelted by bricks, chairs and bottles.\n\nOfficers clashed with protesters in major UK cities, including Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Belfast, Stoke and Hull, in the latest rallies organised in the wake of the Southport stabbings earlier this week.\n\nPolice officers were attacked and forced to draw their batons as they struggled to control violent protesters.\n\nSome of the worst violence was seen in Liverpool where one officer was hit on the head with a chair, and another was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator.\n\nMerseyside Police said two officers had been taken to hospital, with one suffering a suspected broken nose, while another is thought to have a fractured jaw.\n\nThe force said a number of officers were injured during \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre, with one officer being hit on the head by a chair, and another officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator.\n\nThe Prime Minister said the police have his \"full support\" to take action against \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\" by intimidating communities as he held emergency talks with ministers over the unrest in parts of England.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said those engaging in violence \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nMerseyside Police assistant chief constable Jenny Sims said: \"The behaviour we have seen today in Liverpool city centre is completely unacceptable.\n\n\"What should have been a sunny Saturday on the historic waterfront to be enjoyed by people of all ages turned into an afternoon of unashamed disorder and violence, which potentially put decent members of the public, including children, at risk.\n\n\"This disorder, violence and destruction has no place here in Merseyside, least of all after the tragic events that took place in Southport on Monday.\n\n\"Those officers were met with shameful levels of violence and attempts at provocation by a number of those present.\"\n\nThe force said 11 had been arrested and it believed the number will rise, adding that families who had taken their children to see a Disney Princess cruise ship nearby had been forced to flee the violence.\n\nThose arrested included six people aged between 29 and 58, who are being held on suspicion of offences including violent disorder and criminal damage.\n\nCities in England and Northern Ireland saw clashes between anti-immigration demonstrators and counter-protesters, with police forming lines with riot shields to keep groups apart.\n\nThe far-right has drawn condemnation from MPs across the political spectrum after disorder in London, Manchester, Southport and Hartlepool over the past three days.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said Sir Keir met with ministers including the Deputy Prime Minister, Home Secretary, Justice Secretary and the policing minister to discuss the disorder and unrest.\n\nThey said: \"The Prime Minister began by thanking the police who responded to the violence committed by a small minority of thugs in Sunderland last night which injured four officers.\n\n\"Addressing the scenes of disorder we have seen today, the Prime Minister set out that the police have our full support to take action against extremists on our streets who are attacking police officers, disrupting local businesses and attempting to sow hate by intimidating communities.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said the Justice Secretary had told those present that offenders who have committed violence over the past few days have been remanded in custody and \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nThey added: \"The Prime Minister ended by saying the right to freedom of expression and the violent disorder we have seen are two very different things.\n\n\"He said there is no excuse for violence of any kind and reiterated that the Government backs the police to take all necessary action to keep our streets safe.\"\n\nThe Home Secretary said she had been \"talking to MPs across the country\" and \"that work will continue\" when asked whether Parliament should be recalled over the disorder, as Tory former home secretary Dame Priti Patel has insisted.\n\nShe said: \"I've already been talking to MPs across the country and making sure that they and their constituencies are also able to hear from the local police and to work with local communities.\n\n\"That work will continue, it's really important that local representatives, also local community leaders are involved working with the police.\n\n\"But the bottom line here is we cannot stand for this kind of thuggery or criminal disorder on our streets.\"\n\nIn Hull, four people have been arrested as three officers were hurt after a group of people targeted a hotel which houses asylum seekers and city shops were looted and set on fire.\n\nHumberside Police Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore said officers have \"faced eggs and bottles being thrown\" as windows were smashed at the hotel which has housed migrants.\n\nElsewhere, bricks were thrown at officers in Stoke-on-Trent, there were arrests for violent disorder in Bristol and fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast.\n\nFour men have been arrested following disorder in the Staffordshire city.\n\nAnd scuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham's Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides, and chants of \"England till I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" were drowned out by boos from counter-protesters.\n\nAt least three people were led away in handcuffs in the East Midlands city.\n\nAround 150 people carrying St George flags shouting \"You're not English any more\" and \"Paedo Muslims off our street\" were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\".\n\nSkirmishes broke out between demonstrators and punks in Blackpool, with bottles and chairs being thrown and wood wielded.\n\nThe string of violent incidents began in Southport on Tuesday, where demonstrators attacked police and set cars on fire the day after three girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nThe weekend protests followed a night of \"unforgivable\" violence in Sunderland in Friday, which saw a Citizens Advice office burned down.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use for missiles during widespread violence in the city, adding that it was \"an act of sacrilege\".\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nViolence later erupted outside a mosque in the town and 53 police officers and three police dogs were injured.\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association.\n\nPolice officers were attacked and forced to draw their batons as they struggled to control violent protesters.", "source": {"uri":

It never was and it is not now. No one, NO ONE, has the right to express hate and violence. Stop it now.\"\n\nIn Liverpool, there were 11 arrests and a number of officers injured, with one being hit on the head by a chair.\n\nAnother officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nThe Liverpool Echo reports the Spellow Hub, a library which reopened last year and provides support for people of all abilities to gain education and a path to employment, was also lit on fire.\n\nIn a post on X, Liverpool City Council urged people to \"stay away from the area\" and let police \"deal with this ongoing situation in Walton\".\n\nMerseyside Police also said a 58-year-old man has been charged with two offences following the violent disorder in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nDerek Drummond of Pool Street, Southport, has been charged with violent disorder and assault on an emergency worker. He will appear at Wirral Magistrates Court on Monday, August 5, police said.\n\nIn Hull there were at least four arrests, three police officers injured and shops looted and burned after a mob attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers.\n\nBusinesses were targeted in Belfast where police mounted a significant security operation during a lengthy confrontation between anti-Islamic protesters and those taking part in an anti-racist rally at Belfast City Hall during which fireworks and other missiles were thrown.\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nFurther protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.\n\n\"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n\"There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy.\n\n\"So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc",

police officers injured as Prime Minister vows action", "body": "Violent disorder in towns and cities led to officers being injured as objects such as bricks, chairs and bottles were thrown at police.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the police have his \"full support\" to take action against \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\" by intimidating communities as he held emergency talks with ministers over the unrest in parts of England.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said those engaging in violence \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nCities in England and Northern Ireland saw clashes between anti-immigration demonstrators and counter-protesters on Saturday, with police forming lines with riot shields to keep groups apart.\n\nThe far-right has drawn condemnation from MPs across the political spectrum after disorder in London, Manchester, Southport and Hartlepool over the past three days.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said Sir Keir met with ministers including the Deputy Prime Minister, Home Secretary, Justice Secretary and the policing minister to discuss the disorder and unrest.\n\nThey said: \"The Prime Minister began by thanking the police who responded to the violence committed by a small minority of thugs in Sunderland last night which injured four officers.\n\n\"Addressing the scenes of disorder we have seen today (Saturday), the Prime Minister set out that the police have our full support to take action against extremists on our streets who are attacking police officers, disrupting local businesses and attempting to sow hate by intimidating communities.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said the Justice Secretary had told those present that offenders who have committed violence over the past few days have been remanded in custody and \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nThey added: \"The Prime Minister ended by saying the right to freedom of expression and the violent disorder we have seen are two very different things.\n\n\"He said there is no excuse for violence of any kind and reiterated that the Government backs the police to take all necessary action to keep our streets safe.\"\n\nThe Home Secretary said she had been \"talking to MPs across the country\" and \"that work will continue\" when asked whether Parliament should be recalled over the disorder, as Tory former home secretary Dame Priti Patel has insisted.\n\nShe said: \"I've already been talking to MPs across the country and making sure that they and their constituencies are also able to hear from the local police and to work with local communities.\n\n\"That work will continue, it's really important that local representatives, also local community leaders are involved working with the police.\n\n\"But the bottom line here is we cannot stand for this kind of thuggery or criminal disorder on our streets.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said a number of officers were injured during \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre, with one officer being hit on the head by a chair.\n\nBricks, bottles and a flare were also thrown at officers as they lined The Strand in the city centre.\n\nAnother officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nIn Hull, four people have been arrested as three officers were hurt after a group of people targeted a hotel which houses asylum seekers.\n\nHumberside Police Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore said officers have \"faced eggs and bottles being thrown\" as windows were smashed at the hotel which has housed migrants.\n\nElsewhere, bricks were thrown at officers in Stoke-on-Trent and fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast.\n\nFour men have been arrested following disorder in the Staffordshire city.\n\nAnd scuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham's Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides, and chants of \"England till I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" were drowned out by boos from counter-protesters.\n\nAt least three people were led away in handcuffs in the East Midlands city.\n\nAround 150 people carrying St George flags shouting \"You're not English any more\" and \"Paedo Muslims off our street\" were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\".\n\nSkirmishes broke out between demonstrators and punks in Blackpool, with bottles and chairs being thrown and wood wielded.\n\nThe string of violent incidents began in Southport on Tuesday, where demonstrators attacked police and set cars on fire the day after three girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nThe weekend protests followed a night of \"unforgivable\" violence in Sunderland in Friday, which saw a Citizens Advice office burned down.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use for missiles during widespread violence in the city, adding that it was \"an act of sacrilege\".\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nViolence later erupted outside a mosque in the town and 53 police officers and three police dogs were injured.", "source": {"uri": "glasgowtimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Glasgow Times"},

fire.\n\nIn Hull there were at least four arrests, three police officers injured and shops looted and burned after a mob attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers.\n\nBusinesses were targeted in Belfast where police mounted a significant security operation during a lengthy confrontation between anti-Islamic protesters and those taking part in an anti-racist rally at Belfast City Hall during which fireworks and other missiles were thrown.\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nFurther protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.\n\n\"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n\"There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy.\n\n\"So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you.\"", "source": {"uri":

streets will \"pay the price\", the Government has said, amid warnings that further violence is likely in the coming days.\n\nTowns and cities in England and Northern Ireland saw clashes between anti-immigration demonstrators and counter-protesters on Saturday, with police officers attacked and injured and a number of arrests made, with many more promised.\n\nThe string of violent incidents over the past few days began on Tuesday in Southport, after three girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said people involved in the clashes \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the police have his \"full support\" to take action against \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\" by intimidating communities as he held emergency talks with ministers over the unrest in parts of England.\n\nThe far right has drawn condemnation from MPs across the political spectrum after disorder in London, Manchester, Southport and Hartlepool came before Saturday's violence.\n\nArrests have been made across the country with police warning of more to come once CCTV, social media and body-worn camera footage has been scoured.\n\nJustice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told ministers \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\", a Downing Street spokesperson said, which could see courts sitting for 24 hours a day as they did for the 2011 riots, according to one report.\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured.\n\nIt followed a riot on Sunderland on Friday evening.\n\nIn Liverpool there were 11 arrests and a number of officers injured, with one being hit on the head by a chair.\n\nAnother officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nIn Hull there were at least four arrests, three police officers injured and shops looted and burned after a mob attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers.\n\nBusinesses were targeted in Belfast where police mounted a significant security operation during a lengthy confrontation between anti-Islamic protesters and those taking part in an anti-racist rally at Belfast City Hall during which fireworks and other missiles were thrown.\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nFurther protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.\n\n\"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n\"There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy.\n\n\"So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@aol.co.uk", "name": "Press Association", "type": "author",

sees police officers injured as Prime Minister vows action", "body": "Violent disorder in towns and cities led to officers being injured as objects such as bricks, chairs and bottles were thrown at police.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the police have his \"full support\" to take action against \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\" by intimidating communities as he held emergency talks with ministers over the unrest in parts of England.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said those engaging in violence \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nThe far-right has drawn condemnation from MPs across the political spectrum after disorder in London, Manchester, Southport and Hartlepool over the past three days.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said Sir Keir met with ministers including the Deputy Prime Minister, Home Secretary, Justice Secretary and the policing minister to discuss the disorder and unrest.\n\nThey said: \"The Prime Minister began by thanking the police who responded to the violence committed by a small minority of thugs in Sunderland last night which injured four officers.\n\n\"Addressing the scenes of disorder we have seen today (Saturday), the Prime Minister set out that the police have our full support to take action against extremists on our streets who are attacking police officers, disrupting local businesses and attempting to sow hate by intimidating communities.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said the Justice Secretary had told those present that offenders who have committed violence over the past few days have been remanded in custody and \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nThey added: \"The Prime Minister ended by saying the right to freedom of expression and the violent disorder we have seen are two very different things.\n\n\"He said there is no excuse for violence of any kind and reiterated that the Government backs the police to take all necessary action to keep our streets safe.\"\n\nShe said: \"I've already been talking to MPs across the country and making sure that they and their constituencies are also able to hear from the local police and to work with local communities.\n\n\"That work will continue, it's really important that local representatives, also local community leaders are involved working with the police.\n\n\"But the bottom line here is we cannot stand for this kind of thuggery or criminal disorder on our streets.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said a number of officers were injured during \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre, with one officer being hit on the head by a chair.\n\nBricks, bottles and a flare were also thrown at officers as they lined The Strand in the city centre.\n\nAnother officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nIn Hull, four people have been arrested as three officers were hurt after a group of people targeted a hotel which houses asylum seekers.\n\nElsewhere, bricks were thrown at officers in Stoke-on-Trent and fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast.\n\nFour men have been arrested following disorder in the Staffordshire city.\n\nAnd scuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham's Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides, and chants of \"England till I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" were drowned out by boos from counter-protesters.\n\nAt least three people were led away in handcuffs in the East Midlands city.\n\nAround 150 people carrying St George flags shouting \"You're not English any more\" and \"Paedo Muslims off our street\" were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\".\n\nSkirmishes broke out between demonstrators and punks in Blackpool, with bottles and chairs being thrown and wood wielded.\n\nThe string of violent incidents began in Southport on Tuesday, where demonstrators attacked police and set cars on fire the day after three girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nThe weekend protests followed a night of \"unforgivable\" violence in Sunderland in Friday, which saw a Citizens Advice office burned down.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use for missiles during widespread violence in the city, adding that it was \"an act of sacrilege\".\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nViolence later erupted outside a mosque in the town and 53 police officers and three police dogs were injured.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"},

One officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nLancashire Police said more than 20 people were arrested and dispersal orders were

Other smaller demonstrations elsewhere did not turn violent.\n\nThe prime minister has pledged to give police forces the government's \"full support\" to take action against \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\".\n\nTensions have been high after the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in Southport, Merseyside, on Monday.\n\nIn Liverpool, bricks, bottles and a flare were thrown at police, one officer was hit in the head when a chair was thrown, and another was kicked and knocked off his motorbike.\n\nA few hundred anti-fascist demonstrators gathered across from Liverpool's Lime Street station at lunchtime, calling for unity and tolerance, chanting \"refugees are welcome here\" and \"Nazi scum, off our streets\".\n\nThey marched down to the city's riverside to confront around one thousand anti-immigration protestors - some of whom were shouting Islamophobic slurs.\n\nPolice in riot gear with dogs struggled to keep the two sides apart and reinforcements were called to try and maintain order.\n\nThe unrest continued into the early hours of Sunday morning, with fireworks launched towards police officers wearing riot gear.\n\nA library was set on fire in the Walton area of the city and rioters tried to prevent firefighters from putting it out, Merseyside Police said.\n\nShops were broken into and a number of wheelie bins were set on fire, it added.\n\nThe force confirmed a number of officers had been injured in what they described as \"serious disorder\", adding that two had been taken to hospital - one with a suspected broken nose and one with a suspected broken jaw.\n\nIt said 23 people had been arrested.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Jenny Simms said: \"The disorder, violence and destruction has no place here in Merseyside, least of all after the tragic events that took place in Southport on Monday\".\n\n\"Those who engaged in this behaviour bring nothing but shame to themselves and this city. \"\n\nAt a meeting of government ministers earlier on Saturday, a spokesperson for Sir Keir Starmer said the PM told those assembled that \"the right to freedom of expression and the violent disorder we have seen are two very different things.\"\n\nHe added: \"there is no excuse for violence of any kind and reiterated that the government backs the police to take all necessary action to keep our streets safe\".\n\nOn Saturday, the home secretary also warned that anyone engaging in \"unacceptable disorder\" would face imprisonment and travel bans amongst other punishments, adding that \"sufficient\" prison places had been made available.\n\n\"Criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets,\" Yvette Cooper said.\n\nPolice have the government's full backing in taking action against those engaging in \"thuggery\", she added.\n\nIn Bristol, protesters and counter-protests were engaged in a standoff.\n\nOne group could be heard singing Rule Britannia, \"England 'til I die\" and \"we want our country back\", while the other side chanted \"refugees are welcome here\".\n\nBeer cans were thrown at the anti-racism group, and some of the rival protesters were baton-charged by officers.\n\nAvon and Somerset Police said 14 people in the city had been arrested, with Chief Inspector Vicks Hayward-Melen anticipating there would be \"further arrests over the coming days\".\n\nIn Manchester, there were scuffles with police, and at least two arrests.\n\nWhile in Belfast, two people were arrested as protesters outside a mosque threw objects at members of the media and earlier smashed windows in a cafe.\n\nIn Hull, protesters smashed a window at a hotel used to house asylum seekers, and bottles and eggs were thrown at police.\n\nCity Hall was placed on lockdown as the British Chess Championships took place inside.\n\nHumberside Police said three police officers had been injured and 20 people arrested after disorder in the city centre also saw shops ransacked and items set on fire.\n\nIn Blackpool, protesters faced off against punks attending Rebellion Festival.

The force said its focus had been on Blackpool but there had also been \"minor disruption\" in Blackburn and Preston.\n\nIn Stoke-on-Trent, bricks were thrown at officers.

And West Yorkshire Police said a protest on the Headrow in Leeds \"passed off largely without incident\", despite one arrest being made.\n\nNot all demonstrations held across the UK descended into violence on Saturday, and in some places protesters dispersed by the evening.\n\nSaturday's protests follow a night of violence in Sunderland on Friday, which saw four police officers hospitalised.\n\nHundreds of people rioted, beer cans and bricks were thrown at riot police outside a mosque and a Citizens Advice office was torched.\n\nTwelve people have been arrested in connection with the violence.\n\nThe BBC has identified at least 30 demonstrations being planned by far-right activists around the UK over the weekend, including a new protest in Southport.\n\nAn extra 70

There was little police presence as skirmishes broke out between the two groups, with bottles and chairs thrown.\n\nLancashire Police said it had arrested more than 20 people. The force said its focus had been on Blackpool but there had also been \"minor disruption\" in Blackburn and Preston.\n\nIn Stoke-on-Trent, bricks were thrown at officers. Staffordshire Police said that two men at the centre of online claims they had been stabbed had actually been hit by an object that was thrown, and were not seriously injured.\n\nThe force said 10 people had been arrested and three officers suffered minor injuries.\n\nNot all demonstrations held across the UK descended into violence on Saturday, and in some places protesters dispersed by the evening.\n\nSaturday's protests follow a night of violence in Sunderland on Friday, which saw four police officers hospitalised and 10 people arrested.\n\nHundreds of people rioted, beer cans and bricks were thrown at riot police outside a mosque and a Citizens Advice office was torched.\n\nTwelve people have been arrested in connection with the violence.\n\nThe BBC has identified at least 30 demonstrations being planned by far-right activists around the UK over the weekend, including a new protest in Southport.\n\nAn extra 70 prosecutors are on standby this weekend to charge people arrested in connection with violent disorder.\n\nShadow home secretary James Cleverly called on Sir Keir and home secretary to \"do more\" to restore public order and \"send a clear message to the thugs\".\n\nEarlier this week, the prime minister announced a new national violent disorder programme to help clamp down on violent groups by allowing police forces to share intelligence.", "source":

from \"thugs\" who \"sow hate\" as violent protests erupted across the UK following the stabbing of three girls in Southport.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister had met senior ministers including the deputy prime minister, home secretary, justice secretary and the policing minister to discuss the public disorder and unrest seen in towns and cities in recent days.\n\nAfter thanking police who responded to the violence in Sunderland on Friday night, which saw four officers injured, Sir Keir said officers \"have our full support to take action against extremists on our streets who are attacking police officers, disrupting local businesses and attempting to sow hate by intimidating communities.\n\n\"The right to freedom of expression and the violent disorder we have seen are two very different things,\" he said, adding that \"there is no excuse for violence of any kind\".\n\nMr Starmer reiterated that the government backs the police to take \"all necessary action to keep our streets safe.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said those engaging in violent disorder \"will pay the price\", telling broadcasters \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nMs Cooper said: \"We've been clear to the police that they have our full backing in taking the strongest possible action against perpetrators, including making sure that there are more prosecutors, there are sufficient prison places and also that the courts stand ready because anyone who engages in this kind of disorder needs to be clear that they will pay the price.\"\n\nShe promised to work with forces to help ensure \"consequences, arrests and prosecutions\" for those responsible.\n\nBottles, chairs and bricks thrown at officers\n\nProtesters threw bottles, chairs and bricks at police during clashes in towns and cities in England and Northern Ireland on Saturday.\n\nA number of officers were injured during \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre, Merseyside Police said, with one being hit on the head by a chair.\n\nBricks, bottles and a flare were also thrown at officers as they lined The Strand in the city centre.\n\nAnother officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nRioters target asylum seekers' hotels\n\nIn Hull, four people have been arrested as three officers were hurt during a protest in which a group of people targeted a hotel which houses asylum seekers.\n\nHumberside Police Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore said officers have \"faced eggs and bottles being thrown\" as windows were smashed at the hotel which has housed migrants.\n\nFour men were arrested after bricks were thrown at officers in Stoke-on-Trent and fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast.\n\nAt least three people were arrested in Nottingham as scuffles broke out as opposing groups who faced each other in the city's Market Square.\n\nOutnumbered by counter-protesters\n\nBottles and other items were thrown from both sides, and chants of \"England till I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" were drowned out by boos from counter-protesters.\n\nIn Leeds, around 150 people carrying St George flags shouting \"You're not English any more\" and \"Paedo Muslims off our street\" were greatly outnumbered by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\".\n\nSaturday's incidents followed violent protests earlier this week, which saw more than 100 people arrested outside Downing Street on Wednesday and 10 arrests in Sunderland on Friday night after a building next to a police station was set on fire and objects thrown at officers.\n\nThe widespread disorder follows a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class at a community centre in Southport on Monday, which left three girls dead.\n\nBebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, died in the attack and other children and adults were injured.\n\nThe assault was followed by a wave of online misinformation about the background of the suspect, Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, from Lancashire.\n\nFalse claims included that the 17-year-old, who was born in Cardiff, was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Opposing groups of protesters also faced off in the central city of Nottingham.\n\nAuthorities in the eastern city of Hull said four people were arrested and three officers were injured while dealing with protests where bottles were thrown.\n\nAt protests in London, police arrested several people including one for making a Nazi salute towards a counter-protester.\n\nMosques across the country have been advised to strengthen security, while police have deployed extra officers.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer, facing his first big test since being elected a month ago, has condemned the \"far right\" for the violence and backed police to take strong action.\n\nStarmer held talks with senior ministers on Saturday and said there was \"no excuse for violence\" at the protests.\n\nThe last time major widespread violence erupted in the UK was in 2011 when thousands took to the streets for five nights after police shot dead a Black man in London.\n\nOn Friday night, hundreds of anti-immigration demonstrators in Sunderland threw stones at police in riot gear near a mosque, before overturning vehicles, setting a car alight and starting a fire near a police station.\n\nFour injured police officers were taken to hospital and 12 people were arrested, Mark Hall, chief police superintendent of the Sunderland area, told reporters on Saturday.\n\n\"This was not a protest. This was unforgivable violence and disorder,\" Hall said.\n\nRioters will \"pay the price\" for the wave of violent clashes that has spread across the UK, ministers warned on Saturday, after a day in which police battled rival groups of demonstrators in the worst outbreak of civil disorder in Britain for more than a decade.\n\nHome secretary Yvette Cooper said the police would have the government's full support to take the strongest possible action. \"Criminal violence and disorder have no place on Britain's streets,\" she said.\n\n\"Anyone who gets involved in criminal disorder and violent thuggery on our streets will have to pay the price and they should expect there to be arrests, prosecutions, penalties, and the full force of the law including imprisonment and travel bans. There are consequences for breaking the law.\"\n\nThe widespread nature of the clashes poses the first major challenge to Keir Starmer's new government, which is now facing demands to introduce emergency powers to stop further violence and to recall parliament.\n\nIn the protests that spread across the nation, bricks were hurled at police officers in Stoke-on-Trent, fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast, and windows of a hotel which has been used to house migrants were smashed in Hull, where three police officers were injured and four people arrested. Several officers were also injured during \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre, where bricks, bottles and a flare were thrown and one officer hit on the head with a chair. Greater Manchester police said a dispersal notice had been authorised for the city centre and scuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham's Old Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides.\n\nAbout 150 people carrying St George's Cross flags, shouting \"you're not English any more\" and \"paedo Muslims off our street\", were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\". Skirmishes broke out between demonstrators and punks - in town for a festival - in Blackpool, with bottles and chairs being thrown.\n\nKeir Starmer held a meeting of senior ministers on Saturday in which he said police had been given full support to tackle extremists who were attempting \"to sow hate by intimidating communities\". He also made it clear that the right to freedom of expression and the violent scenes over recent days were \"two very different things\".", "source": {"uri": "asianlite.com", "dataType": "news",

warnings that further violence is likely in the coming days.\n\nTowns and cities in England and Northern Ireland saw clashes between anti-immigration demonstrators and counter-protesters on Saturday, with police officers attacked and injured and a number of arrests made, with many more promised.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said people involved in the clashes \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the police have his \"full support\" to take action against \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\" by intimidating communities as he held emergency talks with ministers over the unrest in parts of England.\n\nThe far right has drawn condemnation from MPs across the political spectrum after disorder in London, Manchester, Southport and Hartlepool came before Saturday's violence.\n\nJustice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told ministers \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\", a Downing Street spokesperson said, which could see courts sitting for 24 hours a day as they did for the 2011 riots, according to one report.\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured.\n\nIt followed a riot on Sunderland on Friday evening.\n\nAnother officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nThe Liverpool Echo reports the Spellow Hub, a library which reopened last year and provides support for people of all abilities to gain education and a path to employment, was also lit on fire.\n\nIn Hull there were at least four arrests, three police officers injured and shops looted and burned after a mob attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers.\n\nBusinesses were targeted in Belfast where police mounted a significant security operation during a lengthy confrontation between anti-Islamic protesters and those taking part in an anti-racist rally at Belfast City Hall during which fireworks and other missiles were thrown.\n\nFurther protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.\n\n\"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n\"There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy.\n\n\"So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you.\"", "source": {"uri":

It has a massive effect on already significant under-resourcing.\"\n\nSome areas may see a diminished police presence as a result of less robust preventative patrols because officers \"can't be in two places at once\", he said.\n\nScanning CCTV and other footage in incident rooms to identify suspects and deploying to the scene of disorder means fewer staff on the beat, Mr Booth added.\n\nOfficers taken out by injuries will also deplete forces, he said, adding: \"It's truly awful. These are the images I never want to see, of colleagues being battered just for doing their job.\"\n\nThe far-right has drawn widespread condemnation as the organising force behind scenes of disorder in multiple towns and cities in the wake of the killings of three young girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect, later identified as a 17-year-old from Lancashire, was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nOfficers have been pelted with bricks, chairs and bottles, mosques have been attacked, and a police station in Sunderland along with a number of community facilities across the country have been torched in the violence.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said people involved in the clashes \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nArrests have been made across the country including in London, Hartlepool, Southport, Hull and Liverpool, and some charges have been brought, with police warning of more to come once footage has been scoured.\n\nSir Keir held crisis talks with ministers on Saturday over the unrest, with Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood telling colleagues \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured.\n\nIn Liverpool, Merseyside Police said about 300 people were involved in violent disorder on County Road, Walton, which included community facilities being set on fire.\n\nThe Spellow Lane Library Hub, which was opened last year to provide support for one of the most deprived communities in the country, suffered severe damage to the ground floor.\n\nPolice said rioters tried to prevent firefighters from accessing the blaze, throwing a missile at the fire engine and breaking the rear window of the cab.\n\nA total of 23 people were arrested on Saturday, Merseyside Police said, including 12 arrests for the disorder in the city centre, nine arrests for the disorder on County Road and two arrests in connection with disorder in Southport.\n\nOne officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss called the behaviour of protesters \"deplorable\", adding: \"The impact of the disorder will be devastating for the people of Walton, but I promise that we are doing everything in our power to arrest those involved and bring them to justice.\"\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre, which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nLancashire Police said more than 20 people were arrested and dispersal orders were issued in parts of Blackpool, Preston and Blackburn.\n\nStaffordshire Police said 10 people were arrested following disorder in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nFurther protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.\n\n\"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n\"There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy.\n\n\"So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you.\"",

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nAlarming photographs demonstrate the horrifying aftermath of yet another night of protests across the UK last night (August 3). From destroyed shop windows and burnt vehicles, to streets strewn with litter, the unrest has been prevalent.\n\nNumerous towns and cities across England and Northern Ireland, such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast experienced confrontations between anti-immigration protesters and those opposing them. Several police officers were injured and multiple arrests were made, with authorities indicating that more arrests are expected.\n\nIt followed a riot in Sunderland on Friday evening. In south Belfast, a caf\u00e9 and a supermarket have been badly damaged by fire after attacks, which followed anti-immigration protests in the city. Firefighters were also at the scene dealing with a number of deliberate fires.\n\nAcross Hull city centre, various high street shops on Jameson Street all appear to have been targeted. A clean-up operation is currently underway.\n\nRioters swarmed County Road in Liverpool on Saturday evening, resulting in significant destruction during what authorities described as a \"serious violent disorder\". A father reportedly even begged masked troublemakers not to set fire to a terraced shop to ensure his children's safety.\n\nMeanwhile violence erupted in Piccadilly Gardens during demonstrations in Manchester city centre yesterday. At 10am a rally titled 'Stand Up For Your Country: Enough is Enough' commenced, which was followed by a counter protest: 'Stop The Far Right'.\n\nIn wake of the riots, the Government has said those who engage in criminal disorder on the streets will \"pay the price\". Locals are being warned further violence is likely in the coming days.\n\nThe series of violent events in the last few days started on Tuesday in Southport, when three girls were tragically killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer expressed his complete backing for the police to intervene against those trying to spread hate and intimidate communities. He also had urgent discussions with ministers regarding the recent disturbances in various areas of England.\n\nThe extreme right wing has faced criticism from Members of Parliament from all political parties following the unrest in London, Manchester, Southport, and Hartlepool that preceded the violence on Saturday. Law enforcement has already made arrests nationwide, and authorities are anticipating more as they review CCTV, social media, and body camera footage.\n\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy said anyone who attacks police \"should be ashamed\". She wrote on X: \"I cannot thank our local police enough for everything they're doing to keep people safe.\n\n\"They were among the first on the scene when the horrendous incident unfolded in Southport. They run into danger to keep us safe, and those who attack them should be ashamed.\"\n\nIn Liverpool, Merseyside Police said about 300 people were involved in violent disorder on County Road, Walton, which included community facilities being set on fire.\n\nThe Spellow Lane Library Hub, which was opened last year to provide a much needed on stop shop for one of the most deprived communities in the country, has suffered severe damage to the ground floor.\n\nPolice said rioters tried to prevent firefighters accessing the fire, throwing a missile at the fire engine and breaking the rear window of the cab.\n\nA total of 23 people were arrested on Saturday, including 12 arrests for the disorder in the city centre, nine arrests for the disorder on County Road and two arrests in connection with disorder in Southport. One officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nIn a post on X, Liverpool City Council urged people to \"stay away from the area\" and let police \"deal with this ongoing situation in Walton\".\n\nIn Hull, Humberside Police said there were 20 people arrested, three police officers injured and shops looted and burned after a mob attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Mike Walker said: \"The right to lawful protest is a part of democracy, which my officers upheld, however, we will not accept the senseless vandalism, antisocial behaviour and sheer violence that has been brought to our streets.\"\n\nBusinesses were targeted in Belfast where police mounted a significant security operation during a lengthy confrontation between anti-Islamic protesters and those taking part in an anti-racist rally at Belfast City Hall during which fireworks and other missiles were thrown.\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\". Lancashire Police said more than 20 people were arrested and dispersal orders were issued in parts of Blackpool, Preston and Blackburn.\n\nAnd Staffordshire Police said 10 people were also arrested following disorder in Stoke-on-Trent. Further protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.\n\n\"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n\"There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy. So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you.\"", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"},

across UK see officers injured as bricks and bottles thrown", "body": "Planned anti-immigration protests took place in a number of cities across the country.\n\nViolent protests across the UK have led to officers being injured as objects such as bricks, chairs and bottles were thrown at police.\n\nMerseyside Police said a number of officers were injured during \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre on Saturday, with one officer being hit on the head by a chair.\n\nIn Hull, four people have been arrested as three officers were hurt during a protest in which a group of people targeted a hotel which houses asylum seekers.\n\nCities across the country saw clashes between anti-immigration demonstrators and counter-protesters, with police forming lines with riot shields to keep groups apart.\n\nMinisters prepared to meet on Saturday to discuss the potential for further disorder after a series of violent clashes over the past three days.\n\nIn Liverpool, bricks, bottles and a flare were also thrown at officers as they lined The Strand in the city centre.\n\nAnother officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nElsewhere on Saturday, bricks were thrown at officers in Stoke-on-Trent and fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast.\n\nIn Hull, Humberside Police Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore said officers have \"faced eggs and bottles being thrown\" as windows were smashed at the hotel which has housed migrants.\n\nGreater Manchester Police said a dispersal notice had been authorised for the city centre and Merseyside Police said greater stop and search powers had been granted for officers to deal with planned demonstrations.\n\nScuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham's Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides, and chants of \"England till I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" were drowned out by boos from counter-protesters.\n\nAt least three people were led away in handcuffs in the East Midlands city.\n\nAround 150 people carrying St George flags shouting \"You're not English any more\" and \"Paedo Muslims off our street\" were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\".\n\nSkirmishes broke out between demonstrators and punks in Blackpool, with bottles and chairs being thrown and wood wielded.\n\nOn Saturday it was not possible to search \"Tommy Robinson\" on TikTok, with the social media platform instead showing the message: \"This phrase may be associated with behaviour or content that violates our guidelines.\"\n\nCleveland Police denied claims that the organiser of a march in Middlesbrough on Sunday had been arrested on terrorism charges.\n\nThe force issued a statement saying a 29-year-old man had been arrested on Friday over firearms offences after Mr Robinson had posted: \"Lad who organised Middlesbrough march been locked up on terrorism charges.\"\n\nThe string of violent incidents began in Southport on Tuesday, where demonstrators attacked police and set cars on fire the day after three girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nThe weekend protests followed a night of \"unforgivable\" violence in Sunderland, which saw a Citizens Advice office burned down.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use for missiles during widespread violence in the city, adding that it was \"an act of sacrilege\".\n\nSunderland Central Labour MP Lewis Atkinson said a link could be drawn between the disorder in his constituency on Friday and the ashes of the English Defence League (EDL), which was founded by Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.\n\nThe far right has drawn condemnation from MPs across the political spectrum after disorder in London, Manchester, Southport and Hartlepool over the past three days.\n\nCleveland Police said two boys, aged 11 and 14, have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder after the protests in Hartlepool.\n\nThe EDL has disbanded but its supporters remain active, and Mr Atkinson said evidence suggested a Nazi offshoot of the group was involved in the violence in his constituency on Friday, in which a police station was torched and a mosque attacked.\n\nNorthumbria Police said four officers were injured during the violence in Sunderland and 12 people have been arrested.\n\nQari Asim, chairman of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, said the Muslim community is \"deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far-right groups across the country\".\n\nAn \u2060extra 70 prosecutors will be on standby this weekend to charge people who set out to cause violent disorder as the authorities prepare to deal with dozens of demonstrations.\n\nCampaign group Hope Not Hate has identified more than 30 events taking place.\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nViolence later erupted outside a mosque in the town and 53 police officers and three police dogs were injured.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer later condemned \"thugs\" who had travelled to the town to cause unrest.\n\nThe unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, evoking the scale of public disorder last seen during the 2011 riots.\n\nThere were a series of clashes in August 2011 in cities and towns across England, which started in Tottenham Hale, north-east London, after the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police on August 4.",

It has a massive effect on already significant under-resourcing.\"\n\nSome areas may see a diminished police presence as a result of less robust preventative patrols because officers \"can't be in two places at once\", he said.\n\nScanning CCTV and other footage in incident rooms to identify suspects and deploying to the scene of disorder means fewer staff on the beat, Mr Booth added.\n\nOfficers taken out by injuries will also deplete forces, he said, adding: \"It's truly awful. These are the images I never want to see, of colleagues being battered just for doing their job.\"\n\nThe far-right has drawn widespread condemnation as the organising force behind scenes of disorder in multiple towns and cities in the wake of the killings of three young girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect, later identified as a 17-year-old from Lancashire, was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nOfficers have been pelted with bricks, chairs and bottles, mosques have been attacked, and a police station in Sunderland along with a number of community facilities across the country have been torched in the violence.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said people involved in the clashes \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nArrests have been made across the country including in London, Hartlepool, Southport, Hull and Liverpool, and some charges have been brought, with police warning of more to come once footage has been scoured.\n\nSir Keir held crisis talks with ministers on Saturday over the unrest, with Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood telling colleagues \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured.\n\nIn Liverpool, Merseyside Police said about 300 people were involved in violent disorder on County Road, Walton, which included community facilities being set on fire.\n\nThe Spellow Lane Library Hub, which was opened last year to provide support for one of the most deprived communities in the country, suffered severe damage to the ground floor.\n\nPolice said rioters tried to prevent firefighters from accessing the blaze, throwing a missile at the fire engine and breaking the rear window of the cab.\n\nA total of 23 people were arrested on Saturday, Merseyside Police said, including 12 arrests for the disorder in the city centre, nine arrests for the disorder on County Road and two arrests in connection with disorder in Southport.\n\nOne officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss called the behaviour of protesters \"deplorable\", adding: \"The impact of the disorder will be devastating for the people of Walton, but I promise that we are doing everything in our power to arrest those involved and bring them to justice.\"\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre, which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely

It has a massive effect on already significant under-resourcing.\"\n\nSome areas may see a diminished police presence as a result of less robust preventative patrols because officers \"can't be in two places at once\", he said.\n\nScanning CCTV and other footage in incident rooms to identify suspects and deploying to the scene of disorder means fewer staff on the beat, Mr Booth warned.\n\nOfficers taken out by injuries will also deplete forces, he said, adding: \"It's truly awful. These are the images I never want to see, of colleagues being battered just for doing their job.\"\n\nThe far-right has drawn widespread condemnation as the organising force behind scenes of disorder in multiple towns and cities in the wake of the killings of three young girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect, later identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana from Lancashire, was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nBricks, chairs and bottles have been pelted at officers, mosques have been attacked, and a police station along with a number of community facilities across the country, including a library, have been torched in the violence.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said people involved in the clashes \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nAt least 90 arrests have been made across the country and some charges have been brought, with police warning of more to come once footage has been scoured.\n\nSir Keir held crisis talks with ministers on Saturday over the unrest, with Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood telling colleagues \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured.\n\nIn Liverpool, Merseyside Police said about 300 people were involved in violent disorder on County Road, Walton, which included community facilities being set on fire.\n\nThe Spellow Lane Library Hub, which was opened last year to provide support for one of the most deprived communities in the country, suffered severe damage to the ground floor.\n\nPolice said rioters tried to prevent firefighters from accessing the blaze, throwing a missile at the fire engine and breaking the rear window of the cab.\n\nA total of 23 people were arrested on Saturday, Merseyside Police said, including 12 arrests for the disorder in the city centre, nine arrests for the disorder on County Road and two arrests in connection with disorder in Southport.\n\nOne officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss called the behaviour of protesters \"deplorable\", adding: \"The impact of the disorder will be devastating for the people of Walton, but I promise that we are doing everything in our power to arrest those involved and bring them to justice.\"\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre, which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nLancashire Police said more than 20 people were arrested and dispersal orders were issued in parts of Blackpool, Preston and Blackburn.\n\nStaffordshire Police said 10 people were arrested following disorder in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nFurther protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.\n\n\"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will

have been arrested following disorder in the Staffordshire city.\n\nAnd scuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham's Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides, and chants of \"England till I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" were drowned out by boos from counter-protesters.\n\nAt least three people were led away in handcuffs in the East Midlands city.\n\nAround 150 people carrying St George flags shouting \"You're not English any more\" and \"Paedo Muslims off our street\" were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\".\n\nSkirmishes broke out between demonstrators and punks in Blackpool, with bottles and chairs being thrown and wood wielded.\n\nThe string of violent incidents began in Southport on Tuesday, where demonstrators attacked police and set cars on fire the day after three girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nThe weekend protests followed a night of \"unforgivable\" violence in Sunderland in Friday, which saw a Citizens Advice office burned down.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use for missiles during widespread violence in the city, adding that it was \"an act of sacrilege\".\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nViolence later erupted outside a mosque in the town and 53 police officers and three police dogs were injured.", "source": {"uri":

A report said it could mean courts sitting 24 hours a day, as they did during the 2011 riots.\n\nOn Saturday, violence broke out in cities including Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast, with several police officers injured.\n\nThis happened after a riot in Sunderland on Friday evening.\n\nCulture Minister Lisa Nandy said anyone who attacks police \"should be ashamed\".\n\nShe wrote on X: \"I can't thank our local police enough for everything they do to keep people safe.\n\nThey were among the first on the scene when the horrific incident unfolded in Southport.\n\nThey risk themselves to protect us, and those who attack them should be ashamed.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland must always be a place where the right to protest, the right to have an opinion and to express it, is protected.\n\nLet us be VERY clear: violence is not acceptable. It never was and it is not now. No one, NO ONE, has the right to express hatred and violence. Stop it now.\n\n- Emma Little-Pengelly BL (@little_pengelly) August 3, 2024\n\nEmma Little-Pengelly, Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, said \"violence is not acceptable\".\n\n\"Northern Ireland must always be a place that protects the right to protest, the right to have an opinion and express it,\" she posted on X.\n\n\"Let's be VERY clear - violence is not acceptable. It never was and it is not now. No one, NO ONE, has the right to express hatred and violence. Stop it now.\"\n\nIn Liverpool, Merseyside Police reported that around 300 people were involved in violent disturbances on County Road, Walton, which included setting fire to community facilities.\n\nThe Spellow Lane Library Hub, which opened last year to provide a much-needed base for one of the most deprived communities in the country, has suffered severe damage to the ground floor.\n\nAccording to police, rioters tried to block firefighters from reaching the fire, throwing a projectile at the fire truck and smashing the rear window of the cab.\n\nA total of 23 people were arrested on Saturday, including 12 for the disturbances in the city centre, nine for the disturbances on County Road and two for the disturbances in Southport.\n\nA police officer was kicked and pushed off his motorcycle by a protester, while others tried to kick shields.\n\nA heavy and visible police presence remains in Hull city centre tonight as 20 arrests have now been made for various public order offences. ACC Mike Walker said: \"Enforcement action will continue as we will not tolerate senseless violence and disorder in our city.\" More here: https://t.co/QA8xG8g3l4\n\n- Humberside Police (@Humberbeat) August 3, 2024\n\nIn a post on X, Liverpool City Council urged people to \"stay away\" and let police \"deal with this ongoing situation in Walton\".\n\nDeputy Chief Constable Alex Goss called the protesters' behaviour \"reprehensible\", adding: \"The impact of the disorder will be devastating for the people of Walton but I promise we will do everything we can to arrest those involved and bring them to justice.\"\n\nMerseyside Police also reported that a 58-year-old man has been charged with two offences following violent disorder in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nDerek Drummond, of Pool Street, Southport, has been charged with violent disorder and assault on an emergency worker. He will appear at Wirral Magistrates Court on Monday, August 5, police said.\n\nIn Hull, 20 people were arrested, three police officers were injured and shops were looted and set on fire after a mob attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers, according to Humberside Police.\n\nDeputy Chief Constable Mike Walker said: \"The right to lawful protest is part of democracy and one that my officers have upheld. However, we will not accept the senseless vandalism, anti-social behaviour and sheer violence that has erupted on our streets.\"\n\nBusinesses in Belfast were targeted. Police carried out a large-scale security operation during a prolonged confrontation between anti-Muslim protesters and participants in an anti-racism demonstration at Belfast City Hall, during which fireworks and other missiles were thrown.\n\nIn Bristol, police have arrested 14 people over violent disorder in the city centre, which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nLancashire Police said more than 20 people have been arrested and dispersal orders have been issued to disperse the group in parts of Blackpool, Preston and Blackburn.\n\nTen people have also been arrested following the disturbances in Stoke-on-Trent, according to Staffordshire Police.\n\nAccording to police, more protests are planned for Sunday and it is likely that more trouble will arise in the coming days.\n\n\"We know people will try this again and the police are and remain prepared,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n\"There are 130 additional units across the country, which means that almost 4,000 additional officers with public order training will have to be deployed.\n\n\"So if you plan on causing trouble and disorder, our message is very simple: we are watching you.\"", "source": {"uri": "en.paperblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Paperblog"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

said a number of officers were injured during \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre on Saturday, with one officer being hit on the head by a chair.\n\nIn Hull, four people have been arrested as three officers were hurt during a protest in which a group of people targeted a hotel which houses asylum seekers.\n\nCities across the country saw clashes between anti-immigration demonstrators and counter-protesters, with police forming lines with riot shields to keep groups apart.\n\nMinisters prepared to meet on Saturday to discuss the potential for further disorder after a series of violent clashes over the past three days.\n\nIn Liverpool, bricks, bottles and a flare were also thrown at officers as they lined The Strand in the city centre.\n\nAnother officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nA man throws a brick during a protest in Liverpool (James Speakman/PA)\n\nElsewhere on Saturday, bricks were thrown at officers in Stoke-on-Trent and fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast.\n\nIn Hull, Humberside Police Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore said officers have \"faced eggs and bottles being thrown\" as windows were smashed at the hotel which has housed migrants.\n\nGreater Manchester Police said a dispersal notice had been authorised for the city centre and Merseyside Police said greater stop and search powers had been granted for officers to deal with planned demonstrations.\n\nScuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham's Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides, and chants of \"England till I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" were drowned out by boos from counter-protesters.\n\nAt least three people were led away in handcuffs in the East Midlands city.\n\nAround 150 people carrying St George flags shouting \"You're not English any more\" and \"Paedo Muslims off our street\" were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\".\n\nSkirmishes broke out between demonstrators and punks in Blackpool, with bottles and chairs being thrown and wood wielded.\n\nA man with blood on his hand speaks to a police officer during a protest in Nottingham\u00b4s Market Square (Jacob King/PA)\n\nOn Saturday it was not possible to search \"Tommy Robinson\" on TikTok, with the social media platform instead showing the message: \"This phrase may be associated with behaviour or content that violates our guidelines.\"\n\nCleveland Police denied claims that the organiser of a march in Middlesbrough on Sunday had been arrested on terrorism charges.\n\nThe force issued a statement saying a 29-year-old man had been arrested on Friday over firearms offences after Mr Robinson had posted: \"Lad who organised Middlesbrough march been locked up on terrorism charges.\"\n\nThe string of violent incidents began in Southport on Tuesday, where demonstrators attacked police and set cars on fire the day after three girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nThe weekend protests followed a night of \"unforgivable\" violence in Sunderland, which saw a Citizens Advice office burned down.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use for missiles during widespread violence in the city, adding that it was \"an act of sacrilege\".\n\nSunderland Central Labour MP Lewis Atkinson said a link could be drawn between the disorder in his constituency on Friday and the ashes of the English Defence League (EDL), which was founded by Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.\n\nThe far right has drawn condemnation from MPs across the political spectrum after disorder in London, Manchester, Southport and Hartlepool over the past three days.\n\nCleveland Police said two boys, aged 11 and 14, have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder after the protests in Hartlepool.\n\nThe EDL has disbanded but its supporters remain active, and Mr Atkinson said evidence suggested a Nazi offshoot of the group was involved in the violence in his constituency on Friday, in which a police station was torched and a mosque attacked.\n\nNorthumbria Police said four officers were injured during the violence in Sunderland and 12 people have been arrested.\n\nQari Asim, chairman of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, said the Muslim community is \"deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far-right groups across the country\".\n\nAnti-immigration protests were outnumbered by hundreds of anti-racism demonstrators outside Leeds Town Hall (Owen Humphreys/PA)\n\nAn \u2060extra 70 prosecutors will be on standby this weekend to charge people who set out to cause violent disorder as the authorities prepare to deal with dozens of demonstrations.\n\nCampaign group Hope Not Hate has identified more than 30 events taking place.\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nViolence later erupted outside a mosque in the town and 53 police officers and three police dogs were injured.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer later condemned \"thugs\" who had travelled to the town to cause unrest.\n\nThe unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, evoking the scale of public disorder last seen during the 2011 riots.\n\nThere were a series of clashes in August 2011 in cities and towns across England, which started in Tottenham Hale, north-east London, after the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police on August 4.",

police.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the police have his \"full support\" to take action against \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\" by intimidating communities as he held emergency talks with ministers over the unrest in parts of England.\n\nHome secretary Yvette Cooper said those engaging in violent disorder \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nCities in England and Northern Ireland saw clashes between anti-immigration demonstrators and counter-protesters on Saturday, with police forming lines with riot shields to keep groups apart.\n\nMerseyside Police said a number of officers were injured during \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre, with one officer being hit on the head by a chair.\n\nBricks, bottles and a flare were also thrown at officers as they lined The Strand in the city centre.\n\nAnother officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nIn Hull, four people have been arrested as three officers were hurt during a protest in which a group of people targeted a hotel which houses asylum seekers.\n\nHumberside Police Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore said officers have \"faced eggs and bottles being thrown\" as windows were smashed at the hotel which has housed migrants.\n\nElsewhere, bricks were thrown at officers in Stoke-on-Trent and fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast.\n\nFour men have been arrested following disorder in the Staffordshire city.\n\nAnd scuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham's Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides, and chants of \"England till I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" were drowned out by boos from counter-protesters.\n\nAt least three people were led away in handcuffs in the East Midlands city.\n\nSkirmishes broke out between demonstrators and punks in Blackpool, with bottles and chairs being thrown and wood wielded.\n\nThe string of violent incidents began in Southport on Tuesday, where demonstrators attacked police and set cars on fire the day after three girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nThe weekend protests followed a night of \"unforgivable\" violence in Sunderland in Friday, which saw a Citizens Advice office burned down.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use for missiles during widespread violence in the city, adding that it was \"an act of sacrilege\".\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nViolence later erupted outside a mosque in the town and 53 police officers and three police dogs were injured.", "source": {"uri": "news.stv.tv", "dataType": "news",

It has a massive effect on already significant under-resourcing.\"\n\nSome areas may see a diminished police presence as a result of less robust preventative patrols because officers \"can't be in two places at once\", he said.\n\nScanning CCTV and other footage in incident rooms to identify suspects and deploying to the scene of disorder means fewer staff on the beat, Mr Booth added.\n\nOfficers taken out by injuries will also deplete forces, he said, adding: \"It's truly awful. These are the images I never want to see, of colleagues being battered just for doing their job.\"\n\nRiot police form a line on the Lower Ormeau Road amid unrest in Belfast (PA)\n\nThe far-right has drawn widespread condemnation as the organising force behind scenes of disorder in multiple towns and cities in the wake of the killings of three young girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect, later identified as a 17-year-old from Lancashire, was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nOfficers have been pelted with bricks, chairs and bottles, mosques have been attacked, and a police station in Sunderland along with a number of community facilities across the country have been torched in the violence.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said people involved in the clashes \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nRiot police were deployed on the streets of Liverpool (James Speakman/PA)\n\nArrests have been made across the country including in London, Hartlepool, Southport, Hull and Liverpool, and some charges have been brought, with police warning of more to come once footage has been scoured.\n\nSir Keir held crisis talks with ministers on Saturday over the unrest, with Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood telling colleagues \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured.\n\nA protest in Sunderland city centre (Scott Heppell/PA)\n\nIn Liverpool, Merseyside Police said about 300 people were involved in violent disorder on County Road, Walton, which included community facilities being set on fire.\n\nThe Spellow Lane Library Hub, which was opened last year to provide support for one of the most deprived communities in the country, suffered severe damage to the ground floor.\n\nPolice said rioters tried to prevent firefighters from accessing the blaze, throwing a missile at the fire engine and breaking the rear window of the cab.\n\nA total of 23 people were arrested on Saturday, Merseyside Police said, including 12 arrests for the disorder in the city centre, nine arrests for the disorder on County Road and two arrests in connection with disorder in Southport.\n\nOne officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss called the behaviour of protesters \"deplorable\", adding: \"The impact of the disorder will be devastating for the people of Walton, but I promise that we are doing everything in our power to arrest those involved and bring them to justice.\"\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre, which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nLancashire Police said more than 20 people were arrested and dispersal orders were issued in parts of Blackpool, Preston and Blackburn.\n\nStaffordshire Police said 10 people were arrested following disorder in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nA vehicle is set alight in Belfast (David Young/PA)\n\nFurther protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.\n\n\"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n\"There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy.\n\n\"So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail

It has a massive effect on already significant under-resourcing.\"\n\nSome areas may see a diminished police presence as a result of less robust preventative patrols because officers \"can't be in two places at once\", he said.\n\nScanning CCTV and other footage in incident rooms to identify suspects and deploying to the scene of disorder means fewer staff on the beat, Mr Booth warned.\n\nOfficers taken out by injuries will also deplete forces, he said, adding: \"It's truly awful. These are the images I never want to see, of colleagues being battered just for doing their job.\"\n\nThe far-right has drawn widespread condemnation as the organising force behind scenes of disorder in multiple towns and cities in the wake of the killings of three young girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect, later identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana from Lancashire, was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nBricks, chairs and bottles have been pelted at officers, mosques have been attacked, and a police station along with a number of community facilities across the country, including a library, have been torched in the violence.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said people involved in the clashes \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nAt least 90 arrests have been made across the country and some charges have been brought, with police warning of more to come once footage has been scoured.\n\nSir Keir held crisis talks with ministers on Saturday over the unrest, with Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood telling colleagues \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured.\n\nIn Liverpool, Merseyside Police said about 300 people were involved in violent disorder on County Road, Walton, which included community facilities being set on fire.\n\nThe Spellow Lane Library Hub, which was opened last year to provide support for one of the most deprived communities in the country, suffered severe damage to the ground floor.\n\nPolice said rioters tried to prevent firefighters from accessing the blaze, throwing a missile at the fire engine and breaking the rear window of the cab.\n\nA total of 23 people were arrested on Saturday, Merseyside Police said, including 12 arrests for the disorder in the city centre, nine arrests for the disorder on County Road and two arrests in connection with disorder in Southport.\n\nOne officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss called the behaviour of protesters \"deplorable\", adding: \"The impact of the disorder will be devastating for the people of Walton, but I promise that we are doing everything in our power to arrest those involved and bring them to justice.\"\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre, which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nLancashire Police said more than 20 people were arrested and dispersal orders were issued in parts of Blackpool, Preston and Blackburn.\n\nStaffordshire Police said 10 people were arrested following disorder in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nFurther protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.\n\n\"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n\"There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy.\n\n\"So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you.\"", "source": {"uri":

There are consequences for breaking the law.\"\n\nThe widespread clashes pose the first big challenge to Keir Starmer's new government, which is facing demands to introduce emergency powers to stop further violence and to recall parliament.\n\nOn Saturday bricks were hurled at police officers in Stoke-on-Trent, fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast, and windows of a hotel which has been used to house migrants were smashed in Hull, where three police officers were injured and four people arrested. Later video footage on social media showed shops on fire. Several officers were also injured during \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre, where bricks, bottles and a flare were thrown and two officers needed hospital treatment and six arrests were made. Greater Manchester police said a dispersal notice had been authorised for the city centre. Scuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham's Old Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides.\n\nAbout 150 people carrying St George's Cross flags, shouting \"you're not English any more\" and \"paedo Muslims off our street\", were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\". Skirmishes broke out between demonstrators and punks - in town for a festival - in Blackpool, with bottles and chairs thrown.\n\nIn Bristol, police kept protesters and counter protesters apart before a group headed to a hotel used to house asylum seekers.\n\nThe need for urgent political intervention was stressed by the government's independent adviser on political violence and disruption, Lord Walney, who told the Observer that new emergency powers may be needed. \"The system isn't set up to deal with this rolling rabble-rousing being fuelled by far-right actors,\" he said.\n\n\"I think home office ministers may want to look urgently at a new emergency framework - perhaps temporary in nature - that enables police to use the full powers of arrest to prevent people gathering where there is clear intent to fuel violent disorder.\"\n\nKeir Starmer held a meeting of senior ministers on Saturday in which he said police had been given full support to tackle extremists who were attempting \"to sow hate by intimidating communities\". He made clear that the right to freedom of expression and the violent scenes over recent days were \"two very different things\".\n\nLast week's riots followed the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport on Monday. Axel Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims were spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat. In the wake of these messages, far-right protesters - guided by social media - gathered in cities across the country.\n\nA key factor in this spread of online disinformation involved Elon Musk's decision to allow rightwing activists such as Tommy Robinson back onto his social media platform X, said Joe Mulhall, director of research at Hope not Hate, the anti-fascism organisation. \"The initial disinformation and anger was being perpetrated by individuals on Twitter, for example, that have been previously deplatformed,\" he said. \"And now they've been replatformed.\"\n\nRobinson was permanently banned from the platform (then called Twitter) in March 2018, then reinstated in November last year, after Musk bought it. \"We hadn't seen any significant numbers at any demonstrations since 2018,\" Mulhall added.\n\nAn example of the danger posed by the misuse of social media was revealed in Stoke-on-Trent, where police were forced to deny there had been a stabbing, countering claims made on social media. \"There is growing speculation that a stabbing has taken place as a result of the disorder today. We can confirm this information is false and no stabbings have been reported to police or emergency responders, despite videos fuelling speculation on social media,\" police said.\n\nThe danger of such intervention was stressed by Ben-Julian \"BJ\" Harrington, the National Police Chiefs Council lead for public order, who condemned social media disinformation as a cause of last week's disorder.\n\nHe said: \"We had reports today that two people had been stabbed by Muslims in Stoke - it's just not true. There's people out there, not even in this country, circulating and stoking up hatred, division and concerns in communities that they don't care about, don't know and don't understand.\"\n\nHarrington, who was also the NPCC's gold commander in charge of national strategy for Saturday's disorder, said that \"yobs and thugs and criminals\" were responsible. \"This isn't about protests,\" he said. \"This is about violent disorder. This is about people who are descending into communities and causing damage - throwing bricks and bottles and things at cops who work within those communities.\"\n\nForces across England brought officers back from leave to deploy an extra 130 police support units - about 2,000 officers, he revealed. \"Of course there is a limited number of officers, and every one that is taken from a community is not out there solving burglaries.\"\n\nEchoing concerns about the dangers of social media, shadow home secretary James Cleverly called for tech companies to be hauled into Downing Street to ensure they were acting to stop the spread of disinformation on their platforms. However, he was criticised for issuing a statement in which he said Starmer taking the knee had sent \"completely the wrong message\" to protesters, adding that there was \"never a justification for disorder like this\".\n\nThere was also further condemnation of Nigel Farage's role in inciting the violence with his comments about the Southport killings, in which he questioned \"whether the truth is being withheld from us\" after the attack on Monday. Robert Jenrick, one of the favourites in the Tory leadership race, said that the Reform leader's comments did not \"make the situation better\".\n\nLast week's clashes spread four days ago, when more than 100 protesters were arrested on Whitehall, where bottles and cans were thrown at police, while violence also broke out in Hartlepool and in Manchester.\n\nOn Thursday, Starmer announced a new \"national\" response to the disorder linking police forces across the country through shared intelligence and the expanded use of facial recognition.\n\nThen, on Friday, about 500 people, including some parents with their children, gathered in Sunderland city centre, responding to far-right social media posts to turn up and demonstrate. The gathering quickly descended into violence, with masked boys and men throwing missiles, including bricks, stones, beer barrels and scaffolding poles, at riot police.\n\nTen people were arrested and four policemen taken to hospital, one seriously injured. A police station was ransacked and a Citizens Advice Bureau set alight. By Saturday morning, the acrid smell of fire still hung in the air. Shoppers stopped to express their shock at what had happened, with hundreds of residents of all ages gathering on the city's streets with brushes, litter pickers, buckets, bin bags and dust pans.\n\nThe Sunderland Central Labour MP, Lewis Atkinson, said a link could be drawn between the disorder and the ashes of the English Defence League (EDL), which was founded by Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. The EDL has disbanded but its supporters remain active, and Atkinson said evidence suggested a neo-Nazi offshoot of the group was involved in Friday's violence.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use as missiles during the disorder that gripped the city. \"It's an act of sacrilege to disturb someone's gravestone,\" said Rev Jacqui Tyson. \"It's also remarkably lacking in common sense - have you tried to pick up a gravestone?\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

across UK see officers injured as bricks and bottles thrown", "body": "Violent protests across the UK have led to officers being injured as objects such as bricks, chairs and bottles were thrown at police.\n\nMerseyside Police said a number of officers were injured during \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre on Saturday, with one officer being hit on the head by a chair.\n\nCities across the country saw clashes between anti-immigration demonstrators and counter-protesters, with police forming lines with riot shields to keep groups apart.\n\nMinisters prepared to meet on Saturday to discuss the potential for further disorder after a series of violent clashes over the past three days.\n\nIn Liverpool, bricks, bottles and a flare were also thrown at officers as they lined The Strand in the city centre.\n\nAnother officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nIn Hull, Humberside Police Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore said officers have \"faced eggs and bottles being thrown\" as windows were smashed at the hotel which has housed migrants.\n\nGreater Manchester Police said a dispersal notice had been authorised for the city centre and Merseyside Police said greater stop and search powers had been granted for officers to deal with planned demonstrations.\n\nScuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham's Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides, and chants of \"England till I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" were drowned out by boos from counter-protesters.\n\nAt least three people were led away in handcuffs in the East Midlands city.\n\nAround 150 people carrying St George flags shouting \"You're not English any more\" and \"Paedo Muslims off our street\" were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\".\n\nSkirmishes broke out between demonstrators and punks in Blackpool, with bottles and chairs being thrown and wood wielded.\n\nCleveland Police denied claims that the organiser of a march in Middlesbrough on Sunday had been arrested on terrorism charges.\n\nThe force issued a statement saying a 29-year-old man had been arrested on Friday over firearms offences after Mr Robinson had posted: \"Lad who organised Middlesbrough march been locked up on terrorism charges.\"\n\nThe string of violent incidents began in Southport on Tuesday, where demonstrators attacked police and set cars on fire the day after three girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nThe weekend protests followed a night of \"unforgivable\" violence in Sunderland, which saw a Citizens Advice office burned down.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use for missiles during widespread violence in the city, adding that it was \"an act of sacrilege\".\n\nThe far right has drawn condemnation from MPs across the political spectrum after disorder in London, Manchester, Southport and Hartlepool over the past three days.\n\nCleveland Police said two boys, aged 11 and 14, have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder after the protests in Hartlepool.\n\nThe EDL has disbanded but its supporters remain active, and Mr Atkinson said evidence suggested a Nazi offshoot of the group was involved in the violence in his constituency on Friday, in which a police station was torched and a mosque attacked.\n\nNorthumbria Police said four officers were injured during the violence in Sunderland and 12 people have been arrested.\n\nQari Asim, chairman of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, said the Muslim community is \"deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far-right groups across the country\".\n\nCampaign group Hope Not Hate has identified more than 30 events taking place.\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nViolence later erupted outside a mosque in the town and 53 police officers and three police dogs were injured.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer later condemned \"thugs\" who had travelled to the town to cause unrest.\n\nThe unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, evoking the scale of public disorder last seen during the 2011 riots.\n\nThere were a series of clashes in August 2011 in cities and towns across England, which started in Tottenham Hale, north-east London, after the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police on August 4.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

In Liverpool, far-right thugs pelted officers with bricks and bottles who in return used tear gas as they struggled to keep apart protesters and counter-protesters.\n\nMerseyside Police said a number of officers were injured during the confrontations and condemned the \"despicable behaviour\".\n\nBricks were thrown at officers in Stoke-on-Trent, fireworks were thrown in exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast and windows of a hotel which has been used to house migrants were smashed in Hull.\n\nScuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham, with bottles thrown from both sides, and chants of \"England 'til I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" drowned out by boos from the anti-racism counter-protesters.\n\nAround 150 people carrying St George's flags shouting \"you're not English any more\" and \"paedo Muslims off our street\" were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\".\n\nIn Hull, four people were arrested after three officers were hurt during a protest in which a group of people targeted a hotel which houses asylum seekers.\n\nHumberside Police Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore said officers faced eggs and bottles being thrown as windows were smashed at the hotel which has housed migrants.\n\nThe weekend protests followed a night of \"unforgivable\" violence in Sunderland, which saw a Citizens Advice Bureau office burned down and a police centre looted. Four police officers were injured in clashes with far-right protesters and 10 arrests were made.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use as missiles during widespread violence in the city, adding that they were guilty of \"an act of sacrilege\".\n\nMore than 35 \"Enough is Enough\" protests are planned across the UK this weekend along with several counter-protests led by groups such as Stand Up to Racism.\n\nThe widespread disruption has torn through the country this week in the wake of the Southport stabbings, where three young girls were killed at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Merseyside on Monday.\n\nFalse claims spread on social media that the suspect was an asylum seeker, with police forced to make the unusual move of denying the supposed name of the suspect that was circulating online.\n\nAmid continued fears over the threat from the far-right, a judge on Thursday named the stabbing suspect as Axel Rudakubana, 17, in an attempt to counter false information on social media.\n\nHowever, it has done little to dissuade far-right groups in the UK who are utilising the false online information to push anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\nChair of Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, Qari Asim, said the Muslim community is \"deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far-right groups across the country\".\n\nHe said: \"This intimidation and violence is the inevitable, devastating, outcome of rising Islamophobia that has been enabled to fester on social media, in parts of the mainstream media and by some populist leaders.\"\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nViolence later erupted outside a mosque in the town and 53 police officers and three police dogs were injured.\n\nOn Wednesday, 100 people were arrested in Whitehall as the disorder descended onto the capital as far-right protesters threw flares towards Downing Street and the Cenotaph. Further violence broke out in Manchester, Aldershot and Hartlepool.\n\nCommunities in Sunderland, blighted with far-right violence on Friday evening, started a clean-up operation in the city on Saturday.\n\nBrett Redmayne, 43, saw the aftermath of the violence on Saturday after a police office was looted and photos on social media show a blackened Citizens Advice Bureau office which appeared to have been set alight.\n\nMr Redmayne said: \"The atmosphere around the city with the hundreds that showed up was one of support and unity.\n\n\"These people who rioted don't speak for Sunderland and we are ashamed and embarrassed. This morning, though, we all wanted to show support and help clean the city.\n\n\"I saw smashed windows and glass, but the council had worked hard as well through the night to clean a lot up, credit has to go to Sunderland Council.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper",

It has a massive effect on already significant under-resourcing.\"\n\nSome areas may see a diminished police presence as a result of less robust preventative patrols because officers \"can't be in two places at once\", he said.\n\nScanning CCTV and other footage in incident rooms to identify suspects and deploying to the scene of disorder means fewer staff on the beat, Mr Booth added.\n\nOfficers taken out by injuries will also deplete forces, he said, adding: \"It's truly awful. These are the images I never want to see, of colleagues being battered just for doing their job.\"\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect, later identified as a 17-year-old from Lancashire, was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nOfficers have been pelted with bricks, chairs and bottles, mosques have been attacked, and a police station in Sunderland along with a number of community facilities across the country have been torched in the violence.\n\nSir Keir held crisis talks with ministers on Saturday over the unrest, with Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood telling colleagues \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured.\n\nThe Spellow Lane Library Hub, which was opened last year to provide support for one of the most deprived communities in the country, suffered severe damage to the ground floor.\n\nPolice said rioters tried to prevent firefighters from accessing the blaze, throwing a missile at the fire engine and breaking the rear window of the cab.\n\nA total of 23 people were arrested on Saturday, Merseyside Police said, including 12 arrests for the disorder in the city centre, nine arrests for the disorder on County Road and two arrests in connection with disorder in Southport.\n\nOne officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss called the behaviour of protesters \"deplorable\", adding: \"The impact of the disorder will be devastating for the people of Walton, but I promise that we are doing everything in our power to arrest those involved and bring them to justice.\"\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre, which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nLancashire Police said more than 20 people were arrested and dispersal orders were issued in parts of Blackpool, Preston and Blackburn.\n\nStaffordshire Police said 10 people were arrested following disorder in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\n\"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n\"There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy.\n\n\"So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you.\"", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com",

In Liverpool, far-right thugs pelted officers with bricks and bottles who in return used tear gas as they struggled to keep apart protesters and counter-protesters.\n\nMerseyside Police said a number of officers were injured during the confrontations and condemned the \"despicable behaviour\".\n\nBricks were thrown at officers in Stoke-on-Trent, fireworks were thrown in exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast and windows of a hotel which has been used to house migrants were smashed in Hull.\n\nScuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham, with bottles thrown from both sides, and chants of \"England 'til I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" drowned out by boos from the anti-racism counter-protesters.\n\nAround 150 people carrying St George's flags shouting \"you're not English any more\" and \"paedo Muslims off our street\" were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\".\n\nIn Hull, four people were arrested after three officers were hurt during a protest in which a group of people targeted a hotel which houses asylum seekers.\n\nHumberside Police Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore said officers faced eggs and bottles being thrown as windows were smashed at the hotel which has housed migrants.\n\nThe weekend protests followed a night of \"unforgivable\" violence in Sunderland, which saw a Citizens Advice Bureau office burned down and a police centre looted. Four police officers were injured in clashes with far-right protesters and 10 arrests were made.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use as missiles during widespread violence in the city, adding that they were guilty of \"an act of sacrilege\".\n\nMore than 35 \"Enough is Enough\" protests are planned across the UK this weekend along with several counter-protests led by groups such as Stand Up to Racism.\n\nThe widespread disruption has torn through the country this week in the wake of the Southport stabbings, where three young girls were killed at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Merseyside on Monday.\n\nFalse claims spread on social media that the suspect was an asylum seeker, with police forced to make the unusual move of denying the supposed name of the suspect that was circulating online.\n\nAmid continued fears over the threat from the far-right, a judge on Thursday named the stabbing suspect as Axel Rudakubana, 17, in an attempt to counter false information on social media.\n\nHowever, it has done little to dissuade far-right groups in the UK who are utilising the false online information to push anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\nChairman of Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, Qari Asim, said the Muslim community is \"deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far-right groups across the country\".\n\nHe said: \"This intimidation and violence is the inevitable, devastating, outcome of rising Islamophobia that has been enabled to fester on social media, in parts of the mainstream media and by some populist leaders.\"\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nViolence later erupted outside a mosque in the town and 53 police officers and three police dogs were injured.\n\nOn Wednesday, 100 people were arrested in Whitehall as the disorder descended onto the capital as far-right protesters threw flares towards Downing Street and the Cenotaph. Further violence broke out in Manchester, Aldershot and Hartlepool.\n\nCommunities in Sunderland, blighted with far-right violence on Friday evening, started a clean-up operation in the city on Saturday.\n\nBrett Redmayne, 43, saw the aftermath of the violence on Saturday after a police office was looted and photos on social media show a blackened Citizens Advice Bureau office which appeared to have been set alight.\n\nMr Redmayne said: \"The atmosphere around the city with the hundreds that showed up was one of support and unity.\n\n\"These people who rioted don't speak for Sunderland and we are ashamed and embarrassed. This morning, though, we all wanted to show support and help clean the city.\n\n\"I saw smashed windows and glass, but the council had worked hard as well through the night to clean a lot up, credit has to go to Sunderland Council.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper",

They left dozens of officers requiring hospital treatment and have already led to the arrests of a total of 33 suspects.\"\n\nPolice have \"all the resources they need\" to deal with riots and disorder, a minister said earlier.\n\nPrime minister Keir Starmer has given police his \"full backing\" to take any action necessary to respond to \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\" after scenes of disorder in England and Northern Ireland this week.\n\nTeams worked through the night to reopen streets in cities such as Hull, where volunteers armed with brushes turned up from 7am to assist council crews.\n\n\"Yesterday we saw the worst of Hull but already today we have seen the best,\" councillor Jack Haines of Hull City Council said.\n\nAsked whether enough is being done to respond to the disorder, policing minister Dame Diana said the government has been \"reassured\" that forces are able to meet the scale of the challenge.\n\n\"The police have made it very clear that they have all the resources they need at the moment ... they have the powers that they need,\" the minister told BBC News.\n\nThe far right has drawn widespread condemnation as the organising force behind scenes of disorder in multiple towns and cities in the wake of the killings of three young girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect, later identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana from Lancashire, was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nMr Keir held crisis talks with ministers on Saturday over the unrest, with justice secretary Shabana Mahmood telling colleagues \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured.\n\n[ Belfast disorder: Use of Irish flag by protesters 'repugnant', says TaoiseachOpens in new window ]\n\nFaith leaders across Merseyside have called on communities to \"remain calm and peaceful\" in the aftermath of the Southport killings, saying some people \"have sought to use the tragedy to create division and hate\".\n\nThe joint statement signed by several faith leaders said: \"Division can destroy the very relationships and environment that we depend upon every day of our lives and there is no place for hate in our communities.\n\n\"It can - and has - left communities in fear and has put people in danger.\" - PA", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com",

There are consequences for breaking the law.\"\n\nThe widespread nature of the clashes poses the first major challenge to Keir Starmer's new government, which is now facing demands to introduce emergency powers to stop further violence and to recall parliament.\n\nIn the protests that spread across the nation, bricks were hurled at police officers in Stoke-on-Trent, fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast, and windows of a hotel which has been used to house migrants were smashed in Hull, where three police officers were injured and four people arrested. Several officers were also injured during \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre, where bricks, bottles and a flare were thrown and one officer hit on the head with a chair. Greater Manchester police said a dispersal notice had been authorised for the city centre and scuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham's Old Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides.\n\nAbout 150 people carrying St George's Cross flags, shouting \"you're not English any more\" and \"paedo Muslims off our street\", were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\". Skirmishes broke out between demonstrators and punks - in town for a festival - in Blackpool, with bottles and chairs being thrown.\n\nThe need for urgent political intervention was stressed by the government's independent adviser on political violence and disruption, Lord Walney, who told the Observer that new emergency powers may be needed to deal with the outbreaks of violence. \"The system isn't set up to deal with this rolling rabble rousing being fuelled by far-right actors,\" he said.\n\n\"I think home office ministers maywant to look urgently at a new emergency framework - perhaps temporary in nature - that enables police to use the full powers of arrest to prevent people gathering where there is clear intent to fuel violent disorder.\"\n\nKeir Starmer held a meeting of senior ministers on Saturday in which he said police had been given full support to tackle extremists who were attempting \"to sow hate by intimidating communities\". He also made it clear that the right to freedom of expression and the violent scenes over recent days were \"two very different things\".\n\nLast week's riots were set off in the wake of the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport on Monday. Axel Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims were spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat. In the wake of these messages, far-right protesters - guided by social media - gathered in cities across the country.\n\nA key factor in this spread of online disinformation involved Elon Musk's decision to allow rightwing activists such as Tommy Robinson back onto his social media platform X, said Joe Mulhall, director of research at Hope not Hate, the anti-fascism organisation. \"The initial disinformation and anger was being perpetrated by individuals on Twitter, for example, that have been previously deplatformed,\" he said. \"And now they've been replatformed.\"\n\nRobinson was permanently banned from the platform (then called Twitter) in March 2018, then reinstated in November last year, after Musk bought it. \"We hadn't seen any significant numbers at any demonstrations since 2018,\" Mulhall added.\n\nAn example of the danger posed by the misuse of social media was revealed in Stoke-on-Trent, where police were forced to deny there had been a stabbing there, countering claims made on social media. \"There is growing speculation that a stabbing has taken place as a result of the disorder today. We can confirm this information is false and no stabbings have been reported to police or emergency responders, despite videos fuelling speculation on social media,\" police said.\n\nThe danger of such intervention was stressed by Ben-Julian \"BJ\" Harrington, the National Police Chiefs Council lead for public order, who condemned social media disinformation as a cause of last week's disorder.\n\nHe said: \"We had reports today that two people had been stabbed by Muslims in Stoke - it's just not true. There's people out there, not even in this country, circulating and stoking up hatred, division and concerns in communities that they don't care about, don't know and don't understand.\"\n\nHarrington, who was also the NPCC's gold commander in charge of national strategy for Saturday's disorder, said that \"yobs and thugs and criminals\" were responsible. \"This isn't about protests,\" he said. \"This is about violent disorder. This is about people who are descending into communities and causing damage - throwing bricks and bottles and things at cops who work within those communities.\"\n\nForces across England brought officers back from leave to deploy an extra 130 police support units - about 2,000 officers, he revealed. \"Of course there is a limited number of officers, and every one that is taken from a community is not out there solving burglaries.\n\nEchoing concerns about the dangers of social media, shadow home secretary James Cleverly called for tech companies to be hauled into Downing Street to ensure they were acting to stop the spread of disinformation on their platforms. However, he was criticised for issuing a statement in which he said Starmer taking the knee had sent \"completely the wrong message\" to protesters, adding that there was \"never a justification for disorder like this\".\n\nThere was also further condemnation of Nigel Farage's role in inciting the violence with his comments about the Southport killings, in which he questioned \"whether the truth is being withheld from us\" after the attack on Monday. Robert Jenrick, one of the favourites in the Tory leadership race, said that the Reform leader's comments did not \"make the situation better\".\n\nLast week's clashes spread four days ago, when more than 100 protesters were arrested on Whitehall, where bottles and cans were thrown at police, while violence also broke out in Hartlepool and in Manchester.\n\nOn Thursday, Starmer announced a new \"national\" response to the disorder linking police forces across the country through shared intelligence and the expanded use of facial recognition.\n\nThen, on Friday, about 500 people, including some parents with their children, gathered in Sunderland city centre, responding to far-right social media posts to turn up and demonstrate. The gathering quickly descended into violence, with masked boys and men throwing missiles, including bricks, stones, beer barrels and scaffolding poles, at riot police.\n\nTen people were arrested and four policemen taken to hospital, one seriously injured. A police station was ransacked and a Citizens Advice Bureau set alight. By Saturday morning, the acrid smell of fire still hung in the air. Shoppers stopped to express their shock at what had happened, with hundreds of residents of all ages gathering on the city's streets with brushes, litter pickers, buckets, bin bags and dust pans.\n\nSunderland Central Labour MP Lewis Atkinson said a link could be drawn between the disorder and the ashes of the English Defence League (EDL), which was founded by Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. The EDL has disbanded but its supporters remain active, and Atkinson said evidence suggested a Nazi offshoot of the group was involved in Friday's violence.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use as missiles during the disorder that gripped the city. \"It's an act of sacrilege to disturb someone's gravestone,\" said Rev Jacqui Tyson. \"It's also remarkably lacking in common sense - have you tried to pick up a gravestone?\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That includes ensuring there are more prosecutors, more prisons and better prepared courts to make it clear that anyone who engages in this kind of chaos will pay a price.\"\n\nMrs Cooper said perpetrators can be arrested, prosecuted, face financial penalties, imprisonment and travel bans to make communities feel safe.\n\nBut she stopped short of calling parliament, something Conservative leadership candidate Priti Patel had called for earlier in the day. Patel described the government's response to Britain's turmoil as worrying and inadequate.\n\nMs Cooper attended an emergency meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday, who said he would fully support police in taking action against extremists seeking to spread hate by terrorising communities.\n\nPolice are deployed in large numbers in front of protesters at the Enough is Enough demonstration in Piccadilly Circus, London (James Speakman/PA) Police confront protesters in Liverpool (James Speakman/PA)\n\nBut the opposition Home Secretary James Cleverley urged the government to do more to restore public order and send a clear message to the rioters.\n\nThe growing political divide over the response comes as Britain is gripped by yet another round of violence. In Liverpool, far-right rioters hurled bricks and bottles at police, who used tear gas as they tried to keep protesters and counter-protesters apart.\n\nMerseyside Police said several officers were injured in the clashes and condemned the \"cowardly\" actions.\n\nPolice said they arrested 11 people and two officers were hospitalized, one with a broken jaw and another with a broken nose.\n\nThe Liverpool Echo reports that the fire also broke out at Spelling Hub, a library that reopened last year to help people from all walks of life access education and employment.\n\nIn Stoke-on-Trent, bricks were thrown at police, in Belfast, fireworks were thrown between anti-Islam groups and an anti-racism rally, and in Hull, windows were broken at a hotel used to house immigrants.\n\nA scuffle broke out in Nottingham as the two groups faced off. Bottles were thrown from both sides and chants of \"Britain til death\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" were chanted, but were drowned out by the boos of anti-racist protesters.\n\nClashes also broke out between police and protesters in Blackpool (Michael Holmes/PA) Protesters gather in Nottingham, central England (Getty)\n\nAround 150 people, carrying St George flags and chanting \"You are not British any more\", tried to get the paedophile Muslims off our streets, but in Leeds they were outnumbered by a few hundred counter-protesters who chanted \"Get the Nazi scum off our streets\".\n\nIn Hull, three police officers were injured and four people were arrested during protests that led to an attack on a hotel housing refugees.\n\nHumberside Police Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore said police had eggs and bottles thrown at them after windows were broken at a hotel housing migrants.\n\nBristol police have arrested 14 people following violence in the city centre, which Avon and Somerset Police described as completely unacceptable.\n\nPolice said further protests were planned for Sunday and more trouble was likely in the coming days.\n\n\"We know people are going to try to do this again and the police have been prepared and will continue to be prepared,\" said Police Chief BJ Harrington, speaking on public order at the National Police Chiefs' Conference.\n\nWith 130 additional police units deployed across the country, an additional 4,000 trained police officers will be required to be deployed.\n\nEmotions run high during protest outside Belfast City Hall (PA) Protest outside Lucy Leeson refugee hotel in Hull\n\nSo if you are planning to cause trouble and chaos, our message is very simple: We will be watching you.\n\nThe weekend protests follow an overnight bout of unforgivable violence in Sunderland, which saw a Citizens Advice Bureau office burnt down and a police centre ransacked. Four police officers were injured and 10 arrested in clashes with far-right protesters.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Cathedral said thugs had committed desecration acts by trying to smash gravestones to use as missiles during the violence in the city.\n\nMore than 35 'Enough is Enough' protests are planned across the UK this weekend, with several counter-protests led by groups such as Stand Up to Racism.\n\nThere has been widespread chaos across the country this week following the Southport stabbing that left three young girls murdered at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Merseyside on Monday.\n\nFalse claims that the suspect was an asylum seeker spread on social media, forcing police to take the unusual step of denying the suspect's alleged name had been circulated online.\n\nPolice arrested several people at various protests (Getty)\n\nAmid ongoing concerns about the far-right threat, a judge on Thursday named the stabbing suspect as 17-year-old Axel Rudacubana, seeking to refute misinformation circulating on social media.\n\nBut this has done little to stop far-right groups in Britain from using misinformation online to promote anti-immigrant and anti-Islam sentiments.\n\nQari Asim, chairman of the National Advisory Council of Mosques and Imams, said the Muslim community was deeply concerned and anxious about protests planned by far-right groups across the country.\n\nHe said: These threats and violence are the inevitable and destructive result of Islamophobia, exacerbated by social media, parts of the mainstream media and some populist leaders.\n\nThousands of people attended a memorial service in Southport on Tuesday to remember six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Agiar.\n\nViolence later broke out outside a mosque in the town, injuring 53 police officers and three police dogs.\n\nMore than 100 people were arrested in Whitehall on Wednesday as chaos spread to the capital after far-right protesters threw stun grenades at Downing Street and the Cenotaph. There was further violence in Manchester, Aldershot and Hartlepool.\n\nCommunities in Sunderland devastated by far-right violence on Friday evening began a city clean-up operation on Saturday.\n\nBrett Redmayne, 43, saw the aftermath of the violence after a police station was ransacked on Saturday, with pictures posted on social media showing the Citizens Advice Service office blackened and seemingly set ablaze.\n\nRedmayne said: The mood across the city, with hundreds of people gathered, was one of support and unity.\n\nThese rioters do not represent Sunderland and we are ashamed and embarrassed. But this morning, we all wanted to show our support and help clean up the city.\n\nI saw broken windows and glass, but the council also worked hard all night to clean it up. Thanks to Sunderland Council.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [],

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nRiot police have been involved in face-offs with protesters in parts of the UK as ministers prepare to meet to discuss the potential for further disorder.\n\nPlanned demonstrations in cities across the country got under way on Saturday as tensions remained high after the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Southport, Merseyside, on Monday.\n\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nMerseyside Police said a number of officers were injured during \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre on Saturday, with one officer being hit on the head by a chair.\n\nRead more: Amazon has a \u00a323 'saviour' cooling bed sheet for hot nights\n\nCompetition: Win family tickets to London Zoo with free LNR train travel from Birmingham\n\nBricks, bottles and a flare were also thrown at officers as they lined the The Strand in the city centre.\n\nAnother officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nElsewhere on Saturday, bricks were thrown at officers in Stoke-on-Trent, fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast, and windows of a hotel which has been used to house migrants were smashed in Hull.\n\nGreater Manchester Police said a dispersal notice had been authorised for the city centre and Merseyside Police said greater stop and search powers had been granted for officers to deal with planned demonstrations.\n\nScuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham's Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides, and chants of \"England till I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" were drowned out by boos from counter-protesters.\n\nOn Saturday it was not possible to search \"Tommy Robinson\" on TikTok, with the social media platform instead showing the message: \"This phrase may be associated with behaviour or content that violates our guidelines.\"\n\nCleveland Police denied claims that the organiser of a march in Middlesbrough on Sunday had been arrested on terrorism charges. The force issued a statement saying a 29-year-old man had been arrested on Friday over firearms offences after Mr Robinson had posted: \"Lad who organised Middlesbrough march been locked up on terrorism charges.\"\n\nThe weekend protests followed a night of \"unforgivable\" violence in Sunderland, which saw a Citizens Advice office burned down.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use for missiles during widespread violence in the city, adding that it was \"an act of sacrilege\".\n\nSunderland Central Labour MP Lewis Atkinson said a link could be drawn between the disorder in his constituency on Friday and the ashes of the EDL, which was founded by Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.\n\nThe far-right has drawn condemnation from MPs across the political spectrum after disorder in London, Manchester, Southport and Hartlepool over the past three days.\n\nCleveland Police said two boys, aged 11 and 14, have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder after the protests in Hartlepool.\n\nThe EDL has disbanded but its supporters remain active, and Mr Atkinson said evidence suggested a Nazi offshoot of the group was involved in the violence in his constituency on Friday, in which a police station was torched and a mosque attacked.\n\nNorthumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall said four officers were injured during the violence in Sunderland and 10 people have been arrested.\n\nHe told reporters that those involved in the disorder should \"expect to be met with the full force of the law\", adding: \"This was not a protest, this was unforgivable violence and disorder.\"\n\nQari Asim, chairman of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, said the Muslim community is \"deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far-right groups across the country\".\n\nAn \u2060extra 70 prosecutors will be on standby this weekend to charge people who set out to cause violent disorder as the authorities prepare to deal with dozens of demonstrations.\n\nCampaign group Hope Not Hate has identified more than 30 events taking place.\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nViolence later erupted outside a mosque in the town and 53 police officers and three police dogs were injured.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer later condemned \"thugs\" who had travelled to the town to cause unrest.\n\nThe unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, evoking the scale of public disorder last seen during the 2011 riots.\n\nThere were a series of clashes in August 2011 in cities and towns across England, which started in Tottenham Hale, north-east London, after the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police on August 4.", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nViolent protests spread across the UK on Saturday with far-right thugs hurling bricks, bottles and chairs at the police as demonstrations took part in more than half a dozen cities.\n\nHome secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the \"thuggery\" and \"criminal disorder\" that has followed in the wake of the tragic Southport stabbings, warning that anyone involved in the ongoing violence \"will pay the price\".\n\n\"Criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets,\" she said on Saturday afternoon following clashes in cities including Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Hull, Nottingham and Belfast.\n\n\"We've been clear to the police that they have our full backing in taking the strongest possible action against perpetrators, including making sure that there are more prosecutors, there are sufficient prison places and also that the courts stand ready because anyone who engages in this kind of disorder needs to be clear that they will pay the price,\" the Labour MP added.\n\nMs Cooper said perpetrators face arrests, prosecution, financial penalties, imprisonment and travel bans to ensure that communities can feel safe.\n\nHowever, she stopped short of recalling Parliament, a demand made earlier in the day by Tory leadership hopeful Priti Patel, who described the government's response to disorder in the UK as \"troubling and inadequate\".\n\nMs Cooper attended emergency talks with prime minister Keir Starmer on Saturday, who said the police have his full support to take action against the \"extremists\" on the street who were trying to \"sow hate\" by intimidating communities.\n\nBut shadow home secretary James Cleverly urged the government to \"do more\" to restore public order and \"send a clear message to the thugs\".\n\nThe growing political row over the response comes as Britain was engulfed in another day of violence. In Liverpool, far-right thugs pelted officers with bricks and bottles who in return used tear gas as they struggled to keep apart protesters and counter-protesters.\n\nMerseyside Police said a number of officers were injured during the confrontations and condemned the \"despicable behaviour\".\n\nBricks were thrown at officers in Stoke-on-Trent, fireworks were thrown in exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast and windows of a hotel which has been used to house migrants were smashed in Hull.\n\nScuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham, with bottles thrown from both sides, and chants of \"England 'til I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" drowned out by boos from the anti-racism counter-protesters.\n\nAround 150 people carrying St George's flags shouting \"you're not English any more\" and \"paedo Muslims off our street\" were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\".\n\nIn Hull, four people were arrested after three officers were hurt during a protest in which a group of people targeted a hotel which houses asylum seekers.\n\nHumberside Police Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore said officers faced eggs and bottles being thrown as windows were smashed at the hotel which has housed migrants.\n\nThe weekend protests followed a night of \"unforgivable\" violence in Sunderland, which saw a Citizens Advice Bureau office burned down and a police centre looted. Four police officers were injured in clashes with far-right protesters and 10 arrests were made.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use as missiles during widespread violence in the city, adding that they were guilty of \"an act of sacrilege\".\n\nMore than 35 \"Enough is Enough\" protests are planned across the UK this weekend along with several counter-protests led by groups such as Stand Up to Racism.\n\nThe widespread disruption has torn through the country this week in the wake of the Southport stabbings, where three young girls were killed at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Merseyside on Monday.\n\nFalse claims spread on social media that the suspect was an asylum seeker, with police forced to make the unusual move of denying the supposed name of the suspect that was circulating online.\n\nAmid continued fears over the threat from the far-right, a judge on Thursday named the stabbing suspect as Axel Rudakubana, 17, in an attempt to counter false information on social media.\n\nHowever, it has done little to dissuade far-right groups in the UK who are utilising the false online information to push anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\nChairman of Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, Qari Asim, said the Muslim community is \"deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far-right groups across the country\".\n\nHe said: \"This intimidation and violence is the inevitable, devastating, outcome of rising Islamophobia that has been enabled to fester on social media, in parts of the mainstream media and by some populist leaders.\"\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nViolence later erupted outside a mosque in the town and 53 police officers and three police dogs were injured.\n\nOn Wednesday, 100 people were arrested in Whitehall as the disorder descended onto the capital as far-right protesters threw flares towards Downing Street and the Cenotaph. Further violence broke out in Manchester, Aldershot and Hartlepool.\n\nCommunities in Sunderland, blighted with far-right violence on Friday evening, started a clean-up operation in the city on Saturday.\n\nBrett Redmayne, 43, saw the aftermath of the violence on Saturday after a police office was looted and photos on social media show a blackened Citizens Advice Bureau office which appeared to have been set alight.\n\nMr Redmayne said: \"The atmosphere around the city with the hundreds that showed up was one of support and unity.\n\n\"These people who rioted don't speak for Sunderland and we are ashamed and embarrassed. This morning, though, we all wanted to show support and help clean the city.\n\n\"I saw smashed windows and glass, but the council had worked hard as well through the night to clean a lot up, credit has to go to Sunderland Council.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Merseyside Police said greater stop and search powers had been granted for officers to deal with planned demonstrations.\n\nScuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham's Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides and chants of \"England until I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" were drowned out by boos from the counter-protesters.\n\nAround 150 people carrying St George's flags shouting \"You're not English any more\" and \"paedo Muslims off our street\" were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\".\n\nCleveland Police denied claims that the organiser of a march in Middlesbrough on Sunday had been arrested on terrorism charges.\n\nThe force issued a statement saying a 29-year-old man was arrested on Friday over firearms offences after Mr Robinson had posted on Friday: \"Lad who organised Middlesbrough march has been locked up on terrorism charges.\"\n\nThe weekend protests followed a night of \"unforgivable\" violence in Sunderland, which saw a Citizens Advice Bureau office burned down.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use as missiles during widespread violence in the city, adding that they were guilty of \"an act of sacrilege\".\n\nSunderland Central Labour MP Lewis Atkinson said a link could be drawn between the disorder in his constituency on Friday and the ashes of the English Defence League (EDL), which was founded by Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.\n\nThe far right has drawn condemnation from MPs across the political spectrum after disorder in London, Manchester, Southport and Hartlepool over the past three days.\n\nCleveland Police said two boys, aged 11 and 14, have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder after the protests in Hartlepool.\n\nThe EDL has disbanded but its supporters remain active, and Mr Atkinson said evidence suggested a Nazi offshoot of the group was involved in the violence in his constituency on Friday, in which a police station was torched and a mosque attacked.\n\nNorthumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall said four officers were injured during the violence in Sunderland and 10 people have been arrested.\n\nHe told reporters that those involved in the disorder should \"expect to be met with the full force of the law\", adding: \"This was not a protest, this was unforgivable violence and disorder.\"\n\nChairman of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, Qari Asim, said the Muslim community is \"deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far-right groups across the country\".\n\nAn \u2060extra 70 prosecutors will be drafted in on standby this weekend to charge people who set out to cause violent disorder as the authorities prepare to deal with dozens of demonstrations planned over the next two days.\n\nCampaign group Hope Not Hate has identified more than 30 events taking place.\n\nThousands of people had paid their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nViolence later erupted

Dozens have been arrested at rallies across the UK following the fallout from the Southport killing of three young girls on Monday (July 29).\n\nFollowing misinformation spread online about the case, some far-right factions have been protesting against refugees entering the country. Last night (August 3) thousands took to Bristol's streets with several causing mass disorder. Sixteeen people have currently been arrested and police say more arrests should follow after video footage has been reviewed.\n\nNow a similar protest had been organised for 7pm on Monday, August 5, at Plymouth's Guildhall. Slogans like \"stop the boats\", \"your country needs you\" and \"keep our children safe\" are being used to publicise the demonstration. In response, counter-protesters have planned to meet in the same location an hour earlier to put a stop to it, as PlymouthLive reports.\n\nOrganisers say: \"We must have the largest numbers possible for a counter-protest. That means we're calling everyone to Guildhall Square, Royal Parade, from 6pm with placards (some will need to be made) against racism and fascism, and banners from organisations wherever possible\".\n\nThey add: \"We've done it before in Plymouth and we'll do it again. Refugees are welcome here!\" It comes as a minister said police have \"all the resources they need\" to deal with riots and disorder.\n\nIt comes amid rising concerns over the prospect of further violence sweeping across parts of the country. Courts could sit overnight to ensure \"thugs\" who \"maraud our streets\" are brought to justice, while forces have measures in place to draft in extra officers to tackle potential unrest, Dame Diana Johnson has indicated.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has given police his \"full backing\" to take any action necessary to respond to \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\" after scenes of disorder in England and Northern Ireland this week.\n\nBut concerns have been raised that officers may be left unable to deal with other incidents as a result of the need to focus efforts on the prospect of ongoing rioting, with the Police Federation warning: \"There is a cost to all this.\"\n\nAsked whether enough is being done to respond to the disorder, policing minister Dame Diana said the Government has been \"reassured\" that forces are able to meet the scale of the challenge.\n\n\"The police have made it very clear that they have all the resources they need at the moment... they have the powers that they need,\" the minister told BBC News. \"There is no need to bring in the Army and there has been no discussion about that.\n\n\"(Police) have long-standing plans in place for mutual aid if they need to put extra police officers into certain parts of the country.\"\n\nDespite the Government recently announcing the early release of some offenders to ease prison overcrowding, Dame Diana said there is jail capacity to hand custodial sentences to those \"marauding our streets\".\n\nAsked whether courts could be forced to sit overnight to fast-track prosecutions as they did for the 2011 riots, she said the Government will do \"whatever it takes\" to ensure people are brought to justice.\n\nDeputy national chair of the Police Federation, Brian Booth, told the PA news agency that forces can handle the unrest in the short-term, but it will likely put further pressure on already-stretched resources.\n\n\"There is a cost to all this,\" he said. \"Every day this continues means a certain amount of officer hours are being taken away from other policing duties. It has a massive effect on already significant under-resourcing.\"\n\nSome areas may see a diminished police presence as a result of less robust preventative patrols because officers \"can't be in two places at once\", he said.\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured. At least 100 arrests have been made across the country and some charges have been brought, with police warning of more to come once footage has been scoured.\n\nSir Keir held crisis talks with ministers on Saturday over the unrest, with Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood telling colleagues \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nIn Liverpool, Merseyside Police said about 300 people were involved in violent disorder on County Road, Walton, which included community facilities being set on fire.\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre, which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\". Lancashire Police said more than 20 people were arrested and dispersal orders were issued in parts of Blackpool, Preston and Blackburn.\n\nStaffordshire Police said 10 people were arrested following disorder in Stoke-on-Trent. Further protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.\n\nTeams worked through the night to reopen streets in cities like Hull, where volunteers armed with brushes turned up from 7am to assist council crews.\n\n\"Yesterday we saw the worst of Hull but already today we have seen the best,\" councillor Jack Haines of Hull City Council said. \"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n\"There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy. So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you.\"", "source": {"uri": "devonlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devon Live"}, "authors":

attacked.\n\nNorthumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall said four officers were injured during the violence in Sunderland and 10 people have been arrested.\n\nHe told reporters that those involved in the disorder should \"expect to be met with the full force of the law\", adding: \"This was not a protest, this was unforgivable violence and disorder.\"\n\nChairman of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, Qari Asim, said the Muslim community is \"deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far-right groups across the country\".\n\nAn \u2060extra 70 prosecutors will be drafted in on standby this weekend to charge people who set out to cause violent disorder as the authorities prepare to deal with dozens of demonstrations planned over the next two days.\n\nCampaign group Hope Not Hate has identified more than 30 events taking place.\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nViolence later erupted outside a mosque in the town and 53 police officers and three police dogs were injured.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer later condemned \"thugs\" who had travelled to the town to cause unrest.\n\nThe unrest poses the biggest challenge yet of Starmer's premiership, evoking the scale of public disorder last seen during the 2011 riots.\n\nThere were a series of riots in August 2011 in cities and towns across England, which started in Tottenham Hale, north-east London, after the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police on 4 August.", "source": {"uri": "thejournal.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheJournal.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@thejournal.ie", "name":

violent disorder which broke out in Sunderland on Thursday.\n\nIn footage released by Northumbria Police, officers are seen kicking in a glass door at an address in the city on Saturday morning.\n\nA female officer is seen thumping on the door shouting: \"Police, open the door!\" while her colleagues scale the garden fence.\n\nThe female officer then tells another cop: \"There's someone in, can you put the door through?\"\n\nA male officer then boots the glass panel before cops swarm inside the end-terraced property.\n\nMinutes later a red-haired woman wearing a pink and black lacy nightie is led out in handcuffs.\n\nPolice say a 43-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder.\n\nAnother 55-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of provoking violence.\n\nChief Superintendent Mark Hall warned troublemakers: \"Make no mistake, if you were involved, expect to be met with the full force of the law.\"\n\nMore than 90 arrests were made following scenes of disorder across the UK on Saturday with warnings that further violence is likely in the coming days.\n\nTowns and cities in England and Northern Ireland saw clashes between anti-immigration demonstrators and counter-protesters on Saturday, with police officers attacked and injured, with many more arrests promised.\n\nThe string of violent incidents over the past few days began on Tuesday in Southport, after three girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said people involved in the clashes \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the police have his \"full support\" to take action against \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\" by intimidating communities.\n\nHe held emergency talks with ministers over the unrest in parts of England.\n\nThe far right has drawn condemnation from MPs across the political spectrum after disorder in London, Manchester, Southport and Hartlepool came before Saturday's violence.\n\nArrests have been made across the country with police warning of more to come once CCTV, social media and body-worn camera footage has been scoured.\n\nJustice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told ministers \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nCourts could also sit for 24 hours a day as they did for the 2011 riots, according to one report.\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol,

A 17-year-old male has been arrested and charged with murder and attempted murder in connection with the attack.\n\nRiots have erupted in various towns and cities, fueled by false information that spread rapidly on social media which claimed that the suspect in the Southport knife attack was a radical Muslim migrant.\n\nPolice have clarified that the suspect, Axel Rudakubana, 17, was born in Wales to Rwandan parents. Despite this, protests by anti-immigration and anti-immigrant demonstrators have continued, escalating into violence, arson, and looting.\n\nAlthough suspects under 18 are typically not named in the UK, Judge Andrew Menary has allowed Rudakubana's identification to help combat the spread of misinformation.\n\nDemonstrations turn violent\n\nOn Saturday, Merseyside Police said a number of officers were injured in \"serious disorder\" in the center of Liverpool, about 20 miles away from the scene of the stabbing attack.\n\nA few hundred anti-fascist demonstrators gathered across from Liverpool's Lime Street station at lunchtime, calling for unity and tolerance, chanting \"refugees are welcome here\" and \"Nazi scum, off our streets\", a BBC report stated.\n\nThey marched down to the city's riverside to confront around one thousand anti-immigration protestors - some of whom were shouting Islamophobic slurs.\n\nPolice in riot gear with dogs struggled to keep the two sides apart and reinforcements were called to try and maintain order.\n\nThe unrest continued into the early hours of Sunday morning, with fireworks launched towards police officers wearing riot gear.\n\nAlso Read | Protests turn violent in Sunderland as UK unrest spreads after Southport killings\n\nPolice also said they had made multiple arrests in Bristol, which is arguably the most left-wing city in the U.K, during a standoff that saw as right-wing activists heavily outnumbered by their opponents. In Bristol, far-right activists moved from the city center and headed to a hotel that has been used to house asylum seekers.\n\nIn Hull, authorities stated that four people were arrested and three officers suffered injuries as they handled protests involving bottle-throwing. Mosques across the country have been advised to tighten their security until the situation is contained.\n\nOn Saturday, Merseyside Police reported that several officers were injured during \"serious disorder\" in central Liverpool, about 20 miles from the stabbing attack's location.\n\nA few hundred anti-fascist demonstrators gathered near Liverpool's Lime Street station at lunchtime, calling for unity and tolerance. They chanted slogans such as \"refugees are welcome here\" and \"Nazi scum, off our streets,\" according to a BBC report.\n\nThe group marched to the city's riverside to confront around one thousand anti-immigration protesters, some of whom were shouting Islamophobic slurs.\n\nPolice in riot gear, accompanied by dogs, struggled to separate the two sides and called for reinforcements to maintain order. The unrest continued into the early hours of Sunday morning, with fireworks being launched at officers in riot gear.\n\nIn Hull, authorities reported four arrests and three officers injured during protests involving bottle-throwing. Mosques across the country have been advised to enhance security until the situation is under control.\n\nIn Bristol, protesters and counter-protesters faced off in a tense standoff. One group was heard singing \"Rule Britannia,\" chanting \"England 'til I die,\" and demanding \"We want our country back,\" while the opposing side countered with chants of \"refugees are welcome here.\"\n\nElsewhere, in Stoke-on-Trent, central England, bricks were thrown at police officers. Scuffles have also been reported in Belfast, Manchester, and Nottingham.\n\nMore than 90 people have been arrested across the country so far, the BBC reported on Sunday.\n\nPM Starmer's response\n\nBritain's new Labour Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, convened a crisis meeting with ministers on Saturday. During the meeting, he assured that police have the government's \"full support\" in taking decisive action against \"extremists\" who are attacking officers and attempting to \"sow hate,\" according to a statement from No. 10 Downing Street.\n\nAlso Read | British PM Starmer warns social media firms after Southport misinformation fuels riots\n\nLater \"a spokesperson for Starmer said that there is no excuse for violence of any kind\" and reaffirmed that the government fully supports the police in taking all necessary measures to ensure public safety.\n\n\"The right to freedom of expression and the violent disorder we have witnessed are two very different things.\"\n\nWhich are the far-right groups involved?\n\nAccording to New York Times, the violence has been driven by online disinformation and extremist right-wing groups intent on creating disorder after the stabbing attack. A range of far-right factions and individuals, including neo-Nazis, violent soccer fans, and anti-Muslim campaigners, have promoted and taken part in the unrest.\n\nOther far-right groups spread information about the protest on social media, including British Movement, a neo-Nazi group. Images of the protests examined by Hope not Hate showed some people with Nazi tattoos.\n\nAfter the disorder in Southport, the police said that supporters of the English Defence League had been involved. The riots have also attracted people linked to soccer violence, or hooliganism, which has long aligned with nationalist movements in Britain.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType":

Prime Minister Keir Starmer has faced calls to recall Parliament after gangs of far-right yobs caused chaos again at the weekend, including in Rotherham, where mobs attacked a Holiday Inn Express housing asylum seekers. Here's a map of every area hit by rioting so far:\n\nWhy are the riots happening?\n\nMany of the protests have been organised and agitated online by members of the far-right, with lists of planned demonstrations appearing on social media late last week. Some of these lists also included further dates over the next few days, including protests at the Grey's Monument in Newcastle and at the Bullring in Birmingham.\n\nThe first signs of violence were seen in Southport last Tuesday, before a large 'Enough is Enough' protest in London was followed by several days of disorder in England and Northern Ireland. A total of 147 arrests were made in the weekend's disorder by Sunday afternoon, and this number is expected to rise as police track down those responsible.\n\nFormer home secretary Dame Priti Patel, Labour MPs including Diane Abbott and Dawn Butler, and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage have all called for the Commons to cut short its recess as the country endured another night of violence on Sunday. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said on Monday that Parliament would not be recalled \"right now\".\n\nWhere did riots happen at the weekend?\n\nBelfast\n\nA small group of protesters gathered in front of City Hall on Saturday and chanted \"Islam Out.\" Fireworks were later thrown between the group and anti-racism demonstrators in the city, and some local businesses were attacked. Two people were arrested in connection with the disorder.\n\nBolton\n\nSmoke bombs and mounted police were used to try and quell disorder in Bolton on Sunday, where clashes erupted between protesters holding England flags and another group of around 250 men, some of whom were heard chanting \"Allahu Akbar\". Greater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order, requiring people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nBlackburn\n\nA dispersal order was enforced across Blackburn town centre on Saturday amid concerns that violence would erupt across the town. Blackburn MP Adnan Hussain urged people to stay away from the protest and echoed concerns about an escalation leading to clashes. A small anti-immigrant protest lasted for less than half an hour, according to the Lancashire Telegraph. One arrest has been made.\n\nBlackpool\n\nTwenty people were arrested in Blackpool after a demonstration turned violent on Saturday. ACC Phil Davies, of Lancashire Police, described the disorder as \"mindless thuggery\".\n\nBristol\n\nDemonstrators and counter-protesters faced off at the city's Castle Park on Saturday evening. Avon and Somerset Police obtained extra powers to stop, search and disperse people in the city centre due to the demonstrations. Police later said they had made 16 arrests over violent disorder in the city centre.\n\nHull\n\nShops including a Shoezone were looted and hotel windows smashed in ugly scenes in Hull on Saturday. Rioters were also seen trying to push through police barricades. Images taken at the scene showed police carrying riot shields as a crowd looked on from a distance. Four people have been arrested.\n\nLiverpool\n\nFar-right activists clashed with riot police along The Strand, close to the city's Liverpool One shopping centre on Saturday. Police were hit with bricks and several other objects during the demonstration, and the Spellow Hub library was also torched. Merseyside Police said several officers had been injured during the violent clashes. Police later tried to push demonstrators towards the Albert Docks, an area visited by many tourists. A total of 33 people have been arrested in connection with the disorder.\n\nManchester\n\nFight broke out in the city centre on Saturday. Police officers tried to keep demonstrators apart, but video showed scuffles breaking out in Piccadilly Gardens. A Sainsbury's was stormed by a gang of masked people, and several of them were heard chanting the name of far-right activist Tommy Robinson. Arrests were made by police.\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nA group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses, burnt cars and threw objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\" There were 43 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said.\n\nNottingham\n\nFar-right and counter-protesters threw objects at one another in the centre of Nottingham. Many of the people involved at the initial protest left and were replaced by people who had no affiliation to either group. Police held both groups away from one another during the majority of the protest, according to local reports. 15 people have been arrested\n\nRotherham\n\nIn some of the worst scenes of the entire weekend, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of a Holiday Inn Express believed to be housing asylum seekers before starting several fires. At least 10 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed, saying one person had already been arrested and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\".\n\nDefence Secretary John Healey, who is the local MP, arrived at the scene on Monday to talk to residents about \"the damage they have suffered and the trauma they have suffered\". Mr Healey said: \"This was an estate yesterday that was wracked with shock and fear. Many people in this estate here got holed up in their own homes or felt that they had to get their families out.\"\n\nPortsmouth\n\nHundreds of anti-immigration protesters were met with counter protesters at the steps of the Guildhall on Saturday. It is estimated about 300 people gathered for the short protest this morning. Police scuffled with protesters as they tried to break up a chase.\n\nStoke-on-Trent\n\nFour men were arrested in Stoke-on-Trent following disorder in the city on Saturday. Police were forced to deny speculation spreading on social media about a person being stabbed.\n\nIn a statement, Staffordshire Police said: \"There is growing speculation that a stabbing has taken place as a result of the disorder today. We can confirm this information is false and no stabbings have been reported to police or emergency responders, despite videos fuelling speculation on social media.\n\n\"We can confirm a man was injured after being hit by a blunt object that was thrown. His injuries are not thought to be serious and he has been taken to hospital for treatment. Four men have been arrested in connection with the disorder and are currently in custody for questioning.\n\nSunderland\n\nA police station was burnt in Sunderland on Friday as a planned demonstration quickly turned violent. Damage was also caused across the city centre. Six people have been charged in connection with the disorder.\n\nTamworth\n\nA Holiday Inn hotel was also attacked in Tamworth on Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were being housed. People threw petrol bombs, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, according to Staffordshire Police.\n\nWeymouth\n\nThree men were arrested following a protest and counter-demonstration in Weymouth during which two officers were injured. One officer was hit in the face by a thrown bottle and the other was punched in the face during the protest on Sunday, Dorset Police said. Some of those involved were teenagers, with two 15-year-olds issued with dispersal orders.\n\nA force spokesman said: \"Dorset Police have facilitated the two protests along the Esplanade in Weymouth this afternoon and into this evening, balancing the right to protest with minimising disruption to communities. A highly visible presence with a significant number of resources from Dorset Police, as well as officers from Devon and Cornwall, Avon and Somerset, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, were deployed to the area to ensure the demonstrations were safe and legal - with protesters having now dispersed and left the area. During the evening three arrests were made, with an additional two dispersal orders made against two 15-year-olds from the local area.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

And all right-minded people should be condemning this assault of violence,\" he said.\n\n\"People in this country have a right to be safe. And yet we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques.\n\n\"Other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric, so no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is: far-right thuggery.\"\n\nThe Home Office has announced that mosques will be offered greater protection with new \"emergency security\" that can be rapidly deployed to respond to violent disorder sweeping across parts of England.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the attack in Rotherham as \"utterly appalling\", as she backed police to take \"the strongest action against those responsible\".\n\nRotherham MP Sarah Champion said she was \"extremely concerned\" by the \"escalating violence\" at the hotel.\n\n\"The people causing damage and attacking police do not represent our town and I am disgusted by their actions. This is criminal disorder and intimidation - not protest,\" she said.\n\nElsewhere, Greater Manchester Police said a Section 34 dispersal notice has been authorised covering Bolton until 10pm on Sunday, where a protest is expected later.\n\nMerseyside Police have introduced two section 60 orders giving officers greater stop-and-search powers covering Liverpool and Southport.\n\nThe orders were put in place at 2pm on Sunday and will stay active for a 12-hour period until 2am on Monday.\n\nThe unrest is the latest in a series of violent protests across the country.\n\nMore than 90 arrests have been made over the weekend and some charges have been brought, with police warning of more to come once footage has been scoured.\n\nSir Keir Starmer held crisis talks with ministers on Saturday over the unrest, with Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood telling colleagues \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nStarmer has given police his \"full backing\" to take any action necessary to respond to \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\" in communities.\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured.\n\nIn Liverpool, Merseyside Police said about 300 people were involved in violent disorder on County Road, Walton, which included community facilities being set on fire.\n\nThe Spellow Lane Library Hub, which was opened last year to provide support for one of the most deprived communities in the country, suffered severe damage to the ground floor.\n\nPolice said rioters tried to prevent firefighters from accessing the blaze, throwing a missile at the fire engine and breaking the rear window of the cab.\n\nMerseyside Police Inspector Al McKeon said: \"The scenes we saw yesterday in Liverpool and Walton, and on Tuesday in Southport, were despicable. They left dozens of officers requiring hospital treatment and have already led to the arrests of a total of 33 suspects.\"\n\nTeams worked through the night to reopen streets in cities like Hull, where volunteers armed with brushes turned up from 7am to assist council crews.\n\n\"Yesterday we saw the worst of Hull but already today we have seen the best,\" councillor Jack Haines of Hull City Council said.", "source": {"uri": "news.stv.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "STV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

She said criminal violence and disorder had no place on Britain's streets.\n\nAnyone who engages in criminal disorder and violent assault on the streets must expect to be arrested, prosecuted, punished, and subject to the full force of the law, including imprisonment and travel bans. If you break the law, there are consequences.\n\nThe widespread nature of the clashes presents Keir Starmer's new government with its first major challenge, which now faces calls to introduce emergency powers to stop further violence and summon parliament.\n\nIn protests across the country, bricks were thrown at police officers in Stoke-on-Trent, fireworks were set off amid tense exchanges between anti-Islam groups and anti-racism protesters in Belfast, and in Hull, three police officers were injured and four arrested when windows were smashed at a hotel used to house migrants. Several police officers were injured in Liverpool city centre, where bricks, bottles and flares were thrown and one officer was hit in the head with a chair. Dispersal notices were issued across the city centre, and scuffles broke out in Nottingham's Old Market Square as opposing groups faced each other, with bottles and other objects thrown from both sides.\n\nPeople walk past Sunderland Central Police Station after a violent anti-immigrant protest in Sunderland on August 3. Photograph: Hollie Adams/Reuters\n\nAround 150 people carrying St George's Cross flags and chanting \"You are not British any more\" and \"Paedophile Muslims in our streets\" were heavily outnumbered in Leeds as hundreds of counter-protesters chanted Nazi rubbish in our streets. Clashes broke out between protesters and punks in the town for the festival in Blackpool, with bottles and chairs thrown.\n\nLord Walney, the government's independent adviser on political violence and disorder, has stressed the need for urgent political intervention. He told the Observer that new emergency powers may be needed to deal with outbreaks of violence. He said the system was not set up to deal with these raucous mobs, which were being fomented by far-right actors.\n\nHome Office ministers are expected to urgently consider new temporary emergency arrangements to allow police to use their full powers of arrest to address gatherings where there is a clear intention to cause violent disorder.\n\nKeir Starmer opened a meeting of senior ministers on Saturday, saying he was giving police full support to crack down on extremists who seek to spread hate by terrorising communities. He also made it clear that the right to freedom of expression and the violence of recent days were two very different things.\n\nThe riots last week began on Monday after three young girls were killed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport. Axel Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, was suspected of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat. Following those messages, far-right protesters, guided by social media, gathered in cities across the country.\n\nJoe Mulhall, research director for the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate, said Elon Musk's decision to allow right-wing activists like Tommy Robinson back onto his social media platform X was a major factor in the spread of online misinformation. He said individuals who had previously been banned from Twitter were the ones who spread the initial misinformation and outrage. And now they've been brought back onto the platform.\n\nRobinson was permanently banned from the platform (then called Twitter) in March 2018, but returned in November after Musk took over. Mulhall added that he hasn't seen significant numbers of people protesting since 2018.\n\nAn example of the dangers of misuse of social media was revealed in Stoke-on-Trent, where police were forced to deny that a stabbing had taken place there, contradicting claims made on social media. Speculation today that the disorder had led to a stabbing incident has grown. Police have confirmed that despite a video on social media fuelling speculation, the information is false and that no stabbing incident was reported to police or emergency responders.\n\nBen Julian BJ Harrington, head of public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council, highlighted the dangers of such interventions, blaming social media misinformation for last week's chaos.\n\nHe said: There were reports today that two people were stabbed by Muslims in Stoke. That is not true. There are people who do not even exist in this country, going around and spreading hate, division and concern about communities they do not care about, do not know about and do not understand.\n\nHarrington, who was also the NPCC's gold commander for the national strategy on Saturday disorder, said rioters, thugs and criminals were responsible. He said this was not about protests. This was about violent disorder. This was about people going into communities and throwing bricks and bottles at police officers working in those communities and causing damage.\n\nSkip newsletter promotions\n\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture from top Observer writers.\n\nPrivacy Notice: Our newsletter may contain information about charities, online advertising, and externally funded content.

Of course, police numbers are limited and not all officers pulled from the community will be there to solve robberies.\n\nReflecting concerns about the dangers of social media, Shadow Home Secretary James Cleverley called on tech companies to be taken to Downing Street to ensure they were taking action to stop the spread of misinformation on their platforms. But he was criticised for issuing a statement saying Starmer's kneeling sent the wrong message to protesters, adding that there was absolutely no justification for such disorder.\n\nThere were also accusations that Nigel Farage had played a role in inciting violence with his comments about the Southport murders, and he questioned whether the truth was being hidden from us after Monday's attack. Robert Jenrick, one of the leading candidates in the Conservative leadership race, said the Reform Party leaders' comments had not made things any better.\n\nClashes last week escalated four days ago in Whitehall when more than 100 protesters were arrested and bottles and cans were thrown at police, while violence also broke out in Hartlepool and Manchester.\n\nStarmer announced a new national response to the problem on Thursday, linking police forces across the country through intelligence sharing and expanding facial recognition technology.\n\nThen on Friday, around 500 people, including parents with children, gathered in Sunderland city centre to protest against far-right social media posts. The gathering soon turned violent, with masked boys and men throwing missiles at riot police, including bricks, stones, beer cans and scaffolding poles.\n\nTen people were arrested and four police officers were taken to hospital, one seriously. A police station was looted and a citizens' counselling centre was set on fire. The smell of burning smoke still lingered in the air Saturday morning. Shoppers stopped to express their shock at what had happened, and hundreds of residents of all ages gathered on the city streets, carrying brushes, trash pickers, buckets, garbage bags and dustbins.\n\nSunderland Central Labour MP Louise Atkinson said there was a link between the disorder and the resurgence of the English Defence League (EDL), which was founded by Robinson, whose real name was Stephen Jabley-Lennon. The EDL has since disbanded but its supporters remain active, and Atkinson said there was evidence that the group's Nazi wing was involved in Friday's violence.\n\nA Sunderland cathedral priest said the mob had tried to tear down a headstone to use as a missile during the chaos gripping the city. It is a sacrilegious act to touch someone's headstone, said the Rev. Jackie Tyson. It also shows a lack of common sense. Have you ever picked up a headstone?\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors":

Disinformation spread rapidly that erroneously claimed the suspect in the knife attack was an immigrant. On Saturday, dozens of people were arrested as demonstrations from Liverpool to Belfast descended into violence.\n\nSunday saw a new wave of clashes, with groups gathering in Rotherham, Bolton, Hull, Southport, Middlesbrough and other towns and cities scattered across the country that devolved into varying degrees of violence.\n\nIn Rotherham, protesters smashed windows and set fires at a Holiday Inn before storming into the building as riot police officers struggled to control the rampaging crowd. The hotel had been used to house asylum seekers, but it was unclear if they were still staying at the site.\n\nIn Middlesbrough, a group of mostly men, some of them masked, hurled bottles and rocks at riot police officers. Cars were set alight, and the local police said at least nine people had been arrested on Sunday. In Bolton, near Manchester, things turned violent when two separate groups clashed, despite a large police presence.\n\nThe weekend riots have prompted a heavy police response in cities across Britain. The National Police Chiefs' Council, which represents law enforcement, said that nearly 4,000 additional officers had been deployed to deter the violence, and some 147 arrests had been made across the country since Saturday night.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer, in a statement given from Downing Street on Sunday afternoon, condemned the \"far-right thuggery we have seen this weekend.\"\n\n\"Be in no doubt: Those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law,\" Mr. Starmer said, noting that the police would be making arrests and that charges would follow. \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves. This is not protest. It is organized, violent thuggery.\"\n\nThe crisis has emerged as the first test for Mr. Starmer's fledgling Labour government, which scrambled on Sunday to tamp down reports that he was set to go on vacation this week. His office said he was not scheduled to be out of town and would remain at 10 Downing Street to manage the fallout.\n\nMainstream politicians from across the spectrum have been united in condemning the violence. Rishi Sunak, the former prime minister and current leader of the opposition Conservative Party, which had governed Britain for the last 14 years, said on X that the strife had \"nothing to do with the tragedy in Southport\" and that the police had \"our full support to deal with these criminals swiftly.\"\n\nTension has gripped some communities since a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class left three young girls dead. Eight other children and two adults were wounded in the town of Southport, near Liverpool, and a 17-year-old suspect was later named.\n\nDisinformation about the attacker's identity spread quickly online, falsely identifying him as a recently arrived asylum seeker and fueling a far-right riot in which a mosque was attacked and dozens of police officers were hurt in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nThe wave of protests and unrest has been driven by fast-spreading misinformation, much of it promulgated by far-right voices on the social media platform X and the Telegram messaging app. They include neo-Nazis, violent soccer fans, anti-Muslim factions, and social media influencers who have amplified their messaging to followers.\n\nPockets of disorder have since cropped up in other parts of Britain, with violent protests in Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Nottingham and other cities over the weekend. A protest was also held in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and also turned violent.\n\nBJ Harrington, the head of public order for Britain's National Police Chiefs' Council, said that disinformation had been \"a huge driver of this appalling violence\" and that many who were involved were responding directly to what they had read online.\n\n\"Often posts are being shared and amplified by high-profile accounts,\" he said.\n\n\"We're working hard to counteract this,\" he said, adding, \"They won't win.\"\n\nMr. Harrington added that the disorder had declined significantly on Sunday. He also issued a warning for those stoking the disorder.\n\n\"Intelligence teams, detectives and neighborhood officers are working round the clock to identify and apprehend those involved,\" he said. \"And make no mistake, if you haven't had a knock on the door yet, your time will come.\"\n\nOn Saturday, larger groups had gathered in areas of unrest. In Liverpool, more than 300 people were involved in what the police called a \"violent disorder,\" when businesses were looted and rioters hurled bricks and other projectiles at police officers. Two police officers were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. By Sunday morning, at least 11 people had been arrested, the police said.\n\nFar-right protesters and counterprotesters also clashed in Manchester, at least 10 people were arrested in unrest in Stoke-on-Trent, and there were clashes in Leeds, where the police said they had made a \"handful\" of arrests.\n\nIn Belfast, Northern Ireland, where anti-immigration messaging has also simmered, clashes broke out between anti-Muslim protesters and people at an antiracist demonstration at City Hall, with fireworks and projectiles being hurled between the two. Several businesses and vehicles were reportedly set on fire, and an apartment building had to be evacuated, the police said.\n\nThe Police Services of Northern Ireland said in a statement that while only four people were arrested, \"every tool\" would be used to identify those who caused damage.\n\nMuch of the initial violence in some cities over the weekend had been focused on the Muslim community, with mosques and local businesses owned by Muslim people targeted. Yvette Cooper, Britain's home secretary, announced a new rapid response process to provide mosques at risk of violent disorder additional security personnel, \"providing communities with vital support and reassurance,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"Britain is a proud and tolerant country, and nobody should make any excuses for the shameful actions of the hooligans, thugs and extremist groups who have been attacking police officers, looting local shops or attacking people based on the color of their skin,\" Ms. Cooper said in a written statement.\n\nThe new security provisions have already begun, she said, and specific security for mosques across the country was already being provided this weekend, in addition to the police response.\n\n\"As a nation, we will not tolerate criminal behavior, dangerous extremism and racist attacks that go against everything our country stands for,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [],

And not far away there were ugly scenes in Liverpool city centre on Saturday with clashes on the Strand and \"serious disorder\" close to the city's waterfront, said police.\n\nA number of officers were reported to have been injured, with violence also spilling out into the city's main shopping areas, including Church Street. A group of protesters were also seen gathering around a young officer lying on the ground in Liverpool and intimidating her.\n\n\"Any more pictures and I'll charge \u00a35 a time,\" shouted one rioter. \"How many more kids will have to be raped because you won't listen?\" shouted another, while a woman said: \"She f***ing deserves it.\"\n\nElsewhere in Liverpool 300 people were involved in chaos that broke out on County Road, Walton, which included community facilities being set on fire.\n\nThe Spellow Lane Library Hub, which was opened last year to provide support for one of the most deprived communities in the country, suffered severe damage to the ground floor. Police said rioters tried to prevent firefighters from accessing the fire, throwing a missile at the fire engine and breaking the rear window of the cab.\n\nOne officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields. Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss called the behaviour of protesters \"deplorable\", adding: \"The impact of the disorder will be devastating for the people of Walton, but I promise that we are doing everything in our power to arrest those involved and bring them to justice.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said people involved in the clashes around the country \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".

That means we're calling everyone to Guildhall Square, Royal Parade, from 6pm with placards (some will need to be made) against racism and fascism, and banners from organisations wherever possible\".\n\nThey add: \"We've done it before in Plymouth and we'll do it again. Refugees are welcome here!\" It comes as a minister said police have \"all the resources they need\" to deal with riots and disorder.\n\nClick here to join PlymouthLive on WhatsApp and we'll send breaking news and top stories directly to your phone.

Courts could sit overnight to ensure \"thugs\" who \"maraud our streets\" are brought to justice, while forces have measures in place to draft in extra officers to tackle potential unrest, Dame Diana Johnson has indicated.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has given police his \"full backing\" to take any action necessary to respond to \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\" after scenes of disorder in England and Northern Ireland this week.\n\nBut concerns have been raised that officers may be left unable to deal with other incidents as a result of the need to focus efforts on the prospect of ongoing rioting, with the Police Federation warning: \"There is a cost to all this.\"\n\nAsked whether enough is being done to respond to the disorder, policing minister Dame Diana said the Government has been \"reassured\" that forces are able to meet the scale of the challenge.\n\n\"The police have made it very clear that they have all the resources they need at the moment... they have the powers that they need,\" the minister told BBC News. \"There is no need to bring in the Army and there has been no discussion about that.\n\n\"(Police) have long-standing plans in place for mutual aid if they need to put extra police officers into certain parts of the country.\"\n\nDespite the Government recently announcing the early release of some offenders to ease prison overcrowding, Dame Diana said there is jail capacity to hand custodial sentences to those \"marauding our streets\".\n\nAsked whether courts could be forced to sit overnight to fast-track prosecutions as they did for the 2011 riots, she said the Government will do \"whatever it takes\" to ensure people are brought to justice.\n\nDeputy national chair of the Police Federation, Brian Booth, told the PA news agency that forces can handle the unrest in the short-term, but it will likely put further pressure on already-stretched resources.\n\n\"There is a cost to all this,\" he said. \"Every day this continues means a certain amount of officer hours are being taken away from other policing duties. It has a massive effect on already significant under-resourcing.\"\n\nSome areas may see a diminished police presence as a result of less robust preventative patrols because officers \"can't be in two places at once\", he said.\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured. At least 100 arrests have been made across the country and some charges have been brought, with police warning of more to come once footage has been scoured.\n\nSir Keir held crisis talks with ministers on Saturday over the unrest, with Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood telling colleagues \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nIn Liverpool, Merseyside Police said about 300 people were involved in violent disorder on County Road, Walton, which included community facilities being set on fire.\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre, which Avon and Somerset Police described as \"completely unacceptable\". Lancashire Police said more than 20 people were arrested and dispersal orders were issued in parts of Blackpool, Preston and Blackburn.\n\nStaffordshire Police said 10 people were arrested following disorder in Stoke-on-Trent. Further protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.\n\nTeams worked through the night to reopen streets in cities like Hull, where volunteers armed with brushes turned up from 7am to assist council crews.\n\n\"Yesterday we saw the worst of Hull but already today we have seen the best,\" councillor Jack Haines of Hull City Council said. \"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n\"There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy. So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you.\"", "source": {"uri": "plymouthherald.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Plymouth Herald"},

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA new map has detailed the exact locations of riots across the UK, as concerns rise over the disorder spreading to more parts of the country.\n\nThe country has been gripped by six days of mass disorder in towns and cities following the Southport stabbings last week, which resulted in three children being killed and eight injured during an attack on a dance class.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer is facing calls to recall Parliament after far-right gangs caused chaos again at the weekend, including in Rotherham, where mobs attacked a Holiday Inn Express housing asylum seekers.\n\nHere's a map of every area hit by rioting so far:\n\nWhy are the riots happening?\n\nMany of the protests have been organised and stirred up online by members of the far-right, with lists of planned demonstrations appearing on social media late last week. Some of these lists also included further dates over the next few days, including protests at the Grey's Monument in Newcastle and at the Bullring in Birmingham.\n\nThe first scenes of violence were witnessed in Southport last Tuesday, before a large 'Enough is Enough' protest in London was followed by several days of disorder in England and Northern Ireland. A total of 147 arrests were made in the weekend's disorder by Sunday afternoon, and this number is expected to rise as police track down those responsible.\n\nThe weekend saw violence flare in a number of UK towns and cities, with police making a number of arrests. Here's a roundup of where trouble broke out.\n\nBelfast\n\nA small group of protesters gathered in front of City Hall on Saturday and chanted \"Islam Out.\"\n\nFireworks were later thrown between the group and anti-racism demonstrators in the city, and some local businesses were attacked. Two people were arrested in connection with the disorder.\n\nBolton\n\nSmoke bombs and mounted police were used to try and quell disorder in Bolton on Sunday, where clashes erupted between protesters holding England flags and another group of around 250 men, some of whom were heard chanting \"Allahu Akbar\". Greater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order, requiring people to \"remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance\".\n\nBlackburn\n\nA dispersal order was enforced across Blackburn town centre on Saturday amid concerns that violence would erupt across the town. Blackburn MP Adnan Hussain urged people to stay away from the protest and echoed concerns about an escalation leading to clashes.\n\nA small anti-immigrant protest lasted for less than half an hour, according to the Lancashire Telegraph. One arrest has been made.\n\nBlackpool\n\nIn Blackpool, twenty individuals were detained following a protest that escalated into violence on Saturday. ACC Phil Davies of Lancashire Police condemned the turmoil as \"mindless thuggery\".\n\nBristol\n\nIn Bristol, skirmishes erupted between demonstrators and counter-protesters at Castle Park on Saturday evening. Avon and Somerset Police were granted extended powers to stop and search, and disperse individuals in the city centre amidst the protests.\n\nThe police force later announced the arrest of 16 persons linked to violent disorder within the central area.\n\nHull\n\nHull witnessed scenes of chaos as businesses such as Shoezone were pillaged and hotel windows shattered during the tumult on Saturday. Rioters also attempted to overcome police blockades.\n\nPhotographs from the scene depict officers equipped with riot shields while onlookers observed from a distance. Authorities reported four arrests in connection with the incidents.\n\nLiverpool\n\nLiverpool saw far-right activists clashing with riot police in the vicinity of The Strand, near Liverpool One shopping centre on Saturday. Officers endured attacks by bricks and various projectiles during the demonstration, with the Spellow Hub library also succumbing to fire.\n\nMerseyside Police indicated that a number of officers sustained injuries amid the hostilities. In response to the riots, 33 individuals have been taken into custody.\n\nManchester\n\nFighting between rival groups broke out in the city centre on Saturday. Police officers tried to keep demonstrators apart, but video shared online showed scuffles breaking out in Piccadilly Gardens. A Sainsbury's was then stormed by a gang of masked people, and several of them were heard chanting the name of far-right activist Tommy Robinson. Arrests were made by police.\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nA group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses, burnt cars and threw objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: \"It's our f****** country.\" There were 43 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said.\n\nNottingham\n\nFar-right and counter-protesters threw objects at one another in the centre of Nottingham. Many of the people involved at the initial protest left and were replaced by people who had no affiliation to either group. Police held both groups away from one another during the majority of the protest, according to local reports. 15 people have been arrested\n\nRotherham\n\nIn some of the worst scenes of the entire weekend, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of a Holiday Inn Express believed to be housing asylum seekers, before starting several fires. At least 10 officers were injured, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed. They added that one person had already been arrested and others involved should \"expect us to be at their doors very soon\".\n\nDefence Secretary John Healey, who is the local Labour MP, arrived at the scene on Monday to talk to residents about \"the damage they have suffered and the trauma they have suffered\". Mr Healey said: \"This was an estate yesterday that was wracked with shock and fear. Many people in this estate here got holed up in their own homes or felt that they had to get their families out.\"\n\nPortsmouth\n\nHundreds of anti-immigration protesters were met with counter protesters at the steps of the Guildhall on Saturday. It is estimated about 300 people gathered for the short protest this. Police scuffled with protesters as they tried to break up a chase.\n\nStoke-on-Trent\n\nFour men were arrested in Stoke-on-Trent following disorder in the city on Saturday. Police were forced to deny speculation spreading on social media about a person being stabbed.\n\nIn a statement, Staffordshire Police said: \"There is growing speculation that a stabbing has taken place as a result of the disorder today. We can confirm this information is false and no stabbings have been reported to police or emergency responders, despite videos fuelling speculation on social media.\n\n\"We can confirm a man was injured after being hit by a blunt object that was thrown. His injuries are not thought to be serious and he has been taken to hospital for treatment. Four men have been arrested in connection with the disorder and are currently in custody for questioning.\"\n\nSunderland\n\nA police station was burnt in Sunderland on Friday as a planned demonstration quickly turned violent. Damage was also caused across the city centre. Six people have been charged in connection with the disorder.\n\nTamworth\n\nA Holiday Inn hotel was also attacked in Tamworth on Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were being housed. People threw petrol bombs, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, according to Staffordshire Police.\n\nWeymouth\n\nThree men were arrested following a protest and counter-demonstration on Weymouth seafront, during which two officers were injured. One officer was hit in the face by a thrown bottle and the other was punched in the face during the protest on Sunday, Dorset Police said. Some of those involved were teenagers, with two 15-year-olds issued with dispersal orders.\n\nA force spokesman said: \"Dorset Police have facilitated the two protests along the Esplanade in Weymouth this afternoon and into this evening, balancing the right to protest with minimising disruption to communities.\n\n\"A highly visible presence with a significant number of resources from Dorset Police, as well as officers from Devon and Cornwall, Avon and Somerset, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, were deployed to the area to ensure the demonstrations were safe and legal - with protesters having now dispersed and left the area. During the evening three arrests were made, with an additional two dispersal orders made against two 15-year-olds from the local area.\"\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

He said the right to freedom of expression and violent disorder were \"two very different things\" and labelled participants \"extremists\".\n\nHe said that the government backed the police to \"take all necessary action\" to keep Britain's streets safe following attacks on police officers, disruption to local businesses and what he said were attempts to sow hate by intimidating communities.\n\nYvette Cooper, home secretary, said the \"criminal violence and disorder\" was unacceptable. The government would back the police in acting against \"thuggery\" and individuals involved in disorder would \"pay the price\", she said.\n\nMerseyside Police described scenes of \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool on Saturday; several officers were injured after masked protesters threw bricks and chairs at police and rampaged along the city's waterfront.\n\nThe violence was originally sparked by a mass stabbing in Southport, in north-west England, on Monday, in which three girls were killed and eight other children and two adults were injured. A suspect has been arrested and charged with murder.\n\nPoliticians in Liverpool had warned outsiders with a \"racist\" agenda not to exploit the Southport killings.\n\nSteve Rotheram, mayor of Liverpool city region, said on Saturday that \"the very police who ran towards the scene in Southport\" were being \"subjected to assault and abuse\".\n\n\"It's not on -- especially while our region is still trying to come to terms with Monday's tragic events,\" he said. \"These scenes shame our city and those responsible deserve to feel the full weight of the law.\"\n\nIn Manchester a group gathered, some wearing balaclavas and waving Union Jacks and England flags. Several arrests were made. Some counter-protesters held a march through the city to oppose them.\n\nPart of the city had already experienced disorder earlier in the week when demonstrators targeted a hotel which houses asylum seekers.\n\nOther parts of England also experienced violent protests on Saturday, including Stoke-on-Trent and Hull, where fires were started across the city centre and bins hurled as demonstrators were confronted by a heavy police presence.\n\nAnti-extremism campaign group Hope not Hate said rallies had been planned in more than 30 locations in England and Wales this weekend, according to social media posts.\n\nScores of arrests have been made across England this week, including more than 100 people detained by police at a rally outside Downing Street.\n\nOn Friday night rioters took to the streets of Sunderland in north-east England, setting fire to a building next to a police station, overturning vehicles and hurling projectiles at riot police. Police prevented dozens of rioters from attacking a mosque.\n\nOn Friday, Starmer met local government, police and faith leaders in Southport and confirmed a support package to aid bereaved families and community cohesion, including improved access to mental health and psychological services.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [],

Misinformation spread online that the suspect was a Muslim refugee, but it later emerged that the person who police arrested who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents.\n\nFollowing the killings, right-wing group Enough is Enough organised dozens of protests that have been heard chanting \"save the kids.\" But many of the planned protests soon descended into violence with riot police being drafted in to snuff out the disorder.\n\nHave protests broken out in your area? Get in touch at webnews@reachplc.com\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said those engaging in violent disorder \"will pay the price.\"\n\n\"Criminal violence and disorder have no place on Britain's streets,\" she told broadcasters. \"We've been clear to the police that they have our full backing in taking the strongest possible action against perpetrators, including making sure that there are more prosecutors, there are sufficient prison places and also that the courts stand ready because anyone who engages in this kind of disorder needs to be clear that they will pay the price.\"\n\nMore than 20 protests were planned by far-right activists for the weekend. Police forces remain on high alert after Prime Minister Keir Starmer told leading officers to bring control back to Britain's streets.\n\nWhere did today's riots happen?\n\nBelfast\n\nA small group of anti-Islamic protesters gathered in front of City Hall in the city.

Blackburn MP Adnan Hussain urged people to stay away from the protest and echoed concerns about an escalation leading to clashes.\n\nA small anti-immigrant protest lasted for less than half an hour, according to the Lancashire Telegraph. It is understood not more than 10 attended and larger counter protest groups were seen in the area later.\n\nBlackpool\n\nLancashire Police issued a statement ahead of today's planned protest. Police said: \"We know that the majority of those who plan to attend intend to express their opposing views in in a lawful manner.\n\n\"However, we have received information which indicates that some individuals who plan to attend are intent on causing disorder. We are doing everything in our power to stop that from happening and keep you, the public, safe. With that in mind, a Section 34 dispersal order has been put in place to prevent disorder and allow other members of the community to enjoy the town centre without any issue.\n\nBristol\n\nDemonstrators and counter-protesters descended at the city's Castle Park this evening. Avon and Somerset Police have obtained extra powers to stop, search and disperse people in the city centre due to the demonstrations.\n\nPolice later said they had made multiple arrests due to violent disorder in the city centre.\n\nHull\n\nViolence escalated today with numerous fires being set across the city today as police and firefighters attempted to bring the situation under control. Items were burned outside businesses and hotel windows were smashed.\n\nRioters were also seen trying to push through police barricades. Images taken at the scene showed police carrying riot shields as several people looked on from a distance.\n\nLeeds\n\nA protest group of 200 people marched through the city's centre this afternoon with a heavy police presence being seen in attendance. The demonstrators, many of whom were wearing masks, made their way through Trinity Leeds shopping centre and eventually ended near the Corn Exchange.\n\nLiverpool\n\nFar-right activists clashed with riot police along The Strand, close to the city's Liverpool One shopping area. Police were pelted with bricks and several other objects during the demonstration.\n\nMerseyside Police said several officers had been injured during the violent clashes. Police later tried to push demonstrators towards the Albert Docks, an area visited by many tourists.\n\nManchester\n\nHundreds arrived in the city centre today with several fights breaking out. According to the Manchester Evening News officers tried to keep demonstrators apart, but video showed scuffles breaking out in Piccadilly Gardens.\n\nA Sainsbury's was stormed by a gang of masked yobs this afternoon with several being heard chanting the name of far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\n\nNottingham\n\nAccording to NottinghamshireLive, both anti-Islam and counter-protesters threw objects at one another. Many of the people involved at the initial protest left and were replaced by people who had no affiliation to either group.\n\nPolice held both groups away from one another during the majority of the protest.\n\nPortsmouth\n\nHundreds of anti-immigration protesters were met with anti-racist demonstrators at the steps of the Guildhall today. It is estimated about 300 people gathered for the short protest this morning.\n\nPolice scuffled with protesters as they tried to break up a chase. A group of young black men objected to the presence of the group, some of whom sang English Defence League chants afterward.\n\nPreston\n\nA Preston City Council spokesperson told people to keep away from the planned protest at the Flag Market. The spokesperson added: \"\"Our message is to stay away from any possible disorder this weekend and to continue supporting our neighbours in Southport and our police colleagues who are stretched and need to be able to police any event effectively.\"\n\nSt Helens\n\nA group of demonstrators gathered in Victoria Square in St Helens today, although the gathering appeared to have only attracted a few dozen people.\n\nStoke-on-Trent\n\nFour men have been arrested in Stoke-on-Trent following disorder in the Staffordshire city. Police denied that there had been a stabbing, countering claims made on social media.\n\nIn a statement, the force said: \"There is growing speculation that a stabbing has taken place as a result of the disorder today. We can confirm this information is false and no stabbings have been reported to police or emergency responders, despite videos fuelling speculation on social media.\n\n\"We can confirm a man was injured after being hit by a blunt object that was thrown.

Protesters threw bricks, bottles and flares at police officers as clashes intensified throughout the day.\n\nThe riots erupted in towns and cities after false information spread rapidly on social media that a 17-year-old suspect in the stabbing of three children at a Taylor Swift-themed event was a radical Muslim migrant.\n\nAccording to the police, the suspect, Axel Rudakubana, was born in the UK to Rwandan parents and is a Christian. However, several people protested, which descended into arson, violence and looting, Reuters reported.\n\nViolent clashes erupted in Liverpool, Bristol, Hull and Belfast, where hundreds of rival protesters, largely young men, clashed with each other and police and they threw at the officers.\n\nSeveral police officers suffered injuries as protesters threw bricks, bottles and flares at them while trying to prevent them from clashing with each other.\n\nIn Liverpool, two officers were hospitalised with suspected facial fractures while another was pushed from his motorbike and assaulted in the protests involving about 750 protesters and a similar number of rival demonstrators, according to Merseyside Police, the force overseeing the city.\n\nPolice added that two shops in Liverpool were vandalised and looted.\n\nSimilar scenes were witnessed in other cities, including Bristol, where anti-racist protesters outnumbered anti-immigration groups, and faced off against each other with police in riot gear controlling the situation.\n\nIn Bristol, 14 people were arrested by Avon and Somerset Police, with Neighbourhood Chief Inspector Vicks Hayward-Melen saying they would face the law \"for their thuggery\".\n\nIn Belfast, some businesses reported damage to property while at least one was set on fire, police said.\n\nIn Leeds, protesters waved Palestinian flags and chanted to their rival protesters, saying, \"there are many, many more of us than you.\"\n\nIn Hull, three police officers were injured after protesters targeted a hotel that houses migrants. Four were arrested as officers \"faced eggs and bottles being thrown\" as windows of the hotel were shattered, Humberside Police Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore told Sky News.\n\nStaffordshire Police arrested ten people on charges of assault, violent disorder and threatening behaviour after bricks were thrown at officers in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\n\"Some of the scenes we saw in Bristol tonight were completely unacceptable. We will always facilitate peaceful and lawful protests, however, the behaviour from a minority of people tonight crossed the line,\" Hayward-Melen said.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the police they had his ministers' full backing to take \"all necessary action to keep our streets safe\" from \"thugs\" who \"sow hate\", Sky News reported.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper gave a stern warning to protesters that they \"would pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder had no place on Britain's streets\".\n\n\"We've been clear to the police that they have our full backing in taking the strongest possible action against perpetrators, including making sure that there are more prosecutors, there are sufficient prison places and also that the courts stand ready because anyone who engages in this kind of disorder needs to be clear that they will pay the price,\" she said.\n\nOn July 29, Bebe King (6), Elsie Dot Stancombe (7) and Alice Dasilva Aguiar (9) were stabbed to death in Merseyside town. Rudakubana, the suspect, has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Who Are The Far-Right Groups Behind The Violence? - News18", "body": "Riots involving hundreds of anti-immigration protesters have erupted in towns and cities after false information spread rapidly on social media that the suspect in knife attack at a children's dance class in Southport was a radical Muslim migrant\n\nBritain is seeing the worst outbreak of civil disorder after clashes between anti-immigration demonstrators and counter protesters, following the murder of three young girls in northwest England.\n\nDozens of arrests were made after the scenes of disorder, with police warning that further violence is likely in the coming days.\n\nHome secretary Yvette Cooper said the police would have the government's full support to take the strongest possible action. \"Criminal violence and disorder have no place on Britain's streets,\" she said.\n\nRiots involving hundreds of anti-immigration protesters have erupted in towns and cities after false information spread rapidly on social media that the suspect in Monday's knife attack at a children's dance class in Southport was a radical Muslim migrant.\n\nPolice have said the suspect, Axel Rudakubana, 17, was born in Britain but protests by anti-immigration and anti-Muslim demonstrators have continued, descending into violence, arson and looting.\n\nViolent disorder erupted in Liverpool, Bristol, Hull and Belfast -- four cities located in different corners of the UK -- with scuffles breaking out and bricks and bottles thrown as anti-immigration protesters faced groups opposed to racism, as per a report by Reuters.\n\nMany police officers suffered injuries as they kept several rival protesters from clashing. In Liverpool, two officers were in hospital with suspected facial fractures while another was pushed from his motorbike and assaulted in the disorder involving some 750 protesters and a similar number of rival protesters.\n\nSimilar scenes were witnessed in the southwestern city of Bristol although anti-racist protesters outnumbered anti-immigration groups, with TV footage showing them facing off with police in riot gear.\n\nIn Belfast, some businesses reported damage to property while at least one was set on fire, according to police.\n\nPrime Minister: Keir Starmer is facing his first big test since his election a month ago. Starmer has condemned the violence. He held a meeting of senior ministers on Saturday in which he said police had been given full support to tackle extremists who were attempting \"to sow hate by intimidating communities\". He made clear that the right to freedom of expression and the violent scenes over recent days were \"two very different things\".\n\nHome Secretary: Yvette Cooper said those engaging in violent disorder \"will pay the price\", telling broadcasters \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\". Cooper said: \"We've been clear to the police that they have our full backing in taking the strongest possible action against perpetrators, including making sure that there are more prosecutors, there are sufficient prison places and also that the courts stand ready because anyone who engages in this kind of disorder needs to be clear that they will pay the price.\"\n\nPolice: Police have warned that further violence is likely in the coming days. \"We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,\" said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council. Liverpool City region Mayor Steve Rotheram said to \"call out mindless thuggery by people looking for an excuse to spew hatred and carry out acts of violence\". There were no reports of far-right marches in London. Separately, thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched peacefully through the city to protest Israel's military operation in Gaza.\n\nExperts: Jacob Davey, the director of policy and research for counter-hate at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in London, quoted The Guardian as saying it was \"a perfect storm\", with a rising far right in the UK emboldened by recent mass demonstrations. The need for urgent political intervention was stressed by the government's independent adviser on political violence and disruption, Lord Walney, who told the Observer that new emergency powers may be needed. \"The system isn't set up to deal with this rolling rabble-rousing being fuelled by far-right actors,\" he said. \"\"I think home office ministers may want to look urgently at a new emergency framework - perhaps temporary in nature - that enables police to use the full powers of arrest to prevent people gathering where there is clear intent to fuel violent disorder,\" as quoted by The Guardian.\n\nAbout two dozen children were attending a summer vacation workshop when an attacker with a knife burst in. Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6, died from their injuries. Ten other people were injured, among whom five girls and two adults are in critical condition.\n\nFar-right demonstrators have launched several violent protests, ostensibly in response to the attack, clashing with police outside a mosque in Southport.\n\nA few hundred protesters hurled beer cans and flares near British PM Starmer's residence in Downing Street in central London on Wednesday evening. More than 100 people were arrested for offenses including violent disorder and assault on an emergency worker, London's Metropolitan Police force said.\n\nBritain's worst attack on children was in 1996, when 43-year-old Thomas Hamilton shot and killed 16 kindergartners and their teacher in a school gymnasium in Dunblane, Scotland. The United Kingdom subsequently banned the private ownership of almost all handguns.\n\nSeveral far-right groups have been at the riots or promoted them on social media. David Miles, a prominent member of Patriotic Alternative, a fascist group, shared photographs of himself in Southport, according to Hope Not Hate, a Britain-based advocacy group that researches extremist organisations.\n\nPolice have said the English Defence League had been involved in the riots. The English Defence League was a far-right street movement created in 2009 notorious for violent protests and anti-Islam and anti-immigration stance.\n\nJoe Mulhall, Hope Not Hate's director of research, called the movement \"post organizational\" in a 2018 analysis. Social media and other technologies, he wrote offer \"new ways for it to engage in activism outside the confines of traditional, organizational structures\".", "source": {"uri": "news18.com",

In reality, the suspect, 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, was born in Cardiff, Wales. Despite this fact, anti-immigration and anti-Muslim protests quickly erupted in towns and cities across Britain, sparking days of violence.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, tension was palpable in cities like Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester, and Belfast. Reuters witnesses reported large groups of rival protesters chanting slogans, leading to clashes in certain areas. In Liverpool, eggs, beer cans, and smoke grenades were hurled, while businesses in Belfast suffered property damage.\n\nLiverpool's police reported that multiple officers were injured while handling \"serious disorder\" in the city centre. Meanwhile, authorities in Hull stated that four individuals had been arrested, and three officers were hurt amidst protests involving bottle-throwing.\n\nIn response to the violence, police in Liverpool issued a Section 34 Dispersal Order to combat potential crime. An officer on a motorbike was reportedly kicked off by a demonstrator, with witnesses noting children in tears amidst the chaos as they visited the city centre to see the Disney Magic cruise ship.\n\nAnti-fascist protesters countered the unrest, chanting \"Where's your Tommy gone?\" -- a jab at former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson. Meanwhile, masked individuals attempted to charge police lines, leading to the introduction of a Section 60 order, granting police increased stop-and-search powers in Liverpool and surrounding areas like Kensington and Toxteth.\n\nThe city of Sunderland in the northeast saw some of the most intense clashes, with riots breaking out on Friday evening.\n\nIn a more extreme display of violence, hundreds of anti-immigration protesters in Sunderland clashed with police, throwing stones and setting vehicles on fire near a mosque. A car was torched, and fires were started near a police station. Four police officers were hospitalised, and 12 people were arrested, according to Chief Police Superintendent Mark Hall. He condemned the acts as \"unforgivable violence and disorder\" rather than legitimate protests.\n\nThe BBC reported at least 30 planned demonstrations across the UK this weekend, with counter-protests organised by anti-racism groups. The situation remains volatile, with police forces on high alert.\n\nIn Stoke-on-Trent, bricks were thrown at officers, while fireworks erupted amid tense exchanges between anti-Islamic protesters and anti-racism demonstrators in Belfast. The windows of a hotel housing migrants in Hull were smashed.\n\nIn Nottingham's Market Square, opposing groups clashed, exchanging bottles and other items. Pro-England chants were met with boos from counter-protesters.\n\nIn Leeds, around 150 demonstrators carrying St George's flags shouted anti-immigrant slurs, vastly outnumbered by hundreds of counter-protesters who responded with chants of \"Nazi scum off our streets.\"\n\nGovernment response\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer, who recently assumed office, condemned the far-right groups inciting violence. In a statement, he emphasised the necessity of robust police action and consulted with senior ministers on the situation. This incident marks Starmer's first major challenge since his election a month ago.\n\nShadow Home Secretary James Cleverly criticised the government's handling of the situation, stating that more needs to be done to restore public order. He called for regular updates and collaboration with tech companies to curb the spread of misinformation, urging that those engaging in violence face the full force of the law.\n\nThis wave of violence is reminiscent of the 2011 riots in Britain, which erupted after a Black man was shot by police in London, resulting in five nights of widespread unrest.\n\nGreater Manchester Police authorised a dispersal notice for the city centre, while Merseyside Police enacted greater stop-and-search powers in anticipation of continued unrest.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType":

"body": "A Kent MP is calling for the government to put an end to the \"abhorrent\" violence \"plaguing our streets\" after far-right protestors set fire to a hotel which hac asylum seekers inside.\n\nConservative Tom Tugendhat slammed anti-immigration demonstrators who were seen with lengths of wood and spraying fire extinguishers at police officers outside a Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.\n\nIt is just one of many violent protests that have broken out in the UK over the past week following the deaths of three young girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nCondemning the actions, the Tonbridge MP called on the government to use all available resources to \"punish those responsible\".\n\nSpeaking on X, formerly Twitter, the Tory leader hopeful said: \"This behaviour is abhorrent.\n\n\"We have got to put an end to the violence and disorder plaguing our streets.\n\n\"The government must use all the available resources to punish those responsible.\"\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has this evening addressed the country as riots continue to cause disruption.\n\nIn a speech in Downing Street he said: \"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder.\"\n\nVideos from social media appeared to show demonstrators storming into the hotel, with reports of a fire inside.\n\nA police helicopter circled overhead, and at least one injured officer in riot gear was carried away as the atmosphere turned febrile.\n\nElsewhere, Greater Manchester Police said a Section 34 dispersal notice has been authorised covering Bolton until 10pm on Sunday, where a protest is expected later.\n\nMerseyside Police have introduced two section 60 orders giving officers greater stop-and-search powers covering Liverpool and Southport.\n\nThe orders were put in place at 2pm on Sunday and will stay active for a 12-hour period until 2am on Monday.\n\nTeams worked through the night to reopen streets in cities like Hull, where volunteers armed with brushes turned up from 7am to assist council crews.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has given police his \"full backing\" to take any action necessary to respond to \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\" after scenes of disorder in England and Northern Ireland this week.\n\nFollowing the incident in Southport, false claims had spread online that the suspect, later identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana from Lancashire, was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nSir Keir held crisis talks with ministers on Saturday over the unrest, with Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood telling colleagues \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured.\n\nFaith leaders across Merseyside have called on communities to \"remain calm and peaceful\" in the aftermath of the Southport killings, saying some people \"have sought to use the tragedy to create division and hate\".\n\nThe joint statement signed by several faith leaders said: \"Division can destroy the very relationships and environment that we depend upon every day of our lives and there is no place for hate in our communities.\n\n\"It can - and has - left communities in fear and has put people in danger.\"", "source": {"uri": "kentonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kent Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, Staffordshire Police denied that an attack had taken place in the town, with no stabbings reported to cops or emergency services.\n\nAnd as the violence spread, shops appear to have been ransacked by rampaging mobs - with a Shoezone pictured filled with fire in Hull and a phone shop was looted in Liverpool. Shops have been locked down in the Merseyside city, with an Odeon cinema reportedly telling punters they can't leave the building.\n\nFootage posted online showed groups of Muslims gathering to 'defend mosques'. Many appeared to be carrying sticks, though they said they were in the city 'peacefully'.\n\nMajor violence unfolded in Manchester when a massive brawl was swiftly broken up by officers wielding batons after a man allegedly threw a flare. Protesters tore down fences to hurl at other demonstrators as police put themselves between rival groups.\n\nFootage showed men clutching cups of alcohol shouting and jeering as others jumped into a jumbled fight, each side grappling one another and ripping clothing.\n\nIn Nottingham, protesters waved England flags and made gestures at police while in Liverpool, activists hurled bricks and a scooter at police officers as the protests threatened to spill over into all-out violence.\n\nAt Southend-on-Sea, Essex Police have issued a dispersal order across the city's beachfront.\n\nAnd in Hull, tear gas was deployed against demonstrators who smashed the windows of a hotel housing asylum seekers. Three officers were injured and four arrests were made, Humberside Police said.\n\nShocking scenes appeared to show an Asian man attacked after he reversed into a fence trying to escape the mob - while cars were torched and vandalised in an afternoon of rampant chaos.\n\nA Shoezone was pictured with smashed windows and a raging fire inside, while a Greggs and a Specsavers had also been targeted by men with face coverings throwing stones.\n\nMore than 35 'Enough is Enough' demonstrations are planned across the UK this weekend, with several counter-protests by groups such as Unite Against Fascism and Stand Up to Racism also set to take place.\n\nToday, 24 rallies are taking place - 22 of which are Enough is Enough protests, one an anti-racist protest and one is said to be a peaceful vigil.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged his 'full support' for the police to take action against 'extremists' attempting to 'sow hate' by intimidating communities as he held emergency talks with ministers over the unrest in parts of England.\n\nWidespread disruption has torn through the country this week in the wake of the Southport stabbings, where three little girls were tragically killed.\n\nThe riots in cities including London and Hartlepool are thought to be triggered by misinformation spread online as to the identity of the teenager suspected of killing Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, was eventually named as the suspect in a bid to stop the chaos.\n\nSouthport locals - including Elsie's mother - have desperately pleaded for the violence to stop to no avail.\n\nShadow home secretary James Cleverly said PM Sir Keir Starmer and the Home Secretary need to 'do more' to restore public order and 'send a clear message to the thugs'.\n\nThere is a big turnout in Nottingham today, where counter-protesters seem to outnumber the Enough is Enough members.\n\nOver 400 counter-protesters also massed in Cardiff, including Black Lives Matter and Stand Up to Racism, in contrast to a small number of demonstrators.\n\nAt least three people were led away in handcuffs as demonstrators faced counter-protesters in the city.\n\nPolice separated the two groups in King Street as projectiles including cans, bottles, eggs and fruit were thrown, with some hitting officers.\n\nIn Liverpool, photos show officers kicking a flare away after it was launched into the crowd.\n\nAn officer was kicked and knocked off his motorbike this afternoon in shocking scenes as the protests escalated dramatically in the city.\n\nA chair was also thrown at an officer and hit him on the head, as bricks and bottles were also thrown.\n\nMerseyside Police said multiple officers had been injured trying to police the demonstrations in the city.\n\nThe force said: 'A number of officers have been injured as they deal with serious disorder in Liverpool city centre. This behaviour, which puts the public and our officers in harm's way, will not be tolerated. And we will be arresting those responsible.'\n\nAt 9am this morning, hundreds of counter-protesters gathered at Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester ready to face off with the Enough is Enough members.\n\nAround half an hour later, the protesters turned up dressed in balaclavas and England flags.\n\nPolice separated anti-immigration protesters chanting Tommy Robinson's name from the counter-rally organised by anti-hate groups in Manchester.\n\nShocking scenes appeared to show a black man being surrounded and beaten up after he was accosted by crowds of thugs, being kicked in the face before he was surrounded, backed against a wall and beaten.\n\nAfter he was dragged along the floor, police rushed the scene - as violent yobs attempted to get past them and continue to attack him, chanting 'save our kids'.\n\nTwo men have been arrested, one for drunk and disorderly and another after storming into the group of counter-demonstrators.\n\nSome of those attending draped themselves in England flags, while others wore balaclavas and sunglasses to disguise their faces. One attendee waved a sign reading: 'Save our kids'.\n\nGreater Manchester Police later issued a Section 34 dispersal order for the city centre after anti-immigration protesters and counter-demonstrators had to be separated.\n\nThe notice, issued under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 at 11am, gives police the right to order people to leave a specified area if they are committing or are suspected to be committing, anti-social behaviour.\n\nMounted police and lines of officers were pictured containing demonstrators - many of whom wore masks, hats, sunglasses and hoodies.\n\nA number of people reportedly ran into a Sainsbury's and tore through the store.\n\nThere are chants of 'Tommy Robinson' heard from the protesting group - estimated to have around 150 activists - and 'whose streets? our streets' from the counter side, of around 350 people.\n\nMetal fences were seen lying on the floor after protesters ripped them down as riot police and mounted officers rushed in to the crowd, where punches were being thrown.\n\nChants of 'save our kids' and 'we want Starmer out' were also heard from those gathered as the fighting broke out.\n\nSir Keir Starmer said police have the Government's 'full support' to take action against 'extremists' attacking officers and attempting to 'sow hate' as he held crisis talks with ministers over the violence across parts of England.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said she would work with forces to help ensure 'consequences, arrests and prosecutions' for those responsible.\n\nShe added that communities have a 'right to feel safe,' as she insisted the police have the Government's full support to take the 'strongest possible action'.\n\nAsked what ministers could do to help counter the violence, the Home Secretary said: 'The police need to lead operations in communities across the country where there has been both violent disorder and thuggery on the streets, which is completely unacceptable, completely damaging and where the police need to, they have our full support, taking the strongest possible action, making sure that these criminals face the full force of the law.\n\n'And also already there are some of the suspects and perpetrators have already been arrested, already facing charges and are in custody, but we expect more of that to continue and we will support the police every step of the way. Communities have a right to be able to feel safe.'\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said: 'Addressing the scenes of disorder we have seen today, the Prime Minister set out that the police have our full support to take action against extremists on our streets who are attacking police officers, disrupting local businesses and attempting to sow hate by intimidating communities.'\n\nA video shared on social media from Blackburn suggested far-right activists were demanding to see locals' passports.\n\nAnd in Blackpool, cops moved to protect the war memorial, as the iconic Prom was closed. Items were thrown at police vehicles as a police dog tore a flag from two protesters' arms and then tackled a man.\n\nChairs were flung between rioters and punks gathered for the Rebellion festival in the seaside destination.\n\nIn one clash, a man was knocked unconscious when he fell backwards and hit his head on the ground. Another man drove his motorbike at the crowd before officers arrived.\n\nSeparately, police in Belfast this afternoon deployed Land Rovers to keep an 'anti-Islam' protest separated from an anti-racism counter protest. This does not seem to be affiliated with Enough is Enough.\n\nEyewitnesses say protesters chanted 'Islam out' in front of Belfast City Hall as they unfurled Union flags.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said they are treating reports of criminal damage as 'hate crimes', and have made two arrests.\n\nThe rally was staged in response to calls on social media for 'anti-Islamic' protests.\n\nThe PSNI previously said it was aware of social media posts calling for protests including 'specific calls to block roads using women and children'.\n\nPSNI officers in riot gear were deployed with 4x4s to keep protesters separated - as fireworks were thrown in the direction of the police.\n\nThe force said on X it was aware of 'several planned protests across Northern Ireland today and will be in attendance to ensure the safety of everyone involved.'\n\nIn a post on X, Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn said: \"Shame on those involved in violent disorder in Belfast today.\n\n\"Hatred has no place in our society. I commend the officers of the PSNI for everything they have done to keep people safe.\"\n\nAt 10am, a small crowd began to gather at Portsmouth's Guildhall in Hampshire.\n\nImages shared on social media showed many of those attending came with England and Union flags, while at least one attendee came with a sign bearing online conspiracy theories.\n\nOthers came with a flag bearing the inscription: 'Stop mass immigration'.\n\nHampshire Constabulary said no incidents have been reported from the demonstration in Portsmouth this morning.\n\nA small but concentrated gathering of people assembled on the steps of the Guildhall in the city centre and were met with a handful of counter-protesters.\n\nIt came after a demonstration outside Potters International Hotel in nearby Aldershot on Wednesday led to disruption as a 'minority' of protesters began shouting racist abuse.\n\nAt 12pm, protesters also began to congregate at Victoria Square in Hull.\n\nJust before 3pm, violence broke out after a protester threw a rock at a line of police officers.\n\nThe protesters seem to be trying to get to asylum seekers in a hotel - smashing the windows - and pelted officers with abuse.\n\nThe riot police began deploying tear gas in the demonstrator's faces.\n\nA spokesperson for Humberside Police said: 'Officers are currently in attendance at a protest that began in Hull City Centre this afternoon, Saturday 3 August.\n\n'A road closure has been put in place on Ferensway and we advise members of the public to avoid the area at this time.'\n\nVideo posted online also shows crowds of people outside of the Royal Hotel, next to Hull train station, with chants of 'get them out' heard. The hotel is one of three used to house asylum seekers in the area.\n\nSocial media was buzzing with locals warning each other to remain vigilant around Hanley in Stoke-on-Trent today.\n\nOne man posted a video warning people to avoid Hanley Town Hall and to 'protect your places of worship' but 'don't engage them in the streets'.\n\nA Facebook user posted: 'Not quite sure what's happening up Hanley and Stoke today regarding the protests but please bear in mind people there are families of many different backgrounds and children out and about today on the school holidays shopping and enjoying the sun.\n\n'We have enough trouble going on on this world, let's not add to it. Stay safe and peaceful.'\n\nLarge crowds were seen gathering in Hanley shortly after 12pm as they marched through the town centre streets.\n\nStoke-on-Trent's MPs came together to condemn the protests in Hanley today, describing the participants as 'far-right extremists'.\n\nMP Gareth Snell posted on Facebook saying 'racism is not patriotism'. Dr Alison Gardner, Stoke-on-Trent South, and David Williams, Stoke-on-Trent North and Kidsgrove added that 'political extremists' were in the city'to spread division and sow the seeds of hate'.\n\nPolice denied that there had been a stabbing, countering claims made on social media.\n\nIn a statement, the force said: 'There is growing speculation that a stabbing has taken place as a result of the disorder today. We can confirm this information is false and no stabbings have been reported to police or emergency responders, despite videos fuelling speculation on social media.\n\n'We can confirm a man was injured after being hit by a blunt object that was thrown. His injuries are not thought to be serious and he has been taken to hospital for treatment.\n\n'Four men have been arrested in connection with the disorder and are currently in custody for questioning.\n\n'A number of protesters have dispersed from the location while a large-scale policing presence with specialist public order resources remain in the area.\n\n'A section 34 dispersal notice has also been authorised, allowing police to disperse people who may return to the area.'\n\nProtesters could be seen facing up to police officers draped in England football flags and Union flags, and covering their faces.\n\nThere are around one hundreds police officers on duty, with several riot vans and dog units deployed to the centre.\n\nChants of 'we hate Nazis' by the anti-protest group were heard outside Hanley Town Hall.\n\nShops in the town centre, particularly along Stafford Street, were advised to close.\n\nIn Leeds, a pro-Palestine counter protest amassed ahead of a planned march organised by English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson.\n\nChants of 'England 'til I die' were heard and the pro-Palestine march replied with 'Nazi scum off our streets'.\n\nAround 150 demonstrators wore St George's Crosses and pro Reform UK placards wearing 'free Tommy Robinson' t-shirts.\n\nLeeds Art Gallery has locked its doors 'for safety purposes' as the clashes occurred right outside its doors.\n\nTensions also erupted in Liverpool this afternoon, as police confirmed a Section 60 Order has been introduced in the city centre and surrounding areas today.\n\nThe Section 60 Order - giving stop and search powers - was put in place at midday and will stay active for a 12-hour period until midnight.\n\nPolice have also put a Section 34 Dispersal Order in place. Under this legislation, officers have the power to seize any item used for anti-social behaviour.\n\nOfficers closed the Strand along the waterfront at 3.30pm in an effort to calm the simmering tensions, while some shops were 'locked down' as thugs flooded the streets.\n\nAn officer was kicked and knocked off his motorbike this afternoon. As it happened, a traffic cone was thrown and a protester held a wooden pole as they shouted 'save our kids'.\n\nPolice separated groups of demonstrators outside the Cunard Building on The Strand in Liverpool.\n\nThe windscreen of a police van was smashed as bricks and plastic barriers were thrown.\n\nBricks were pelted at the vans and officers by youths with their faces covered.\n\nRiot officers then ran at the group to move them back, before backing away as more bricks were thrown.\n\nAnti-fascist protesters sang: 'Where's your Tommy gone?' At one point a group of men with masks and hoods up appeared to try and charge police officers who stood with batons.\n\nOfficers with riot shields and helmets moved the crowd back and cans, bottles and coins were thrown. Police with dogs also moved in to separate the groups.\n\nTwo groups of protesters met at the Pier Head in Liverpool, in front of the Liver Buildings.\n\nChants of 'save our kids' and 'stop the boats' were heard from crowds gathered closer to the waterfront.\n\nRiot vans arrived on Water Street, as police continue to separate opposing protests at the waterfront.\n\nOn one side, crowds are shouting 'where's your Tommy gone?' while the other side is chanting 'get them out' and 'stop the boats', according to the Liverpool Echo.\n\nIn Nottingham, protesters with St George's and union flags in the Market Square have been met with counter-protesters chanting 'racist scum off our streets' and 'Nazis not welcome'.\n\nScuffles broke out at about 3pm, with bottles and other items thrown from both sides.\n\nBut chants of 'England until I die' and 'Tommy Robinson' were drowned out by boos.\n\nShadow home secretary James Cleverly said the Prime Minister and Home Secretary need to 'do more' to restore public order and 'send a clear message to the thugs'.\n\nThe Tory leadership contender said in a statement: 'In opposition Labour voted against public order measures we brought forward to give our police more powers to keep our streets clear, calm and safe, and Keir Starmer taking the knee sent completely the wrong message. There is never a justification for disorder like this.\n\n'Now they are in Government Labour need to clamp down immediately on the violence that we have seen across the country and send a clear message to the thugs that they will be met with the full strength of the law.\n\n'The public expects the Government to restore order. The Prime Minister and Home Secretary must do more to demonstrate that they are gripping this situation.\n\n'They should be giving regular updates alongside the police so potential rioters know that they won't get away with this and they must haul the tech companies in to ensure they are doing everything they can to prevent the spread of disinformation fuelling these events.'\n\nSunderland Central Labour MP Lewis Atkinson said a link could be drawn between the disorder in his constituency on Friday and the ashes of the English Defence League (EDL), which was founded by Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon.\n\nThe EDL has disbanded but its supporters remain active, and Mr Atkinson said evidence suggested a Nazi offshoot of the group was involved in the violence in his constituency on Friday, in which a police station was torched and a mosque attacked.\n\nNorthumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall said four officers were injured during the violence in the city and 10 people have been arrested.\n\nHe told reporters that those involved in the disorder should 'expect to be met with the full force of the law', adding: 'This was not a protest, this was unforgivable violence and disorder.'\n\nChairman of Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, Qari Asim, said the Muslim community is 'deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far right groups across the country'.\n\nHe said: 'This intimidation and violence is the inevitable, devastating, outcome of rising Islamophobia that has been enabled to fester on social media, in parts of the mainstream media and by some populist leaders.'\n\nMeanwhile, Tory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick said 'elements of the far right' appear to be involved in the rioting while fellow contender Priti Patel denounced the 'thuggery' and said MPs should unite in condemnation.\n\nMr Atkinson said he was 'really sad' for Sunderland after a group of 'racists' descended on the city on Friday and attacked police, setting a police station and two cars on fire and targeting a mosque.\n\nHe added: 'A night of idiots will not prevent us from building.'\n\nAsked how the disorder had happened, Mr Atkinson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that protests had been suggested by people in a number of social media groups in the wake of the Southport stabbings.\n\nHe said: 'The far right, for example Stephen Yaxley Lennon, picked up on those and started promoting those and encouraging known far right individuals to join.'\n\nIndividuals who were involved with the EDL are 'still out there' and need to be kept under surveillance, he said.\n\nMr Jenrick said 'if there is a case' for proscribing the EDL it should be 'considered', when asked by the BBC.\n\nLeadership contender and former home secretary Ms Patel demanded Parliament be recalled over the violence and criticised the Government response, saying: 'Saying the nation is 'braced for disorder' is not only breathtakingly complacent, but both troubling and inadequate.\n\n'The Government is now in danger of appearing to be swept away with events rather than maintaining control of them.'\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer later condemned 'thugs' who had travelled to the town to cause unrest.\n\nThe unrest poses the biggest challenge yet of Sir Keir's premiership, evoking the scale of public disorder last seen during the 2011 riots.\n\nThere were a series of riots in August 2011 in cities and towns across England, which started in Tottenham Hale, north east London, after the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police on August 4.\n\nEducation Secretary and minister for women and equalities, and MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, Bridget Phillipson, posted on X, saying: 'The scenes in our city centre tonight are shocking. We have seen unforgivable violence and thuggery.\n\n'The criminals involved in this appalling disorder must be identified, prosecuted and punished with the full force of the law.'\n\nRudakubana is also charged with the attempted murders of yoga class instructor Leanne Lucas, businessman John Hayes and eight children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and with possession of a kitchen knife with a curved blade.\n\nHe was remanded to youth detention accommodation and will next appear in court in October.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast

Riot vans were on standby, but the only sign of discontent was from the lone protester calling absent demonstrators \"a set of f***ing w***ers\".\n\nIn a video on social media, the protesters can be heard angrily telling no-shows they were 'f***ing a***holes'. The man was outnumbered by police officers he said \"looked bored\". In a comment, he added: \"Looks like everyone is busy in Doncaster.\"\n\nHave protests broken out in your area? Get in touch at webnews@reachplc.com\n\nHe said: \"Well, here we are lads, quarter past two, Sir Nigel Gresley Square, there's me, two coppers who look bored, there's a van there - they looked bored, you're all a set of f***ing w***ers, every one of you. He continued: \"Where are you?\" F***ing a***holes. If I were you boys in future I'd keep your mouth shut.\"\n\nThe protest was set up to show \"solidarity with Southport\" following the stabbing of young girls at a dance class in the Merseyside town on July 29.\n\nElsewhere, violent protests in towns and cities led to officers being injured as objects such as bricks, chairs and bottles were thrown at police. Merseyside Police said a number of officers were injured during \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre, with one officer being hit on the head by a chair.\n\nPolice forces are on high alert across the country, particularly after violence broke out at the first of these weekend protests - held in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, on Friday evening. Eight people were arrested there and three police officers needed treatment in hospital for various injuries.\n\nGreater Manchester Police said a dispersal notice had been authorised for the city centre and Merseyside Police said greater stop and search powers had been granted for officers to deal with planned demonstrations. In Manchester, footage showed scuffles breaking out in Piccadilly Gardens this afternoon. A number of punches were thrown and metal fences were hurled as police could be seen attempting to keep order.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the police have his \"full support\" to take action against \"extremists\" attempting to \"sow hate\" by intimidating communities as he held emergency talks with ministers over the unrest in parts of England.\n\nHome secretary Yvette Cooper said those engaging in violent disorder \"will pay the price\" and that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nIn Hull, four people have been arrested as three officers were hurt during a protest in which a group of people targeted a hotel which houses asylum seekers. Humberside Police Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore said officers have \"faced eggs and bottles being thrown\" as windows were smashed at the hotel which has housed migrants.\n\nElsewhere, bricks were thrown at officers in Stoke-on-Trent and fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast. Four men have been arrested following disorder in the Staffordshire city.\n\nAt least three people were led away in handcuffs in Nottingham following scuffles between opposing groups in Nottingham. In Leeds, a group shouting derogatory phrases about Muslims were outnumbered by counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\".", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nViolent clashes erupted across various towns and cities in the UK, resulting in injuries to police officers from missiles like bricks, chairs, and bottles as riots broke out following the Southport stabbings.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has thrown his \"full support\" behind the police to act against \"extremists\" who are trying to \"sow hate\" and intimidate communities, following urgent discussions with ministers about the turmoil in parts of England.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper issued a stern warning that those involved in violent disorder \"will pay the price\" emphasising that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nEngland and Northern Ireland witnessed confrontations between anti-immigration protesters and counter-demonstrators on Saturday, with police deploying riot shields to separate the factions.\n\nMerseyside Police reported several officers sustained injuries amid \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre, including one officer struck by a chair. Officers faced projectiles such as bricks, bottles, and a flare while stationed along The Strand in the heart of the city.\n\nAn officer was also kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a protester, while others attempted to assault riot shields.\n\nIn Hull, the police arrested four individuals after three officers were injured during a demonstration where a group targeted a hotel accommodating asylum seekers.\n\nHumberside Police Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore described how officers \"faced eggs and bottles being thrown\" and dealt with smashed windows at the hotel which has been providing shelter for migrants.\n\nElsewhere, bricks were hurled at officers in Stoke-on-Trent and tumult erupted amid an exchange between anti-Islamic demonstrators and anti-racism activists in Belfast where fireworks were set off. In the Potteries city, the constabulary reported that four individuals have been nabbed following the unrest.\n\nMeanwhile, market square in Nottingham became a hotspot for confrontation as opposing factions squared off, with missiles including bottles flying in both directions, while chants of \"England till I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" were submerged under a chorus of jeers from those opposing them.\n\nThe East Midlands saw at least a trio of individuals being carted away in handcuffs. Leeds witnessed a scene where roughly 150 flag-waving persons shouting slogans such as \"You're not English any more\" and \"Paedo Muslims off our streets\" found themselves heavily outnumbered by counter demonstrators who retorted with bellows of \"Nazi scum off our streets\".\n\nDisorder also flared up between groups and punks in Blackpool, leading to a fray where bottles, chairs, and even planks of wood were wielded as weapons.\n\nThis spate of violent outbursts was kick-started in Southport on Tuesday when protestors lashed out against the police and vehicles were torched following a monstrous knife assault at a Taylor Swift-themed dance club, which resulted in the tragic deaths of three girls.\n\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17 and from Lancashire, is facing charges over the attack, but false allegations circulating online claimed that the assailant was an asylum seeker who had recently arrived on UK shores via boat.\n\nThe weekend demonstrations came hot on the heels of reprehensible anarchy in Sunderland on Friday night, where a Citizens Advice Bureau was set ablaze.\n\nA minister in the town expressed horror after hooligans attempted to vandalise a gravestone to use it as a projectile amid chaos across the town, denouncing it as \"an act of sacrilege\".\n\nThe local community had gathered in their thousands to honour the memories of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a Southport vigil held on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, the sombre tribute was marred by violence which far-right thugs targeted a mosque, leaving 53 officers and three police service dogs wounded.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk",

The National Police Chiefs' Council, which represents law enforcement across Britain, has said that nearly 4,000 additional officers had been deployed to deter the violence.\n\n\"The police have our full backing,\" Yvette Cooper, the British home secretary, said on Saturday. \"I want everyone to be clear. Anyone who gets involved in criminal disorder, violent thuggery on our streets will have to pay the price.\"\n\nTension has gripped some communities across the country after a stabbing rampage at a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga class on Monday in the town of Southport, near Liverpool, killed three young girls and injured many others. A 17-year-old suspect was later named.\n\nDisinformation about the attacker's identity spread quickly online, falsely identifying him as a migrant and fueling a violent, far-right riot in which a mosque was attacked and dozens of police officers were injured in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nUnrest has since spread to other parts of Britain, with violent protests in Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Nottingham and other cities over the weekend. A protest was also held in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and also turned violent.\n\n\"This week we have seen appalling behavior that in no way shows compassion or respect for the little girls who were killed and injured last week,\" Chief Constable BJ Harrington said on Saturday. \"It shows no respect for our communities, and it will be stopped.\"\n\nIn Liverpool, more than 300 people were involved in what police called a \"violent disorder\" on Saturday night, where businesses were looted and rioters hurled bricks and missiles at police officers. Two police officers were taken to the hospital, one with a \"suspected broken nose\" and another with a likely broken jaw. By Sunday morning, at least 11 people had been arrested, the police said.\n\nFar-right protesters and counterprotesters also clashed in Manchester, where the police issued a dispersal order for all demonstrations in parts of the city center. At the same time, at least 10 people were arrested in Stoke-on-Trent, south of Manchester, on Saturday amid unrest in that city, where the police were beginning to scale back in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nFights also broke out in Leeds, where the police said they had made a \"handful\" of arrests. In Nottingham, where multiple demonstrations took place on Saturday, 15 people were arrested in what the police described as a \"largely peaceful\" day.\n\n\"Anyone who comes into the city or our neighborhoods over the coming days to cause any kind of disorder can expect a robust response,\" said Steve Cooper, the deputy chief constable for Nottinghamshire.\n\nThe wave of protests and unrest has been driven by fast-spreading online misinformation, much of it promulgated by far-right voices on the social media platform X and the Telegram messaging app. They include neo-Nazis, violent soccer fans, anti-Muslim factions, and social media influencers who have amplified their messaging to scores of followers.\n\nBy Saturday, unrest had also spread to Northern Ireland, where anti-immigration messaging has simmered across the island over the British government's plan for asylum seekers. In Belfast, clashes broke out between anti-Islam protesters and an antiracist demonstration at City Hall, with fireworks and other missiles being hurled between the two. Several businesses and vehicles were reportedly set on fire.\n\nOfficials with the Ministry of Justice were reportedly in talks early Sunday that could see the state's courts open overnight in order to process the influx of arrests.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type":

Why? Why is the prime minister not considering recalling parliament? Because something needs to happen.\n\n'There is a limit to how many police officers you can move around the country.

It's totally unrealistic. It's just not going to happen.'\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured. It followed a riot on Sunderland on Friday evening.\n\nIn Liverpool there were 11 arrests and a number of officers injured, with one being hit on the head by a chair. One officer was treated in hospital for a suspected broken jaw and another for a suspected broken nose.\n\nAnother officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nBrian Booth, the Acting National Deputy Chair of Police Federation, welcomed the news that courts could sit throughout the day and night to bring more offenders to justice - saying it would be a serious deterrent.\n\nHe explained that he had he had 'no issue' with water cannons - but believes there are not enough available in the UK to have enough effect.\n\nHimself a veteran of Bradford and the 2011 riots, he said: 'I think the biggest key is we've got to make an absolute deterrent, and also make sure we've got Fast Track courts.\n\nA protester throws a can of cider towards counter-protesters in Bristol\n\nLEEDS: A masked protester raises his arms outside Leeds Town Hall.

Showing if you're going to get involved in the highest level of disorder - rioting - there are consequences.\n\n'I think a few quick hits and a lot of public attention around that will be the deterrent that probably starts to win.'\n\nIn response to reports that magistrates courts could sit 24/7 in response to the riots, a Government spokesperson said: 'There are contingency measures in place across the criminal justice system, to handle any unexpected and exceptional increases in demand on magistrates' courts.'\n\nWhen a major incident causes a sudden surge in criminal gases the Chief Officer of Police and the Chief Crown Prosecutor can request additional court sessions.\n\nThe process was used in 2011, when Sir Keir Starmer was Director of Public Prosecutions, and saw courts open throughout the night to process offenders.\n\nThe riots of that year - sparked after Mark Duggan, a black man, was shot dead by police - saw around 3,000 people arrested across cities including London, Birmingham, Coventry, Leicester and Nottingham.\n\nBut Mr Booth added that drafting in officers from across the country will have an impact on future cases and will mean everyday inquiries will be processed slower.\n\nAnd he said the effect of being pummeled by the very people they have been working to protect will have an 'awful' effect on morale, particularly after they did a 'really good job' in response to the horrific stabbing in Southport.\n\nA protestor holds a fire extinguisher in Liverpool, where there have been tense clashes with police\n\nPolice called into action at the far-right counter demonstration in Bristol\n\nPeople react as a police officer falls while facing protesters throwing bricks and beverage cans outside the Liver Building in Liverpool\n\nOpposing factions clash in Blackpool as fights break out in the seaside city\n\nRead More Hundreds of mosques beef up security over fear planned rallies will spill over into full-on riots\n\nHe said: 'These officers aren't just magicked out of out of nowhere, and there's no impact. These officers are the ones that are carrying a normal workload or investigating crimes already.\n\n'These are the officers who are being dragged back off annual leave or off their rest days and in the future, that will have an impact.\n\n'The general public are going to suffer in the in the sense that officers are being distracted from their normal duties.\n\n'It's awful because we've become the focus of everyone's ills. The police are now becoming the targets of everyone's anger, and it's nothing they've done.\n\n'They've actually gone out and done a really good job bringing the alleged offender to justice, gathering the the evidence and dealing with a very upset public. But now becoming the target of the bricks and the stakes and the hatred.'\n\nThe riots in cities including London and Hartlepool are thought to be triggered by misinformation spread online as to the identity of the teenager suspected of killing Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, was eventually named as the suspect in a bid to stop the chaos.\n\nSouthport locals - including Elsie's mother - have desperately pleaded for the violence to stop to no avail.\n\nA man swings a length of wood as the groups fight on Blackpool's cobbled streets\n\nLEEDS: Yobs wearing the Union Jack mount railings and shout at cops as the protests continue\n\nMANCHESTER: Police clash with right wing protesters in Piccadilly Gardens\n\nMANCHESTER: Major violence has exploded as simmering tensions erupt\n\nRead More Moment mob of racist thugs in Hull yelling 'p***' drag Asian man out of his car and smash it up\n\nShocking images show cars and shops torched on the streets of Hull, while footage appeared to show demonstrators rushing an Asian man in his car as they shouted 'p***', smashing his window as clouds of black smoke billowed overhead.\n\nRunning clashes between the mob and officers in the Liverpool left families visiting to see a Disney Princess cruise ship fleeing in terror from gangs of thugs.\n\nHooligans torched the city's new Spellow Hub library, which had only opened last year.

However, Staffordshire Police denied that an attack had taken place in the town, with no stabbings reported to cops or emergency services.\n\nFootage posted online showed groups of Muslims gathering to 'defend mosques'. Many appeared to be carrying sticks, though they said they were in the city 'peacefully'.\n\nMajor violence unfolded in Manchester when a massive brawl was swiftly broken up by officers wielding batons after a man allegedly threw a flare. Protesters tore down fences to hurl at other demonstrators as police put themselves between rival groups.\n\nFootage showed men clutching cups of alcohol shouting and jeering as others jumped into a jumbled fight, each side grappling one another and ripping clothing.\n\nIn Hull, tear gas was deployed against demonstrators who smashed the windows of a hotel housing asylum seekers.

The National Police Chiefs' Council, which represents law enforcement across Britain, has said that nearly 4,000 additional officers had been deployed to deter the violence.\n\n\"The police have our full backing,\" Yvette Cooper, the British home secretary, said on Saturday. \"I want everyone to be clear. Anyone who gets involved in criminal disorder, violent thuggery on our streets will have to pay the price.\"\n\nTension has gripped some communities across the country after a stabbing rampage at a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga class on Monday in the town of Southport, near Liverpool, killed three young girls and injured many others. A 17-year-old suspect was later named.\n\nDisinformation about the attacker's identity spread quickly online, falsely identifying him as a migrant and fueling a violent, far-right riot in which a mosque was attacked and dozens of police officers were injured in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nUnrest has since spread to other parts of Britain, with violent protests in Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Nottingham and other cities over the weekend. A protest was also held in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and also turned violent.\n\n\"This week we have seen appalling behavior that in no way shows compassion or respect for the little girls who were killed and injured last week,\" Chief Constable BJ Harrington said on Saturday. \"It shows no respect for our communities, and it will be stopped.\"\n\nIn Liverpool, more than 300 people were involved in what police called a \"violent disorder\" on Saturday night, where businesses were looted and rioters hurled bricks and missiles at police officers. Two police officers were taken to the hospital, one with a \"suspected broken nose\" and another with a likely broken jaw. By Sunday morning, at least 11 people had been arrested, the police said.\n\nFar-right protesters and counterprotesters also clashed in Manchester, where the police issued a dispersal order for all demonstrations in parts of the city center. At the same time, at least 10 people were arrested in Stoke-on-Trent, south of Manchester, on Saturday amid unrest in that city, where the police were beginning to scale back in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nFights also broke out in Leeds, where the police said they had made a \"handful\" of arrests. In Nottingham, where multiple demonstrations took place on Saturday, 15 people were arrested in what the police described as a \"largely peaceful\" day.\n\n\"Anyone who comes into the city or our neighborhoods over the coming days to cause any kind of disorder can expect a robust response,\" said Steve Cooper, the deputy chief constable for Nottinghamshire.\n\nThe wave of protests and unrest has been driven by fast-spreading online misinformation, much of it promulgated by far-right voices on the social media platform X and the Telegram messaging app. They include neo-Nazis, violent soccer fans, anti-Muslim factions, and social media influencers who have amplified their messaging to scores of followers.\n\nBy Saturday, unrest had also spread to Northern Ireland, where anti-immigration messaging has simmered across the island over the British government's plan for asylum seekers. In Belfast, clashes broke out between anti-Islam protesters and an antiracist demonstration at City Hall, with fireworks and other missiles being hurled between the two. Several businesses and vehicles were reportedly set on fire.\n\nOfficials with the Ministry of Justice were reportedly in talks early Sunday that could see the state's courts open overnight in order to process the influx of arrests.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ali_watkins@nytimes.com", "name": "Ali Watkins", "type":

UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper warned the mobs they will \"pay the price\" for such ''criminal disorder and violent thuggery''.\n\n\"Addressing the scenes of disorder we have seen, the Prime Minister set out that the police have our full support to take action against extremists on our streets who are attacking police officers, disrupting local businesses and attempting to sow hate by intimidating communities,\" Downing Street said after a high-level meeting of ministers convened by Starmer on Saturday.\n\n\"The Prime Minister ended by saying the right to freedom of expression and the violent disorder we have seen are two very different things. He said there is no excuse for violence of any kind and reiterated that the government backs the police to take all necessary action to keep our streets safe,\" the statement added.\n\nGroups that monitor anti-Muslim incidents across the UK have said there has been an increase in reports from British Muslims expressing concerns for their safety, with many scared to visit their local mosques.\n\n\"People particularly are frightened because of the colour of their skin, and that cannot be right and that is something this government will take every action to deal with,'' UK Policing Minister Diana Johnson told the BBC.\n\n''When I saw people looting some of the shops in the city centre, that's nothing to do with genuine protest or people having different opinions about immigration. That's about criminal behaviour that needs to be dealt with,'' she said, warning the culprits there are ''sufficient prison places'' for such ''criminal behaviour''.\n\nOfficials at the UK Ministry of Justice are said to be in discussions with the judiciary, as well as police chiefs and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for magistrates' courts to open longer hours to speedily process the expected surge in the number of people in custody for riot-related offences.\n\nWales-born Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, has been charged with the stabbing attack on the Taylor Swift theme children's dance workshop in Southport, north-west England, which was the first site of the unrest earlier in the week. It was triggered after false claims spread online that the suspect, who is of Rwandan heritage, was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK on a small boat. Since then, misinformation has continued to spread across social media and resulted in violent demonstrations involving anti-immigrant chants by protesters in different parts of the country.\n\nMerseyside Police in Southport publicly identified the English Defence League (EDL) as a key factor - a group that does not exist in a formal sense but its founder, Tommy Robinson, is

The mob, all white men and women, can be seen kicking and punching the man until police intervenes and breaks up the altercation. Later, Police surround the man to protect him from the mob.\n\nThe protests:\n\nOver 90 individuals were arrested after demonstrations organized by far-right groups escalated into riots across various UK towns and cities on Saturday. The unrest spread through Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Blackpool, and Belfast, where missiles were thrown, shops were looted, and police officers were attacked. Other smaller demonstrations in different locations remained peaceful.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has assured police forces of the government's \"full support\" to take decisive action against \"extremists\" aiming to \"sow hate.\"\n\nTensions have been high following the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in Southport, Merseyside, on Monday.\n\nIn Liverpool, chaos ensued as bricks, bottles, and a flare were hurled at police officers. One officer was struck in the head by a thrown chair, and another was kicked and knocked off his motorbike. Approximately one thousand anti-immigration protestors, some shouting Islamophobic slurs, clashed with counter-protesters.\n\nA few hundred anti-fascist demonstrators gathered near Liverpool's Lime Street station around lunchtime, advocating for unity and tolerance while chanting \"refugees are welcome here\" and \"Nazi scum, off our streets.\" Police in riot gear, accompanied by dogs, struggled to keep the groups apart, and reinforcements were called in to maintain order.\n\nThe unrest persisted into the early hours of Sunday morning, with fireworks being launched at police officers in riot gear. In the Walton area, a library was set on fire, and rioters attempted to hinder firefighters from extinguishing the blaze, according to Merseyside Police. Shops were broken into, and several wheelie bins were set ablaze.\n\nMerseyside Police confirmed that several officers sustained injuries during what they described as \"serious disorder,\" with two officers being hospitalized -- one with a suspected broken nose and the other with a suspected broken jaw. A total of 23 arrests were made in connection with the violence.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Jenny Simms stated, \"The disorder, violence, and destruction have no place here in Merseyside, especially after the tragic events that took place in Southport on Monday. Those who engaged in this behavior bring nothing but shame to themselves and this city.\"", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "pakistantoday.com.pk"}, "authors":

A car was flipped onto its roof in the middle of the street and also set on fire.\n\nPolice arrested 14 people following the violent clashes, where police were yet again targeted with missiles, bricks, and other objects.\n\nChief Superintendent Mark Hall, area commander for Sunderland, said on Saturday: \"Make no mistake, if you were involved last night expect to be met with the full force of the law.\"\n\nSix people have now been charged in connection with \"disgraceful scenes\" of violent disorder.\n\nFour men aged 48, 41, 31 and 29, and one woman aged 43, have been charged with violent disorder.

(Danny Lawson/PA Wire)\n\nA hotel has been targeted on Sunday as demonstrations and riots continue across the UK in the wake of a knife attack last week. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday condemned the violence and said perpetrators would face the full force of the law.\n\nPolice forces in England and Northern Ireland have arrested around 100 people following chaotic scenes in multiple cities where pro- and anti-immigration demonstrators clashed.\n\nOn Sunday, masked rioters have launched lengths of wood and sprayed fire extinguishers at police officers outside a Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.\n\nVideos from social media appeared to show demonstrators storming into the hotel, with unconfirmed reports of a fire inside.\n\nA police helicopter circled overhead, and at least one injured officer in riot gear was carried away as the atmosphere turned febrile.\n\nElsewhere, Greater Manchester Police said sections 34, 60, and 60 AA powers have been authorised to cover Bolton until 10 p.m. on Sunday, giving police enhanced dispersal and stop and search powers.\n\n\"I utterly condemn the far-right thuggery we've seen this weekend,\" Starmer said in a statement, adding it was criminal violence and not legitimate protest.\n\n\"Be in no doubt, those that have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law.\"\n\nIn Middlesbrough, hundreds of protesters squared up to police with shields at Middlesbrough's Cenotaph, throwing bricks, cans, and pots at officers.\n\nA group of demonstrators smashed windows and cars in a residential area, and a scuffle broke out between demonstrators and a small group of people whose cars were smashed.\n\nCleveland Police officers have made several arrests and asked the public to avoid the area.\n\nMerseyside Police said they have also invoked Section 60 stop and search powers in Liverpool and Southport.\n\nThe scenes followed a week of unrest across the country after three young school girls were killed on July 29 in a knife attack in Southport, in which eight other children and two adults were also injured.\n\nThe sole suspect charged was 17-year-old Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, who was born in Wales to Rwandan parents.\n\nBefore the authorities identified him, another individual with a Muslim name had been falsely identified as the suspect by social media users, who claimed he was a small boat asylum seeker.\n\nOn Saturday, pro- and anti-immigration demonstrators clashed in a number of cities, with one side chanting slogans such as \"stop the boats\" and \"England until I die\" while the other side chanted words like \"racist scum off our streets\" and \"Nazis not welcome.\"\n\nTeams worked through the night to reopen streets in cities like Hull, where volunteers armed with brushes turned up from 7 a.m. to assist council crews.\n\nFollowing demonstrations on Saturday, Humberside Police arrested 20 people in Hull while Lancashire Police arrested more than 20 people across the county.\n\nAvon and Somerset arrested 16, Hampshire Police arrested five, and two were arrested in Leicester.\n\nMerseyside Police said the force has arrested 34 people over the week, including 10 in Southport, 12 in Liverpool, and 12 in Walton.\n\nDorset Police issued a statement ahead of two planned protests in Weymouth town centre on Sunday, saying rumours that asylum seekers on Bibby Stockholm will be moved to local hotels are not true.\n\nAsked whether enough is being done to respond to the disorder, policing minister Dame Diana

Cities including Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Blackpool, and Belfast saw significant unrest, marked by missile throwing, shop looting, and attacks on police officers. Smaller demonstrations elsewhere remained peaceful.\n\nThe violence comes in the wake of the tragic killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in Southport, Merseyside, earlier in the week.\n\nIn Liverpool, clashes erupted between around 1,000 anti-immigration protesters and counter-protesters. Violence escalated as bricks, bottles, and a flare were thrown at police, leading to injuries among officers, including one with a suspected broken nose and another with a broken jaw. The unrest continued into the early hours of Sunday, with fireworks targeted at police and a library set on fire.\n\nIn Bristol, a standoff occurred between protest groups and counter-protesters. Songs such as \"Rule Britannia\" and \"England 'til I Die\" were sung by one faction, while beer cans were thrown at anti-racism demonstrators. Avon and Somerset Police reported 14 arrests in the city, with expectations of more to follow.\n\nManchester saw scuffles with police and at least two arrests, while in Belfast, protesters outside a mosque threw objects at media members and vandalized a cafe, leading to two arrests.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has vowed full government support for police actions against \"extremists\" and condemned the violence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper warned that those engaging in \"unacceptable disorder\" would face severe penalties, including imprisonment and travel bans.\n\nStarmer emphasized that while freedom of expression is protected, violent disorder is unacceptable. The government has promised full backing for police efforts to maintain public safety.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Jenny Simms condemned the violence in Merseyside, stating, \"The disorder, violence, and destruction has no place here in Merseyside, least of all after the tragic events that took place in Southport on Monday.\"\n\nAuthorities are bracing for further protests on Sunday but expect fewer demonstrations compared to Saturday's upheaval.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The chief constable BJ Harrington warned: \"If you've been involved but haven't been arrested yet, your time will come.\"\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, Sir Keir Starmer held a call from Chequers with key ministers to discuss the latest unrest.\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said: \"We've been clear to the police that they have our full backing in taking the strongest possible action against perpetrators, includ\u00ading making sure that there are more prosecutors, there are sufficient prison places and also that the courts stand ready. Anyone who engages in this kind of disorder needs to be clear that they will pay the price.\"\n\nOn a day of violence:\n\n* Protests descended into violence in Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Hull, Belfast, Blackpool and Leeds.\n\n* At least 26 people were arrested between Friday and Saturday night with many more arrests likely to be announced.\n\n* Four police officers were injured in Sunderland, three in Hull, and in Liverpool two officers were taken to hospital, one with a suspected broken nose and another with a suspected broken jaw after more than 750 people gathered in the city centre and threw bricks and bottles.\n\n* In Bristol, about 200 far-right demonstrators clashed with 500 counter-protesters, with police deploying dogs to quell the violence. Avon and Somerset police said it had made \"multiple arrests\".\n\n* The far-right agitator Tommy Robinson continued to stoke tensions in Britain despite being more than a thousand miles away on holiday, according to an analysis of his social media posts.\n\n* Dame Priti Patel said parliament should be recalled while a fellow Tory leadership contender, James Cleverly, said Starmer should haul in tech companies over misinformation on their platforms.\n\n* Robert Jenrick, another Tory leadership candidate, said that if there was a case for the proscription of the far-right English Defence League, which was founded by Robinson, it should be considered.\n\nContingency plans are being rapidly pulled together by government and law enforcement agencies, amid fears that Britain is heading for violent disorder on a scale last seen during the 2011 riots. Those were triggered by the police shooting of Mark Duggan, a black man, in Tottenham Hale, north London, and over a week spread across London boroughs then into other English cities.\n\nSources have confirmed the blueprint now being drawn up includes the \"additional courts protocol\", which can be deployed in response to an unexpected surge in criminal cases caused by a significant incident.\n\nIt would enable judges to direct magistrates' courts to extend their sitting hours, including overnight and during weekends. It would also provide additional capacity should police forces begin arresting hundreds of protesters, ensuring they could be brought before the courts as quickly as possible.\n\nPolice chiefs are concerned that, otherwise, suspects charged with rioting or violent disorder could still engage in further demonstrations before their hearings and a bail decision is made. Triggering the protocol requires the agreement of the director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, and the heads of the relevant police forces.\n\nA government spokesman said: \"There are contingency measures in place across the criminal justice system to handle any ... exceptional increases in demand on magistrates' courts.\"\n\nStarmer announced on Thursday that he had established a new violent disorder unit to enable police forces to pull together intelligence and resources to help stamp out unrest led by far-right \"thugs\".\n\nThis weekend the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) drafted in 70 additional prosecutors, with police forces also providing capacity to deploy more officers from neighbouring forces where there were flashpoints.\n\nAccording to insiders, relaxing the charging thresholds again is also an option. However, there are now concerns about the capacity of the court and prison systems to deal with another 2011-style crisis. Between 2010 and 2018, 162 out of 323 magistrates' courts were closed and the crown courts are still grappling with a backlog from the pandemic.\n\nStarmer was director of public prosecutions during the summer of disorder in 2011. More than 3,000 arrests were made and nearly 1,984 people were charged with offences related to the riots.\n\nThe CPS under Starmer's leadership was praised for its response, which included the introduction of 24/7 night courts, a relaxing of the thresholds to determine whether to press charges, and a push for longer jail sentences. In the aftermath of the trouble, the additional courts protocol was drawn up to formalise how the courts and judiciary could respond to similar crises in future.\n\nIt has not been used since, but a government source said that the Ministry of Justice had held discussions with the judiciary, which had indicated a willingness to use it should rioting escalate. More than 100 people have been arrested since the disorder first broke out last week.\n\nIn Liverpool a group of protesters gathered around a female police officer lying injured on the ground. \"Any more pictures and I'll charge \u00a35 a time,\" shouted one thug. \"How many more kids will have to be raped because you won't listen?\" shouted another man. \"She f***ing deserves it,\" yelled a woman with a local accent.\n\nWave after wave of protesters clashed with police by the Liver Building on the city's waterfront, with masked men throwing bricks, bottles and chairs.\n\nAround the country video on social media showed looting, including at a Sainsbury's in Manchester, a JD Sports in Blackpool and an O2 shop in Hull.\n\nIn Hull, three police officers were hurt and at least four people were arrested after thugs descended on a hotel that has been used to accommodate asylum seekers after a protest earlier in the day. Riot police formed a protective cordon around the Royal Station hotel after bricks and bottles were thrown at its windows. Some protesters could be heard chanting: \"Get them out.\"\n\nIn Stoke-on-Trent, a group of far-right protesters stormed the Masjid Salahuddin mosque in the Hanley area, throwing bricks at police and worshippers. Masked counter-protesters carrying batons and metal rods retaliated, leaving at least two members of the far-right group requiring medical attention for head injuries. Staffordshire police said four men had been arrested but put out a statement to counter claims that a stabbing had taken place after speculation on social media.\n\nPatel said the government appeared in danger of being \"swept away with events rather than maintaining control of them\". Calling for parliament to be recalled immediately, she added: \"Now is a moment for national reflection and solidarity ... we either believe in the rule of law, or we do not.\"", "source": {"uri":

Footage posted online showed a bin being set on fire outside the hotel and demonstrators smashing their way inside.\n\nIt was the latest disruption after several nights of unrest triggered by the killing of three girls in the Lancashire town of Southport on Monday, and came hours after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer warned that \"violence committed by a small minority of thugs\" would be met with the full weight of the law.\n\nThe protests are the most widespread eruption of far-right violence in the UK for years, and have been fuelled by a torrent of Islamophobic and anti-immigrant misinformation spread on social media by far-right influencers since the mass stabbing in Southport.\n\nMore than 90 people were arrested on Saturday after violent gatherings in several towns and cities including Bristol, Blackpool, Hull and Liverpool, according to various regional police forces.\n\nJudges were on Sunday considering keeping courts open all night to work through the backlog of cases, as they did in the wake of the 2011 riots that resulted in thousands of arrests and prosecutions.\n\nIn Bolton, Greater Manchester, police issued a dispersal order on Sunday afternoon as several hundred demonstrators and counter demonstrators gathered in the town hall square.\n\nMissiles were thrown as tensions escalated and the protests spilled out across the town centre, with the two sides confronting one another while police attempted to keep them separate.\n\nAround 300 protesters marched through Middlesbrough in North Yorkshire on Sunday afternoon before breaking through a police line in the city centre and throwing projectiles including pieces of slate and plastic bottles.\n\nStarmer held emergency talks with ministers this weekend to discuss the riots spurred by far-right agitators. He said the right to freedom of expression and violent disorder were \"two very different things\" and labelled participants \"extremists\".\n\nThe prime minister said the government backed the police to \"take all necessary action\" to keep Britain's streets safe after attacks on police officers, disruption to local businesses and what he said were attempts to sow hate by intimidating communities.\n\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council said 4,000 extra officers were in place across the country to deal with any further outbreaks of violence.\n\nShadow home secretary James Cleverly said that there was no \"justification or rationale\" for the violence in Rotherham. \"This should be condemned by everybody, and those taking part should expect to be met with the full weight of the

Footage posted online showed a bin being set on fire outside the hotel and demonstrators smashing their way inside.\n\nHome secretary Yvette Cooper said the demonstrators had \"deliberately\" set fire to the building \"with people known to be inside\" and urged police to take \"the strongest action against those responsible\".\n\nIn Bolton, Greater Manchester, police issued a dispersal order on Sunday afternoon as several hundred demonstrators and counter-demonstrators gathered in the town hall square.\n\nMissiles were thrown as tensions escalated and the protests spilled out across the town centre, with the two sides confronting one another while police attempted to keep them separate.\n\nAbout 300 protesters marched through Middlesbrough in North Yorkshire on Sunday afternoon before breaking through a police line in the city centre, throwing projectiles including pieces of slate and plastic bottles, and smashing up cars, police vans and buildings.\n\nAhead of the gathering, calls to stage a full-scale riot had circulated online. Cleveland police said they were dealing with disorder in the town and had made a \"number of arrests\".\n\nThe latest disruptions came hours after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer warned that \"violence committed by a small minority of thugs\" would be met with the full weight of the law.\n\nMore than 100 people were arrested on Saturday after violent gatherings in several towns and cities including Bristol, Blackpool, Hull and Liverpool, according to various regional police forces.\n\nJudges were on Sunday considering keeping courts open all night to work through the backlog of cases, as they did in the wake of the 2011 riots that resulted in thousands of arrests and prosecutions.\n\nStarmer held emergency talks with ministers this weekend to discuss the riots spurred by far-right agitators. He said the right to freedom of expression and violent disorder were \"two very different things\" and labelled participants \"extremists\".\n\nThe prime minister said the government backed the police to \"take all necessary action\" to keep Britain's streets safe after attacks on police officers, disruption to local businesses and what he said were attempts to sow hate by intimidating communities.\n\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council said 4,000 extra officers were in place across the country to deal with any further outbreaks of violence.\n\nSouth Yorkshire mayor Oliver Coppard called the scenes in Rotherham \"brutal thuggery directed against some of the most vulnerable people in our society\".\n\nShadow home secretary James Cleverly said there was no \"justification or rationale\" for the violence in Rotherham. \"This should be condemned by everybody, and those taking part should expect to be met with the full weight of the law,\" he posted on X.\n\nREAD SOURCE",

The riots represent one of the biggest challenges facing the month-old Labour government, as it struggles to rein in the unrest.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper pledged the government's \"full backing\" for the police in dealing with the unrest. \"Anyone who gets involved in criminal disorder and violent thuggery on our streets will have to pay the price,\" she said in a video posted to X.\n\nTensions have risen since an attack on a Taylor Swift-themed dance party left three young girls dead in Southport on Monday. Fuelled by an online misinformation campaign, the attack was seized upon by far-right protesters, some of whom took to the street chanting anti-immigration slogans this weekend.\n\nAround 300 people were involved in disturbances in the Walton area of Liverpool on Saturday night, according to Merseyside Police. The force, which is also responsible for nearby Southport, said that a local convenience store was set on fire and that a library was damaged, while firefighters who attended to the scene had a missile thrown at their vehicle. The police force said it made 23 arrests on Saturday.\n\n\"We will do whatever it takes to make sure that people can get through the court system,\" Diana Johnson, the policing minister, said in an interview on Sky News Sunday. Courts could sit through the night to deal with the large number of people arrested if necessary, she added.\n\nFollowing the attack in Southport, a number of influential right-wing accounts on X spread false information about the perpetrator, including claims that he was an asylum seeker or a refugee. That led to protests and skirmishes with police, including in London, earlier in the week.\n\nEven after the attacker was named as Axel Rudakubana, a 17-year-old from a village near Southport who was born in Cardiff, Wales, protesters have continued to target immigrants.\n\nPolice have warned that the disturbances could continue on Sunday, with protests and demonstrations planned for a number of towns in England, according to posts from activists on social media.\n\nIn Hull, demonstrators gathered outside a hotel that houses asylum seekers, a number of windows were smashed and bottles thrown. In videos uploaded to social media many of the protesters can be heard chanting \"stop the boats,\" a reference to crossings made from the European continent by migrants attempting to get to Britain.\n\nMany police forces across the country have issued so-called dispersal orders to try and break up and deter rioters. Three police officers were hospitalized after violence in Sunderland, the police force there said in a statement. There were also disturbances in Leicester, Stoke-on Trent, Nottingham and Manchester.", "source": {"uri": "luxtimes.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Luxembourg Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Later video footage on social media showed shops on fire. Several officers were also injured during \"serious disorder\" in Liverpool city centre, where bricks, bottles and a flare were thrown and two officers needed hospital treatment and six arrests were made. Greater Manchester police said a dispersal notice had been authorised for the city centre. Scuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham's Old Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides.\n\nAbout 150 people carrying St George's Cross flags, shouting \"you're not English any more\" and \"paedo Muslims off our street\", were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets\". Skirmishes broke out between demonstrators and punks - in town for a festival - in Blackpool, with bottles and chairs thrown.\n\nIn Bristol, police kept protesters and counter protesters apart before a group headed to a hotel used to house asylum seekers.\n\nThe need for urgent political intervention was stressed by the government's independent adviser on political violence and disruption, Lord Walney, who told the Observer that new emergency powers may be needed. \"The system isn't set up to deal with this rolling rabble-rousing being fuelled by far-right actors,\" he said.\n\n\"I think Home Office ministers may want to look urgently at a new emergency framework - perhaps temporary in nature - that enables police to use the full powers of arrest to prevent people gathering where

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nMalaysia has issued a travel advisory to its citizens visiting the UK in light of recent violent protests, marking the first country to do so.\n\nThe Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement following the unrest that has erupted across several areas of the UK after a stabbing incident in Southport on July 29. Malaysians are encouraged to register with the High Commission in London.\n\nThe ministry advised: \"Malaysians residing in or travelling to the United Kingdom are urged to stay away from protest areas, remain vigilant and follow the latest updates and guidance provided by local authorities.\"\n\n43 arrested as Middlesbrough hit by 'staggering' violence on Sunday\n\nKeep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter\n\nRiots have broken out across the country including in Middlesbrough and Rotherham. In Middlesbrough, far-right demonstrators clashed with police near the Cenotaph, hurling bricks, cans, and pots at law enforcement, with one protester declaring, \"It's our f******* country.\"\n\nA mob in Middlesbrough was also seen vandalising residential property, smashing windows of homes and vehicles, accompanied by racially charged language.\n\nThe far-right has been accused of setting a Holiday Inn in Rotherham ablaze, which was being used to house migrants. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has labelled the recent riots as \"far right thuggery\".\n\nIn response to the violent outbreaks in several major UK cities, the Government has issued a stern warning that those participating in criminal disorder will \"pay the price\". Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nStarmer expressed his \"full support\" for police action against \"extremists\" who are attempting to \"sow hate\" by intimidating communities. This comes as he held emergency discussions with ministers regarding the unrest in various parts of England.\n\nPolice officers have been assaulted and injured, leading to numerous arrests with promises of more to come. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood informed ministers that \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\", according to a Downing Street spokesperson.\n\nThis could potentially result in courts operating 24 hours a day, similar to the measures taken during the 2011 riots.\n\nMPs from all political backgrounds have condemned the far-right following the disorder in London, Manchester, Southport and Hartlepool prior to Saturday's violence. The chaos continued into Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast, resulting in several police officers being injured.\n\nThis followed a riot in Sunderland on Friday evening.", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Some rioters hurled pieces of wood, bottles and chairs, and sprayed fire extinguishers at police officers. At least one injured officer in riot gear was carried away by colleagues.\n\nFootage from the scene showed a bin on fire and protesters, some draped in St George and union flags, chanting: \"Get them out.\" The demonstrators appeared at one point to storm into the hotel, with reports of a fire inside, and people peering out of windows.\n\nYvette Cooper, the home secretary, condemned the rioters, saying: \"The criminal, violent attack on a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham is utterly appalling. Deliberately setting fire to a building with people known to be inside.\n\n\"South Yorkshire police have full government support for the strongest action against those responsible.\"\n\nProtests on Sunday were also planned in Bolton, Lancaster, Weymouth and Middlesbrough where more than 300 protesters marched through the city centre, chanting: \"We want our country back\".\n\nThe rioters in Middlesbrough threw bricks, cans and pots at police, and pushed burning wheelie bins at a line of officers with shields, leaving a road strewn with smoking rubbish.\n\nOne group walked through a residential area smashing the windows of houses and cars. When asked by a resident why they were breaking windows, one replied \"because we're English\", the PA news agency reported.\n\nCleveland police said \"a number of arrests\" had been made since the protest started at about 2pm. \"The public is asked to avoid the area,\" a statement on social media added.\n\nElsewhere, Merseyside police introduced two section 60 orders giving officers greater stop-and-search powers covering Liverpool and Southport. The orders were put in place at 2pm on Sunday and will stay active for a 12-hour period.\n\nGreater Manchester police said section 60 and section 60AA orders have been authorised across Bolton until 10pm on Sunday, after an early section 34 dispersal notice. A section 60AA requires people to remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance.\n\nRioting and disorder has continued in the wake of the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport on Monday.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims were spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat. In the wake of these messages, far-right protesters - guided by social media - have gathered in towns and cities across the country.\n\nAt least 100 people were arrested after violence on Saturday in Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast.\n\nSeveral police officers were injured, shops were looted and a library providing support for one of the most deprived communities in the country was set on fire.\n\nBut volunteers armed with brushes and bin bags joined council crews who worked through the night to reopen the streets.\n\n\"Yesterday we saw the worst of Hull but already today we have seen the best,\" councillor Jack Haines of Hull city council said on Sunday as he thanked the \"selfless\" volunteers.\n\nThe community also rallied together to help council workers in County Road, Walton, where the ground floor of Spellow Lane Library Hub suffered severe fire damage. Shelves of books were knocked over at the library which was due to host a programme of activities for young people in August and adult learning courses in September.\n\n\"I want to pay tribute to Merseyside police, the emergency services and Liverpool city council staff for their fast response in cleaning up, and also to those residents who came out to help - it has been heartening to see, and that is the real spirit of our city,\" said councillor Liam Robinson, the leader of Liverpool city council.\n\n\"The violence we have seen on our streets is the manipulation of tragic events, an attack on our community by wanton criminals. We can't allow a minority of mindless thugs to win. They are not representative of our city and we will be working with partners to ensure the perpetrators are swiftly brought to justice.\n\n\"Our priority is to assess the damage to Spellow Library and to bring it back into use as quickly as possible.\"\n\nFaith leaders across Merseyside said that communities who have been hard hit by the Southport killings and the violence that has spread afterwards are trying to rebuild.\n\nIn a joint statement, they said: \"The people of all faiths and none who came out to sweep the streets, to rebuild walls and have so generously donated money in memory of those three girls: that is the spirit that will help us through this incredibly challenging time.\n\n\"While the events of this week may continue to shake our belief in humanity, it remains intact.\n\n\"We need to remain calm and peaceful at this time and, as faith leaders, we are united in our desire for peace and justice. Now is the time to take pride in our community spirit again.\n\n\"Within our different communities we pray for all those affected. And for all those injured to make a good recovery.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emine_sinmaz@theguardian.com", "name":

Two adults were also left in a critical condition, sparking false rumours online about the suspect's background, ethnicity and religion.\n\nOn Sunday (August 4), there were riots in Middlesbrough and Rotherham. Hundreds of far-right protesters squared up to police shields at Middlesbrough's Cenotaph, throwing bricks cans and pots at officers.\n\nOne group in Middlesbrough walked through a residential area smashing the windows of houses and cars as a Holiday Inn housing migrants was stormed and set ablaze.\n\nThere was unrest on Saturday (August 3) in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured. It followed a riot in Sunderland on Friday evening.\n\nFollowing violence across a number of major British cities, the Government has said thugs who engage in criminal disorder on the streets will 'pay the price'. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"Criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer pledged to 'do whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice as quickly as possible' amid the violence\n\nHe told reporters that time has been spent over recent days working with police and the justice system to \"make sure that the necessary arrangements for law enforcement are in place\".\n\nHe added: \"Be in no doubt, those that have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law. The police will be making arrests. Individuals will be held on remand, charges will follow and convictions will follow.\n\n\"I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves. This is not a protest, it is organised, violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets or online.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester

Why? Why is the prime minister not considering recalling parliament? Because something needs to happen.\n\n'There is a limit to how many police officers you can move around the country. I tell you, the first place that these police officers that they want to send all over the country will come from is neighborhood policing.\n\n'And then what happens? Well, the service that the public get is appalling because there are no police officers out there to deliver it.\n\n'The government seem to think this is as easy as snapping your fingers, and all of these police officers are going to get magicked out of cupboards. It's totally unrealistic. It's just not going to happen.'\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured. It followed a riot on Sunderland on Friday evening.\n\nIn Liverpool there were 11 arrests and a number of officers injured, with one being hit on the head by a chair. One officer was treated in hospital for a suspected broken jaw and another for a suspected broken nose.\n\nAnother officer was kicked and knocked off his motorcycle by a demonstrator and others tried to kick riot shields.\n\nBrian Booth, the Acting National Deputy Chair of Police Federation, welcomed the news that courts could sit throughout the day and night to bring more offenders to justice - saying it would be a serious deterrent.\n\nHe explained that he had he had 'no issue' with water cannons - but believes there are not enough available in the UK to have enough effect.\n\nHimself a veteran of Bradford and the 2011 riots, he said: 'I think the biggest key is we've got to make an absolute deterrent, and also make sure we've got Fast Track courts.\n\n'Start showing people that we're not messing about, sending people to prison. Showing if you're going to get involved in the highest level of disorder - rioting - there are consequences.\n\n'I think a few quick hits and a lot of public attention around that will be the deterrent that probably starts to win.'\n\nIn response to reports that magistrates courts could sit 24/7 in response to the riots, a Government spokesperson said: 'There are contingency measures in place across the criminal justice system, to handle any unexpected and exceptional increases in demand on magistrates' courts.'\n\nWhen a major incident causes a sudden surge in criminal gases the Chief Officer of Police and the Chief Crown Prosecutor can request additional court sessions.\n\nThe process was used in 2011, when Sir Keir Starmer was Director of Public Prosecutions, and saw courts open throughout the night to process offenders.\n\nThe riots of that year - sparked after Mark Duggan, a black man, was shot dead by police - saw around 3,000 people arrested across cities including London, Birmingham, Coventry, Leicester and Nottingham.\n\nBut Mr Booth added that drafting in officers from across the country will have an impact on future cases and will mean everyday inquiries will be processed slower.\n\nAnd he said the effect of being pummeled by the very people they have been working to protect will have an 'awful' effect on morale, particularly after they did a 'really good job' in response to the horrific stabbing in Southport.\n\nHe said: 'These officers aren't just magicked out of out of nowhere, and there's no impact. These officers are the ones that are carrying a normal workload or investigating crimes already.\n\n'These are the officers who are being dragged back off annual leave or off their rest days and in the future, that will have an impact.\n\n'The general public are going to suffer in the in the sense that officers are being distracted from their normal duties.\n\n'It's awful because we've become the focus of everyone's ills. The police are now becoming the targets of everyone's anger, and it's nothing they've done.\n\n'They've actually gone out and done a really good job bringing the alleged offender to justice, gathering the the evidence and dealing with a very upset public. But now becoming the target of the bricks and the stakes and the hatred.'\n\nThe riots in cities including London and Hartlepool are thought to be triggered by misinformation spread online as to the identity of the teenager suspected of killing Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, was eventually named as the suspect in a bid to stop the chaos.\n\nSouthport locals - including Elsie's mother - have desperately pleaded for the violence to stop to no avail.\n\nShocking images show cars and shops torched on the streets of Hull, while footage appeared to show demonstrators rushing an Asian man in his car as they shouted 'p***', smashing his window as clouds of black smoke billowed overhead.\n\nRunning clashes between the mob and officers in the Liverpool left families visiting to see a Disney Princess cruise ship fleeing in terror from gangs of thugs.\n\nHooligans torched the city's new Spellow Hub library, which had only opened last year. Video footage showed vandals rampaging outside the facility, as flames rose into the night sky.\n\nUnverified reports on social media suggested a man was stabbed in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent. However, Staffordshire Police denied that an attack had taken place in the town, with no stabbings reported to cops or emergency services.\n\nFootage posted online showed groups of Muslims gathering to 'defend mosques'. Many appeared to be carrying sticks, though they said they were in the city 'peacefully'.\n\nMajor violence unfolded in Manchester when a massive brawl was swiftly broken up by officers wielding batons after a man allegedly threw a flare. Protesters tore down fences to hurl at other demonstrators as police put themselves between rival groups.\n\nFootage showed men clutching cups of alcohol shouting and jeering as others jumped into a jumbled fight, each side grappling one another and ripping clothing.\n\nIn Hull, tear gas was deployed against demonstrators who smashed the windows of a hotel housing asylum seekers. Three officers were injured and four arrests were made, Humberside Police said.\n\nShocking scenes from the Yorkshire city appeared to show an Asian man attacked after he reversed into a fence trying to escape the mob - while cars were torched and vandalised in an afternoon of rampant chaos.\n\nOver 400 counter-protesters also massed in Cardiff, including Black Lives Matter and Stand Up to Racism, in contrast to a small number of demonstrators.\n\nFourteen people were arrested in Bristol, as shocking images showed beer kegs being thrown at police cars and windows being smashed by hurled projectiles.\n\nA video shared on social media from Blackburn suggested far-right activists were demanding to see locals' passports.\n\nAnd in Blackpool, cops moved to protect the war memorial, as the iconic Prom was closed. Items were thrown at police vehicles as a police dog tore a flag from two protesters' arms and then tackled a man.\n\nChairs were flung between rioters and punks gathered for the Rebellion festival in the seaside destination.\n\nIn one clash, a man was knocked unconscious when he fell backwards and hit his head on the ground. Another man drove his motorbike at the crowd before officers arrived.\n\nSeparately, police in Belfast deployed Land Rovers to keep an 'anti-Islam' protest separated from an anti-racism counter protest. Eyewitnesses said protesters chanted 'Islam out' in front of Belfast City Hall as they unfurled Union flags.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said they are treating reports of criminal damage as 'hate crimes', and made two arrests. Later in the night, officers responded after a building was set on fire.\n\nAt 10am, a small crowd also gathered at Portsmouth's Guildhall in Hampshire.\n\nMore than 35 'Enough is Enough' demonstrations are planned across the UK this weekend, with several counter-protests by groups such as Unite Against Fascism and Stand Up to Racism also set to take place.\n\nThe violence came alongside wide-spread looting, with shops across the UK ransacked as yobs took advantage of the chaos sweeping the country.\n\nWine, phones and phones were ripped from the shelves of every-day stores as brazen demonstrators profited from the anarchy, having smashed the windows with bricks and stones.\n\nMore shops were beaten and even torched by gangs of masked yobs, with blazes ripping through ordinary people's livelihoods as anti-immigration demonstrations spiralled out of control.\n\nAnd police say this could only be the beginning - with forces bracing for more disorder in the coming days.\n\nChief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council, said in a statement: 'This week we have seen appalling behaviour that in no way shows compassion or respect for the little girls who were killed and injured last week. It shows no respect for our communities, and it will be stopped.\n\n'We know people will try and do this again in the coming days and policing has been and will continue to be ready.\n\n'There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy.\n\n'So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you. Anyone committing a criminal offence will be detained and brought before the courts.\n\n'In recent days we have seen criminals masquerading as protesters, causing senseless destruction.\n\n'These people are not protesters, they're violent thugs - and many have already been arrested and charged.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"},

Some rioters hurled pieces of wood, bottles and chairs, and sprayed fire extinguishers at police officers. At least one injured officer in riot gear was carried away by colleagues.\n\nFootage from the scene showed a bin on fire and protesters, some draped in St George and union flags, chanting: \"Get them out.\" The demonstrators appeared at one point to storm into the hotel, with reports of a fire inside, and people peering out of windows.\n\nYvette Cooper, the home secretary, condemned the rioters, saying: \"The criminal, violent attack on a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham is utterly appalling. Deliberately setting fire to a building with people known to be inside.\n\nRelated: 'Far-right thugs' will be swiftly brought to justice, Keir Starmer vows\n\n\"South Yorkshire police have full government support for the strongest action against those responsible.\"\n\nProtests on Sunday were also planned in Bolton, Lancaster, Weymouth and Middlesbrough where more than 300 protesters marched through the city centre, chanting: \"We want our country back\".\n\nThe rioters in Middlesbrough threw bricks, cans and pots at police, and pushed burning wheelie bins at a line of officers with shields, leaving a road strewn with smoking rubbish.\n\nOne group walked through a residential area smashing the windows of houses and cars. When asked by a resident why they were breaking windows, one replied \"because we're English\", the PA news agency reported.\n\nCleveland police said \"a number of arrests\" had been made since the protest started at about 2pm. \"The public is asked to avoid the area,\" a statement on social media added.\n\nElsewhere, Merseyside police introduced two section 60 orders giving officers greater stop-and-search powers covering Liverpool and Southport. The orders were put in place at 2pm on Sunday and will stay active for a 12-hour period.\n\nGreater Manchester police said section 60 and section 60AA orders have been authorised across Bolton until 10pm on Sunday, after an early section 34 dispersal notice. A section 60AA requires people to remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance.\n\nRioting and disorder has continued in the wake of the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport on Monday.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims were spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat. In the wake of these messages, far-right protesters - guided by social media - have gathered in towns and cities across the country.\n\nAt least 100 people were arrested after violence on Saturday in Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast.\n\nSeveral police officers were injured, shops were looted and a library providing support for one of the most deprived communities in the country was set on fire.\n\nBut volunteers armed with brushes and bin bags joined council crews who worked through the night to reopen the streets.\n\n\"Yesterday we saw the worst of Hull but already today we have seen the best,\" councillor Jack Haines of Hull city council said on Sunday as he thanked the \"selfless\" volunteers.\n\nRelated: 'Nick them quick' approach to be used against UK rioters, minister says\n\nThe community also rallied together to help council workers in County Road, Walton, where the ground floor of Spellow Lane Library Hub suffered severe fire damage. Shelves of books were knocked over at the library which was due to host a programme of activities for young people in August and adult learning courses in September.\n\n\"I want to pay tribute to Merseyside police, the emergency services and Liverpool city council staff for their fast response in cleaning up, and also to those residents who came out to help - it has been heartening to see, and that is the real spirit of our city,\" said councillor Liam Robinson, the leader of Liverpool city council.\n\n\"The violence we have seen on our streets is the manipulation of tragic events, an attack on our community by wanton criminals. We can't allow a minority of mindless thugs to win. They are not representative of our city and we will be working with partners to ensure the perpetrators are swiftly brought to justice.\n\n\"Our priority is to assess the damage to Spellow Library and to bring it back into use as quickly as possible.\"\n\nFaith leaders across Merseyside said that communities who have been hard hit by the Southport killings and the violence that has spread afterwards are trying to rebuild.\n\nIn a joint statement, they said: \"The people of all faiths and none who came out to sweep the streets, to rebuild walls and have so generously donated money in memory of those three girls: that is the spirit that will help us through this incredibly challenging time.\n\n\"While the events of this week may continue to shake our belief in humanity, it remains intact.\n\n\"We need to remain calm and peaceful at this time and, as faith leaders, we are united in our desire for peace and justice. Now is the time to take pride in our community spirit again.\n\n\"Within our different communities we pray for all those affected. And for all those injured to make a good recovery.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He said there is no excuse for violence of any kind and reiterated that the government backs the police to take all necessary action to keep our streets safe,\" the statement added.\n\nGroups that monitor anti-Muslim incidents across the UK have said there has been an increase in reports from British Muslims expressing concerns for their safety, with many scared to visit their local mosques.\n\n\"People particularly are frightened because of the colour of their skin, and that cannot be right and that is something this government will take every action to deal with,\" UK Policing Minister Diana Johnson told the BBC.\n\n\"When I saw people looting some of the shops in the city centre, that's nothing to do with genuine protest or people having different opinions about immigration. That's about criminal behaviour that needs to be dealt with,\" she said, warning the culprits there are \"sufficient prison places\" for such \"criminal behaviour\".\n\nOfficials at the UK Ministry of Justice are said to be in discussions with the judiciary, as well as police chiefs and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for magistrates' courts to open longer hours to speedily process the expected surge in the number of people in custody for riot-related offences.\n\nWales-born Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, has been charged with the stabbing attack on the Taylor Swift theme children's dance workshop in Southport, north-west England, which was the first site of the unrest earlier in the week.\n\nIt was triggered after false claims spread online that the suspect, who is of Rwandan heritage, was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK on a small boat. Since then, misinformation has continued to spread across social media and resulted in violent demonstrations involving anti-immigrant chants by protesters in different parts of the country.\n\nMerseyside Police in Southport publicly identified the English Defence League (EDL) as a key factor - a group that does not exist in a formal sense but its founder, Tommy Robinson, is associated with using the social media space to whip up far-right sentiments.\n\nStand Up to Racism, among the groups organising some of the counter-protests, has warned that the activities of the extremist mobs must not be \"unopposed\".

These are the images I never want to see, of colleagues being battered just for doing their job.\"\n\nThe far-right has drawn widespread condemnation as the organising force behind scenes of disorder in multiple towns and cities in the wake of the killings of three young girls in Southport on Monday.\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect, later identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana from Lancashire, was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nBricks, chairs and bottles have been pelted at officers, mosques have been attacked, shops looted and a number of community facilities across the country, including a library, torched in the violence.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said people involved in the clashes \"will pay the price\" and \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast which saw several police officers injured.\n\nAt least 100 arrests have been made across the country and some charges have been brought, with police warning of more to come once footage has been scoured.\n\nSir Keir held crisis talks with ministers on Saturday over the unrest, with Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood telling colleagues \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nFurther protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType":

has been targeted on Sunday as demonstrations and riots continue across the UK in the wake of a knife attack earlier this week.\n\nPolice forces in England and Northern Ireland have arrested around 100 people following chaotic scenes in multiple cities where pro- and anti-immigration demonstrators clashed.\n\nOn Sunday, masked rioters have launched lengths of wood and sprayed fire extinguishers at police officers outside a Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.\n\nVideos from social media appeared to show demonstrators storming into the hotel, with unconfirmed reports of a fire inside.\n\nA police helicopter circled overhead, and at least one injured officer in riot gear was carried away as the atmosphere turned febrile.\n\nElsewhere, Greater Manchester Police said sections 34, 60, and 60 AA powers have been authorised to cover Bolton until 10 p.m. on Sunday, giving police enhanced dispersal and stop and search powers.\n\nIn Middlesbrough, hundreds of protesters squared up to police with shields at Middlesbrough's Cenotaph, throwing bricks, cans, and pots at officers.\n\nA group of demonstrators smashed windows and cars in a residential area, and a scuffle broke out between demonstrators and a small group of people whose cars were smashed.\n\nCleveland Police officers have made several arrests and asked the public to avoid the area.\n\nMerseyside Police said they have also invoked Section 60 stop and search powers in Liverpool and Southport.\n\nThe scenes followed a week of unrest across the country after three young school girls were killed on July 29 in a knife attack in Southport, in which eight other children and two adults were also injured.\n\nThe sole suspect charged was 17-year-old Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, who was born in Wales to Rwandan parents.\n\nBefore the authorities identified him, another individual with a Muslim name had been falsely identified as the suspect by social media users, who claimed he was a small boat asylum seeker.\n\nOn Saturday, pro- and anti-immigration demonstrators clashed in a number of cities, with one side chanting slogans such as \"stop the boats\" and \"England until I die\" while the other side chanted words like \"racist scum off our streets\" and \"Nazis not welcome.\"\n\nTeams worked through the night to reopen streets in cities like Hull, where volunteers armed with brushes turned up from 7 a.m. to assist council crews.\n\nFollowing demonstrations on Saturday, Humberside Police arrested 20 people in Hull while Lancashire Police arrested more than 20 people across the county.\n\nAvon and Somerset arrested 16, Hampshire Police arrested five, and two were arrested in Leicester.\n\nMerseyside Police said the force has arrested 34 people over the week, including 10 in Southport, 12 in Liverpool, and 12 in Walton.\n\nDorset Police issued a statement ahead of two planned protests in Weymouth town centre on Sunday, saying rumours that asylum seekers on Bibby Stockholm will be moved to local hotels are not true.\n\nAsked whether enough is being done to respond to the disorder, policing minister Dame Diana said the government has been \"reassured\" that forces are able to meet the scale of the challenge.\n\n\"The police have made it very clear that they have all the resources they need at the moment ... they have the powers that they need,\" the minister told BBC News.\n\nChief Constable BJ Harrington, National Police Chiefs' Council's public order lead, said the \"appalling behaviour\" of rioters \"in no way shows compassion and respect for the little girls who were killed and injured last week.\"\n\nHe said 130 extra units, or around 4,000 extra officers have been deployed across the country, warning, \"Anyone committing a criminal offence will be detained and brought before the courts.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We have seen unforgivable violence and thuggery.\n\n'The criminals involved in this appalling disorder must be identified, prosecuted and punished with the full force of the law.'\n\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nAn extra 70 prosecutors have been drafted in on standby this weekend to charge people who set out to cause violent disorder as the authorities prepared to deal with dozens of further demonstrations today and tomorrow.\n\nWhen asked by the BBC, Tory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick said he would 'absolutely' condemn the far right for organising the disorder, adding, 'We need to ensure that the police have all the support that they need.'.\n\nMeanwhile, fellow Conservative leadership contender and former home secretary Priti Patel demanded Parliament be recalled over the violence and criticised the government response, warning: 'Saying the nation is 'braced for disorder' is not only breathtakingly complacent, but both troubling and inadequate.\n\n'The government is now in danger of appearing to be swept away with events rather than maintaining control of them.'\n\nShe added: 'Now is a moment for national reflection and solidarity - to pull back from the wave of violence we have seen, to call it out for what it is - without fear or favour - and for parliament to speak with one voice in condemnation.'\n\nMayor of the North East Kim McGuinness praised the people of Sunderland for cleaning up the wreckage of the riot, which she said showed 'the true spirit of what we are as the North East and as Sunderland'.\n\nThe violence started on Tuesday after hundreds of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil.\n\nA group of rioters, many with their faces covered, gathered outside a mosque, where they attacked the front of the building by throwing several missiles.\n\nThey also threw objects, including wheelie bins, at police officers, leaving 53 officers and three police dogs injured.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer later condemned the 'thugs' who had travelled to the town to cause unrest.\n\nRudakubana is also charged with the attempted murders of yoga class instructor Leanne Lucas, businessman John Hayes and eight children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and with possession of a kitchen knife with a curved blade.\n\nHe was remanded to youth detention accommodation and will next appear in court in October.\n\nMORE : Rioters in Sunderland 'tried to smash gravestones for missiles to throw at police'\n\nMORE : Boy, 13, charged with sex attacks at knifepoint including attempted rape",

In Sunderland, a police building was ransacked, and a Citizens Advice premises next door was set on fire.\n\nNorthumbria Police confirmed 10 arrests and reported that four officers were hospitalized.\n\nSimilar scenes of unrest were reported in Hull, where Humberside Police said three officers were injured during clashes in the city center.\n\nFour people have been arrested in connection with public order violations, and a dispersal order has been issued to control the ongoing chaos.\n\nMerseyside Police have been actively working to control the situation in Liverpool, where they faced significant resistance.\n\nProtesters threw eggs, bottles, and smoke canisters, with some masked people among the crowd chanting anti-immigrant slogans.

surprise and concern over the protests, questioning the connection to the tragic events in Southport earlier in the week, where three young girls were killed.\n\nThe Sunderland protest on Friday evening was among several planned across the UK this weekend.\n\nThese protests have been fueled by social media misinformation about the 17-year-old suspect's background and religion.\n\nAnti-racism group Hope Not Hate has reported that up to 35 protests are planned across the UK this weekend, driven by a broad anti-multiculturalism, anti-Muslim, and anti-government agenda.\n\nPolice and local

I commend the officers of the PSNI for everything they have done to keep people safe.\"\n\nAt 10am, a small crowd began to gather at Portsmouth's Guildhall in Hampshire.\n\nImages shared on social media showed many of those attending came with England and Union flags, while at least one attendee came with a sign bearing online conspiracy theories.\n\nOthers came with a flag bearing the inscription: 'Stop mass immigration'.\n\nHampshire Constabulary said no incidents have been reported from the demonstration in Portsmouth this morning.\n\nA small but concentrated gathering of people assembled on the steps of the Guildhall in the city centre and were met with a handful of counter-protesters.\n\nIt came after a demonstration outside Potters International Hotel in nearby Aldershot on Wednesday led to disruption as a 'minority' of protesters began shouting racist abuse.\n\nAt 12pm, protesters also began to congregate at Victoria Square in Hull.\n\nJust before 3pm, violence broke out after a protester threw a rock at a line of police officers.\n\nThe protesters seem to be trying to get to asylum seekers in a hotel - smashing the windows - and pelted officers with abuse.\n\nThe riot police began deploying tear gas in the demonstrator's faces.\n\nA spokesperson for Humberside Police said: 'Officers are currently in attendance at a protest that began in Hull City Centre this afternoon, Saturday 3 August.\n\n'A road closure has been put in place on Ferensway and we advise members of the public to avoid the area at this time.'\n\nPORTSMOUTH: The protest in Portsmouth has seen crowds gather in front of the Guildhall\n\nHULL: Protesters gathered adding to the series of demonstrations happening across the UK\n\nHULL: At 12pm, protesters also began to congregate at Victoria Square in Hull\n\nVideo posted online also shows crowds of people outside of the Royal Hotel, next to Hull train station, with chants of 'get them out' heard. The hotel is one of three used to house asylum seekers in the area.\n\nSocial media was buzzing with locals warning each other to remain vigilant around Hanley in Stoke-on-Trent today.\n\nOne man posted a video warning people to avoid Hanley Town Hall and to 'protect your places of worship' but 'don't engage them in the streets'.\n\nA Facebook user posted: 'Not quite sure what's happening up Hanley and Stoke today regarding the protests but please bear in mind people there are families of many different backgrounds and children out and about today on the school holidays shopping and enjoying the sun.\n\n'We have enough trouble going on on this world, let's not add to it. Stay safe and peaceful.'\n\nLarge crowds were seen gathering in Hanley shortly after 12pm as they marched through the town centre streets.\n\nStoke-on-Trent's MPs came together to condemn the protests in Hanley today, describing the participants as 'far-right extremists'.\n\nMP Gareth Snell posted on Facebook saying 'racism is not patriotism'. Dr Alison Gardner, Stoke-on-Trent South, and David Williams, Stoke-on-Trent North and Kidsgrove added that 'political extremists' were in the city'to spread division and sow the seeds of hate'.\n\nLEEDS: People protest outside Leeds Town Hall today following the stabbing attacks\n\nLEEDS: A pro-Palestine counter protest amassed ahead of a planned march organised by English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson\n\nLEEDS: Chants of 'England 'til I die' were heard and the pro-Palestine march replied with 'Nazi scum off our streets' in Leeds\n\nLEEDS: Around 150 demonstrators wore St George's Crosses and pro Reform UK placards wearing 'free Tommy Robinson' t-shirts in Leeds\n\nPolice denied that there had been a stabbing, countering claims made on social media.\n\nIn a statement, the force said: 'There is growing speculation that a stabbing has taken place as a result of the disorder today. We can confirm this information is false and no stabbings have been reported to police or emergency responders, despite videos fuelling speculation on social media.\n\n'We can confirm a man was injured after being hit by a blunt object that was thrown. His injuries are not thought to be serious and he has been taken to hospital for treatment.\n\n'Four men have been arrested in connection with the disorder and are currently in custody for questioning.\n\n'A number of protesters have dispersed from the location while a large-scale policing presence with specialist public order resources remain in the area.\n\n'A section 34 dispersal notice has also been authorised, allowing police to disperse people who may return to the area.'\n\nProtesters could be seen facing up to police officers draped in England football flags and Union flags, and covering their faces.\n\nThere are around one hundreds police officers on duty, with several riot vans and dog units deployed to the centre.\n\nChants of 'we hate Nazis' by the anti-protest group were heard outside Hanley Town Hall.\n\nShops in the town centre, particularly along Stafford Street, were advised to close.\n\nIn Leeds, a pro-Palestine counter protest amassed ahead of a planned march organised by English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson.\n\nLIVERPOOL: Tensions also erupted this afternoon, as police confirmed a Section 60 Order has been introduced in the city centre and surrounding areas today\n\nLIVERPOOL: A demonstration outside following violent protests across the country\n\nLIVERPOOL: Police officers stand guard between anti-racism protesters and the 'Enough is Enough' demonstration as a flare is thrown into the crowd\n\nLIVERPOOL: A protester falls as police officers try to control a stand-off\n\nLIVERPOOL: Two groups of protesters met at the Pier Head, in front of the Liver Buildings\n\nLIVERPOOL: People protest following the stabbing attacks on Monday\n\nChants of 'England 'til I die' were heard and the pro-Palestine march replied with 'Nazi scum off our streets'.\n\nAround 150 demonstrators wore St George's Crosses and pro Reform UK placards wearing 'free Tommy Robinson' t-shirts.\n\nLeeds Art Gallery has locked its doors 'for safety purposes' as the clashes occurred right outside its doors.\n\nTensions also erupted in Liverpool this afternoon, as police confirmed a Section 60 Order has been introduced in the city centre and surrounding areas today.\n\nThe Section 60 Order - giving stop and search powers - was put in place at midday and will stay active for a 12-hour period until midnight.\n\nPolice have also put a Section 34 Dispersal Order in place. Under this legislation, officers have the power to seize any item used for anti-social behaviour.\n\nOfficers closed the Strand along the waterfront at 3.30pm in an effort to calm the simmering tensions, while some shops were 'locked down' as thugs flooded the streets.\n\nAn officer was kicked and knocked off his motorbike this afternoon. As it happened, a traffic cone was thrown and a protester held a wooden pole as they shouted 'save our kids'.\n\nPolice separated groups of demonstrators outside the Cunard Building on The Strand in Liverpool.\n\nThe windscreen of a police van was smashed as bricks and plastic barriers were thrown.\n\nBricks were pelted at the vans and officers by youths with their faces covered.\n\nRiot officers then ran at the group to move them back, before backing away as more bricks were thrown.\n\nPriti Patel called the riots 'totally unacceptable' as she urged for Parliament to be recalled\n\nNOTTINGHAM: People protest in the Market Square following the stabbing attacks on Monday\n\nMANCHESTER: Police stand guard at the entrance to a Sainsbury's Local store that was ransacked by rioters\n\nLIVERPOOL: E-scooters were hurled into the road by protesters as they faced off with police\n\nAnti-fascist protesters sang: 'Where's your Tommy gone?' At one point a group of men with masks and hoods up appeared to try and charge police officers who stood with batons.\n\nOfficers with riot shields and helmets moved the crowd back and cans, bottles and coins were thrown. Police with dogs also moved in to separate the groups.\n\nTwo groups of protesters met at the Pier Head in Liverpool, in front of the Liver Buildings.\n\nRead More Jail cells are cleared and lawyers put on standby in crackdown amid fears of weekend of riots: Sunderland burns on fresh night of shame and Southport MP slams 'disgusting extremists hijacking grief' - but Kemi says 'we can't ignore tensions'\n\nChants of 'save our kids' and 'stop the boats' were heard from crowds gathered closer to the waterfront.\n\nRiot vans arrived on Water Street, as police continue to separate opposing protests at the waterfront.\n\nOn one side, crowds are shouting 'where's your Tommy gone?' while the other side is chanting 'get them out' and 'stop the boats', according to the Liverpool Echo.\n\nIn Nottingham, protesters with St George's and union flags in the Market Square have been met with counter-protesters chanting 'racist scum off our streets' and 'Nazis not welcome'.\n\nScuffles broke out at about 3pm, with bottles and other items thrown from both sides.\n\nBut chants of 'England until I die' and 'Tommy Robinson' were drowned out by boos.\n\nShadow home secretary James Cleverly said the Prime Minister and Home Secretary need to 'do more' to restore public order and 'send a clear message to the thugs'.\n\nThe Tory leadership contender said in a statement: 'In opposition Labour voted against public order measures we brought forward to give our police more powers to keep our streets clear, calm and safe, and Keir Starmer taking the knee sent completely the wrong message. There is never a justification for disorder like this.\n\n'Now they are in Government Labour need to clamp down immediately on the violence that we have seen across the country and send a clear message to the thugs that they will be met with the full strength of the law.\n\n'The public expects the Government to restore order. The Prime Minister and Home Secretary must do more to demonstrate that they are gripping this situation.\n\n'They should be giving regular updates alongside the police so potential rioters know that they won't get away with this and they must haul the tech companies in to ensure they are doing everything they can to prevent the spread of disinformation fuelling these events.'\n\nSunderland Central Labour MP Lewis Atkinson said a link could be drawn between the disorder in his constituency on Friday and the ashes of the English Defence League (EDL), which was founded by Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon.\n\nNOTTINGHAM: protesters in the Market Square have clashed with officers\n\nMANCHESTER: This morning, hundreds of counter-protesters gathered in preparation for the Enough is Enough rallies taking place today\n\nMANCHESTER: Hundreds of protesters on both sides of railings set up to separate them can be seen in Piccadilly Gardens at 9.30 this morning\n\nMANCHESTER: Activists take part in a protest at Piccadilly Gardens, holding an England flag\n\nA police officer breaks down a door in Sunderland to make an arrest after a night of horrendous violence in the city\n\nTwo people were arrested, a woman aged 43 on suspicion of violent disorder, and a man aged 55 on suspicion of provoking violence\n\nThe EDL has disbanded but its supporters remain active, and Mr Atkinson said evidence suggested a Nazi offshoot of the group was involved in the violence in his constituency on Friday, in which a police station was torched and a mosque attacked.\n\nNorthumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall said four officers were injured during the violence in the city and 10 people have been arrested.\n\nHe told reporters that those involved in the disorder should 'expect to be met with the full force of the law', adding: 'This was not a protest, this was unforgivable violence and disorder.'\n\nChairman of Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, Qari Asim, said the Muslim community is 'deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far right groups across the country'.\n\nHe said: 'This intimidation and violence is the inevitable, devastating, outcome of rising Islamophobia that has been enabled to fester on social media, in parts of the mainstream media and by some populist leaders.'\n\nMeanwhile, Tory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick said 'elements of the far right' appear to be involved in the rioting while fellow contender Priti Patel denounced the 'thuggery' and said MPs should unite in condemnation.\n\nMr Atkinson said he was 'really sad' for Sunderland after a group of 'racists' descended on the city on Friday and attacked police, setting a police station and two cars on fire and targeting a mosque.\n\nHe added: 'A night of idiots will not prevent us from building.'\n\nAsked how the disorder had happened, Mr Atkinson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that protests had been suggested by people in a number of social media groups in the wake of the Southport stabbings.\n\nHe said: 'The far right, for example Stephen Yaxley Lennon, picked up on those and started promoting those and encouraging known far right individuals to join.'\n\nIndividuals who were involved with the EDL are 'still out there' and need to be kept under surveillance, he said.\n\nMr Jenrick said 'if there is a case' for proscribing the EDL it should be 'considered', when asked by the BBC.\n\nLeadership contender and former home secretary Ms Patel demanded Parliament be recalled over the violence and criticised the Government response, saying: 'Saying the nation is 'braced for disorder' is not only breathtakingly complacent, but both troubling and inadequate.\n\nNOTTINGHAM: Police officers speak to a man as people protest this afternoon\n\nMANCHESTER: Police hold back anti-racism counter protesters at Piccadilly Gardens\n\nMANCHESTER: People in front of an anti-racism counter protest at Piccadilly Gardens\n\nLIVERPOOL: Heavy police presence as people protest, following the stabbing on Monday\n\n'The Government is now in danger of appearing to be swept away with events rather than maintaining control of them.'\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer later condemned 'thugs' who had travelled to the town to cause unrest.\n\nThe unrest poses the biggest challenge yet of Sir Keir's premiership, evoking the scale of public disorder last seen during the 2011 riots.\n\nThere were a series of riots in August 2011 in cities and towns across England, which started in Tottenham Hale, north east London, after the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police on August 4.\n\nEducation Secretary and minister for women and equalities, and MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, Bridget Phillipson, posted on X, saying: 'The scenes in our city centre tonight are shocking. We have seen unforgivable violence and thuggery.\n\n'The criminals involved in this appalling disorder must be identified, prosecuted and punished with the full force of the law.'\n\nRudakubana is also charged with the attempted murders of yoga class instructor Leanne Lucas, businessman John Hayes and eight children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and with possession of a kitchen knife with a curved blade.\n\nHe was remanded to youth detention accommodation and will next appear in court in October.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail

Eight other children and two adults were injured in the attack.\n\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, who was born in Wales to Rwandan parents, has been charged with the murders of the three girls, 10 counts of attempted murder, and possession of a bladed article.\n\nBefore the authorities identified him, another individual with a Muslim name had been falsely identified as the suspect by social media users, who claimed he was a small boat asylum seeker.\n\nThe attack also coincided with another recent riot involving a minority community and the brief detention of anti-Islamic activist Tommy Robinson amid a court case in which he was accused of contempt of court.\n\nThree police officers were injured as a direct result of the disorder, Northumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall said.\n\nA fourth officer, a mounted rider, was also taken to hospital after sustaining \"serious injuries in an accident,\" he said.\n\nHall said a full investigation is now underway to identify those responsible, and those involved should expect \"to be met with the full force of the law.\"\n\nHe also condemned the \"attempt to drive division amongst us\" and said, \"We are committed to make sure that doesn't happen.\"\n\nLewis Atkinson, Labour MP for Sunderland Central, said that a link could be drawn between the disorder in his constituency on Friday and the ashes of the now-defunct English Defence League (EDL), which was founded by Tommy Robinson.\n\nMore protests have been organised on social media over the weekend.\n\nHope Not Hate said it had identified 35 planned protests triggered by the Southport attack, although most of them are \"more broadly focused, expressive of a wider hostility to multiculturalism, anti-Muslim, and anti-migrant prejudice, as well as a visceral streak of populist anti-Government sentiment.\"\n\nCounter-protests and separate pro-Gaza marches are also expected over the weekend.\n\nIn a statement issued on Friday, CPS said: \"We stand ready to combat any criminality which arises from public disorder, and we will have an additional 70 experienced lawyers supporting police out-of-hours with charging advice this weekend to help maintain public safety.\"\n\nGreater Manchester Police imposed a Section 34 dispersal notice across Manchester City Centre for Saturday, meaning officers have extra powers to deal with anti-social behaviour in the designated areas.\n\nAvon and Somerset Police have put in place enhanced stop and search powers and a Section 35 dispersal zone from midday on Saturday to 6 p.m. on Sunday in Bristol city centre.\n\nMerseyside's Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said the force is \"fully prepared to deal with anyone intent on causing disorder.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the force introduced enhanced stop-and-search powers for parts of Liverpool.\n\nPolice Scotland said there has been no intelligence indicating violent protests are likely in Scotland, but it's \"closely monitoring\" the situation.\n\nA line of police moved in to separate groups of demonstrators who met at the Pier Head in Liverpool.\n\nA crowd, some with union flags, who had gathered outside the Mersey Ferry terminal shouting \"stop the boats\" were greeted by so-called anti-fascist protesters who marched from a rally at St George's Hall.\n\nChants of \"Tommy Robinson\" were greeted by shouts of \"Nazi scum, off our streets.\"\n\nSome cans were thrown from one group towards the other.\n\nIn Leeds, one of the protest groups left their pen en masse just before 1:30 p.m. and marched through the city centre.\n\nAround 200 people walked past bemused Saturday shoppers chanting \"stop the boats\" and other slogans as they made their way through the Trinity Leeds shopping centre and up Briggate.\n\nA line of police officers eventually arrived in vans near the Corn Exchange and walked in front of the protesters, some of whom were wearing masks.\n\nWhen the march arrived back at the much larger pro-Palestine counter demo, large numbers of police placed themselves in front of the marchers, prompting some minor pushing, shoving, and screaming at the officers from the marchers.\n\nThe noisy stand-off then continued outside the central library and art gallery, with around 50 police between the two groups.\n\nIn Nottingham, protesters with St George's and union flags have been met with counter-protesters chanting \"racist scum off our streets\" and \"Nazis not welcome.\"\n\nScuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other on King Street at about 3 p.m., with bottles and other items thrown from both sides.\n\nChants of \"England until I die\" and \"Tommy Robinson\" were drowned out by boos from the counter-protesters.\n\nLabour mayor McGuinness praised the people of Sunderland for cleaning up the wreckage of the riot together, which she said showed \"the true spirit of what we are as the North East and as Sunderland.\"\n\nTory leadership contender and former home secretary Priti Patel demanded Parliament be recalled and criticised the government response, warning: \"Saying the nation is 'braced for disorder' is not only breathtakingly complacent, but both troubling and inadequate.\"\n\nAnother Tory leadership candidate, shadow housing secretary Kemi Badenoch, said the UK needs to end a \"culture of silence\" and have \"a clearer strategy on integration.\"\n\nThe recent events coincided with the detention and release of anti-Islamist activist Tommy Robinson last week hours after he played his film \"Silenced,\" which was banned for containing claims that the High Court previously ruled to be libellous, to a crowd of thousands during a largely peaceful, and amid a separate contempt of court case centred around the film.",

They are thugs, criminals and extremists who betray the values our country is built on.\"\n\nShe said police forces have been backed by government to take the \"strongest possible action against every level of perpetrator\", while the number of prosecuting lawyers on call have been increased.\n\n\"There must and will be consequences for the damage these thugs have done, and they will be paying the price for years to come\", she added.\n\nOn Sunday, the Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson promised \"severe consequences\" and said CPS prosecutors are working \"around the clock\" to bring cases to court.\n\nThe disorder echoes the 2011 riots, which spread from a protest about the shooting of Mark Duggan by police in Tottenham to disorder across London, and then to cities across England over the course of four August days.\n\nLooter Gordon Thompson received one of the toughest sentences in the aftermath of the riots, as he was locked up for 11-and-a-half years for setting fire to the family-run furniture store House of Reeves in Croydon.\n\nThompson had confessed \"it was me\" as he walked away from the blaze, and he was convicted of an arson attack which caused \u00a33million in damage.\n\nThe sentencing judge at the Old Bailey condemned Thompson for a \"deliberate, willful act of shocking, dangerous vandalism\" - words that could be echoed in courts in 2024 after last week's disorder.\n\nThe 2011 riots also saw tough sentences for people who only played a minor role in the breakdown in law and order.\n\nStudent Nicolas Robinson was jailed for six months for stealing a \u00a33.50 bottle of water from a looted Lidl supermarket while he was walking home from his girlfriend's house.\n\nIn total, 2,158 people were convicted of involving in the 2011 riots, leading to prison sentences totalling more than 1,800 years.\n\nThe 2011 riots proved difficult for police forces to contain as they were fuelled in part by fast-changing information being shared on social media.\n\nPolice forces investigating last weeks' disorder are said to be actively investigating people encouraging violence and criminality online.\n\nIn 2011, in a sign of the tough sentences available to courts, two men who used Facebook to incite disorder were both jailed for four years.\n\nJordan Blackshaw and Perry Sutcliffe-Keenan admitted their involvement, even though the actions they had called for did not actually take place.\n\nThe men lost appeals against the sentences, when then Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge said: \"The imposition of severe sentences, intended to provide both punishment and deterrence, must follow.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is a sinister feature of these cases that modern technology almost certainly assisted rioters in other places.\n\n\"What both these appellants intended was to cause very serious crime. All this was incited at a time of sustained countrywide mayhem.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast on Monday, Ms Cooper said: \"Social media companies need to take some responsibility, we also need to make sure that criminal activity online is being pursued.\"\n\nThe CPS is likely to be looking at possible offences under the Public Order Act 1986, including incitement to commit an offence including rioting.\n\nCriminal charges have already been brought against some of those accused of involvement in the disorder.\n\nMerseyside Police said Gareth Metcalfe, 44, and John O'Malley, 43, both of Cambridge Gardens in Southport, are accused of violent disorder last Tuesday, while a 14-year-old boy from Toxteth is accused of violent disorder in Liverpool city centre on Saturday when police officers had fireworks set off in their direction.\n\nAdam Wharton, 28, and Ellis Wharton, 22, of Selwyn Street, Walton, have both been charged with burglary at the Spellow Hub library. Wharton is also accused of assault on an emergency worker.\n\nThe offence of violent disorder carried a maximum penalty of five years in prison, with the toughest penalties reserved for those who are armed, use petrol bombs, lead the violence, and and target people in a mob attack. If someone is charged with rioting, the maximum penalty is ten years in prison.\n\nLooters will face a burglary charge with a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison, and judges in 2011 imposed lengthy prison terms to send a deterrent message.\n\nProsecutors will also be considering arson charges for those responsible for the fires last week. Arson carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This is not the Hull we know and love.\n\n'These actions do not reflect the beliefs of those who genuinely care about their country, city, or communities; rather, they stem from a small group of criminals' intent on bringing division, conflict, and fear to our city.'\n\nHe added: 'Hull is a vibrant and diverse city, home to caring and considerate individuals who will stand united to demonstrate that today's events do not define us. Together, we will work to repair the damage caused by this unrepresentative minority.'\n\nPolice in the area have so far made twenty arrests. Three officers also have sustained injuries after being attacked with bricks and fireworks during the clashes.\n\nOn Saturday, rioters set off fireworks and missiles near Belfast city hall, before they targeted several businesses in the area.\n\nA supermarket and a cafe in the Donegall Road area were badly damaged during the unrest, and a number of cars were burnt out.\n\nBusiness owners, such as Bashir (pictured below), are currently in the process of cleaning up the mess.\n\nOf the incident, he said: 'People attacked this place, racism against Islam and Muslims, especially the Muslim community.\n\n'All of that happened and the police did nothing, I am telling you the truth. What kind of police are letting the people burn everything down?'\n\nIn Liverpool, counter-protesters faced off with around 1,000 anti-immigration protesters yesterday near St George's Hall - the latter shouting racial slurs and Islamophobic chants.\n\nSeveral police officers were injured during scuffles between them and the rioters.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims confirmed that one officer suffered a broken nose, while another's jaw was broken.\n\nThe Spellow Hub library was also targeted by rioters and was set alight at around 11.30pm. As well as serving the community as a library, the building also functions as a food bank.\n\nLiverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said of the attack: 'Devastated to see this wonderful community asset ravaged by thugs.'\n\nPolice across the UK have warned that further disorder is likely today.\n\nMORE : Politicians unite in condemnation of far-right violence as rioting continues\n\nMORE :

Get the phones!' as a group surrounded and battered their way into a phone repair and vape shop in the city centre.\n\nKicking the shutters with the feet and wrenching them up in a wild frenzy, the mob battered at the glass with what appeared to be a bollard before leaving the road outside strewn with packaging after they emptied the shelves.\n\nMeanwhile, in Hull a Shoezone was pictured with smashed windows and a raging fire inside, while a Greggs and a Specsavers had also been targeted by men with face coverings throwing stones.\n\nIn Hull, a Shoezone was pictured with smashed windows and a raging fire inside, while a Greggs and a Specsavers had also been targeted by men with face coverings throwing stones\n\nShoes were strewn in the street outside the store as the fire rages, with the shop gutted\n\nAn O2 store was also looted in the city, after a yob in an England shirt smashed the windows with a metal stool, before leaving with handfuls of gear.\n\nAs he left, a young boy could be seen smashing one of the displays in a senseless act of destruction while one man yelled 'this is England'.\n\nAnd in Manchester a Sainsbury's Local was forced to shut after it was 'stormed' by rioters, with eyewitnesses saying they saw the mob 'grabbing items and throwing them' from the city centre store.\n\nIn south Belfast a caf\u00e9 and a supermarket were left badly damaged after being set on fire during an anti-immigration protest.\n\nA number of burnt out cars were seen on the road as officers tried to deal with the disorder in the Donegall Road area.\n\nSupermarket manager Bashir's business was extensively damaged by fire, telling reports the Islamic community in the city was being targetted.\n\nHe said: 'People attacked this place, racism against Islam and Muslims, especially the Muslim community.'\n\nLEEDS: A masked protester raises his arms outside Leeds Town Hall.

One officer was knocked off his motorbike while other demonstrators kicked riot shields.\n\nSpellow Lane Library Hub was opened last year to provide routes into education and work for those living in the community.\n\nA ribbon was cut by the city's Lord Mayor last year alongside a group of beaming primary school children as the library opened after the community and local Government \u00a3900,000 for its rebuilding.\n\nVideos from last nights mayhem, however, showed flames pouring out of the building, rising into the sky. Police said rioters tried to prevent firefighters from accessing the fire, throwing a missile at the fire engine and breaking the rear window of the cab.\n\n'I cannot believe what I am seeing,' one wrote. 'Spellow library played a huge part in my upbringing. Then again when I needed help as an adult.

This is pure thug behaviour.'\n\nA third said: 'Spellow Library on County Road in Liverpool has been set on fire by idiotic rioters. It had only just been reopened after a big refurbishment. This is not a wealthy community. Why destroy some of the few good things in it?'\n\n'The Spellow is a library which reopened last year and provides support for people of all abilities to gain education and a path to employment. It [is] truly awful. I fought for years for this hub and now [it's] destroyed.'\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss called the behaviour of protesters 'deplorable', adding: 'The impact of the disorder will be devastating for the people of Walton, but I promise that we are doing everything in our power to arrest those involved and bring them to justice.'\n\nMerseyside Police also said a 58-year-old man has been charged with two offences following the violent disorder in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nDerek Drummond of Pool Street, Southport, has been charged with violent disorder and assault on an emergency worker. He will appear at Wirral Magistrates Court on Monday, August 5, police said.\n\nIn Hull, Humberside Police said there were 20 people arrested, three police officers injured and shops looted and burned after a mob attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers.\n\nA car is set alight in Belfast following a night of rioting\n\nA person throws a chair in Bristol amid violence on the southern city's streets\n\nA protester appears to make a Nazi salute as Belfast Anti-Racism and Anti immigration protesters have a tense stand off\n\nNOTTINGHAM: Police officers detain a woman during a demonstration as she screams her protest\n\nPolice officers detain a woman during a protest in Nottingham Market Square yesterday\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Mike Walker said: 'The right to lawful protest is a part of democracy, which my officers upheld, however, we will not accept the senseless vandalism, antisocial behaviour and sheer violence that has been brought to our streets.'\n\nBusinesses were targeted in Belfast where police mounted a significant security operation during a lengthy confrontation between anti-Islamic protesters and those taking part in an anti-racist rally at Belfast City Hall during which fireworks and other missiles were thrown.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said they were treating reports of criminal damage as hate crimes and had made two arrests.\n\nA number of social messages during the week had been shared asking for people to gather and block roads in the greater Belfast area and elsewhere in the wake of the murders of three young children in Southport.\n\nStormont leaders including First Minister Michelle O'Neill, deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly and Justice Minister Naomi Long have condemned the violence in Belfast.\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn praised the police for their response to the unrest.\n\nDUP MLA Edwin Poots said many of those involved were not from south Belfast.\n\nHe said: 'The violence witnessed in south Belfast is totally wrong and unacceptable. Many of those engaged in the violence are not local and many in the local community are expressing their unhappiness at the rioting.\n\n'People are angry and frustrated. Over the course of the last year councillor Tracy Kelly and I have raised many issues affecting communities in south Belfast, which Government bodies have largely ignored.\n\n'Acts of violence and destruction of the area which we are trying to get investment into is totally counterproductive.'\n\nMr Poots added: 'Working people are being driven out of the community because housing is unaffordable and unattainable. Essential services such as access to GPs and dentists are incredibly difficult to access.\n\n'It is essential that we meet the needs of people who have lived in an area for generations. This will only be achieved through engagement, and by government bodies listening and acting to meet those needs. Violence will solve nothing.'\n\nIn Bristol, police made 14 arrests because of violent disorder in the city centre, which Avon and Somerset Police described as 'completely unacceptable'.\n\nLancashire Police said more than 20 people were arrested and dispersal orders were issued in parts of Blackpool, Preston and Blackburn.\n\nAnd Staffordshire Police said 10 people were also arrested following disorder in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nFurther protests are planned for Sunday and more trouble is likely in the coming days, police said.\n\n'We know people will try and do this again and policing has been and will continue to be ready,' said Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who speaks on public order for the National Police Chiefs' Council.\n\n'There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy.\n\n'So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you.'", "source": {"uri":

Get the phones!\" as they ransacked a phone repair and vape shop in the city centre.\n\nSmashed glass and empty phone packaging could be seen on the streets after rioters kicked in the shutters, breaking their way into the local business.\n\nIn another incident in Liverpool, thugs torched a recently renovated library on Saturday night.\n\nThe Spellow Lane Library Hub, which was opened last year to provide support for one of the most deprived communities in the country, suffered severe damage.\n\nLiverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram condemned the mob who tried to prevent firefighters from accessing the blaze.\n\n\"Devastated to see this wonderful community asset ravaged by thugs,\" Mr Rotheram said in a post on X.\n\nA Shoezone in Hull was left completely destroyed after rioters shattered the glass storefront, looted the store and set it on fire.\n\nFootage showed a raging blaze coming from inside the shop with shoes scattered on the path outside, while a Greggs and a Specsavers had also been targeted by masked men throwing stones and bricks.\n\nThe Humberside Police Chief said officers \"faced eggs and bottles being thrown\" as windows were smashed at a nearby hotel which has housed migrants.\n\nA heartbroken supermarket manager in Belfast said his store was reduced to ashes as rioters deliberately targeted immigrant-owned businesses.\n\n\"People attacked this place, racism against Islam and Muslims, especially the Muslim community,\" Bashir said.\n\nHe added: \"All of that happened and the police did nothing, I am telling you the truth.\n\n\"What kind of police are letting the people burn everything down?\"\n\nAcross the road from the supermarket, a cafe seemed to have been completely destroyed by fire. The sign on the Bash Cafe offers Arabic coffee and falafels.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said it had attended a shop and a cafe on fire on the Donegall Road on Saturday night. It said the cause of both fires had been determined as deliberate.\n\nMasked men in Manchester chanted \"England\" and \"Oh Tommy, Tommy!\", supposedly in reference to Tommy Robinson, founder of the far-right English Defence league, as they ransacked a Sainsbury's local in Picadilly Gardens with handfuls of expensive wines.\n\nIn video of the incident, one man can be heard further encouraging the looters, shouting: \"Go get the beers!\"\n\nThe men were chased by riot police before being detained.\n\nRioters in Sunderland set an overturned car on fire, set alight a disused police building and torched a Citizens Advice office, while others targeted a mosque and chanted Islamphobic insults.\n\nThe far-right has drawn widespread condemnation as the organising force behind scenes of disorder in the wake of the killings of three young girls in Southport.\n\nFalse claims had spread online that the suspect, later identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana from Lancashire, was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nMore than 35 'Enough is Enough' demonstrations are planned across the UK this weekend, with several counter-protests by groups such as Unite Against Fascism and

MPs across the political spectrum after disorder in towns and cities including London, Manchester, Southport and Hartlepool over the past three days.\n\nThe string of violent incidents began on Tuesday in Southport, where demonstrators attacked police and set cars on fire the day after three girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nFriday saw a night of \"unforgivable\" violence in Sunderland, with a Citizens Advice office burned down.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use for missiles during widespread violence in the city, adding that

Get the phones!\" as they ransacked a phone repair and vape shop in the city centre.\n\nSmashed glass and empty phone packaging could be seen on the streets after rioters kicked in the shutters, breaking their way into the local business.\n\nIn another incident in Liverpool, thugs torched a recently renovated library on Saturday night.\n\nThe Spellow Lane Library Hub, which was opened last year to provide support for one of the most deprived communities in the country, suffered severe damage.\n\nLiverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram condemned the mob who tried to prevent firefighters from accessing the blaze.\n\n\"Devastated to see this wonderful community asset ravaged by thugs,\" Mr Rotheram said in a post on X.\n\nA Shoezone in Hull was left completely destroyed after rioters shattered the glass storefront, looted the store and set it on fire.\n\nFootage showed a raging blaze coming from inside the shop with shoes scattered on the path outside, while a Greggs and a Specsavers had also been targeted by masked men throwing stones and bricks.\n\nThe Humberside Police Chief said officers \"faced eggs and bottles being thrown\" as windows were smashed at a nearby hotel which has housed migrants.\n\nA heartbroken supermarket manager in Belfast said his store was reduced to ashes as rioters deliberately targeted immigrant-owned businesses.\n\n\"People attacked this place, racism against Islam and Muslims, especially the Muslim community,\" Bashir said.\n\nHe added: \"All of that happened and the police did nothing, I am telling you the truth.\n\n\"What kind of police are letting the people burn everything down?\"\n\nAcross the road from the supermarket, a cafe seemed to have been completely destroyed by fire.

There were gruesome scenes in central Liverpool as fights broke out on the Strand and \"serious disorder\" ensued nearby the city's waterfront, reports the police, reports the Mirror.\n\nSeveral officers reported injuries during the skirmishes which also spilled into popular shopping hotspots such as Church Street. One set of rioters was noted gathering around and intimidating a young officer who had fallen to the ground.\n\nRead more: Police 'concerned' for missing Shropshire girls not seen in days as urgent 999 appeal issued\n\nAs disorder ran rife across the city, 300 individuals in Liverpool's Walton area caused havoc on County Road, torching community centres. The Spellow Lane Library Hub, a lifeline opened last year for one of the nation's poorest communities, saw extensive damage to its ground floor. Police report tells us that officers were met with resistance as they tried to tackle the flames, including having objects hurled at their vehicles resulting in broken windows.\n\nViolence escalated as an officer got kicked off his motorcycle by an agitator, and attempts were made to kick riot shields. Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss condemned the protesters' actions as 'deplorable', stating: \"The impact of the disorder will be devastating for the people of Walton, but I promise that we are doing everything in our power to arrest those involved and bring them to justice.\"\n\nIn response to the nationwide outbursts, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper warned those participating in such clashes that they \"will pay the price\" and affirmed her stance that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".

Every Prime Minister has to have that family time and that break but from what I know of Keir - and I've met him many times, and sitting here in Blackpool several times - he will be continuing to work and monitor the situation wherever he is on holiday.'\n\nCities such as Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester and Belfast have seen vehicles burned, shops destroyed, pedestrians attacked and police officers injured this week following the Southport stabbings on Monday.\n\nArrests have been made across the country, with police warning of more to come once CCTV, social media and body-worn camera footage has been scoured.\n\nThere was violence on Saturday in towns and cities such as Hull, Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Blackpool and Belfast, which saw several police officers injured. It followed a riot in Sunderland on Friday evening.\n\nA community library on the Merseyside that only opened last year after months of fundraising was set on fire last night as more than 300 people

Protesters tore down fences to hurl at other demonstrators as police put themselves between rival groups.\n\nFootage shows men clutching cups of alcohol shouting and jeering as others jumped into a jumbled fight, each side grappling one another and ripping clothing.\n\nIn Nottingham, protesters waved England flags and made gestures at police while in Liverpool, activists hurled bricks and a scooter at police officers as the protests threatened to spill over into all-out violence.\n\nAnd in Hull, tear gas was deployed against demonstrators who smashed the windows of a hotel housing asylum seekers. Three officers were injured and four arrests were made, Humberside Police said.\n\nMore than 35 'Enough is Enough' demonstrations are planned across the UK this weekend, with several counter-protests by groups such as Unite Against Fascism and Stand Up to Racism also set to take place.\n\nToday, 24 rallies are taking place - 22 of which are Enough is Enough protests, one an anti-racist protest and one is said to be a peaceful vigil.\n\nIt comes as ministers are expected to hold a group call today to discuss public order.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged his 'full support' for the police to take action against 'extremists' attempting to 'sow hate' by intimidating communities as he held emergency talks with ministers over the unrest in parts of England.\n\nMultiple police officers have reportedly been injured while tackling the disorder.\n\nThe riots are thought to be triggered by misinformation spread online as to the identity of the teenager suspected of killing Bebe King,six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, was eventually named as the suspect in a bid to stop the chaos.\n\nSouthport locals - including Elsie's mother - have desperately pleaded for the violence to stop to no avail.\n\nShadow home secretary James Cleverly said PM Sir Keir Starmer and the Home Secretary need to 'do more' to restore public order and 'send a clear message to the thugs'.\n\nThere is a big turnout in Nottingham today, where counter-protesters seem to outnumber the Enough is Enough members.\n\nOver 400 counter-protesters also massed in Cardiff, including Black Lives Matter and Stand Up to Racism, in contrast to a small number of demonstrators.", "source": {"uri":

One attendee waved a sign reading: 'Save our kids'.\n\nGreater Manchester Police later issued a Section 34 dispersal order for the city centre after anti-immigration protesters and counter-demonstrators had to be separated.\n\nThe notice, issued under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 at 11am, gives police the right to order people to leave a specified area if they are committing or are suspected to be committing, anti-social behaviour.\n\nMounted police and lines of officers were pictured containing demonstrators - many of whom wore masks, hats, sunglasses and hoodies.\n\nHundreds of protesters on both sides of railings set up to separate them could be seen in Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens before each went on separate marches.\n\nThere is a heavy police presence in place, with officers swiftly intervening and detaining one man after a verbal spat, with chants of 'Nazi scum off our streets' heard from the crowd.\n\nPhotos show people holding signs reading 'no to racism, no to fascism' signs in the counter-protest in Manchester, where an estimated 500 people have turned up.\n\nThere are chants of 'Tommy Robinson' heard from the protesting group - estimated to have around 150 activists - and 'whose streets? our streets' from the counter side, of around 350 people.\n\nMetal fences were seen lying on the floor after protesters ripped them down as riot police and mounted officers rushed in to the crowd, where punches were being thrown.\n\nChants of 'save our kids' and 'we want Starmer out' were also heard from those gathered as the fighting broke out.\n\nSeparately, police in Belfast this afternoon deployed Land Rovers to keep an 'anti-Islam' protest separated from an anti-racism counter protest. This does not seem to be affiliated with Enough is Enough.\n\nEyewitnesses say protesters chanted 'Islam out' in front of Belfast City Hall as they unfurled Union flags.\n\nThe rally was staged in response to calls on social media for 'anti-Islamic' protests.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) previously said it was aware of social media posts calling for protests including 'specific calls to block roads using women and children'.\n\nPSNI officers in riot gear were deployed with 4x4s to keep protesters separated - as fireworks were thrown in the direction of the police.\n\nThe force said on X it was aware of 'several planned protests across Northern Ireland today and will be in attendance to ensure the safety of everyone involved.'\n\nAt 10am, a small crowd began to gather at Portsmouth's Guildhall in Hampshire.\n\nImages shared on social media showed many of those attending came with England and Union flags, while at least one attendee came with a sign bearing online conspiracy theories.\n\nOthers came with a flag bearing the inscription: 'Stop mass immigration'.\n\nHampshire Constabulary said no incidents have been reported from the demonstration in Portsmouth this morning.\n\nA small but concentrated gathering of people assembled on the steps of the Guildhall in the city centre and were met with a handful of counter-protesters.\n\nIt came after a demonstration outside Potters International Hotel in nearby Aldershot on Wednesday led to disruption as a 'minority' of protesters began shouting racist abuse.\n\nAt 12pm, protesters also began to congregate at Victoria Square in Hull.\n\nJust before 3pm, violence broke out after a protester threw a rock at a line of police officers.\n\nThe protesters seem to be trying to get to asylum seekers in a hotel and pelted officers with abuse.\n\nThe riot police began deploying tear gas in the demonstrator's faces.\n\nA spokesperson for Humberside Police said: 'Officers are currently in attendance at a protest that began in Hull City Centre this afternoon, Saturday 3 August.\n\n'A road closure has been put in place on Ferensway and we advise members of the public to avoid the area at this time.'\n\nVideo posted online also shows crowds of people outside of the Royal Hotel, next to Hull train station, with chants of 'get them out' heard. The hotel is one of three used to house asylum seekers in the area.\n\nSocial media was buzzing with locals warning each other to remain vigilant around Hanley in Stoke-on-Trent today.\n\nOne man posted a video warning people to avoid Hanley Town Hall and to 'protect your places of worship' but 'don't engage them in the streets'.\n\nA Facebook user posted: 'Not quite sure what's happening up Hanley and Stoke today regarding the protests but please bear in mind people there are families of many different backgrounds and children out and about today on the school holidays shopping and enjoying the sun.\n\n'We have enough trouble going on on this world, let's not add to it. Stay safe and peaceful.'\n\nLocal bus routes were diverted and will not serve some stops because of the rally in the centre.\n\nLarge crowds were seen gathering in Hanley shortly after 12pm as they marched through the town centre streets.\n\nStoke-on-Trent's MPs came together to condemn the protests in Hanley today, describing the participants as 'far-right extremists'.\n\nMP Gareth Snell posted on Facebook saying 'racism is not patriotism'.\n\nHe said: 'What is happening in Stoke-on-Trent today is not a reflection of the city I know and love.\n\n'Violence is not protest. Racism is not patriotism. Political extremism is not welcome.'\n\nDr Alison Gardner, Stoke-on-Trent South, and David Williams, Stoke-on-Trent North and Kidsgrove, released a joint statement: 'Today, political extremists will be in our city. They are here not because they are concerned about out city or the people who live here. They are here for one thing. To spread division and sow the seeds of hate.\n\n'To create chaos among neighbours and attack our calues of peace, tolerance and respect.\n\n'They do this to further their own cause - with no concern for the damage and destruction they leave behind.\n\n'We urge our neighbours in Stoke-on-Trent not to be taken in by these far-right extremists.\n\n'Violence solves nothing. Our city has seen this before. We have previously stood tall against political extremists and when tomorrow comes and these people have left, it will again be the decent, fair and upstanding residents of Stoke-on-Trent who will be left to clear up the mess.\n\n'Out message to the far-right extremists is simple. You are not welcome in Stoke-on-Trent.'\n\nProtesters could be seen facing up to police officers draped in England football flags and Union flags, and covering their faces.\n\nThere are around one hundreds police officers on duty, with several riot vans and dog units deployed to the centre.\n\nChants of 'we hate Nazis' by the anti-protest group were heard outside Hanley Town Hall.\n\nShops in the town centre, particularly along Stafford Street, were advised to close.\n\nIn Leeds, a pro-Palestine counter protest amassed ahead of a planned march organised by English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson.\n\nChants of 'England 'til I die' were heard and the pro-Palestine march replied with 'Nazi scum off our streets'.\n\nAround 150 demonstrators wore St George's Crosses and pro Reform UK placards wearing 'free Tommy Robinson' t-shirts.\n\nLeeds Art Gallery has locked its doors 'for safety purposes' as the clashes occurred right outside its doors.\n\nTensions also erupted in Liverpool this afternoon, as police confirmed a Section 60 Order has been introduced in the city centre and surrounding areas today.\n\nThe Section 60 Order - giving stop and search powers - was put in place at midday and will stay active for a 12-hour period until midnight.\n\nPolice have also put a Section 34 Dispersal Order in place. Under this legislation, officers have the power to seize any item used in the commission of anti-social behaviour.\n\nOfficers closed the main road - the Strand - at 3.30pm in an effort to calm the simmering tensions.\n\nPolice separated groups of demonstrators outside the Cunard Building on The Strand in Liverpool.\n\nAnti-fascist protesters sang: 'Where's your Tommy gone?' At one point a group of men with masks and hoods up appeared to try and charge police officers who stood with batons.\n\nOfficers with riot shields and helmets moved the crowd back and cans, bottles and coins were thrown. Police with dogs also moved in to separate the groups.\n\nTwo groups of protesters met at the Pier Head in Liverpool, in front of the Liver Buildings.\n\nChants of 'save our kids' and 'stop the boats' were heard from crowds gathered closer to the waterfront.\n\nRiot vans arrived on Water Street, as police continue to separate opposing protests at the waterfront.\n\nOn one side, crowds are shouting 'where's your Tommy gone?' while the other side is chanting 'get them out' and 'stop the boats', according to the Liverpool Echo.\n\nIn Nottingham, protesters with St George's and union flags in the Market Square have been met with counter-protesters chanting 'racist scum off our streets' and 'Nazis not welcome'.\n\nScuffles broke out at about 3pm, with bottles and other items thrown from both sides.\n\nBut chants of 'England until I die' and 'Tommy Robinson' were drowned out by boos.\n\nSunderland Central Labour MP Lewis Atkinson said a link could be drawn between the disorder in his constituency on Friday and the ashes of the English Defence League (EDL), which was founded by Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon.\n\nThe EDL has disbanded but its supporters remain active, and Mr Atkinson said evidence suggested a Nazi offshoot of the group was involved in the violence in his constituency on Friday, in which a police station was torched and a mosque attacked.\n\nNorthumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall said four officers were injured during the violence in the city and 10 people have been arrested.\n\nHe told reporters that those involved in the disorder should 'expect to be met with the full force of the law', adding: 'This was not a protest, this was unforgivable violence and disorder.'\n\nChairman of Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, Qari Asim, said the Muslim community is 'deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far right groups across the country'.\n\nHe said: 'This intimidation and violence is the inevitable, devastating, outcome of rising Islamophobia that has been enabled to fester on social media, in parts of the mainstream media and by some populist leaders.'\n\nMeanwhile, Tory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick said 'elements of the far right' appear to be involved in the rioting while fellow contender Priti Patel denounced the 'thuggery' and said MPs should unite in condemnation.\n\nMr Atkinson said he was 'really sad' for Sunderland after a group of 'racists' descended on the city on Friday and attacked police, setting a police station and two cars on fire and targeting a mosque.\n\nHe added: 'A night of idiots will not prevent us from building.'\n\nAsked how the disorder had happened, Mr Atkinson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that protests had been suggested by people in a number of social media groups in the wake of the Southport stabbings.\n\nHe said: 'The far right, for example Stephen Yaxley Lennon, picked up on those and started promoting those and encouraging known far right individuals to join.'\n\nIndividuals who were involved with the EDL are 'still out there' and need to be kept under surveillance, he said.\n\nMr Jenrick said 'if there is a case' for proscribing the EDL it should be 'considered', when asked by the BBC.\n\nLeadership contender and former home secretary Ms Patel demanded Parliament be recalled over the violence and criticised the Government response, saying: 'Saying the nation is 'braced for disorder' is not only breathtakingly complacent, but both troubling and inadequate.\n\n'The Government is now in danger of appearing to be swept away with events rather than maintaining control of them.'\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer later condemned 'thugs' who had travelled to the town to cause unrest.\n\nThe unrest poses the biggest challenge yet of Sir Keir's premiership, evoking the scale of public disorder last seen during the 2011 riots.\n\nThere were a series of riots in August 2011 in cities and towns across England, which started in Tottenham Hale, north east London, after the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police on August 4.\n\nEducation Secretary and minister for women and equalities, and MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, Bridget Phillipson, posted on X, saying: 'The scenes in our city centre tonight are shocking. We have seen unforgivable violence and thuggery.\n\n'The criminals involved in this appalling disorder must be identified, prosecuted and punished with the full force of the law.'\n\nRudakubana is also charged with the attempted murders of yoga class instructor Leanne Lucas, businessman John Hayes and eight children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and with possession of a kitchen knife with a curved blade.\n\nHe was remanded to youth detention accommodation and will next appear in court in October.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast

On July 29th three children were murdered in a dance class in Southport. False rumours that their killer had been Muslim and an illegal immigrant who had arrived in a small boat quickly spread across the internet, leading to a riot in the northern town on the following day, as well as violence in London, Hartlepool and elsewhere. Sir Keir Starmer, Britain's prime minister, decried the unrest as the work of a \"tiny, mindless minority\" of \"thugs\" on the \"far right\". Further demonstrations across English cities on August 3rd reinforced that verdict but also revealed a wider, inchoate sense of grievance.\n\nThe protests at Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester were one of a number organised via channels on X, a social-media site, and WhatsApp and Telegram, two messaging apps. Perhaps because it took place in the morning, the Manchester demonstration was relatively calm. The 150 or so anti-immigration demonstrators who had come to \"stand up for their country\" were outnumbered by approximately 350 counter- protesters. Although the two hurled abuse at one another and occasionally tried to break through the lines of police officers separating them, there was little violence.\n\nMany of the protesters took offence at the claim that they were members of the far right, and to chants of \"Nazi scum\" from the counter-protesters. We're just \"ordinary people\", said John Taylor, an ex-marine who was attending a demonstration for the first time. He said he did not object to immigration itself but rather to the violent crime and cost to the taxpayer it brings when newcomers are not \"vetted\" properly. (Never mind that the person charged with the murders in Southport was born in Britain to Rwandan parents.) Yet chants of \"Muhammad is a paedo\" and \"Oh, Tommy Robinson\", in support of a far-right firebrand who has repeatedly spread the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy theory claiming that Muslims are being brought into Western countries to outbreed and \"replace\" whites, suggested that plenty in the crowd deserve the labels they have been given by Sir Keir.\n\nOthers in Manchester complained of \"two-tier policing\". One protester, still young enough to have peach fuzz on his lip, said that the authorities controlled white Britons who are demonstrating \"for what's right for our country\" more harshly than those who protest against white Britons. \"They oppress the wrong people,\" he complained. Some pointed to the police response to unrest among the Roma community in Leeds in July, as well as a recent violent clash between Muslim men and police officers at Manchester airport, as evidence of double standards. Plenty of the counter-protesters in Manchester told precisely the opposite story: of two-tiered policing that discriminates against ethnic minorities.\n\nUnderpinning all of these protesters' concerns was a feeling that successive governments had ignored them. \"Every time we talk, we're shut down instantly,\" complained Josie, a young woman with a St George's flag wrapped around her hand.\n\nNot all of the day's protests were as calm. With the summer sun beating down, Liverpool erupted into what the Merseyside Police called \"serious disorder\". As protesters and counter-protesters shouted at each other down on the Strand, a road that runs along the Mersey river, some of the anti-immigration protesters charged the police lines separating the two groups. The police pushed them back, starting a repeated dance that lasted the afternoon.\n\nSome of the protesters, mostly young men and boys, would throw bottles, bricks and chairs. The police would run at them with riot shields and batons to repel them. And then both groups would pause for breath before starting again. At one point, a group of youths were tearing chunks off off St George's Dock pumping station, a 143-year-old red-brick building, raising them above their heads and dropping them to make debris to use as ammunition.\n\nThe violence in Liverpool was repeated elsewhere. In Sunderland the night before protesters threw beer cans and bricks at police officers outside a mosque. Several cars and a police station were set on fire. Violence also broke out on Saturday at protests in Blackburn, Blackpool, Bristol, Hull, Nottingham, Preston and Stoke-on-Trent. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, vowed that those involved would feel the \"full force of the law\". More than 90 people were arrested. Plans are being drawn up for courts to sit for extended hours to cope with the expected surge in cases.\n\nAmong the masked faces in Liverpool was the occasional symbol of the far right -- the distinct black and gold-trim Fred Perry shirts of the Proud Boys or the skull masks of the Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi group. For them, people with less militant views who feel ignored are potential recruits. Attendance at these protests exposes newcomers to more radical ideas; the violence and inevitable prosecutions to follow draw attention to their cause. On Saturday afternoon, the Independent Nationalist Network, a small neo-Nazi group, posted an image of a window to its Telegram channel labelled \"Overton window\", the academic term for the range of socially acceptable political views. All of the glass was smashed.\n\nWith more protests expected on August 4th, the question is how much to worry about these disturbances. It is certainly possible to overreact. In Liverpool, at least, the real troublemakers were mostly youngsters enjoying the excitement of anarchy. Among adults, the crossover between far-right ideologues and football hooligans is significant: some simply find violence enjoyable. Hot weather and sporadic outbreaks of rioting occasionally disfigure Britain; arrests and prosecutions may soon dampen protesters' enthusiasm, as they did during the London riots in 2011. But complacency is also a mistake. The protesters' anger about immigration is real. Disinformation can rapidly inflame tensions. And fury is the fuel of the far right. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "economist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Economist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's very clear that we want to send that message to people - if you engage in this type of criminal thuggery on our streets, you will be held to account.\"\n\nShe said that the prime minster was the director of public prosecutions during the 2011 riots when the courts did sit through the night and is therefore \"very well versed ... in making sure we have available what's needed\".\n\n\"We cannot have people feeling they are not safe on their streets, particularly communities who don't feel safe because of the colour of their skin,\" she added.\n\nDozens of people have been arrested after violent disorder in England and Northern Ireland on Saturday, with police warning more violence is likely in the coming days.\n\nPolice officers were attacked and injured, while there were also clashes between anti-immigration demonstrators and counter-protesters.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper has said those involved in the clashes \"will pay the price\", adding that \"criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets\".\n\nMeanwhile, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has told ministers \"the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible\".\n\nProtests this week erupted following the fatal stabbing of three young girls in Southport - which was followed by a wave of online misinformation about the suspect spread by far-right activists and agitators.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nMore than 90 arrested after violent protests across UK\n\nEyewitness: Inside 'running battle' in Bristol\n\nLord Walney, the government's adviser on political violence and disruption, told Sky News the Southport tragedy had been \"seized on by far-right actors almost certainly aided and abetted by hostile states in creating and planning disinformation to put out false narratives\".\n\nHe said the government should \"do more\" to go after accounts spreading false information and that he had recommended in his recent review to the government that intelligence and security sources should be given more resources.\n\n\"You'll have troll factories in places like Russia and Iran full of Russian or Iranian nationals pretending to be Brits with extreme views on the far right or the far left, whose sole purpose is to create disinformation and fan it,\" he said.\n\n\"That can have a very significant effect in this environment.\"",

Stay safe and peaceful.'\n\nLocal bus routes were diverted and will not serve some stops because of the rally in the centre.\n\nLarge crowds were seen gathering in Hanley shortly after 12pm as they marched through the town centre streets.\n\nStoke-on-Trent's MPs came together to condemn the protests in Hanley today, describing the participants as 'far-right extremists'.\n\nMP Gareth Snell posted on Facebook saying 'racism is not patriotism'.\n\nHe said: 'What is happening in Stoke-on-Trent today is not a reflection of the city I know and love.\n\n'Violence is not protest. Racism is not patriotism. Political extremism is not welcome.'\n\nDr Alison Gardner, Stoke-on-Trent South, and David Williams, Stoke-on-Trent North and Kidsgrove, released a joint statement: 'Today, political extremists will be in our city. They are here not because they are concerned about out city or the people who live here. They are here for one thing.

Our city has seen this before. We have previously stood tall against political extremists and when tomorrow comes and these people have left, it will again be the decent, fair and upstanding residents of Stoke-on-Trent who will be left to clear up the mess.\n\n'Out message to the far-right extremists is simple. You are not welcome in Stoke-on-Trent.'\n\nProtesters could be seen facing up to police officers draped in England football flags and Union flags, and covering their faces.\n\nThere are around one hundreds police officers on duty, with several riot vans and dog units deployed to the centre.\n\nChants of 'we hate Nazis' by the anti-protest group were heard outside Hanley Town Hall.\n\nShops in the town centre, particularly along Stafford Street, were advised to close.\n\nIn Leeds, a pro-Palestine counter protest amassed ahead of a planned march organised by English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson.\n\nTensions also erupted in Liverpool this afternoon, as police confirmed a Section 60 Order has been introduced in the city centre and surrounding areas today\n\nA demonstration outside in Liverpool, following violent protests across the country\n\nTwo groups of protesters met at the Pier Head in Liverpool, in front of the Liver Buildings\n\nPeople protest in Liverpool, following the stabbing attacks on Monday\n\nChants of 'England 'til I die' were heard and the pro-Palestine march replied with 'Nazi scum off our streets'.\n\nAround 150 demonstrators wore St George's Crosses and pro Reform UK placards wearing 'free Tommy Robinson' t-shirts.\n\nLeeds Art Gallery has locked its doors 'for safety purposes' as the clashes occurred right outside its doors.\n\nTensions also erupted in Liverpool this afternoon, as police confirmed a Section 60 Order has been introduced in the city centre and surrounding areas today.\n\nThe Section 60 Order was put in place at midday and will stay active for a 12-hour period until midnight, and extra officers will be in the area to provide a visible presence to reassure communities.\n\nIt has been introduced to prevent incidents of disorder and criminality.\n\nTwo groups of protesters met at the Pier Head in Liverpool, in front of the Liver Buildings.\n\nChants of 'save our kids' and 'stop the boats' were heard from crowds gathered closer to the waterfront.\n\nRiot vans arrived on Water Street, as police continue to separate opposing protests at the waterfront.\n\nOn one side, crowds are shouting 'where's your Tommy gone?' while the other side is chanting 'get them out' and 'stop the boats', according to the Liverpool Echo.\n\nPriti Patel called the riots 'totally unacceptable' as she urged for Parliament to be recalled\n\nSunderland Central Labour MP Lewis Atkinson said a link could be drawn between the disorder in his constituency on Friday and the ashes of the English Defence League (EDL), which was founded by Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon.\n\nThe EDL has disbanded but its supporters remain active, and Mr Atkinson said evidence suggested a Nazi offshoot of the group was involved in the violence in his constituency on Friday, in which a police station was torched and a mosque attacked.\n\nNorthumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall said four officers were injured during the violence in the city and 10 people have been arrested.\n\nHe told reporters that those involved in the disorder should 'expect to be met with the full force of the law', adding: 'This was not a protest, this was unforgivable violence and disorder.'\n\nChairman of Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, Qari Asim, said the Muslim community is 'deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far right groups across the country'.\n\nThis morning, hundreds of counter-protesters gathered in Manchester in preparation for the Enough is Enough rallies taking place today\n\nHundreds of protesters on both sides of railings set up to separate them can be seen in Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens at 9.30 this morning\n\nActivists take part in a protest at Piccadilly Gardens, holding an England flag\n\nHe said: 'This intimidation and violence is the inevitable, devastating, outcome of rising Islamophobia that has been enabled to fester on social media, in parts of the mainstream media and by some populist leaders.'\n\nMeanwhile, Tory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick said 'elements of the far right' appear to be involved in the rioting while fellow contender Priti Patel denounced the 'thuggery' and said MPs should unite in condemnation.\n\nMr Atkinson said he was 'really sad' for Sunderland after a group of 'racists' descended on the city on Friday and attacked police, setting a police station and two cars on fire and targeting a mosque.\n\nHe added: 'A night of idiots will not prevent us from building.'\n\nAsked how the disorder had happened, Mr Atkinson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that protests had been suggested by people in a number of social media groups in the wake of the Southport stabbings.\n\nHe said: 'The far

next door to the city's police station - which gave free advice to families struggling with poverty, in a cruel and unjustifiable attack.\n\nThe nearest available provider is now seven miles away in South Shields, Mirror reports, leaving the local community 'devastated'.\n\nNorthumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall said four officers were injured during the violence in the city and 10 people have been arrested.\n\nHe told reporters that those involved in the disorder should 'expect to be met with the full force of the law', adding: 'This was not a protest, this was unforgivable violence and disorder.'\n\nChairman of Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, Qari Asim, said the Muslim community is 'deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far right groups across the country'.\n\nHe said: 'This intimidation and violence is the inevitable, devastating, outcome of rising Islamophobia that has been enabled to fester on social media, in parts of the mainstream media and by some populist leaders.'\n\nMeanwhile, Tory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick said 'elements of the far right' appear to be involved in the rioting while fellow contender Priti Patel denounced the 'thuggery' and said MPs should unite in condemnation.\n\nMr Atkinson said he was 'really sad' for Sunderland after a group of 'racists' descended on the city on Friday and attacked police, setting a police station and two cars on fire and targeting a mosque.\n\nHe added: 'A night of idiots will not prevent us from building.'\n\nAsked how the disorder had happened, Mr Atkinson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that protests had been suggested by people in a number of social media groups in the wake of the Southport stabbings.\n\nHe said: 'The far right, for example Stephen Yaxley Lennon, picked up on those and started promoting those and encouraging known far right individuals to join.'\n\nIndividuals who were involved with the EDL are 'still out there' and need to be kept under surveillance, he said.\n\nMr Jenrick said 'if there is a case' for proscribing the EDL it should be 'considered', when asked by the BBC.\n\nLeadership contender and former home secretary Ms Patel demanded Parliament be recalled over the violence and criticised the Government response, saying: 'Saying the nation is 'braced for disorder' is not only breathtakingly complacent, but both troubling and inadequate.\n\nNOTTINGHAM: Police officers speak to a man as people protest this afternoon\n\nMANCHESTER: Police hold back anti-racism counter protesters at Piccadilly Gardens\n\nMANCHESTER: People in front of an anti-racism counter protest at Piccadilly Gardens\n\nLIVERPOOL: Heavy police presence as people protest, following the stabbing on Monday\n\n'The Government is now in danger of appearing to be swept away with events rather than maintaining control of them.'\n\nThousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer later condemned 'thugs' who had travelled to the town to cause unrest.\n\nThe unrest poses the biggest challenge yet of Sir Keir's premiership, evoking the scale of public disorder last seen during the 2011 riots.\n\nThere were a series of riots in August 2011 in cities and towns across England, which started in Tottenham Hale, north east London, after the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police on August 4.\n\nEducation Secretary and minister for women and equalities, and MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, Bridget Phillipson, posted on X, saying: 'The scenes in our city centre tonight are shocking. We have seen unforgivable violence and thuggery.\n\n'The criminals involved in this appalling disorder must be identified, prosecuted and punished with the full force of the law.'\n\nRudakubana is also charged with the attempted murders of yoga class instructor Leanne Lucas, businessman John Hayes and eight children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and with possession of a kitchen knife

One attendee waved a sign reading: 'Save our kids'.\n\nGreater Manchester Police later issued a Section 34 dispersal order for the city centre after anti-immigration protesters and counter-demonstrators had to be separated.\n\nThe notice, issued under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 at 11am, gives police the right to order people to leave a specified area if they are committing or are suspected to be committing, anti-social behaviour.\n\nManchester Police separating protesters from Enough is Enough and anti fascist groups\n\nPolice form a divide between people taking part in an anti-racism counter protest, (to the right) and activists protesting at Piccadilly Gardens\n\nPictures from Manchester show people with hoods up and masks covering their faces\n\nPolice form a line to separate opposing demonstrators in Manchester\n\nMounted police and lines of officers were pictured containing demonstrators - many of whom wore masks, hats, sunglasses and hoodies.\n\nHundreds of protesters on both sides of railings set up to separate them could be seen in Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens before each went on separate marches.\n\nThere is a heavy police presence in place, with officers swiftly intervening and detaining one man after a verbal spat, with chants of 'Nazi scum off our streets' heard from the crowd.\n\nPhotos show people holding signs reading 'no to racism, no to fascism' signs in the counter-protest in Manchester, where an estimated 500 people have turned up.\n\nThere are chants of 'Tommy Robinson' heard from the protesting group - estimated to have around 150 activists - and 'whose streets? our streets' from the counter side, of around 350 people.\n\nSeparately, police in Belfast this afternoon deployed Land Rovers to keep an 'anti-Islam' protest separated from an anti-racism counter protest. This does not seem to be affiliated with Enough is Enough.\n\nSeparately, police in Belfast this afternoon deployed Land Rovers to keep an 'anti-Islam' protest separated from an anti-racism counter protest\n\nThe rally was staged in response to calls on social media for 'anti-Islamic' protests\n\nEyewitnesses say protesters chanted 'Islam out' in front of Belfast City Hall as they unfurled Union flags.\n\nThe rally was staged in response to calls on social media for 'anti-Islamic' protests.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) previously said it was aware of social media posts calling for protests including 'specific calls to block roads using women and children'.\n\nPSNI officers in riot gear were deployed with 4x4s to keep protesters separated - as fireworks were thrown in the direction of the police.\n\nThe force said on X it was aware of 'several planned protests across Northern Ireland today and will be in attendance to ensure the safety of everyone involved.'\n\nAt 10am, a small crowd began to gather at Portsmouth's Guildhall in Hampshire.\n\nImages shared on social media showed many of those attending came with England and Union flags, while at least one attendee came with a sign bearing online conspiracy theories.\n\nThere is also a small scattering of protesters in front of Portsmouth's Guildhall, after the Enough is Enough rally kicked off at 10am\n\nThe protest in Portsmouth has seen crowds gather in front of the Guildhall\n\nOthers came with a flag bearing the inscription: 'Stop mass immigration'.\n\nHampshire Constabulary said no incidents have been reported from the demonstration in Portsmouth this morning.\n\nA small but concentrated gathering of people assembled on the steps of the Guildhall in the city centre and were met with a handful of counter-protesters.\n\nIt came after a demonstration outside Potters International Hotel in nearby Aldershot on Wednesday led to disruption as a 'minority' of protesters began shouting racist abuse.\n\nAt 12pm, protesters also began to congregate at Victoria Square in Hull.\n\nA spokesperson for Humberside Police said: 'Officers are currently in attendance at a protest that began in Hull City Centre this afternoon, Saturday 3 August.\n\n'A road closure has been put in place on Ferensway and we advise members of the public to avoid the area at this time.'\n\nProtesters gathered in Hull, adding to the series of demonstrations happening across the UK\n\nAt 12pm, protesters also began to congregate at Victoria Square in Hull\n\nVideo posted online also shows crowds of people outside of the Royal Hotel, next to Hull train station, with chants of 'get them out' heard. The hotel is one of three used to house asylum seekers in the area.\n\nSocial media was buzzing with locals warning each other to remain vigilant around Hanley in Stoke-on-Trent today.\n\nOne man posted a video warning people to avoid Hanley Town Hall and to 'protect your places of worship' but 'don't engage them in the streets'.\n\nA Facebook user posted: 'Not quite sure what's happening up Hanley and Stoke today regarding the protests but please bear in mind people there are families of many different backgrounds and children out and about today on the school holidays shopping and enjoying the sun.\n\n'We have enough trouble going on on this world, let's not add to it. Stay safe and peaceful.'\n\nLocal bus routes were diverted and will not serve some stops because of the rally in the centre.\n\nLarge crowds were seen gathering in Hanley shortly after 12pm as they marched through the town centre streets.\n\nPeople protest outside Leeds Town Hall today following the stabbing attacks\n\nIn Leeds, a pro-Palestine counter protest amassed ahead of a planned march organised by English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson\n\nChants of 'England 'til I die' were heard and the pro-Palestine march replied with 'Nazi scum off our streets' in Leeds\n\nAround 150 demonstrators wore St George's Crosses and pro Reform UK placards wearing 'free Tommy Robinson' t-shirts in Leeds\n\nProtesters could be seen facing up to police officers draped in England football flags and Union flags, and covering their faces.\n\nThere are around one hundreds police officers on duty, with several riot vans and dog units deployed to the centre.\n\nChants of 'we hate Nazis' by the anti-protest group were heard outside Hanley Town Hall.\n\nShops in the town centre, particularly along Stafford Street, were advised to close.\n\nIn Leeds, a pro-Palestine counter protest amassed ahead of a planned march organised by English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson.\n\nChants of 'England 'til I die' were heard and the pro-Palestine march replied with 'Nazi scum off our streets'.\n\nAround 150 demonstrators wore St George's Crosses and pro Reform UK placards wearing 'free Tommy Robinson' t-shirts.\n\nLeeds Art Gallery has locked its doors 'for safety purposes' as the clashes occured right outside its doors.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

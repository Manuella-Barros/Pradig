The Bad Habits singer, 33, said he gained weight after eating only chicken wings as he used to think that having no carbs in his diet meant 'no bread, no fries'. He soon learned what he needed to do to maintain a healthy weight after gaining four stone from his chicken diet. During a chat on the the Session 24 podcast, Ed explained: \"I was in my fat phase, in America I used to think no carb meant no bread, no fries. I was like 'I can eat chicken wings' and I just ate chicken wings for a year and a half. And I put on 4st.\" He lost weight a few years ago and maintained a healthy weight ever since. He said: \"I'm prone to putting on a lot of weight and what I found is just going to the gym regularly and trying to portion size. I don't have an off switch. If I have one thing to eat, the off switch is there. Like if I have that, then I won't be like I need to order another and another. If everything is in front of me then I will eat it.\" Back in 2021, he opened up about his weight gain during an interview with The Sun. Ed explained that at his heaviest he weighed 15.5st due to a diet of \"chicken wings, wine, beer\" every day, coupled with \"never\" exercising. He also revealed taking a break from touring was the \"worst thing\" for his health, as he would \"drink every single day\". But it all stopped when he became a parent alongside his wife Cherry Seaborn. He told the publication: \"Since becoming a dad I've become quite clean-living. But I think actually taking time off and not being on tour was the worst thing for my health because I would drink every single day. \"I stopped three months before Lyra was born because I was determined I was going to be the person to drive my wife to the -hospital. I was 15-and-a-half stone at my peak and I think I'm ten-and-a-half now - I was big, it really showed. I had a 36 waist - now I'm down to 28.\" If you're struggling with disordered eating and need someone to speak to, the BEAT helpline is available seven days a week from 3pm to 8pm.

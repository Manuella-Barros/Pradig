{"id": 225010884, "title": "Ukraine Appeals to Australian PM to Attend Peace Talks", "text": "\u201cI informed the prime minister about Russia\u2019s ongoing efforts to expand the war and our pressing defence needs to counter the aggressor,\u201d the president wrote on X. \u201cWe also discussed the upcoming peace summit and the need to encourage as many nations from around the globe as possible to attend it. I highly appreciate Australia\u2019s willingness to be present at the summit.\u201d Ambassadors from the EU and member states issued a separate call to Australia\u2019s foreign affairs department on May 28, a European official confirmed. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is yet to decide on attending the mid-June summit, his department\u2019s deputy secretary Graham Fletcher told a parliamentary hearing on May 29. \u201cThe invitation has been received and it\u2019s under consideration,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said. \u201cAn announcement will be made in due course.\u201d The Department of Foreign Affairs has been contacted for comment. The last time the prime minister spoke with the Ukrainian president was at the NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania in July 2023, assistant secretary Craig Chittick said. Ukrainian ambassador to Australia Vasyl Myroshnychenko urged Mr. Albanese or a high-level minister to attend the summit. \u201cAustralia has a voice of reason in the international community that goes back in history,\u201d he told AAP. \u201cThe Australian voice needs to be present in a definitive way at the summit for peace in Switzerland, which is best achieved by a cabinet minister who is a member of the National Security Committee.\u201d The invitation is aimed at high-level ministers, chiefly the prime minister, deputy prime minister and foreign minister. Members of the Group of Seven and Group of 20 forums, the EU and United Nations have been invited. The opposition strongly supports Mr. Albanese\u2019s attendance at the summit, coalition foreign spokesman Simon Birmingham said. \u201cI appreciate sometimes competing demands on the prime minister\u2019s time and scheduling of matters but this should be a senior cabinet representation at a meeting as significant as the Ukraine peace summit,\u201d he said. \u201cOther significant world leaders have already made their commitments and it seems remarkable that Australia is so slow to have made a decision on our position.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin would \u201cpersonally applaud\u201d a decision from US President Joe Biden not to attend the summit, Mr. Zelenskiy said. Mr. Myroshnychenko is travelling to Kiribati, Tonga and Fiji to try to rally support from the Pacific island nations. Australia in April pledged an extra $100 million (US$66.31 million) in support for Ukraine when Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Richard Marles visited the war-torn nation. It brought Australia\u2019s total contributions to more than $1 billion since Russia\u2019s invasion, including about $880 million of military assistance.", "summary": "'I informed the prime minister about Russia's ongoing efforts to expand the war and our pressing defence needs to counter the aggressor.'", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/ukraine-appeals-to-australian-pm-to-attend-peace-talks-5658808", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/07/04/20220704001676104195-original-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:07:44", "author": "AAP", "authors": ["AAP"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.366}

Two of its crew members jumped into the sea and rescued the woman, officials said. She was airlifted by a coast guard helicopter to land, they said.\n\nIn a video released by the Japanese coast guard, the woman -- dry and wrapped in a pale blue blanket -- stood on the deck of the tanker with a crew member who stood by her in case she lost her balance, while others quietly looked on. A coast guard helicopter hovered above. When she was attached to a rope and safely taken into the chopper, she waved at the tanker crew.\n\nCrew members of the tanker who helped in the rescue told TV Asahi that they shouted to the woman not to give up as she bobbed up and down in waves that were about 2 meters (6.5 feet) high. Two of them jumped into the water and tied a rope around the woman, while other crew pulled her up to the tanker, they said.\n\nOne crew member said everyone was relieved the woman survived, even though she seemed to be exhausted.\n\nSocial media was filled with messages praising the crew members who helped in the rescue as \"heroes,\" saying they did a \"good job,\" while others celebrated the woman's perseverance and survival in good health.\n\nThe woman was slightly dehydrated but was in good health and walked away after being examined at a nearby hospital, the officials said.\n\nThe coast guard said she had drifted more than 80 kilometers (50 miles) and was lucky to have survived despite the danger of heat stroke, hypothermia at night or being hit by a ship in the dark.\n\nHidetoshi Saito, a senior member of the Society of Water Rescue and Survival Research, said in a televised interview that the woman's survival was like \"a miracle.\"\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Tokyo on Thursday noted the safe rescue of the woman in cooperation with the Chinese Consulate and the Japanese authorities as well as the cargo and the tanker crew. In the message, the embassy urged Chinese residents in Japan to check weather and maritime conditions, use caution when going to the beach or engaging in marine activity and to choose locations staffed by lifeguards.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tanker (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coast guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swim ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cargo ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_ship_launching", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceremonial ship launching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimoda,_Shizuoka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shimoda, Shizuoka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shimoda, Shizuoka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Asahi", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TV Asahi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlift", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airlift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deck (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_petroleum_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquefied petroleum gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B\u014ds\u014d_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consulate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consulate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lifeguard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hypothermia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Living_Aboard", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Living Aboard", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/2024-chinese-woman-swept-sea-85268713.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723494", "eventUri": "eng-9723494", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

She has been working at PEOPLE since 2024. Her work has previously appeared on ET Canada, Metro and the Mail Online.\n\nA woman in her 20s has been rescued 37 hours after drifting out to sea in a rubber ring after going swimming at a beach in Japan.\n\nOn Monday, July 8, at around 7:30 p.m. local time, the woman -- who has only been identified as a Chinese national -- went into the Pacific Ocean with a friend at Shirahama Ohama beach in Shimoda, Shizuoka Prefecture, per the Japan Times.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the Coast Guard launched a search for the woman shortly afterward when her friend reported her missing.\n\n\"It was around 7.55 p.m. on July 8 when we received the information after the woman's friend reported to a nearby convenience store that she was missing,\" a local Japan Coast Guard official said, per The Guardian.\n\n36 hours later she was found drifting around 50 miles away from the beach, according to AP.\n\nThe woman was dehydrated but did not need to be hospitalized, the Japan Times added. However, the outlet stated she had been taken to a hospital in Yokohama.\n\nThe publication also reported the woman had been seen by a cargo ship off the coast of Nojimazaki on the Boso Peninsula in Chiba Prefecture just before 8 a.m. local time on Wednesday, July 10.\n\nThe Guardian added that two crew members from a smaller tanker ship that was nearby jumped into the sea to rescue the woman after being contacted by radio. \"There are 80km (50 miles) in a straight line [between the beach and rescue spot] ... but it is assumed she drifted for an even greater distance,\" an official said, per the outlet.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nIn a photo and video shared by AP, the woman could be seen being lifted to safety from the ship by a helicopter while wrapped in a blue blanket.\n\nThe outlet added that the coast guard said she was lucky to survive given the warm temperatures, the risk of hypothermia at night, or the possibility of being hit by a ship when it was dark.\n\nThe Independent stated that the woman told officials she only noticed she was drifting out to sea around 30 minutes after she went for a swim, but was unable to get back to the beach by that point.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType":

the possibility of being hit by a ship when it was dark.\n\nThe Independent stated that the woman told officials she only noticed she was drifting out to sea around 30 minutes after she went for a

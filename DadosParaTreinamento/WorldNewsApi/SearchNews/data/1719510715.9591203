This was the standard four student\u2019s first time on the stage, and she is determined it will not be her last. Thara spent five weeks in rehearsal for the show which ran for three days at the Central Bank Auditorium. She sang several of Calypso Rose\u2019s songs, performed dialogue as Carty Rose, and danced as part of the cast, both in scenes as young Rose and as a chorus dancer. She said it took her two weeks to learn the dialogue lines and the music. \u201cI kept my focus and every day I\u2019d do at least five pages, and every day I\u2019d do something new. I wouldn\u2019t stay on one page. When I finished the whole book, because I\u2019d usually finish it in one day, I\u2019d be like 'Okay, let me check it over, because I don\u2019t feel like five pages is enough for me.' That\u2019s what I do.\u201d She said of the three skills \u2013 acting, singing, and dancing \u2013 she liked acting the best. \u201cI preferred the acting during the play. I just loved it! I didn\u2019t have a problem memorising my lines, that was the best part of it. I enjoyed it and once you concentrate on what you\u2019re doing, you will get success.\u201d She also learned some of the choreography in the play through observation. Thara said while this is her first play, she does art, dance and drama with Marcia Charles at the St Patrick\u2019s Newtown Girls' RC School, where she\u2019s preparing for SEA examinations in 2025. She said she\u2019s nervous about doing the examination but she\u2019ll get through it. \u201cAt school I\u2019m studying English grammar, mathematics, social studies and science. Those are my major subjects. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I want to study in high school. When I get to high school I\u2019ll see, and whatever option I love and I want to do, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Thara said her dream job is to be a dance instructor, teaching other people different dance forms \u201cI do want to be a dance instructor. I want to train people to dance, but I also have something else I could do if that doesn\u2019t work out, which is real estate. I like to sell things, I\u2019d like to sell apartments.\u201d Thara also loves exercising. Her mother, Latisha Samuel, said she gets on the stage with the instructor at the Fit Addicts Movement Fitness Boot camp, and also did the same during the fitness section of the 2024 Tribe launch. \u201cI love exercising, it makes me feel a way, I can\u2019t describe it. In my free time I like to draw, it\u2019s a sense of relief for me. I like to go outdoors, and I do rock climbing and stuff like that.\u201d Thara is preparing for the stage again in the Queen of the Road: The Calypso Rose Musical on May 30 and 31, and June 2. She said she\u2019s looking forward to participating in similar projects. \u201cThe part I enjoyed the most about being in the play was when I go to Tobago, because I learned the calypsos and it makes me feel a kind of way, I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d", "summary": "<p><img width=\"825\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/23233009-825x510.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" /></p>\n<p>Ten-year-old Thara Howe wowed audiences with her performance as young Calypso Rose in the calypso musical Queen of the Road: The Calypso Rose Musical by Rhoma Spencer.

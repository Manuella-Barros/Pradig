Djokovic won against a 7-6, 7-6 in straight sets to notch his first ever Olympic gold medal, while the women's singles match was ultimately won by China's Zheng Qinwen against Croatia's Donna Vekic.",

The 23-time Grand Slam winner took to X to publicly complain about the treatment she received at The Peninsula Hotel on Monday after being 'denied access to the rooftop to eat'.\n\nAfter posting a snap of the luxury establishment alongside her gripe, the restaurant clapped back just two hours later on X in response to the complaint. 'Dear Mrs. Williams, Please accept our deepest apologies for the disappointment you encountered tonight,' the Peninsula team wrote. 'Unfortunately, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked and the only unoccupied tables you saw belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was fully reserved. 'We have always been honored to welcome you and will always be to welcome you again. The Peninsula Paris.'\n\nWilliams' fans were quick to rip the hotel for rejecting the tennis legend as one X user asked: 'How does one get denied when they are Serena Williams...... lol' 'Glad you didn't have to waste money there,' another fan pointed out. 'You're better off not going, their food is subpar -- I've unfortunately had to pay for it quite a few times,' someone else said. 'It's Serena Williams - you make a table for her!,' a fourth commented.\n\nIt came after the tennis legend shared her annoyance following the treatment in a message that read: 'Yikes, @peninsulaparis I've been denied access to rooftop to eat in a empty restaurant of nicer places but never with my kids. Always a first.' But not all social media users flocked to take the star's side, with some people claiming her attitude was 'entitled' and 'about privilege'.\n\nOne X user said: 'Wait are we really telling this place that because she's a celebrity they should have figured it out? No. If they're booked, they're booked and it's entitled as heck to be upset that they didn't figure it out because \"I'm special.\" Another chimed in: 'I love the people in here saying she deserved special treatment and should have gotten a table in a place that was fully booked. Jesus Christ, talk about privilege, lol'.\n\nOne more added:'There is literally nothing more entitled than walking into @peninsulaparis during tourist and the Olympics, expecting a table to be ready for you'.\n\nWilliams has attended several Olympic disciplines with her six-year-old daughter, Olympia, and her family in Paris.\n\nShe was also among several high-profile names to be part of the Games' opening ceremony on July 26, as she shared a boat with Rafael Nadal, Carl Lewis and Nadia Comaneci.\n\nWilliams described the ceremony as 'unforgettable.'

Unfortunately, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked and the only unoccupied tables you saw belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was fully reserved,\" read the company's first reply on Monday.\n\n\"We have always been honored to welcome you and will always be to welcome you again. The Peninsula Paris,\" a second post followed.\n\nRepresentatives for Williams and The Peninsula Paris did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for more information on Monday.\n\nAn employee at L'Oiseau Blanc, Maxime Mannevy, told Variety that Williams looked \"unrecognizable\" when she arrived at the restaurant with another woman and a stroller.\n\n\"When she came there were only two tables available and they had been reserved by clients of the hotel,\" said Mannevy, who told the outlet she was not working when Williams was at the restaurant. \"My colleague didn't recognize her and feels terrible, but he told her what he would have told any other client, which is to wait downstairs in the bar for a table to become available. That was absolutely nothing personal.\"\n\nThe Peninsula Paris also issued a statement to TODAY. \"In response to Mrs. Williams' tweet, for whom we have the utmost admiration and respect, as we do for all our esteemed guests; we can only reiterate our deepest apologies for her perception of tonight's situation,\" the hotel said.\n\nThe statement continued: \"Today, August 5th, our rooftop bar was indeed unfortunately fully booked, and the only unoccupied tables at that time belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was also fully reserved tonight. She has always and will always be more than welcome with her family to The Peninsula.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nWilliams and her family arrived in Paris just before the Olympic opening ceremony. During the opening ceremony on July 26, the 23-time Grand Slam winner joined several athletes as a torch bearer.\n\nAfter the opening ceremony, Williams stayed in the French capital and made appearances at different Olympic events. She attended the match in which Serbian tennis pro Novak Djokovic defeated Spain's Carlos Alcaraz and scored gold in the men's singles tournament.\n\nBefore retiring from tennis, Williams won four Olympic gold medals for Team USA. At the London Games in 2012, she earned one in women's singles and another in women's doubles with her sister, Venus. The pair also won gold in women's doubles at the Sydney 2000 Games and Beijing 2008 Games.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The retired tennis star slammed a restaurant in the City of Light after they allegedly \"denied access\" to her family to dine there for dinner.\n\nOn Monday, the 23-time Grand Slam Champion posted on X (formerly Twitter) about the experience, claiming The Peninsula Paris wouldn't seat her family even though she could see open tables in the restaurant. \"Yikes @peninsulaparis,\" she wrote. \"I've been denied access to rooftop to eat in a empty restaurant of nicer places \ud83e\udee0 but never with my kids. Always a first. \ud83d\ude44#Olympic2024\"\n\nIn the post, she also shared a picture of the restaurant, which has received 5.2 million views. \"How does one get denied when they are Serena Williams...... lol\" one person wrote. Another said, \"Glad you didn't have to waste money there.\"\n\nThe restaurant quickly responded, explaining that the restaurant was fully booked. \"Dear Mrs. Williams, Please accept our deepest apologies for the disappointment you encountered tonight,\" they tweeted. \"Unfortunately, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked and the only unoccupied tables you saw belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was fully reserved. We have always been honored to welcome you and will always be to welcome you again. The Peninsula Paris.\"\n\nThe Peninsula also gave a statement to Entertainment Tonight on Monday, \"In response to Mrs. Williams' tweet, for whom we have the utmost admiration and respect, as we do for all our esteemed guests, we can only reiterate our deepest apologies for her perception of tonight's situation. Today, August 5th, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked, and the only unoccupied tables at that time belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was also fully reserved tonight.\"\n\n\"She has always been, and will always be, more than welcome with her family at The Peninsula,\" they concluded.\n\nEven if that's true, it's telling that the restaurant didn't tell Williams this at the time, instead, seemingly waiting until she made a public announcement before clearing up the confusion. If you've been discriminated against before like Williams, it's completely understandable why she thought the same was happening here.\n\nWilliams is currently in Paris for the 2024 Olympics with her husband Alexis Ohanian and their daughters Olympia, 6, and Adira, 11 months. During the opening ceremony on July 26, a British sports reporter accidentally called her husband her \"umbrella holder,\" as he was following behind holding an umbrella up over Williams. \"She's got someone just behind us holding an umbrella,\" the reporter said, per Page Six. \"Those are the levels you aspire to. To have an actual umbrella holder behind you.\"\n\nLater, the Reddit co-founder shared a picture of him holding an umbrella up for Olympia as well. \"I'm also Olympia's personal umbrella holder,\" he joked. \"Sidebar: Y'all set the bar too low for me \ud83d\ude02 celeb dads get flowers just for *acknowledging* they have kids.\"\n\nSo far, Williams hasn't publicly acknowledged the restaurant's response.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sydni_ellis@sheknows.com", "name": "Sydni Ellis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peninsula_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Peninsula Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardi_B", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardi B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Oiseau_Blanc", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "L'Oiseau Blanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gourmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gourmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peninsula_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Peninsula (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Ohanian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Ohanian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympia, Greece"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Olympia, Greece"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Serena-Williams-Alexis-Ohanian-Olympia.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792815", "eventUri": "eng-9792815", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 1789, "textEnd": 1799}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 2588, "textEnd": 2595}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

That was absolutely nothing personal.\"\n\nSerena first touched down in Paris at the end of July, just before the Olympic opening ceremony where she had the honour of being a torch bearer. The tennis legend, who hung up her racket after the 2022 US Open, was among a star-studded line-up of athletes to carry the torch, including nine-time medallist Carl Lewis, French favourites Zinedine Zidane, Teddy Riner and Marie-Jose Perec, as well as Tony Parker and fellow tennis ace Rafael Nadal.\n\nSince then, she's been soaking up the Olympic atmosphere in Paris, spotted at several tennis matches over the past few weeks, including Novak Djokovic's gold medal triumph over Carlos Alcaraz in the men's singles. Serena won four Olympic Gold medals throughout the course of her glittering career, with one win in the women's singles in London for the 2012 games and the other three bagged in the women's doubles alongside her sister Venus Williams.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zoe_delaney@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Zoe Delaney",

The acclaimed athlete revealed that she and her children Alexis Olympia Jr., 6, and Adira River, 11 months, were denied a table at the hotel's restaurant.\n\n\"Yikes @PeninsulaParis I've been denied access to rooftop to eat in an empty restaurant of nicer places \ud83e\udee0but never with my kids,\" she tweeted. \"Always a first. \ud83d\ude44 #Olympic2024.\"\n\nThe Peninsula Hotel responded to the 42-year-old four-time Olympic gold medalist with a public apology. \"Dear Mrs. Williams, Please accept our deepest apologies for the disappointment you encountered tonight.

The Peninsula Paris.\"\n\nAccording to People, an employee at L'Oiseau Blanc, Maxime Mannevy, provided further context to Variety, explaining that Williams arrived with another woman and a stroller. According to Mannevy, who was not present then, a colleague did not recognize Williams and informed her that the available tables were reserved for other hotel guests. \"My colleague didn't recognize her and feels terrible, but he told her what he would have told any other client: to wait downstairs in the bar for a table to become available. That was absolutely nothing personal,\" Mannevy said.\n\nIn a statement to TODAY, The Peninsula Paris reiterated its apology and clarified the situation. \"In response to Mrs. Williams' tweet, for whom we have the utmost admiration and respect, as we do for all our esteemed guests; we can only reiterate our deepest apologies for her perception of tonight's situation. Today, August 5, our rooftop bar was indeed unfortunately fully booked, and the only unoccupied tables at that time belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was also fully reserved tonight.

Image: Instagram via @BounceSport\n\nSerena Williams has been caught up in a controversy involving a Parisian luxury hotel.\n\nThe retired tennis star and her family were reportedly denied access to The Peninsula Hotel's rooftop restaurant, sparking a public apology from the establishment.\n\nWilliams, 42, took to X (formerly Twitter) on 5 August to express her frustration.\n\n\"Yikes @peninsulaparis I've been denied access to [the] rooftop to eat in [an] empty restaurant of nicer places \ud83e\udee0 but never with my kids.\" she wrote.\n\n\"Always a first. \ud83d\ude44#Olympic2024.\"\n\nThe Peninsula Hotel, known for its opulent amenities and stunning views, swiftly responded to Williams' tweet.\n\nThe hotel offered its sincere apologies, according to US Weekly.\n\n\"In response to Mrs. Williams' tweet, for whom we have the utmost admiration and respect, as we do for all our esteemed guests, we can only reiterate our deepest apologies for her perception of tonight's situation,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Today, 5 August, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked, and the only unoccupied tables at that time belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was also fully reserved tonight.\"\n\nThe hotel's apology continued, \"She has always been, and will always be, more than welcome with her family at The Peninsula.\"\n\nThe incident unfolded as Williams was in Paris for the 2024 Olympics, according to the New York Post.\n\nAccompanied by her husband, Alexis Ohanian, and their two daughters, Olympia and Adira, the tennis legend was enjoying her time at the Games.\n\nWilliams had participated in the torch relay for the Opening Ceremony, sharing the stage with luminaries such as Rafael Nadal and Nadia Com\u0103neci.\n\nWhile at the ceremony, Ohanian, 41, was mistakenly identified by broadcasters as the person holding Williams' umbrella.\n\nCommentator Laura Woods remarked, \"She [Serena] looks absolutely incredible.\n\nShe's got someone just behind us holding an umbrella. Those are the levels you aspire to.\n\nTo have an actual umbrella holder behind you.\"\n\nOhanian took the blunder in stride. \"Olympia. Serena Williams. Serena's Personal Umbrella Holder. \ud83d\ude02\" he joked on Instagram.\n\nHe then shared a photo of himself with Williams and their daughter.\n\n\"Let the games begin! I'll be watching a lot of T&F [track and field events] to soak up @athlos inspiration. \ud83e\udd47\"\n\nDespite the dining debacle, Williams' presence at the Olympics was a highlight, according to Fox News.\n\nKnown for her illustrious career, Serena Williams is a four-time Olympian, having competed in 2000, 2008, 2012, and 2016.\n\nWilliams secured gold medals in women's doubles with her sister Venus at each event.\n\nThis year, however, she was relishing the chance to witness other athletes compete.\n\n\"It's fun! The Olympics in Paris is really, really incredible,\" Williams said.\n\n\"I don't know if it's fun or I'm a little jealous. I did do the London/Wimbledon combination, but I was a little jealous of here!\"\n\nWhile the situation at The Peninsula may have cast a shadow, it seems Williams is maintaining her positive outlook.\n\nThe hotel's apology and her continued enjoyment of the Games suggest that the mix-up has not dampened her Olympic spirit.\n\nWith her family by her side and a front-row seat to the world's greatest sporting event, Serena Williams remains a formidable presence both on and off the court.\n\nLet us know by clicking on the comment tab below this article or by emailing

Another said, \"There might be something else going on in Paris.... Maybe not everything is about you? Just a thought.\"\n\nThe 23-time Grand Slam champion has been in Paris for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, accompanied by her husband, Alexis Ohanian, and their daughters, Olympia, 6, and Adira, 1. The retired athlete participated in the opening ceremony's torch relay.\n\nIn Williams' original post, which was viewed more than 5 million times, she wrote: \"Yikes @peninsulaparis.\" She said she had been \"denied access to rooftop to eat in an empty restaurant of nicer places but never with my kids. Always a first. #Olympic2024. You're Really Gonna Reject Me?!?!\"\n\nWilliams' complaint appears to be centered on the fact that she and her family arrived at the restaurant, saw empty tables and assumed they were available. Her claim of being \"denied access\" prompted some to wonder if she believed she was being turned away because she had her young children with her or because of her race.\n\nBut in its apology, the Peninsula Hotel explained that its rooftop bar was indeed \"fully booked\" and the unoccupied tables she saw belonged to its gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, \"which was fully reserved.\"\n\nReaders soon added a \"context\" warning to Williams' original post, pointing out that she was not \"denied access\" but that the restaurant was fully booked.\n\n\"The arrogance and vengeance of Serena Williams!\" wrote Australian entertainment reporter Peter Ford on X, appearing to take particular issue with the way she went public with her complaints. \"Things are kind of busy in Paris right now. You need to book ahead. ... Does she want regular people kicked out to accommodate her party?\"\n\nWhile a number of people offered versions of, \"For Serena Williams you find a table,\" one person pointed out that the Paris dining experience, which involves luxuriating over meals, means that high-end restaurants typically don't expect to turn tables multiple times each evening. \"So if a booking is made for 8pm, they will not seat someone at that table at 7,\" the person said. \"So at 7 pm a restaurant may look empty at the moment, but every table is actually reserved. You can't take this as a personal slight.\"\n\nOthers said it was \"tone-deaf\" and \"not a good look\" for a wealthy person like Williams to make an issue of not getting a table at a luxury restaurant during a massive international event like the Olympics.\n\n\"Nobody is more ostracized or victimized than people in the $300 million net worth club,\" someone wrote with faux sympathy. \"It's truly remarkable how they carry on.\"\n\n\"Coming on to X to publicly complain and name a Parisian restaurant is pretty tone deaf,\" another person wrote. \"A lot of us are just trying to afford groceries these days. I respect celebs who use their name to help others or animals, not whine about not getting preferential treatment.\"\n\nSomeone else asked Williams what her goal was in going public with her complaint: \"Outrage from strangers? Hard working servers lose their jobs?\"\n\nAnd yet others offered solutions for Williams, saying she could probably buy the hotel herself or she should, at the very least, make reservations. Someone else suggested: \"It's really simple Ms. Williams, reserve your room at The Ritz.\"", "source": {"uri": "eastbaytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Bay Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_ross@eastbaytimes.com", "name": "Martha Ross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peninsula_Hong_Kong", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Peninsula Hong Kong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narcissism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Oiseau_Blanc", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "L'Oiseau Blanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Ohanian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Ohanian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_flame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic flame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympia, Greece"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Olympia, Greece"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_worth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net worth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.eastbaytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24208621240169-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792815", "eventUri": "eng-9792815", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

In 2018, she faced backlash at the French Open for wearing a black catsuit, an outfit that was subsequently banned. French Tennis Federation President Bernard Giudicelli stated, \"It will no longer be accepted ... One must respect the game and the place.\" Williams responded by saying, \"I didn't know it would have such an impact. Here I am, just trying to be healthy, I was a new mom and just trying to be me.

Always a first. #Olympic2024.\" The Peninsula Hotel later replied to the sports legend's call-out.\n\nReplying to Serena's tweet, the official account for the hotel told the American star: \"Dear Mrs. Williams, Please accept our deepest apologies for the disappointment you encountered tonight. Unfortunately, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked and the only unoccupied tables you saw belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was fully reserved.\"\n\nIn an additional tweet, the hotel's Twitter account added: \"We have always been honoured to welcome you and will always be to welcome you again. The Peninsula Paris.\" Maxime Mannevy, an employee at L'Oiseau Blanc, told Variety that Serena was \"unrecognizable\" when she arrived at the restaurant with another woman and a pram.\n\n\"When she came there were only two tables available and they had been reserved by clients of the hotel,\" said Mannevy, who wasn't working when the tennis icon visited the restaurant. \"My colleague didn't recognize her and feels terrible, but he told her what he would have told any other client, which is to wait downstairs in the bar for a table to become available. That was absolutely nothing personal.\"\n\nSerena first touched down in Paris at the end of July, just before the Olympic opening ceremony where she had the honour of being a torch bearer. The tennis legend, who hung up her racket after the 2022 U.S. Open, was among a star-studded line-up of athletes to carry the torch, including nine-time medallist Carl Lewis, French favourites Zinedine Zidane, Teddy Riner and Marie-Jose Perec, as well as Tony Parker and fellow tennis ace Rafael Nadal.\n\nSince then, she's been soaking up the Olympic atmosphere in Paris, spotted at several tennis matches over the past few weeks, including Novak Djokovic's gold medal triumph over Carlos Alcaraz in the men's singles. Serena won four Olympic Gold medals throughout the course of her glittering career, with one win in the women's single in London for the 2012 games and the other three bagged in the women's doubles alongside her sister Venus Williams.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Representatives for Williams were not immediately available for comment.\n\nWilliams first arrived in the French capital in late July, ahead of the Olympic opening ceremony in which she participated as a torch bearer. The champion, who retired from professional tennis after the 2022 U.S. Open, was one of several athletes to carry the torch, with others including nine-time medallist Carl Lewis, French favorites Zinedine Zidane, Teddy Riner and Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec, as well as Tony Parker and fellow tennis champ Rafael Nadal. She has remained in Paris to take in the Olympics, making appearances at several tennis matches over the past few weeks, including at Novak Djokovic's win over Carlos Alcaraz to take home gold in the men's singles tournament.\n\nWilliams won four Olympic gold medals over the course of her career. One came in the women's singles at the London games in 2012, while the other three were earned in the women's doubles, in which Williams and her sister, Venus Williams, emerged victorious in Sydney 2000, Beijing 2008 and London 2012.\n\nBest of Variety", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "j_kim_murphy@yahoo.com", "name": "J.

Throughout her illustrious career, Serena clinched four Olympic Gold medals - one in the women's singles at the London 2012 games and three in the women's doubles with her sister Venus Williams.\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

The tennis legend claimed the restaurant turned her and her children away, despite it being \"empty.\" Williams shared her disappointment on X, stating, \"Yikes @peninsulaparis I've been denied access to rooftop to eat in an empty restaurant of nicer places but never with my kids. Always a first. #Olympic2024.\" The tweet, accompanied by a melting face and rolling eyes emoji, quickly went viral, prompting reactions from fans and the establishment itself.\n\nThe Peninsula Paris swiftly issued a response, explaining the situation and offering an apology to the 23-time Grand Slam winner. In a statement provided to The Post, the restaurant reiterated its admiration and respect for Williams and explained that they couldn't accommodate her family due to a lack of reservation. \"We do always try to make space for walk-in guests, but sometimes this is not possible,\" the statement read. The establishment noted that their rooftop bar and gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, were fully booked on the day in question. As an alternative, they offered Williams a table at La Terrasse Kl\u00e9ber, an outdoor dining area on the hotel's ground floor.\n\nPublic Reaction and Hotel's Outreach\n\nThe incident sparked a wave of reactions online, with many fans and observers questioning the restaurant's decision. One user bluntly commented, \"Y'all probably made a table available for certain others, I bet!\" This sentiment echoed a broader expectation that high-profile guests like Williams should receive special treatment, even under tight circumstances. The hotel's public response on X mirrored the sentiments of their official statement, emphasizing that they had \"always been honored to welcome\" Williams and looked forward to doing so again.\n\nSerena Williams, who is in Paris to enjoy the Olympic Games with her family, including her 6-year-old daughter Olympia, had also participated in the opening ceremony. She described the experience as \"unforgettable,\" sharing a boat with fellow sports icons like Rafael Nadal, Carl Lewis, and Nadia Comaneci. Despite the restaurant incident, Williams' Paris trip seems filled with memorable moments, underscoring her continued influence and presence on the global stage.\n\nThe Peninsula Paris, meanwhile, appears eager to mend fences, having reached out to Williams directly to address the matter.

Always a first. #Olympic2024,\" she said.\n\nThe post accompanied a clear snapshot of the restaurant's signage, with many of Williams' 10.3 million fans posting their disapproval over the venue's alleged snub in the comments below.\n\n\"How does one get denied when they are Serena Williams...... lol,\" one person said.\n\n\"How embarrassing for them. I'm sorry this happened to you. It has to hurt,\" said another.\n\nA third person said: \"Who doesn't make room for a queen?\"\n\nThe post, which was seen by three million people and surpassed two thousand comments, only seemed to attract further uproar when The Peninsula commented an apology to Williams.\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Williams, please accept our deepest apologies for the disappointment you encountered tonight,\" the diner said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked and the only unoccupied tables you saw belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was fully reserved.\"\n\n\"We have always been honored to welcome you and will always be to welcome you again.\"\n\nWilliams' fans took aim at the restaurant after it surrendered, with one person saying: \"How come y'all didn't say that when she was still there?\n\n\"How hard would it have been to inform her and her family, that the unoccupied tables are for your gourmet restaurant L'Oiseau Blanc, which had to be confusing for anyone to know upon entering Peninsula Paris, that the rooftop serves two restaurants, and she cannot use the unoccupied tables\" said another.\n\n\"One more person said: \"Make room for the Queen next time, Serena deserves royal treatment.\"\n\nBut others sided with the five-star Parisian spot and said Williams was entitled for expecting to be seated in a bustling city restaurant during peak tourist time.\n\n\"There is literally nothing more entitled than walking into @peninsulaparis during tourist and the Olympics, expecting a table to be ready for you,\" one person said.\n\n\"Wait are we really telling this place that because she's a celebrity they should have figured it out? No. If they're booked, they're booked and it's entitled as heck to be upset that they didn't figure it out because \"I'm special,\" another dissatisfied person said.\n\nL'Oiseau Blanc rooftop boasts French Gastronomic cuisine and the menu's offering will set luxury food fiends back 125\u20ac ($210 AUD) for a Sea bass \"\u00e0 la nage\".\n\nThose seeking to then stay at the hotel will need to shell out a minimum of $4,700 AUD per night.\n\nWilliams, who is no stranger to accusations of being a diva, enjoyed a spectacle of sports with an enclave of celebrities before her public row with the diner.\n\nShe was on Saturday snapped with entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian to witness the US defeat Japan 1-0 in the Women's Football Quarterfinal at Stade de France.\n\nThe mother-of-two last month joined former gymnastics great Nadia Comaneci in the stand for the artistic gymnastics women's team final.\n\nShe took part in the Olympic torch-lighting hand-off with fellow tennis notoriety Rafael

Always a first,\" she wrote on the app.\n\nThe post featured a photo of a sign for The Peninsula Paris, a hotel with six restaurants.\n\nThe Peninsula Paris responded to Williams on X and said, \"Please accept our deepest apologies for the disappointment you encountered tonight. Unfortunately, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked, and the only unoccupied tables you saw belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was fully reserved.\"\n\nToday reached out to The Peninsula Paris for a comment, saying, in part, \"In response to Mrs. Williams' tweet, for whom we have the utmost admiration and respect, as we do for all our esteemed guests; we can only reiterate our deepest apologies for her perception of tonight's situation ... She has always and will always be more than welcome with her family to The Peninsula.\"\n\nRELATED: Exactly How Much Olympic Athletes Actually Make For Competing\n\nFellow X users who responded to Williams' post and The Peninsula's response were divided about how the situation should have been handled.\n\nSome were on Williams' side, and wondered how such a high profile celebrity could be \"denied access.\"\n\nHowever, others sided with the restaurant, which was not backing down from its stance that it was full and simply had no room left for Williams' family.\n\n\"Using your fame to trash a restaurant because they did not bend to your entitled demands is being the worst type of person. I thought you were better than this,\" someone said.\n\nAnother person added, \"There might be something else going on in Paris. Maybe not everything is about you? Just a thought.\"\n\nStill, others brought the conversation back to the reality faced by so many. \"Coming on to X to publicly complain and name a Parisian restaurant is pretty tone-deaf,\" someone said. \"A lot of us are just trying to afford groceries these days.\"\n\nThere is no simple answer as to who was wrong and who was right in this case. Serena Williams is, after all, one of the most recognizable athletes in the world, making her a huge celebrity. One could argue that people with platforms as large as hers deserve to be accommodated and treated with respect, even if it means rescheduling another guest's booking.\n\nLeonard Zhukovsky | Shutterstock\n\nOn the other hand, the argument could also be made that just because Williams is famous doesn't mean she should be treated differently than anyone else. If the restaurant was already fully booked, then there simply was no room for her and her family.

In a post on social media, Williams mentioned being denied access to the rooftop restaurant, even though it was empty, which was a first-time experience for her, especially with her kids in tow. The hotel responded with an apology, explaining that the rooftop bar was fully booked, and the unoccupied tables belonged to the gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was also fully reserved.\n\nDespite the hotel's apology, Williams did not respond directly. Instead, she shared a video on her Instagram Stories, showing her support for the United States' men's volleyball team competing against Brazil in the Olympics. It's worth noting that Williams was also a torchbearer for the Paris Olympics, adding to her connection with the event.\n\nWilliams, who retired from professional tennis after the 2022 U.S. Open, is a legendary figure in the sport, having won 23 Grand Slam titles throughout her career. She continues to be involved in sports and supporting fellow athletes, as seen in her presence at the Paris Olympics to cheer on Team USA.\n\nWhile the incident at The Peninsula Paris may have been disappointing for Williams, it's essential to remember that even celebrities and accomplished individuals like her can face challenges or setbacks in their everyday experiences. It serves as a reminder that everyone, regardless of status, can encounter unexpected hurdles while traveling or dining out.\n\nAs fans of Serena Williams and admirers of her athletic achievements, it's crucial to respect her privacy and allow her to address any issues or concerns in her own time. Despite the incident, Williams remains a respected and celebrated figure in the world of sports, with a legacy that transcends any isolated incident at a Paris hotel.\n\nIn conclusion, Serena Williams' experience at The Peninsula Paris highlights the importance of hospitality and customer service, even when dealing with high-profile guests. It also underscores the unpredictable nature of travel and dining experiences, where even the best-laid plans can sometimes fall through. As Williams continues to support athletes and contribute to the world of sports, fans can appreciate her resilience and dedication, both on and off the tennis court.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peninsula_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Peninsula Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hospitality industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://usanews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/news-06082024-105128.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792815", "eventUri": "eng-9792815", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Always a first. #Olympic2024.\" This tweet quickly garnered attention, highlighting the challenges faced by high-profile individuals in public spaces.\n\nIn response to Williams' tweet, The Peninsula Paris issued an apology, explaining that their rooftop bar was fully booked and that the only available tables belonged to their gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was also reserved. They emphasized their respect and admiration for Williams, stating that they would be honored to welcome her again.\n\nAn employee at L'Oiseau Blanc, Maxime Mannevy, commented on the situation, noting that when Williams arrived, there were only two tables available, both of which were reserved. He mentioned that his colleague did not recognize her, leading to the misunderstanding. Mannevy expressed regret over the incident, emphasizing that it was not personal.\n\nThis incident has sparked discussions about the treatment of Black individuals in public spaces, particularly in Paris, where instances of racial bias have been reported. While the restaurant's explanation suggests a misunderstanding, the situation resonates with broader concerns about accessibility and inclusivity for families, especially those of color.\n\nWilliams and her family were in Paris for the Olympic Games, where she participated in the opening ceremony as a torchbearer. Known for her remarkable achievements, including four Olympic gold medals, Williams continues to be a prominent figure in sports and beyond.\n\nWhile the Peninsula Paris has expressed regret over the incident, it serves as a reminder of the ongoing conversations about race, privilege and accessibility in public spaces.

Unfortunately, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked and the only unoccupied tables you saw belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was fully reserved.\"\n\nMany supporters commented on her post to state that the restaurant could have made room for her.\n\nMeanwhile, Serena recently revealed she was inspired to achieve success after being \"ghosted\" by a man.\n\nThe champion was ranked world No.1 in singles by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for 319 weeks and is the is the only player to accomplish a Career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles but admitted that her motivation all came from an early relationship that suddenly broke down without warning.\n\nSpeaking in her new ESPN docuseries 'In the Arena', she explained: \"It was the first relationship that I had ever had, but I was in my 20s, so you know, whatever...and then he ghosts me, I got ghosted. And it wasn't even that serious, but it was like I used that and I made it way more serious than what it was. So, when he ghosted me, I used that as an opportunity to say, 'He's gonna regret this for the rest of his life.' That was just the motivation I needed, just the excuse I used to go the extra mile.\"\n\nSerena - who is now married to Alexis Ohanian and has Olympia, six, and Adira,12 months, with him - retired from the tennis court in 2022 but admitted that she wanted to make sure that the person who abandoned her would \"never forget\" her as she cemented her rise to global fame and wanted to be around in their life forever through her celebrity status.", "source": {"uri": "capitalfm.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital FM Kenya"}, "authors": [{"uri": "king_bee_kiragu@capitalfm.co.ke", "name": "King Bee Kiragu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Oiseau_Blanc", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "L'Oiseau Blanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_ace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flying ace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_documentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television documentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Ohanian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Ohanian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympia, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Olympia, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Dining_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Dining Guides", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Ghosts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Ghosts", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/thesauce/files/2023/12/Serena-Williams-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792815", "eventUri": "eng-9792815", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

They should have been honored to have you,\" while another wondered, \"How does THE Serena Williams get denied anywhere?? Especially during the Olympics???\"\n\nWhile Serena retired from competitive tennis in 2022, she won four gold medals during her illustrious career, taking home the hardware as the women's singles champ at the 2012 London Olympics and winning doubles gold medals with sister Venus Williams at 2000 Sydney games, 2008 Beijing Olympics and London 2012.\n\nThe 23-time grand slam champion is such a beloved Olympic icon that she was chosen to help carry the torch on its final leg on a boat down the Seine River at the Paris Olympics opening ceremony on July 26. She was joined by fellow tennis great Rafael Nadal, nine-time gold medalist track star Carl Lewis and gymnastics legend Nadia Comaneci.\n\nSerena later joked about the emotional yet rainy ride, writing on X, \"From being part of an amazing Opening Ceremony at the Paris Olympics to riding in the boat in the rain-and it was pouring! So much so my lashes came right on off.\"\n\nThe seven-time Wimbledon champ has been taking in plenty of events while in Paris. She was joined by Alexis and Olympia to watch Simone Biles lead Team USA to the women's team all-around gymnastics gold medal on July 30. She also attended the men's tennis final at Roland Garros on Sunday, August 4, watching Novak Djokovic beat Carlos Alcaraz for the gold medal.\n\nSerena announced she was stepping away from competitive tennis in an August 2022 essay for Vogue. Her final tournament was the U.S. Open the following month.\n\n\"I have never liked the word retirement. It doesn't feel like a modern word to me. I've been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people,\" she wrote. \"Maybe the best word to describe what I'm up to is evolution. I'm here to tell you that I'm evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.\"", "source": {"uri": "lifeandstylemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life & Style"},

In another tweet, it added: \"We have always been honored to welcome you and will always be to welcome you again.\"\n\nWilliams's post was flooded with responses from people split about what exactly happened. While some accused the former tennis player of wanting special treatment during the busy Olympics season, others felt that she was denied entry because she's Black -- a reasonable feeling given the experiences people of color in France regularly deal with. Earlier this year, Kelly Rowland suggested that a terse exchange she had with an usher at the Cannes Film Festival had been racially motivated, the country's refusal to allow its athletes to wear hijabs in competition has been condemned as racist and sexist by international organizations, and France has seen an increase in racism and intolerance in recent years.\n\nIn a statement to Today, the hotel doubled down on its tweet, saying, \"We can only reiterate our deepest apologies for her perception of tonight's situation.\" We'll have to see if Williams accepts the apology.", "source": {"uri": "thecut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Cut"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tariro_mzezewa@thecut.com", "name": "Tariro Mzezewa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Ohanian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Ohanian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympia, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Olympia, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gourmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gourmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fcb/ed8/b3575801e301e500f0f2bc4e043b39c452-GettyImages-2165309684.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792815", "eventUri": "eng-9792815", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

On Monday, the tennis icon, 42, claimed that she wasn't permitted to eat in the rooftop of Paris' The Peninsula -- despite claiming the place was \"empty.\"\n\nNow, the restaurant has responded to the 23-time Grand Slam winner as the staffers doubled down on why they denied Williams and her children a table.\n\n\"In response to Ms Williams' tweet, for whom we have the utmost admiration and respect, as we do for all our esteemed guests, we reiterate our deepest apologies that we were not able to offer her a table at our rooftop bar when she arrived with her family and without a reservation,\" the hotel said in a statement to The Post. \"We do always try to make space for walk-in guests but sometimes this is not possible.\"\n\n\"On August 5th, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked, and the only unoccupied tables at that time belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was also fully reserved,\" the Peninsula Paris said.\n\n[From The New York Post]\n\nThis reminds me of that 2013 incident with Oprah and the Zurich boutique. Oprah was shopping in Zurich, she wanted to see an expensive purse and instead of letting her see the bad, the shop's clerk refused to show it to her and instead offered to show her less expensive bags. That blew up into an international incident over whether Oprah was being \"oversensitive\" or whether Oprah (correctly) read the vibe as racist and got out. I'm sure from Peninsula Paris's perspective, they were following their own booking protocol and while the restaurant was empty, they simply did not see a good reason to get Serena and her family to a table. But I trust Serena's instincts here - if she's suggesting that there was another vibe, I believe her.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympia, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Olympia, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oprah Winfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Oiseau_Blanc", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "L'Oiseau Blanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Etiquette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z\u00fcrich", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Z\u00fcrich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Z\u00fcrich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Dining_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Dining Guides", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Table_Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Table Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Table_Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Table Tennis", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Table_Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Table Football", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792815", "eventUri": "eng-9792815", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 1699, "textEnd": 1709}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

We have always been honored to welcome you and will always be to welcome you again.\"\n\nNot providing a former tennis star with anything less than 5-star treatment would be a public relations nightmare for any establishment.\n\nFor as long as sports have boomed in this country, star American athletes have been accustomed to fine dining and accommodations. That tradition has been slipping in recent years, including a recent complaint by NFL Hall of Famer Terrell Davis made against United Airlines after they handcuffed him on a flight to Southern California.\n\nAn aspect worth addressing from this ordeal is the new age's style of complaining about service, which is to publicly tag a business for a complaint.

Whether it was Williams or her ardent fan base mocking the business, the hotel was humbled in the end.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alejandro_avila@outkick.com", "name": "Alejandro Avila", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peninsula_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Peninsula Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrell Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Consolidators", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Consolidators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/08/gettyimages-1434792679-594x594-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792815", "eventUri": "eng-9792815", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Always a first.\"\n\nThe Peninsula responded with an apology, stating that the rooftop bar was fully booked and that the vacant tables were reserved for another of their restaurants.\n\nThey posted on X, explaining, \"We can only reiterate our deepest apologies for her perception of tonight's situation. She has always been, and will always be, more than welcome with her family at The Peninsula.\"\n\nThey added, \"Dear Mrs Williams. Please accept our deepest apologies for the disappointment you encountered tonight. Unfortunately, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked and the only unoccupied tables you saw belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was fully reserved.\"\n\nHowever, this response raises more questions than it answers, especially given the specificity of Williams' claim that the space appeared empty and that this was the first time she had experienced such treatment with her children.\n\nThe optics of this incident are troubling, particularly when viewed through the lens of race and privilege. Serena Williams is not just a globally recognized athlete; she is a cultural icon and symbol of strength, perseverance, and grace under pressure. For her to be denied entry, especially in a city like Paris, known for its cosmopolitan and supposedly inclusive nature, suggests an underlying bias that cannot be ignored.\n\nThis is not the first time a Black celebrity has faced such discriminatory treatment in high-end spaces. In 2013, Oprah Winfrey, one of the most influential women in the world, was denied access to a luxury store in Zurich. Winfrey recounted how a shop assistant refused to show her a handbag, assuming she couldn't afford it. These incidents highlight a recurring issue where Black individuals, regardless of their fame or wealth, are judged and excluded based on their skin color.\n\nThis is not merely a case of a restaurant adhering to reservation policies. The issue runs deeper, reflecting a pattern of exclusion that many people of color experience in spaces that are predominantly white and elite. The subtle and often unspoken rules about who belongs and who does not are at play here, and they are reinforced by actions like the one taken by The Peninsula. It is a reminder that, despite progress, there are still places where the presence of Black people, even those as accomplished as Serena Williams, is questioned or unwelcome.\n\nThe Peninsula's apology, while polite, failed to address the core of the issue. It was a standard PR move, more concerned with preserving the hotel's reputation than acknowledging the harm done. The suggestion that the rooftop was fully booked does not hold up against the specificity of Williams' complaint and the visible support she received from the public.\n\nThe fact that many netizens rallied behind her, questioning how anyone could turn away a figure as illustrious as Williams, speaks volumes about the public's perception of the incident.\n\nThis event also highlights the broader issue of accessibility in luxury spaces. The hospitality industry, particularly at the high end, often operates under a veneer of exclusivity that can easily mask discriminatory practices. These practices can range from overt racism to more subtle forms of bias, such as differential treatment based on a person's appearance or perceived status. The result is a stratified experience where certain groups are made to feel like outsiders, regardless of their accomplishments or financial means.\n\nThis incident serves as a stark reminder of the persistent barriers faced by Black people, even those who have reached the pinnacle of success. It underscores the need for a more inclusive and equitable approach in all spaces, especially those that pride themselves on their sophistication and worldliness.\n\nSerena Williams' experience, much like Oprah Winfrey's, is a call to action for all of us to recognize and challenge the subtle ways in which discrimination continues to operate. It is a reminder that no matter how far we've come, there is still work to be done to ensure that everyone is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.", "source": {"uri": "face2faceafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Face2Face Africa"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dollita_okine@face2faceafrica.com", "name": "Dollita Okine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_Guide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelin Guide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oprah Winfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Optics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human skin color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multiculturalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z\u00fcrich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Z\u00fcrich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Z\u00fcrich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social stratification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hospitality industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Direct action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Dining_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Dining Guides", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://face2faceafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-06-at-9.32.57-AM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792815", "eventUri": "eng-9792815", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The tennis superstar, known for her unparalleled achievements on the court and her advocacy off it, was seemingly left bewildered and disheartened by the experience. In a series of posts, she called out the Peninsula Paris, bringing to light a broader issue that has occasionally reared its head in the city of lights - the subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, exclusion of black celebrities from high-end establishments.\n\nBefore delving into the incident, it's essential to understand who Serena Williams is and the magnitude of her influence. Born on September 26, 1981, in Saginaw, Michigan, Serena Jameka Williams has become a global icon, transcending the sport of tennis. She has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, the most by any player in the Open Era, and has been ranked world No. 1 in singles by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) on eight separate occasions between 2002 and 2017.\n\nWilliams' journey to the top of the tennis world is a story of grit, determination, and resilience. Coached by her father, Richard Williams, alongside her sister Venus, Serena emerged from the public courts of Compton, California, to dominate the traditionally white and elitist sport of tennis. Her powerful playing style, characterized by aggressive baseline play, relentless athleticism, and mental fortitude, revolutionized the women's game and inspired countless young athletes around the globe.\n\nOff the court, Serena Williams is a businesswoman, fashion designer, and philanthropist. She has her own clothing line, S by Serena, and has invested in various startups through her venture capital firm, Serena Ventures. Williams is also an advocate for social justice, using her platform to speak out against racial and gender inequality. Her journey and success story have made her a role model for many, embodying the message that with hard work and determination, barriers can be broken, and ceilings can be shattered.\n\nSerena Williams' recent ordeal in Paris has sparked conversations about celebrity treatment, cultural differences, and, regrettably, racial insensitivity. The incident occurred at the Peninsula Paris, a renowned five-star hotel known for its luxurious accommodations and exquisite dining experiences. Williams, along with her family, attempted to dine at the hotel's exclusive rooftop restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, only to be turned away.\n\n\"Yikes @peninsulaparis,\" she wrote on Monday. \"I've been denied access to the rooftop to eat in an empty restaurant of nicer places ? but never with my kids. Always a first. ?#Olympic2024. You're Really Gonna Reject Me?!?!\"\n\nThe post quickly went viral, with fans and followers expressing their outrage and disappointment. Many questioned how one of the most recognizable athletes in the world could be denied access, speculating about the underlying reasons behind the snub.\n\nThe restaurant was swift to respond to the backlash. In a public statement, they extended an apology to Serena Williams, explaining the situation and attempting to clarify the misunderstanding.\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Williams,\" they wrote. \"Please accept our deepest apologies for the disappointment you encountered tonight. Unfortunately, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked, and the only unoccupied tables you saw belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was fully reserved.\"\n\nMaxime Mannevy, a worker at the Peninsula's rooftop restaurant, spoke with Variety to provide further context. According to Mannevy, the staff member who interacted with Williams did not recognize her and was merely following standard protocol.\n\n\"When she came there were only two tables available, and they had been reserved by clients of the hotel,\" said Mannevy. \"My colleague didn't recognize her and feels terrible, but he told her what he would have told any other client, which is to wait downstairs in the bar for a table to become available. That was absolutely nothing personal.\"\n\nDespite the apology, the incident has reignited discussions about the treatment of black celebrities in Paris, a city with a complicated history regarding race and exclusivity.\n\nSerena Williams' experience is not an isolated case. Over the years, several black celebrities have reported similar treatment at high-end establishments in Paris. These incidents have raised concerns about underlying racial biases that persist in some of the city's elite circles.\n\nOne notable instance involved Oprah Winfrey, who, in 2013, was refused service at a high-end boutique in Paris. Winfrey recounted that a sales assistant had told her that a handbag she was interested in was \"too expensive\" for her, an encounter that left the media mogul feeling humiliated and marginalized. The store later issued an apology, but the incident underscored a troubling trend.\n\nSimilarly, rapper and entrepreneur Jay-Z has spoken about feeling unwelcome in certain Parisian establishments. In a 2017 interview, he recounted an experience at a nightclub where he was denied entry despite having a reservation. Jay-Z attributed the incident to racial profiling, emphasizing that wealth and fame do not always shield black individuals from discrimination.\n\nThese experiences highlight a broader issue within Parisian society, where black celebrities, despite their status, continue to face barriers and prejudices that their white counterparts often do not encounter. While some may argue that these incidents are isolated and not indicative of systemic racism, the frequency and consistency of such reports suggest otherwise.\n\nThe exclusion of black celebrities from high-end establishments in Paris reflects a deeper, more pervasive issue of racism and exclusivity within elite spaces. These incidents are not merely about individual snubs but point to a broader cultural problem where black individuals are often perceived as outsiders, regardless of their achievements or status.\n\nIn the world of luxury and high society, where image and perception are paramount, black celebrities often find themselves subjected to scrutiny and skepticism. This treatment underscores a reluctance to fully embrace diversity and inclusion within these spaces, perpetuating a cycle of exclusion and marginalization.\n\nThe impact of these experiences extends beyond the celebrities themselves. When prominent black figures face discrimination, it sends a message to the broader black community about their place and acceptance within society. It reinforces the notion that no matter how successful or famous one becomes, racial biases can still undermine their dignity and respect.\n\nSerena Williams' decision to speak out about her experience is a powerful reminder of the importance of using one's platform to advocate for change. By publicly addressing the incident, Williams has sparked a necessary conversation about the treatment of black individuals in elite spaces and the need for greater awareness and accountability.\n\nHer outspokenness serves as a call to action for other celebrities and influencers to share their experiences and challenge the status quo. It also highlights the need for institutions and establishments to re-evaluate their policies and practices to ensure they are inclusive and equitable for all.\n\nAs the world moves towards greater diversity and inclusion, it is crucial that elite spaces reflect these values. The hospitality industry, in particular, must prioritize training and education to combat racial biases and foster a culture of respect and equality. By doing so, they can create environments where all guests, regardless of their background, feel welcome and valued.\n\nThe incident involving Serena Williams at the Peninsula Paris is a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by black celebrities in elite spaces. While the restaurant's apology and explanation provide some context, they do not erase the broader implications of such experiences.\n\nSerena Williams' resilience and advocacy serve as an inspiration for many, and her willingness to address these issues publicly is a step towards progress. It is a call for greater awareness, empathy, and action to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their race, are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.\n\nAs conversations about diversity and inclusion continue to evolve, it is essential that society listens to and learns from these experiences.

Rather, the restaurant was fully booked.\"\n\nAs usual, the Note was a great visual gag.\n\nBad look for Serena Williams, barring more revelatory details? Probably. Then again, where could we be as American sports without our entitled stars?

Then add Four Olympic medals. Seven Wimbledon singles titles, and the title as arguably the greatest Grand Slam player of all time.\n\nBut talent, fame, and wealth did not stop the mother of two from being denied entry to one of France's top hotels for lunch with her children while attending the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. She and her husband Alexis Ohanian, are parents to Olympia, 6, and babygirl Adira, who was born in December 2023.\n\nIt's unclear when the incident went down but Williams took to social media on Monday, Aug. 5, to call out the restaurant. She said, \"Yikes @peninsulaparis I've been denied access to rooftop to eat in a empty restaurant of nicer places but never with my kids. Always a first. #Olympic2024.\"\n\nThis was followed by hundreds asking, \"Who Denied the GOAT entry?\"\n\nWhile Williams never stated the exact reason for being blocked entry with her kids, news of the slight quickly spread, with many pointing to racial or national discrimination as the root of the disrespect.\n\n\"Everyone knows the French don't like black folk,\" one person wrote on The Shade Room's post about the hotel's refusal to seat Williams and her family.\n\nAnother added, \"Between Jamaican women withdrawn from their events to Sha'Carri and Shelly being denied entrance, Coco being treated unfairly on the court, and Serena being turned away from a nice rooftop restaurant... Paris seems to not favor black people.\"\n\nAnother blatantly asked, \"Why was she denied? Did they give a reason, or was this Racism?\"\n\nSha'Carri Richardson and Jamaica's Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce were briefly denied entry into the warmup area before the 100-meter race after a new rule change and Jamaican runner Shericka Jackson withdrew from the 200-meter race on Sunday.\n\nWilliams considers Paris her second home, even buying a two-bedroom pied-\u00e0-terre, which is a small apartment, in the 7th arrondissement in 2007. She has spoken fondly of her time there before the recent pushback.\n\nOne person said, \"The City of Light\" is: \"Paris is that mean/introvert friend who invites you over but doesn't want you to really show up or touch anything.\"\n\nSome on social media blasted the Olympics' committee for the bevy of nightmare stories this year about how athletes of color are being treated.\n\n\"Paris and this Olympic drama. They should never host the Olympics again,\" someone said. \"They have been HORRIBLE in their treatment of athletes - particularly those that are black & brown.\"\n\nOthers suggested this is a broader French problem, comparing it to another recent event that put the racist treatment on blast.\n\n\"Paris is giving Cannes red carpet,\" read one post, referencing the May 2024 incident where singer Kelly Rowland was shooed into the venue on the red carpet of the \"Marcello Mio\" premiere at the Cannes Film Festival by a front-facing staffer at the event.\n\nMany deemed Rowland as angry for wagging her finger and frowning at a white woman, who was one of the security guards, for rushing her off the red carpet stairs and into the venue. Meanwhile, other celebrities of color on the red carpet did not receive the same treatment.\n\nThe Destiny's Child singer was quick to say that this was a blatant act of discrimination.\n\nBut in this case, with Williams, there is not enough information to examine what really happened.\n\nOne post said, \"Perhaps they don't want kids on the rooftop. More context is needed.\"\n\nThe Peninsula Paris, which has been named the best hotel in the city, has a rooftop restaurant and bar, L'Oiseau Blanc, which offers its patrons views of the city, according to the website.\n\nWhile hotels, in general, are family-friendly, policies regarding children in specific areas like the rooftop can vary. Typically, fine dining and bar areas may have restrictions or specific guidelines for young children.\n\nFor now, fans just know that one of the most decorated tennis players in the world was not allowed in.\n\nMany have already begun bombarding the European establishment with negative reviews on Google.\n\nOthers just encouraged Williams to \"support a Black-owned restaurant in Paris\" next time she's in Paris.\n\nThe hotel has not issued a statement on why she was not let in. But her supporters were ready to ride with her, declaring, \"Yup, there's no discrimination when it comes to racism.

But she and her children were turned away when trying to eat at the The Peninsula Paris hotel and it didn't sit well with Serena Williams who put the hotel on blast on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nSerena wrote: \"Yikes @peninsulaparis I've been denied access to rooftop to eat in a empty restaurant of nicer places \ud83e\udee0 but never with my kids. Always a first. \ud83d\ude44#Olympic2024\"\n\nCurrently, the cheapest rooms at The Peninsula Paris Hotel start at around $1,400/night. This is a luxury property and one that caters to the 1%. Meaning, if they were to make concessions for Serena Williams it would have possibly created a ripple effect of angry customers who got bumped.\n\nThat said, this is Paris we are talking about and they harbor downright contempt for Americans and they could have easily found room for a table for Serena Williams and her family and made it happen. Instead, they got called out on social media by Serena and the hotel has since issued an apology to her while calling her out for not telling the whole truth:\n\nSurely someone told her all of those tables were accounted for, right? Did they really need to clarify that?\n\nThat said... It's hard to imagine a world where Serena Williams brings her family there again. Paris, like the other world capitals, has no shortage of 5-star hotels with Michelin starred restaurants.\n\nAgain, this could have been entirely avoided if whoever was working simply set up another table for Serena and her kids. Instead, they have now issued a formal apology and are getting called out by the world press.

We may receive compensation when you click on links to those products. For an explanation of our Advertising Disclosure, visit this page.\n\nTennis superstar Serena Williams just tweeted that she and her kids were turned down at the rooftop restaurant of the Peninsula Paris, that had empty tables and it's causing quite a stir on social media.\n\nHer tweet was somewhat cryptic but many online are suggesting the incident was race-related and it's not clear if that's what Serena was alluding to, as well. However, the Peninsula Paris was quick to respond to her tweet with: \"Dear Mrs. Williams, Please accept our deepest apologies for the disappointment you encountered tonight. Unfortunately, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked and the only unoccupied tables you saw belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was fully reserved.\" Both tweets are embedded below.\n\nPersonally, I think it's just a misunderstanding, perhaps with a dash of Parisian attitude, which the locals are famous for (not the French people as a whole because out in the suburbs, they're warm and welcoming).\n\nHowever, it seems like Serena didn't ask about the empty tables she saw and/or the host didn't offer the gourmet restaurant as an alternative. If Serena was just looking to get food for her kids, then I would think they would have been happy with the alternative restaurant.\n\nI've been to restaurants before where something similar has happened, like this incident at the Duke's in Malibu. In fact, it also happened to me the other night, but I was able to talk our way in when I explained, \"I have two little kids and we're going to be quick!\" The hostess agreed and we were quick as promised so the restaurant was able to turn the tables around fast, which is the goal of most restaurant owners.\n\nUsers on social media had mixed feelings. Here are some of the tweets:\n\n@AlexNever347: You were denied access because they were serving prejudice. Shame on them.\n\n@Mo_Magoda: It doesn't matter how much money you have. Racism doesn't care bro \ud83e\udd23\n\n@Relatifise: I have seen first hand that black Africans regularly get denied access to rooftops in Paris. @serenawilliams, in Paris they have some of the best African cuisine in the world.

According to Serena, she was turned away from a rooftop table at the restaurant, which she mentioned was empty at the time.\n\nShe even made a post on X, voicing out the \"unfairness\" that she faced.\n\nHowever, the hotel took to social media to clarify the situation. They issued a dignified response, apologizing to Serena and explaining the circumstances. They claimed that the supposedly empty tables were actually reserved and that's why they had to deny Serena a dining spot.\n\nThis won over many tennis fans, who didn't side with Serena in this case.\n\nComments like \"entitled brat\" and \"spoiled\" were thrown around, with some fans feeling that Serena overreacted. A few did accuse the hotel of racism, but those claims didn't hold much weight.\n\nThe general consensus was that Serena didn't act appropriately and decided to slam the restaurant for just a minor inconvenience.\n\nMany fans also argued that the hotel didn't owe Serena an apology, especially not publicly, since they seemed to have handled the situation appropriately.\n\nThis incident feeds into a broader perception that Serena Williams can be arrogant at times. Critics often point to past controversies to back up this view.\n\nFor those who might not know, Simona Halep prevented Serena Williams from clinching her eighth Wimbledon title in 2019 by defeating her 6-2, 6-2 in the women's singles final. Williams, who retired after last year's US Open, now seems to be laying claim to her eighth Wimbledon title if Halep is stripped of her trophies due to her suspension.\n\nShe tweeted saying \"8 is a better number\", clearly hinting at her Wimbledon finals with Halep which she lost.\n\nMeanwhile, Williams' husband, Alexis Ohanian appeared to mock Simona Halep as well by sharing a throwback picture of himself wearing a D.A.R.E (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) t-shirt from 2019. Williams responded to the post, commenting, \"Seriously, not out of style.\"\n\nWhile Serena's incredible achievements in tennis are undeniable, these incidents have painted a picture of her that some fans find hard to ignore.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rishika_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rishika Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simona_Halep", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simona Halep"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Table tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Ohanian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Ohanian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Abuse_Resistance_Education", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug Abuse Resistance Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/0f59e36f-serena-williams-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792815", "eventUri": "eng-9792815", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Even during the Paris Olympics.\n\nJust look at Serena Williams' tweet from earlier this week: \"Yikes @peninsulaparis I've been denied access to rooftop to eat in a empty restaurant of nicer places but never with my kids,\" the tennis champion posted on X. \"Always a first.\"\n\nThe restaurant, for its part, offered statements to media outlets apologizing to Williams while claiming it was fully booked. It replied to her tweet: \"Please accept our deepest apologies for the disappointment you encountered tonight. Unfortunately, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked and the only unoccupied tables you saw belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was fully reserved.\"\n\nIt's unclear exactly what happened, though as is usually the case in incidents of this nature, people on both sides have weighed in. \"French racism is truly unique,\" one X user wrote, while others felt the restaurant was in the right: \"If they're booked, they're booked and it's entitled as heck to be upset that they didn't figure it out because 'I'm special.'\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Williams for comment; the restaurant contacted her directly.\n\nThis incident is in line with a greater trend we've seen in recent years: Venting on the internet has become the new way to complain. Instead of leaving a one-star Yelp review, or sharing a bad experience with family and friends, disgruntled customers can go on TikTok, go viral and go nuclear on a place - or person - they feel has wronged them.\n\nBe it a bakery, tattoo parlor, airline or bar, anyone can find themselves at the mercy of thousands of angry bandwagoners ready to carry out justice on an organization or person they don't know. It's that much more of a pile-on when the person making the assertion is famous themselves.\n\nExperts say this phenomenon is about more than an individual incident. It's about the urge to pick a side and a need to feel validated by others - even if they have no real connection to either party.\n\n\"Social media, especially TikTok, has democratized consumer reach,\" Chapman University adjunct communications professor Matthew Prince previously told USA TODAY. \"Whether you have 200 followers, or 2 million, consumers' content is going further than it ever has before. That reach comes with power.\"\n\n'A sense of powerlessness': Why people get the urge to seek revenge online\n\nThe internet, and especially TikTok in recent years, has taken venting to the next level. When we feel we've been given the short end of the stick, we seek out those who will tell us we're right, experts explain, and in viral posts, people are able to find thousands of people who will agree with them. Those following recent incidents - such as #CakeGate or #TattooGate - are enthralled by the drama, in part, because humans are hardwired to be social and take sides depending on who they most identify with. The same goes for Serena Williams and the Paris restaurant.\n\n\"When you feel like you are getting scammed, there's usually a sense of powerlessness,\" Andrea Bonior, a clinical psychologist and host of the \"Baggage Check: Mental Health Talk and Advice\" podcast, previously told USA TODAY. \"Posting about it often tries to reverse that: giving you validation when people agree that you were wronged.\" Yes, even celebrities can feel powerless, too. Human. Particularly if someone's identity feels attacked in some way.\n\nPeople on the internet often appreciate being able to connect with others in a shared frustration over an argument in which they've taken the same side.\n\nYou get it, right? Simone Biles' stunning Olympics gymnastics routines can be hard to watch. Here's why.\n\nBut does the punishment fit the crime?\n\nOf course, the punishment (hate from thousands of people) doesn't always fit the crime (denying someone a seat at a restaurant).\n\n\"It gives people a temporary escape from their own lives, allowing them to indulge in the thrill of someone else's conflict without actually being directly involved,\" crisis management and public relations expert Molly McPherson previously told USA TODAY. \"It taps into our innate desire for justice and our fascination with human conflict. It's like watching real-life reality television play out in front of our eyes, and people can't help but follow along in their feeds to see how it all unfolds.\"\n\nRemember this?

Even during the Paris Olympics.\n\nJust look at Serena Williams' tweet from earlier this week: \"Yikes @peninsulaparis I've been denied access to rooftop to eat in a empty restaurant of nicer places but never with my kids,\" the tennis champion posted on X. \"Always a first.\"\n\nThe restaurant, for its part, offered statements to media outlets apologizing to Williams while claiming it was fully booked. It replied to her tweet: \"Please accept our deepest apologies for the disappointment you encountered tonight. Unfortunately, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked and the only unoccupied tables you saw belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, which was fully reserved.\"\n\nIt's unclear exactly what happened, though as is usually the case in incidents of this nature, people on both sides have weighed in. \"French racism is truly unique,\" one X user wrote, while others felt the restaurant was in the right: \"If they're booked, they're booked and it's entitled as heck to be upset that they didn't figure it out because 'I'm special.'\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Williams and the restaurant for comment.\n\nThis incident is in line with a greater trend we've seen in recent years: Venting on the internet has become the new way to complain. Instead of leaving a one-star Yelp review, or sharing a bad experience with family and friends, disgruntled customers can go on TikTok, go viral and go nuclear on a place - or person - they feel has wronged them.\n\nBe it a bakery, tattoo parlor, airline or bar, anyone can find themselves at the mercy of thousands of angry bandwagoners ready to carry out justice on an organization or person they don't know. It's that much more of a pile-on when the person making the assertion is famous themselves.\n\nExperts say this phenomenon is about more than an individual incident. It's about the urge to pick a side and a need to feel validated by others - even if they have no real connection to either party.\n\n\"Social media, especially TikTok, has democratized consumer reach,\" Chapman University adjunct communications professor Matthew Prince previously told USA TODAY. \"Whether you have 200 followers, or 2 million, consumers' content is going further than it ever has before. That reach comes with power.\"\n\nThe internet, and especially TikTok in recent years, has taken venting to the next level. When we feel we've been given the short end of the stick, we seek out those who will tell us we're right, experts explain, and in viral posts, people are able to find thousands of people who will agree with them. Those following recent incidents - such as #CakeGate or #TattooGate - are enthralled by the drama, in part, because humans are hardwired to be social and take sides depending on who they most identify with. The same goes for Serena Williams and the Paris restaurant.\n\n\"When you feel like you are getting scammed, there's usually a sense of powerlessness,\" Andrea Bonior, a clinical psychologist and host of the \"Baggage Check: Mental Health Talk and Advice\" podcast, previously told USA TODAY. \"Posting about it often tries to reverse that: giving you validation when people agree that you were wronged.\" Yes, even celebrities can feel powerless, too. Human. Particularly if someone's identity feels attacked in some way.\n\nPeople on the internet often appreciate being able to connect with others in a shared frustration over an argument in which they've taken the same side.\n\nYou get it, right? Simone Biles' stunning Olympics gymnastics routines can be hard to watch. Here's why.\n\nOf course, the punishment (hate from thousands of people) doesn't always fit the crime (denying someone a seat at a restaurant).\n\n\"It gives people a temporary escape from their own lives, allowing them to indulge in the thrill of someone else's conflict without actually being directly involved,\" crisis management and public relations expert Molly McPherson previously told USA TODAY. \"It taps into our innate desire for justice and our fascination with human conflict. It's like watching real-life reality television play out in front of our eyes, and people can't help but follow along in their feeds to see how it all unfolds.\"\n\nRemember this? People online are fighting over a rainbow sprinkle cake. It's gotten out of hand.\n\n\"People have always been engaged by gossip and conflict,\" Gayle Stever, a professor of social and behavioral sciences at Empire State University of New York, previously said. \"In my mother's day, it was about the neighbors, and it would have been the cake shop down the road.

Harris has struggled to stay fit after sustaining a shoulder injury during a recent training camp.\n\nWhether she plays or not, she will be in Australia for the match, posting on Instagram that she is 'brb (be right back)' in Paris.\n\nWilliams also gained unwanted publicity in the French capital when she criticised a five-star hotel for denying her family access to a rooftop restaurant despite it being empty.\n\nSome have questioned whether Harris (pictured) should have gone to Paris at all, given that the AFL Women's season starts in three weeks and she is struggling to recover from a shoulder injury.\n\nThe 23-time Grand Slam winner went to X to complain about the treatment she received at The Peninsula Hotel on Monday.\n\n'Ouch,' Williams wrote.

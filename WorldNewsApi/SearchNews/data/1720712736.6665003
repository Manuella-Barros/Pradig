The Eras Tour sets Swift up to pull deep from her discography when she wants to, during her ever-changing acoustic section of the concert. Nearing her 100th show on the sprawling trek (Saturday night in Edinburgh, Scotland, was No. 98), the star got particularly unpredictable in her choice of surprise songs when she sat at the piano. First, on guitar, Swift debuted one of her newer songs live. She played \u201cThe Bolter,\u201d one of the last tracks on the Anthology edition of 2024\u2019s The Tortured Poets Department. A song in which she tells a story about how \u201chearts are hers for the breakin'\u201d and how there\u2019s \u201cescape in escaping,\u201d \u201cThe Bolter\u201d seamlessly pivoted to 2017\u2019s \u201cGetaway Car,\u201d from Reputation. Swift performing well thought-out mashups during the surprise song part of the Eras show has become customary on the international leg of The Eras Tour, ever since the singer announced her intention to \u201cbe as creative as possible with the acoustic set moving forward,\u201d back in February. Saturday night in Edinburgh, she followed the mashup of \u201cThe Bolter\u201d and \u201cGetaway Car\u201d with another song combo, this one more surprising than the first. On piano, she paired \u201cAll of the Girls You Loved Before,\u201d a one-off track she released from the vault of 2019\u2019s Lover, with a song Swift wasn\u2019t even sure her crowd would recognize: \u201cCrazier,\u201d found only on the soundtrack for the 2009 film Hannah Montana: The Movie. But the stadium had no problem recalling the swooping chorus of \u201cCrazier,\u201d and sang with her: \u201cYou lift my feet off the ground/ You spin me around/ You make me crazier, crazier/ Feels like I\u2019m fallin\u2019 and I am lost in your eyes/ You make me crazier, crazier, crazier.\u201d \u201cOh my god,\u201d Swift said, laughing at how many people knew the words.

Scaring you, your family, your friends. Don\u2019t be scared, just be prepared is our motto at Spectrum News 13, and it\u2019s a great way to prepare for any storm that may impact us. Dr. Deborah Beidel, a Professor of Psychology and the Executive Director of UCF Restores, has some advice on how to mentally prepare when handling the extreme hype of the upcoming season. \u201cWhat we find is that when people are worrying about uncertainty, because that\u2019s what this is, the best thing to do is try and plan and prepare,\u201d Beidel says. \u201cI think the best thing to do to parse through the information is to remember that although all these storms might happen, the probability of any one storm hitting us directly is always pretty low. It\u2019s not impossible, but it\u2019s low. So, we shouldn\u2019t think that we are going to be hit by 21 storms or whatever it may be.\u201d Planning itself can be stressful, but there are things you can do now to ease your mind including getting a list of items you should grab for a hurricane kit, stocking up on the appropriate amount of non-perishable food and water, and creating a to-do that includes preparations inside and outside of your home. \u201cOne thing people can do right now is start thinking about what things they might need to put aside in case they do have to leave their house,\u201d Beidel states. \u201cDo they know where insurance papers are? Are there medications they\u2019re going to need to take? So, putting aside the things they can now.\u201d Beidel explains, \u201cPeople often forget when they get stressed to do the things that help them feel better. So, if they exercise, they should find some time to exercise. They should prepare foods they might be able to use. They should make sure they have foods that are non-perishable just in case we lose electricity.\u201d And when it comes to kids, Beidel says there are many ways to prepare them mentally as well. \u201cI would have, if people can, a new toy, a new activity, a new game, something to engage their children. Keep them excited about something that\u2019s going on. Maybe have special hurricane snacks, particularly if children might, in advance, pick out what they might like to have during a hurricane camp out.\u201d During a hurricane, the key is to keep everyone preoccupied so they are not worried about the storm\u2019s potential impacts. \u201cTry and again decrease the focus on what\u2019s going on outside. Maybe play some music, maybe do some other things to kind of drown out some of that noise. And don\u2019t forget the pets too. I mean, an important thing for a child might be, \u2018look, for the next hour, let\u2019s teach Spot how to shake, right?\u2019 And so, engage the child with a beloved pet, and have them do something that will decrease their focus on what\u2019s going on outside.\u201d And once a storm moves out, take a deep breath, and focus on small tasks so you don\u2019t feel overwhelmed. \u201cThe thing to remember is that possessions can be replaced, people can\u2019t. Take a moment and realize that your family is safe. You may be displaced, but you\u2019re safe. The more we can portray that this is something that happens in Florida, but we always get through it, then I think we\u2019ll all be better off.\u201d Bryan Karrick is the chief meteorologist for Spectrum News 13, the Orlando Sentinel\u2019s television partner.", "summary": "Dr. Deborah Beidel, a Professor of Psychology and the Executive Director of UCF Restores, has some advice on how to mentally prepare when handling the extreme hype of the upcoming season.", "url": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2024/05/26/hurricane-season-2024-dont-be-scared-just-be-prepared-for-hurricane-season/", "image": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HurricaneIdaliaPrep19833.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:38:14", "author": "Bryan Karrick", "authors": ["Bryan Karrick"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.182}

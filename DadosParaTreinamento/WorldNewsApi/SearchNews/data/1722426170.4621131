{"id": 243303400, "title": "Union says Boeing penny-pinching has hurt supply chain", "text": "SEEKING \"SUBSTANTIAL\" RAISE In light of Boeing's current travails, the union wants to be able to bargain on any changes to quality management that could affect the production system. \"We never proposed those things in the past but it's our reputation, it's our jobs, it's our livelihoods,\" Holden said. Key demands include a \"substantial\" salary hike of at least 40 per cent, as well as provisions for healthcare, retirement and job security. Holden said a hefty wage hike is imperative after workers only received nominal cost-of-living support over the last eight years in spite of the \"massive inflation\" of recent years. The union is also seeking assurances from Boeing that it will build its next new aircraft - expected around 2035 - in the Seattle region. \"It's job security for the next 50 years,\" he said. At a congressional hearing earlier this month, Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun said that workers \"will definitely get a raise\". Holden said most of the major issues in the contract talks remain unresolved, meaning the two sides will be adding hours to upcoming negotiations. The IAM plans to take a vote on Jul 17 authorising a possible strike. To mark the event, it has rented T-Mobile Park in Seattle, the stadium for the Seattle Mariners baseball team, which holds up to 48,000. \"When we all participate in this important event, the factory will be quiet,\" the union said on its website. The current contract, in place for 16 years, expires at midnight on Sep 12. The union last called a strike in 2008 that lasted 57 days. During a media visit to the Renton plant organised by Boeing this week, an AFP reporter observed a boisterous union rally with representatives wearing IAM buttons and carrying signs as they marched through the plant in a show of solidarity. \"We have a very strong leverage right now and we're going to use it,\" said Holden. Boeing is currently engaged in talks to buy back Spirit AeroSystems, a supplier of the fuselage for the 737 MAX. The company was once part of Boeing before it was spun off in 2005. Holden welcomes the shift, saying it was \"foolish\" for Boeing to separate from Spirit, adding: \"It's important that they are healthy.\"", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/union-says-boeing-penny-pinching-has-hurt-supply-chain-4444806", "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--o34JnRC0--/c_crop,h_432,w_768,x_0,y_67/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/58087e90701bd81c76a8cd", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:01:23", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": 0.064}

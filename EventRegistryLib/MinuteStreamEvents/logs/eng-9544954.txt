Despite political upheaval, he emphasizes the alliance's development efforts and infrastructure projects as reasons for voter support. Shinde highlights improvements in connectivity, industry-friendliness, and job creation. He credits Prime Minister Modi's support and sees it as a continuation of Balasaheb Thackeray's legacy. Despite voter confusion caused by party splits, Shinde believes voters recognize the government's focus on public interest and service delivery.\n\nUnfazed by confusion over the split in two key parties and switchovers galore across all political forces, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde has exuded confidence that the ruling alliance is way ahead of the opposition bloc in Lok Sabha elections in the state and his single-point agenda is to achieve 'Mission-45' to help Prime Minister Narendra Modi reach his 400-plus target in the Lok Sabha elections.\n\nHe also said the voters are clear in their mind about whom to choose between someone who ran his government on Facebook Live while sitting at home or those who are working on the ground.\n\n''Nothing was happening during the previous government. The government led by Uddhav Thackeray was being run on Facebook Live. They were running the government while sitting at home. Can a government be run with the chief minister going to the secretariat for just two days?'' he alleged.\n\nMaharashtra has 48 Lok Sabha seats, the second highest after 80 in Uttar Pradesh, and the BJP-Shiv Sena-NCP alliance is targeting to win at least 45 of these seats in the ongoing polls. BJP is contesting on 28 seats, Shiv Sena on 15, Ajit Pawar-led NCP has got four and one seat has gone to Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (RSP).\n\nIn an exclusive interview with PTI here at his residence, Shinde said people of Maharashtra are voting for the ruling alliance because of its good work, completion of several long-stalled projects and large-scale job creation, among other factors.\n\nIn the 2019 elections, the BJP got 23 seats, the then Shiv Sena got 18 and NCP got four seats. Of these, five Shiv Sena MPs are now with the faction led by Uddhav Thackeray, while the Shinde-led Sena is now in 'Mahayuti' ruling alliance with BJP, and so is Ajit Pawar-led NCP.\n\nThe opposition alliance now mainly comprises Sena's Uddhav Thackeray faction, Sharad Pawar faction of NCP and the Congress.\n\n''We are seeing very good trends. In the initial phases of voting, our Mahayuti alliance has taken a strong lead and it will definitely get a lot more seats than others. This has happened because of the development that has taken place in our two years of government, the work we have done and the number of infrastructure projects that we have started to make Maharashtra the top state in terms of infrastructure projects,'' Shinde said.\n\nHe listed various connectivity and road projects, including Atal Setu, the Nagpur-Mumbai project named after Balasaheb Thackeray, and metro projects inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n''Large-size infrastructure projects that were stalled, all of those have resumed. Work is happening all around. Various schemes have been launched by our government for farmers, women, youth and senior citizens among others.\n\n''Several industries are coming here and Maharashtra is becoming their top priority choice. We have emerged as an industry-friendly state and people are reposing trust in us. This will generate employment on a large scale. It's because of all this work that people are voting for us and they will vote for us in the rest of the phases also,'' Shinde said.\n\nAsked what the prime minister has told him about his vision for Maharashtra and his expectations from the state government, Shinde said, ''He (Modi) loves Maharashtra a lot. He always supports us on our development agenda.'' ''The double engine government of the Centre and state is working very well here. All our proposals, be it of railways, roads, urban development or irrigation, PM Modi is helping us a lot. He says there is a lot of potential for development in Maharashtra and we should work on that and the Centre will extend full support,'' the chief minister added.\n\nShinde said it is the general public that benefits the most from ''this whole-hearted support for Maharashtra from PM Modi'' and therefore people are very happy, more so after they saw everything getting stalled during the earlier government.\n\nAsked how he is taking forward Balasaheb Thackeray's legacy after being recognised as the real Shiv Sena, Shinde said it is being done through the development of the state.\n\n''Our government is the one that has been formed for the general public. When elections happened in 2019, the people's mandate was for the BJP-Shiv Sena government. But they abandoned the ideology of Balasaheb Thackeray for the greed of the chief minister's chair.\n\n''We are now taking forward Balasaheb's ideology and that forms the foundation of this government. We got full support from our prime minister and Union home minister. The work we are doing, so many major schemes we have launched, development is the main agenda for all of that and that is the real agenda of Shiv Sena and that is what Balasaheb had dreamed of,'' he added.\n\nAsked whether the voters in the state were confused, Shinde said, ''Voters have complete clarity in their mind. They know that ours is a government that takes decisions in the public's interest.'' Giving examples, he said his government has brought out 122 irrigation-related schemes in two years, while the previous government could do just two in two-and-a-half years.\n\n''That's the difference and people know that. Our government goes to the doorsteps of the people. Government at your doorstep is our policy,'' he added.\n\nShinde said there were beneficiary schemes earlier too but people were not getting the benefits because the leaders used to cut the ribbon and leave the project or scheme midway.\n\n''We decided to put all benefits under one roof. That's the difference. Who will people support, those who do the work or those who sit at home, those doing Facebook Live or those hitting the ground?'' he quipped in an apparent attack on Uddhav Thackeray.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eknath_Shinde", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eknath Shinde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Congress_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nationalist Congress Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Sena", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shiv Sena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uddhav_Thackeray", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uddhav Thackeray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal_Thackeray", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bal Thackeray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indian_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2019 Indian general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtriya_Samaj_Paksha", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rashtriya Samaj Paksha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharad_Pawar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sharad Pawar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Socialist_Party_(India)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_16_57_14_7140931.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544954", "eventUri": "eng-9544954", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The government led by Uddhav Thackeray was being run on Facebook Live. They were running the government while sitting at home. Can a government be run with the chief minister going to the secretariat for just two days?\" he alleged.\n\nMaharashtra has 48 Lok Sabha seats, the second highest after 80 in Uttar Pradesh, and the BJP-Shiv Sena-NCP alliance is targeting to win at least 45 of these seats in the ongoing polls. BJP is contesting on 28 seats, Shiv Sena on 15, Ajit Pawar-led NCP has got four and one seat has gone to Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (RSP).\n\nIn an exclusive interview with PTI here at his residence, Shinde said people of Maharashtra are voting for the ruling alliance because of its good work, completion of several long-stalled projects and large-scale job creation, among other factors.\n\nIn the 2019 elections, the BJP got 23 seats, the then Shiv Sena got 18 and NCP got four seats. Of these, five Shiv Sena MPs are now with the faction led by Uddhav Thackeray, while the Shinde-led Sena is now in 'Mahayuti' ruling alliance with BJP, and so is Ajit Pawar-led NCP.\n\nThe opposition alliance now mainly comprises Sena's Uddhav Thackeray faction, Sharad Pawar faction of NCP and the Congress.\n\n\"We are seeing very good trends. In the initial phases of voting, our Mahayuti alliance has taken a strong lead and it will definitely get a lot more seats than others. This has happened because of the development that has taken place in our two years of government, the work we have done and the number of infrastructure projects that we have started to make Maharashtra the top state in terms of infrastructure projects,\" Shinde said.\n\nHe listed various connectivity and road projects, including Atal Setu, the Nagpur-Mumbai project named after Balasaheb Thackeray, and metro projects inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"Large-size infrastructure projects that were stalled, all of those have resumed. Work is happening all around. Various schemes have been launched by our government for farmers, women, youth and senior citizens among others.\n\n\"Several industries are coming here and Maharashtra is becoming their top priority choice. We have emerged as an industry-friendly state and people are reposing trust in us. This will generate employment on a large scale. It's because of all this work that people are voting for us and they will vote for us in the rest of the phases also,\" Shinde said.\n\nAsked what the prime minister has told him about his vision for Maharashtra and his expectations from the state government, Shinde said, \"He (Modi) loves Maharashtra a lot. He always supports us on our development agenda.\" \"The double engine government of the Centre and state is working very well here. All our proposals, be it of railways, roads, urban development or irrigation, PM Modi is helping us a lot. He says there is a lot of potential for development in Maharashtra and we should work on that and the Centre will extend full support,\" the chief minister added.\n\nShinde said it is the general public that benefits the most from \"this whole-hearted support for Maharashtra from PM Modi\" and therefore people are very happy, more so after they saw everything getting stalled during the earlier government.\n\nAsked how he is taking forward Balasaheb Thackeray's legacy after being recognised as the real Shiv Sena, Shinde said it is being done through the development of the state.\n\n\"Our government is the one that has been formed for the general public. When elections happened in 2019, the people's mandate was for the BJP-Shiv Sena government. But they abandoned the ideology of Balasaheb Thackeray for the greed of the chief minister's chair.\n\n\"We are now taking forward Balasaheb's ideology and that forms the foundation of this government. We got full support from our prime minister and Union home minister. The work we are doing, so many major schemes we have launched, development is the main agenda for all of that and that is the real agenda of Shiv Sena and that is what Balasaheb had dreamed of,\" he added.\n\nAsked whether the voters in the state were confused, Shinde said, \"Voters have complete clarity in their mind. They know that ours is a government that takes decisions in the public's interest.\" Giving examples, he said his government has brought out 122 irrigation-related schemes in two years, while the previous government could do just two in two-and-a-half years.\n\n\"That's the difference and people know that. Our government goes to the doorsteps of the people. Government at your doorstep is our policy,\" he added.\n\nShinde said there were beneficiary schemes earlier too but people were not getting the benefits because the leaders used to cut the ribbon and leave the project or scheme midway.\n\n\"We decided to put all benefits under one roof. That's the difference. Who will people support, those who do the work or those who sit at home, those doing Facebook Live or those hitting the ground?\" he quipped in an apparent attack on Uddhav Thackeray.

Pic/Sameer Markande\n\nThe Thane, Kalyan, Bhiwandi and Palghar Lok Sabha constituencies, which are part of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, will see the Maha Vikas Aghadi and Mahayuti butting heads. The Thane seat, once considered a Matoshree stronghold, mainly comprises the urban area of Thane district -- the base of the Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, Navi Mumbai and Mira-Bhayandar while the Bhiwandi and Palghar constituencies include urban and rural parts of the Thane and Palghar districts and the Kalyan Lok Sabha seat comprises urban and semi-urban areas.\n\nIt will be challenging for Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray to make inroads into the Thane and Palghar districts as most former corporators and MLAs from these areas sided with the Shinde faction after the split in the Shiv Sena.\n\nPolitical landscape\n\nThis constituency will see a direct fight play out between Thackeray and Shinde whose respective blue-eyed boys, Rajan Vichare and Naresh Mhaske, are vying for power.\n\nThe Thane Lok Sabha constituency comprises six Vidhan Sabha segments, most of which are represented by Shiv Sena and BJP legislators. Shinde and fellow Sainik Pratap Sarnaik are the MLAs of Kopri-Pachpakhadi and Ovala-Majiwada respectively while the Thane, Airoli and Belapur segments are represented by BJP's Sanjay Kelkar, Ganesh and Manda Mhatre. Geeta Jain, an Independent who is supporting the Shinde Sena, is the Mira Bhayandar MLA.\n\nPrevious victors\n\nVichare has been the incumbent since the 2014 general election where he defeated Sanjeev Naik, a former NCP MP, by 2.81 lakh votes. In 2019, he secured 7.40 lakh votes, besting NCP's Anand Paranjpe, whose tally was 4.12 lakh votes.\n\nConstituency and concerns\n\nWhile Navi Mumbai is renowned as a planned city, Thane and Mira Bhayandar are plagued by illegal constructions and hawkers as well as transport, water supply and solid waste management issues. Navi Mumbai facing issues such as encroachment and lacks a proper internal transport system.\n\nRajan Vichare, Shiv Sena (UBT)\n\nA former mayor and MLA, the two-time MP became the face of the Thackeray faction in Thane following the split in the party. Vichare started his political career alongside Shinde under the leadership of the late Shiv Sena leader Anand Dighe.\n\nDeclared wealth\n\nMovable assets: Rs 3.73 crore\n\nImmovable assets: Rs 26 crore\n\nNaresh Mhaske, Shiv Sena\n\nA former mayor of Thane and two-time corporator, Mhaske is known as the blue-eyed boy of Shinde. He is the Thane district head of the party. The post, once occupied by Dighe and Shinde, is among the most prestigious ones in the Shiv Sena. He is also a spokesperson for the Shinde faction.\n\nDeclared wealth\n\nMovable assets: Rs 10.26 crore\n\nImmovable assets: Rs 21.08 crore\n\nPolitical landscape\n\nDr Shrikant Shinde, the chief minister's son and a two-time MP, is contesting this seat for the third consecutive time. Now, he is up against former corporator Vaishali Darekar of the Shiv Sena (UBT).\n\nInitially, it seemed that, apart from the Opposition, Mahayuti ally, the BJP, was not in favour of Shrikant Shinde as BJP MLA Ganpat Gaikwad opened fire on Shiv Sena city head Mahesh Gaikwad inside a police station earlier this year.\n\nOf the six Assembly seats here, four are with the Mahayuti. MNS's Pramod Patil is MLA of the Kalyan Rural segment. Mumbra Kalwa MLA Jitendra Awhad belongs to the NCP (SP). The Ulhasnagar, Kalyan East and Dombivli segments are represented by BJP's Kumar Ailani, Ganpat Gaikwad and Ravindra Chavan. As the party holds sway in the constituency, party workers had demanded that its candidate be fielded from here. However, it was Shinde who was picked as the Mahayuti candidate.\n\nPrevious victors\n\nSince the formation of the constituency in 2009, Shiv Sena won it thrice. In 2014, Dr Shinde defeated former Shiv Sena MP Anand Paranjpe, who was contesting on an NCP ticket. Dr Shinde got 4.40 lakh votes as opposed to Paranjape's 1.90 lakh. In 2019, Dr Shinde defeated Babaji Patil, the NCP by 3.44 lakh votes.\n\nConstituency and concerns\n\nKalyan, which comprises urban and semi-urban areas, mainly faces issues involving water supply, solid waste management, illegal construction and sanitation. Public transport is problematic while Kalyan and Dombivli are plagued by traffic congestion. Citizens also mainly depend on Mumbai and Thane for medical treatment.\n\nDr Shrikant Shinde, Shiv Sena\n\nDr Shinde is seen as the educated face of the Shiv Sena. The two-time MP is well-connected to Delhi circles as well as high-ranking government officials in Maharashtra. He started taking participating heavily in the party's internal politics after the split.\n\nDeclared wealth\n\nMovable assets: Rs 8.15 crore\n\nImmovable assets: Rs 6.77 crore\n\nVaishali Darekar, Shiv Sena (UBT)\n\nThe two-time Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation councillor was elected as a corporator for the first time in 2005. She later joined the MNS and was elected as its corporator in 2010. She also contested the 2009 Lok Sabha election as the MNS's candidate. She secured 1.02 lakh votes. Recently, she is known for taking an aggressive stance against the chief minister.\n\nDeclared wealth\n\nMovable assets: Rs 1.18 crore\n\nImmovable assets: Rs 5.06 crore\n\nPolitical landscape\n\nOnce a famous textile hub, Bhiwandi is now emerging a prominent chemical and goods transport hub. This constituency has been dominated by BJP for a decade with its two-time MP, and Union minister, Kapil Patil, being fielded yet again. The seat was mainly associated with the Congress, but the NCP (SP) gained it during seat sharing. The grand old party's workers are still upset about this.\n\nFive out of six MLAs representing Bhiwandi's Assembly segments belong to the Mahayuti. One seat, Bhiwandi East, is held by the Samajwadi Party.\n\nPrevious victors\n\nThis constituency first existed as a parliamentary seat from 1962 to 1971. Congress was dominant then. It came into existence again in 2009. Suresh Taware of the Congress won the general election that year against BJP's Jagannath Patil. In the next two Lok Sabha polls, Kapil Patil defeated Congress's Vishwanath Patil and Taware by 1.1 lakh votes and 1.56 lakh votes respectively.\n\nConstituency and concerns\n\nBhiwandi lacks adequate medical infrastructure and internal public transport. Apart from the proliferation of illegal constructions, air pollution due to chemical plants, obtaining drinking water and sanitation are challenges. Bhiwandi is at the crossroads between North and Western Maharashtra and Gujarat, making it an ideal goods transport junction. But due to ill planning, advantage isn't being taken of its location.\n\nKapil Patil, BJP\n\nThe Union Minister of State in the Ministry of Panchayati Raj had jumped to the BJP from the NCP in 2014. He was chairman of the Thane district co-operative bank. He also had a stint as the president of the Thane zilla parishad.\n\nSuresh Mhatre, NCP (SP)\n\nPopularly referred to as Balya Mama, this leader is known for party hopping. He began his political career in the Shiv Sena. He was elected as a zilla parishad member. In 2014, he contested the Lok Sabha election on an MNS ticket, securing 93,000 votes. Later, he won the zilla parishad election again. He demanded a Congress ticket for the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Though NCP patriarch Sharad Pawar supported him, the grand old party denied him one. He then joined NCP, working as the party's district president. After the split in the Shiv Sena, Mhatre joined the Shinde-led faction before finally becoming an NCP (SP) member.\n\nDeclared wealth\n\nMovable assets: Rs 60.42 crore\n\nImmovable assets: Rs 46.62 crore\n\nPolitical landscape\n\nThis geographically diverse district was formed in 2014 after being separated from the Thane district. It includes the Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation. The Bahujan Vikas Aaghadi (BVA) holds sway over the seat, which was part of the Mumbai North constituency before 2009. Three of the seat's six MLAs belong to the BVA: party president Hitendra Thakur, his son Kshitij Thakur and Rajesh Patil.\n\nIn 2018, Rajendra Gavit, the tribal development minister in the then-Congress-NCP government, joined the BJP and contested a Lok Sabha by-poll necessitated by the death of the BJP MP Chintaman Vanaga, who came to power in 2014. The next year, undivided Shiv Sena got this seat and Gavit contested as its candidate and won the election.\n\nPrevious victors\n\nIn 2014, Vanaga defeated BVA's Baliram Jadhav. The former secured 5.33 lakh votes while the latter got 2.93 lakh. After Vanaga's death, Gavit secured 2.72 lakh votes in the by-poll. Vanaga's son Shrinivas contested the election as the Shiv Sena candidate as the BJP denied him a ticket. In 2019, Gavit contested the election as Shiv Sena candidate and secured 5.15 lakh votes while his rival, Baliram Jadhav of the BVA, secured 4.91 lakh votes.\n\nConstituency and concerns\n\nThe Palghar district has water and public transport issues. The water problem is more severe in the eastern part. There is opposition to the two projects, the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project and the Vadhavan Port. Although there is diversity such as beaches and forests, adequate tourist facilities have not been developed. Declining fisherman income is another big problem.\n\nBharti Kamdi, Shiv Sena (UBT)\n\nAfter losing the first Palghar Municipal Council election in 1999, she was elected twice as a member of the Palghar zilla parishad. She worked as president of the organisation for more than a year. After the Sena split, she supported Thackeray.\n\nDr Hemant Savara, BJP\n\nThe son of former minister Vishnu Savara, he fought his first Vidhan Sabha election from Vikramgad constituency in 2019 but was defeated.\n\nRajesh Patil, BVA\n\nThe Boisar MLA, who is contesting on Bahujan Vikas Aaghadi ticket is considered the educated face of the rural party headed by Hitendra Thakur.\n\nDeclared wealth\n\nMovable assets: Rs 2.88 crore\n\nImmovable assets: Rs 7.51 crore", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

When asked for more information, Shinde remained cryptic, reported IANS.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe IANS report stated that Raut emphasised that Shinde's fear of imprisonment influenced political actions, particularly the schism within the Shiv Sena that resulted in Uddhav Thackeray's dismissal as CM of the Maha Vikas Aghadi.\n\n\"On June 14, 2022, Shinde spoke with me, saying that 'it would be better to join the BJP and PM Narendra Modi'. He said he was not keen on going to jail,\" claimed Sanjay Raut.\n\nAccording to the IANS report, Raut, while referring to the vertical split in Shiv Sena in June 2022 which toppled the Maha Vikas Aghadi government led by Uddhav Thackeray, said, \"When I said that the ED-CBI will not just start probing unless they have something in hand, he did not specify...; and all the political developments followed.\"\n\nVichare revealed Shinde's history of attempting to switch parties, citing a failed attempt in 2013 when he planned to defect to the Congress with four Shiv Sena MLAs. Despite previous failures, Shinde succeeded in splitting Shiv Sena after ten years, the IANS report added.\n\n\"However, at the last minute, the four SS legislators reneged and the plan collapsed.

The plan also included inducting 25 BJP MLAs into the Sena, which eventually turned against them.\n\nShinde was addressing his Mahayuti workers in Thane, where he disclosed a few lesser-known incidents that triggered his rebellion.\n\n\"I was being systematically targeted and sidelined in my party (undivided Sena) and attempts were also made to implicate me in false cases. I was the guardian minister of the Naxal-hit Gadchiroli district but despite threats I never got any support from my CM and my plans to do some constructive work there was met with opposition,\" Shinde said.\n\nThe CM mentioned that the thought of rebellion germinated as he could not bear to see the morale of Sainiks and Sena MLAs being trampled upon in the coalition. Operating without funds and administrative assistance was difficult, he said. He had shared his experiences with his wife, Lata, who was also stunned.\n\nShinde said the real shock came when he was informed about the coup being planned against the BJP.\n\n\"They (MVA) had plans to arrest prominent leaders including Devendra Fadnavis, his close relatives, Girish Mahajan among others which would weaken the state BJP and then induct their 25 MLAs into the MVA. I was worried if this would upset my plans of rebellion but the almighty probably had something else in mind. Our decision to rebel was cemented after he (Uddhav Thackeray) passed some veiled uncharitable remarks at us during the party foundation day in 2022 which was followed by humiliation during the Vidhan Parishad elections. Apparently, they made the mistake of taking me lightly,\" he said.\n\nShinde, who was in touch with Devendra Fadnavis during his rebellion, also mentioned how he was supported by BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, who stood behind him. \"After we rebelled, I told them (BJP) that I have done my work and now you have to takeover... Subsequently, we got the Shiv Sena party and its symbol (bow and arrow),\" he said.\n\nLaunching a frontal attack on the UBT, Shinde questioned whether Uddhav had the moral right to call him a traitor, as he (Uddhav) was the one who deserted the principles of Balasaheb in 2019 for the sake of the CM post.\n\n\"In hindsight, it seems all his excuses and allegations on the BJP were pre-planned as he apparently wanted to stay on the CM post for five years. After we got the party name and symbol, all that they hankered after was the Rs 50 cr bank balance... They joined hands with the Congress and recently announced of voting for the party here. If Balasaheb was alive, he would have 'thrashed' them...,\" Shinde said.\n\nSpeaking about the Mahayuti alliance in the district, he said people are with him and are extending full support to Naresh Mhaske.\n\n\"Initially, there were issues, but now all the parties and their leaders including Ganesh Naik, Manda Mhatre and the MNS are working for electing Narendra Modi as the PM. The position of our country strengthened globally during Modi's regime and our country deserves a dashing personality like him to lead us to more success,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "manoj_badgeri@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Manoj Badgeri", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maha_Vikas_Aghadi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maha Vikas Aghadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devendra_Fadnavis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Devendra Fadnavis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thane", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girish_Mahajan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Girish Mahajan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eknath_Shinde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eknath Shinde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadchiroli_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gadchiroli district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uddhav_Thackeray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uddhav Thackeray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manda_Vijay_Mhatre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manda Vijay Mhatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesh_Naik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ganesh Naik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra_Navnirman_Sena", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra Navnirman Sena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Sena", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shiv Sena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109905108,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-17342,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544954", "eventUri": "eng-9544954", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

I told them nothing will come out of it. It will only delay and cause cost escalation. They wanted to put five leaders in prison in which Fadnavis's name was also there,\" Shinde alleged.\n\nShinde further claimed that after the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly poll results, he advised Thackeray about continuing the coalition with the BJP, but the latter refused.\n\n\"They wanted 20-25 MLAs from BJP to join MVA. I didn't make the wrong decision by coming out of MVA. They ditched the BJP in 2019. After the result, they said all the doors were open. Five times I explained to him (Uddhav Thackeray) that we should go with BJP. He asked if BJP would remove Kirit Somaiya and Narayan Rane from the party,\" Shinde added.\n\nAsking his party workers and office bearers to campaign for the BJP candidates with full force, Shinde said that he would analyse the performance of leaders based on the votes the party gets in different areas to decide on tickets in the upcoming civic body polls. Shinde said that he would promote the party leaders who ensure good party performance in their areas in the Lok Sabha polls.\n\n\"Due to electronic voting machines (EVMs), we get to know how many votes we got in which area. After the Lok Sabha elections, there is a civic body election. In areas where there was a lead, those office bearers and workers would get tickets. It's the same for MLAs. I will give promotion to those who do well in this election,\" Shinde said.\n\nPolling for 11 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra will be held on Tuesday with the spotlight firmly on the high-stakes battle in Baramati.\n\nPolling in these constituencies, spread across western Maharashtra, Konkan and Marathwada regions, will begin at 7 am and end at 6 pm at more than 23,000 polling centres set up for the third phase of the general elections.\n\nThe seats where polling will take place on May 7 are Baramati, Raigad, Osmanabad, Latur (SC), Solapur, Madha, Sangli, Satara,

Dr Shrikant is contesting for the third time in parliamentary polls. Shiv Sena UBT has fielded Vaishali Darekar Rane, a former corporator.\n\nCivic infrastructure and connectivity to Mumbai are key issues in the constituency. Kalyan, Dombivali, Ambernath, Ulhasnagar and Mumbra-Kalwa are satellite towns of Mumbai. They are alternatives to high priced real estate in the city, but lag way behind Mumbai in living conditions including in facilitating the commute to Mumbai for work.\n\nThe six assembly constituents in Kalyan are Ulhasnagar, Ambernath, Kalyan East, Dombivali, Kalyan Rural and Mumbra Kalwa.\n\nAmong these, only Mumbra - Kalwa is with the NCP (SP) and is represented by Jitendra Awhad. Ambernath is held by Shiv Sena while Ulhasnagar, Kalyan East and Dombivali are with BJP and Kalyan Rural is with MNS. Most Sainiks went with Eknath Shinde during the 2022 split with only a few staying with Uddhav.\n\nEknath Shinde considers Thane district his karmabhoomi. He has much influence and controls the party organisation in the cities in Thane district as well.\n\nThe Mahayuti alliance has not been smooth here. Workers of Shinde's Shiv Sena and BJP have often tangled with each other here. In early February, Mahesh Gaikwad, Shiv Sena's boss in Kalyan, was shot at by Ganpat Gaikwad, who is Mahesh's cousin and BJP MLA of Kalyan East.\n\nMahesh Gaikwad survived the attack and recovered, but the police sent Ganpat Gaikwad to Taloja jail. In the wake of this, the Kalyan East unit of BJP met several times and decided not to work for Shinde's Sena during elections. But Eknath Shinde looped in Devendra Fadnavis who personally announced Shrikant's candidature before any official announcement. It was a signal to local BJP workers to fall in line. Fadnavis asked the Kalyan city chief Nana Suryavanshi to patch up.\n\nGanpat Gaikwad's wife Sulbha has been recalcitrant. She was seen with UBT's Vaishali Darekar Rane in the Gudi Padwa shobha yatra as well as on the campaign vehicle of Shiv Sena (UBT).\n\nShrikant Shinde brushed aside these issues. \"I don't see any problem for me anywhere including Kalyan East. I will get elected by a margin of over five lakh.'' The local BJP unit in Kalyan wanted the seat for the BJP as once the seat was held by BJP's Ram Kapse and was surrendered to the Shiv Sena because Bal Thackeray insisted.\n\nNana Suryavanshi, the Kalyan chief of BJP, said, \"There are two sides to any coin. Our workers wanted the seat as it was with us in the past. Now we all will work together as we want PM Narendra Modi to come back as prime minister.\"\n\nOne of the constituencies in Kalyan is held by Pramod Patil of MNS. The Shiv Sena was not sure which way these votes will swing, but with the MNS supporting the NDA, Shinde may not need to worry. When the third phase ends, Eknath Shinde is expected to shift gears to Thane.\n\nThe Shiv Sena UBT candidate Vaishali Darekar Rane said: \"I had no inkling that I will be made the candidate. A few minutes before my candidature was announced, I got a call from Uddhavji that I would be the candidate. Before I could even think, the TV channels were flashing my name. I may not have money like how Shindes have, but people are with me. My candidature has been declared early and I have enough time to campaign,\" she said. Darekar Rane says that Rashmi Thackeray, Uddhav's wife who hails from Dombivali, will campaign for her.\n\nDarekar Rane is a two-time corporator. She is originally from Shiv Sena and had a brief stint before returning. She said that only leaders have gone away with Shinde and the masses are still with Uddhav. The party had considered Kedar Dighe (nephew of Anand Dighe) but she was chosen because she was a woman, she says.\n\nOne of the main issues in this constituency is the commute within the area and to Mumbai. Seema Pagey, a resident of Dombivali and lawyer, said: \"There is rapid urbanisation in this area and facilities are inadequate. Our cities need better city buses and metro connectivity. We also need a good hospital and the need was acutely felt during the pandemic. We need much better frequency of trains and Kalyan must be railway terminal.\"\n\nShrikant Shinde says that he has brought many infra projects such as a tunnel and new road to Mumbai, metro and elevated road on Mumbai bypass. He said he has introduced many corridors on the railway system and Kalyan railway yard is also being remodelled.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan

Patil, in Ghatkopar late on Wednesday, Chaturvedi slammed CM Shinde and his son Shrikant Shinde, who is eyeing a hat-trick from the Kalyan Lok Sabha seat in the adjoining Thane district.\n\n\"Who are you Eknath Shinde? What are you? You are nothing but a 'gaddar' (traitor),\" Chaturvedi said, reminding the gathering of the split in the undivided Shiv Sena in June 2022.\n\nChaturvedi continued: \"Whatever you do, you cannot escape the 'gaddar' taint... It will haunt even your family, as in the film 'Deewar' (1975).\"\n\nShe was referring to the famous dialogue by Amitabh Bachchan to his brother Shashi Kapoor in the film, pointing out how some goons had tattooed 'Mera Baap Chor Hai' on his arm.\n\n\"In the same manner, the CM's son, Shrikant Shinde, will always carry the burden. 'Mera Baap Gaddar Hain' is written on his forehead and he cannot escape the consequences,\" Chaturvedi said amid thunderous applause.\n\nThe reference was to the unprecedented revolt in June 2022 when the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by then CM Uddhav Thackeray was toppled and Eknath Shinde hopped onto the CM's seat with BJP's support.\n\nTaking more potshots, she said the MVA is poised for a huge victory all over Maharashtra and it's the \"people's fight versus the ruling MahaJhoothi alliance\".\n\nThe MahaYuti alliance hit back on Thursday with Shiv Sena deputy leader Sanjay Nirupam, spokespersons Sheetal Mhatre and Sanjay Shirsat, and BJP's Nitesh Rane attacking her for the filmy jibe.\n\nCalling it a highly inappropriate statement coming from a woman MP of the SS (UBT), Nirupam claimed it was Uddhav Thackeray who became a 'Maha Gaddar' after he betrayed the BJP to join the MVA partners Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (in October 2019).\n\n\"If she truly believes her statement, then Aditya Thackeray's forehead should say 'Mera Baap Maha-Gaddar Hai'. His father had committed a treachery of Balasaheb Thackeray's ideals by joining hands with the Congress, which the former opposed all his life,\" Nirupam said.\n\nWarning that she would be compelled to reveal certain things about SS (UBT) leaders like Aditya Thackeray in Davos (Switzerland), Mhatre asked Chaturvedi to mind her language when speaking about the Chief Minister.\n\nShirsat said that if needed, he could also give an appropriate reply to Chaturvedi but he was restraining himself as he did not want to be accused of attacking a woman MP, but said that she must exercise restraint.\n\nRane called Chaturvedi's statement 'nonsense' and asked whether it was appropriate to use such language about someone's father from a public platform.\n\n\"What if the MahaYuti leaders speak something like this about the Thackerays? Will it be acceptable to Chaturvedi if something is said about her father,\" Rane asked.\n\nIn a supportive tone, SS (UBT)'s leader of opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Council, Ambadas Danve, said that \"he (Shinde) is a 'gaddar', so what's wrong in calling him a traitor\".\n\nIncidentally, Sanjay Patil, an ex-MP, is pitted against the MahaYuti-BJP's newcomer Mihir C.

Sharad Pawar's latest statement means he is unable to run his party and, therefore, wants to merge it with Congress,\" said Fadnavis.\n\nState BJP president Chandrashekhar Bawankule too said Sharad Pawar will have no option but to merge his party with Congress.\n\nBawankule, while interacting with the media in Pune, said \"If you look at Pawar's decision-making since 1977, he has done similar things in the past. He forms a new party and later merges it with another party. When he realizes that his party does not have a bright future, he merges with another one. He will do the same after June 4.\"\n\n\"What other option is he (Pawar) left with? He already knows that Supriya Sule is losing the election. After June 4, all the three major parties in MVA will be utterly disappointed,\" Bawankule said.\n\nPawar, in an interview to an English daily, had said that after the election, regional parties will move closer to Congress, and some could merge with it. He added that there is no difference between Congress and NCP (SCP).", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In a nostalgic turn, a bunch of 70- and 80-plus former Shiv Sainiks have regrouped to form the Jestha Shiv Sainik Kaksh (Senior Shiv Sena Wing) at Sena Bhavan in Dadar. The seniors are urging people to rally behind the \"authentic\" Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray in order to save \"democracy and the Constitution\".\n\nThe group's inaugural meeting took place in October 2022 at Miranda Wadi in Shivaji Park, four months after Eknath Shinde defected with a bunch of MLAs to join hands with the BJP. \"Our strategy is to reach out to as many people as we can,\" said Vishwanath Khatate (76), who chairs the wing and gave the first call to all elderly Shiv Sainiks in 2022. \"We are getting in touch with all our old party workers and their families and friends, making them aware of what is happening right now and how we need to be vigilant while casting our vote.\"\n\nEmphasising the party's original mission in 1966 to safeguard the rights of the Marathi manus (Marathi people), the group contends that this cause has once again become relevant on account of the \"threat to the existence of Marathi people in their own city and state\". \"In Modi's era, history is being repeated,\" said Khatate. \"They are taking everything to Gujarat. Modi only wants Gujaratis, Marwaris and Rajasthanis. We have come together to fight for the rights of the Marathi manus.\"\n\nThe 2022 meeting was attended by nearly 100 Shiv Sainiks, who had been with the party since its inception and early days. Shyaam Naidu (71), who served Bal Thackeray for 40 years, said, \"He used to like telling people that his bodyguards -- me and my brother Manohar -- were South Indian. For him, anyone born in Maharashtra was a son of the soil, and he never pinned down anyone's identity as Muslim or South Indian. Balasaheb's Hindutva was that if a person, irrespective of their religion or caste, loved his country, Maharashtra and Mumbai, they were his own people. That was his stand till his death, and so is Uddhav Thackeray's.\"\n\nKhatate quoted a line from the Maharashtra state song 'Jai jai Maharashtra maajha': 'Dilli chi takth rakhito Maharashtra maajha (Maharashtra is safeguarding the throne of Delhi)'. \"The leaders in Delhi seem to have a grudge against this line,\" he said. \"They have kicked the Constitution and are hell-bent on destroying Maharashtra. Today, our children are back to dealing with job losses and unemployment. This has to be a wake-up call for all of us.\"\n\nWhile candidates and politicians are busy with campaign rallies, this bunch of senior citizens also wakes up early and takes different modes of transport to reach Sena Bhavan by noon and start connecting with people. \"We aren't here every day,\" said ex-corporator Machindra Kachre (73). \"Some days, we are in some village or another city to meet people. The idea is to make everyone aware of their rights and acquaint them with the history of the Shiv Sena and Balasaheb's ideology and thoughts on Hindutva.\"\n\nSouth Central is one of the constituencies in Maharashtra set to witness a Sena-versus-Sena contest, with incumbent MP Rahul Shewale as the Shiv Sena (Shinde) candidate and Anil Desai representing the Shiv Sena (UBT).\n\n\"We are not afraid of the traitors who left the party to satiate their greed,\" said Rajendra Chandorkar, who is coordinating the activities of the Jestha Sena. \"None of our members have any greed for posts or money -- they are working only in support of Uddhav Thackeray and for the fundamental principles for which the party stood. They have worked with Balasaheb Thackeray and who better than them to reach out to people with his ideology?\"\n\nChandrakant Prabhale (75), who was one of the first shakha pramukhs of the party, emphasised that the Constitution was in danger. \"Babasaheb Ambedkar had appealed to the Indian people through the preamble of the Constitution,\" he said. \"In the last two years, I have distributed 5,000 copies of the preamble to people. Uddhav Thackeray has said he will fight for the Constitution and democracy, and we are with him.\"\n\n'Madrasi' nonagenarian acquaintance of Bal Thackeray speaks up for Uddhav\n\nNonagenarian Sarada Viswanathan Iyer, who was Bal Thackeray's sister's neighbour at Taikalwadi, Dadar, and knew the family well, is closely watching the political drama.\n\n\"I was never a Sena loyalist, but what I saw in the last three years, especially Uddhav Thackeray's betrayal by his party members, has deeply pained me,\" she said. \"While I was surprised by his decision to become chief minister, his government's work during the Covid-19 pandemic was commendable.\" The 92-year-old's vote this time will be \"against inflation and polarisation\".\n\nRecollecting her heyday, Iyer said that hers was the only \"Madrasi\" family in Taikalwadi when the Shiv Sena unleashed its anti-South Indian campaign. \"Still, our family never felt unsafe,\" she said. \"We were respected. They loved our food. We exchanged food and we were very cordial.\"\n\nIyer, who has never missed casting her vote, has always made an informed decision after attending rallies of all political parties. \"The current generation casts its vote without knowing anything,\" she said. \"Its members have information at their fingertips but they are not updated about ground realities. Today, society is being polarised for political gain. We should understand that and vote responsibly.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uddhav_Thackeray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uddhav Thackeray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal_Thackeray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bal Thackeray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivaji_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shivaji Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Sena", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shiv Sena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sena_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sena dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marathi people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marathi language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_South_Central_Lok_Sabha_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai South Central Lok Sabha constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eknath_Shinde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eknath Shinde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindutva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shiva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dadar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dadar"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marwari_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marwari people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarati_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gujarati people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Sena_(Uddhav_Balasaheb_Thackeray)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preamble to the Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Shewale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Shewale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil_Desai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anil Desai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "B.

Patil in Ghatkopar, the party Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi launched a virulent attack on the rival BJP-Shiv Sena nominee.\n\nAt one point, she slammed Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and his son Shrikant Shinde, who is making his hat-trick bid for LS from the neighbouring Kalyan LS seat in adjoining Thane district.\n\n\"Who are you... Eknath Shinde... What are you... Eknath Shinde?

Will it be acceptable to Chaturvedi if something is said about her father,\" Rane asked.\n\nIn a supportive tone, SS (UBT)'s leader of opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Council, Ambadas Danve, said that \"he (Shinde) is a 'gaddar', so what's wrong in calling him a traitor\".\n\nIncidentally, Sanjay Patil, an ex-MP, is pitted against the MahaYuti-BJP's newcomer Mihir C.

The situation of the ruling parties is like unseasonal rains, while the Congress is seasonal monsoon.\n\nAmid the intriguing polling scenario, Sharad Pawar's statement that there is a high probability of many regional parties merging with the Congress in the coming years has elicited sharp responses from the ruling Mahayuti partners, including the BJP, Shinde Sena and Ajit Pawar's NCP.\n\nIn an interview to an English newspaper, NCP (SP) chief Sharad remarked that in the next couple of years, several regional parties will associate more closely with the Congress or may look at the option of merger with it if they believe that is best for their party. He said that even Uddhav Thackeray is positive...about working together (with like-minded parties).\n\nExuding confidence that his daughter Supriya Sule will defeat his nephew Ajit's wife in Baramati seat, Sharad asserted that many parties don't like the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They are beginning to come together and there is a strong undercurrent against the ruling coalition, he underscored.\n\nWhen queried that would his party which is still recovering from the jolt after Ajit's split also consider a Congress merger, Sharad said, \"Though ideology and thinking of my party is the same like the Congress, I would have to discuss (the merger option) with my party leaders.\"\n\nHis crucial statement gave more ammo to the Mahayuti partners, who launched a no holds barred against Sharad. In a curt remark, Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said that the NCP (SP) chief may find it difficult to run his party. Also, he has a habit of creating new parties and merging them with the Congress after a few years. Hence, his thoughts aren't new, he added.\n\nMaking the most of Sharad's statement to target his archrival Uddhav Thackeray, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde said, \"Pawar is a big leader and he makes such statements.\n\nHowever, Shiv Sena (UBT) has already become the Congress as they speak the language of the Congress and Pakistan. Just the formality (of merger between them) is remaining.\" Uddhav is siding with the grand old party which is insulting martyrs of the 26/11 attacks, said Shinde, alluding to Congress leader Vijay Waddetiwar's remarks on Hemant Karkare. The latter had said that the senior IPS officer was gunned down by a \"RSS-linked\" cop. Ajit NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal said that he doesn't feel that regional parties will merge with the Congress.\n\nDefending Sharad, Waddetiwar said, \"The NCP (SP) chief is of Gandhi ideology and no one can erase it. The situation of the ruling parties is like unseasonal rains, while the Congress is seasonal monsoon.\" Taking a nuanced stand, senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan said, \"Whether the regional parties will merge with the Congress will be clear after the poll results on June 4.

Pic/Atul Kamble\n\nThe Mumbai North West Lok Sabha constituency is witnessing a major showdown between the two Shiv Sena factions. Amol Kirtikar, son of current MP Gajanan Kirtikar and representing the Sena (UBT) faction, is up against Ravindra Waikar from the Eknath Shinde faction for the constituency.\n\nWaikar recently spoke with mid-day and explained that when he faced scrutiny from the Enforcement Directorate, he asked Uddhav Thackeray for help and requested him to talk to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But since Thackeray didn't support him, he had to leave the Sena (UBT).\n\nDespite being one of the longest-serving leaders in Sena (UBT) and a close confidant of Thackeray, what made you switch sides, even after remaining loyal to Thackeray through the party's internal split?\n\nWhen I was being framed, I made sure that I made my side of the matter clear to the departments concerned, including EOW, the police and ED. I was expecting that they (Uddhav Thackeray) would support me. I even requested them to call Modi-saheb because the allegations against me were false.\n\nHad you ever anticipated a split within the Shiv Sena and the likelihood of contesting elections against the Thackeray faction candidate?\n\nI had never imagined this. I have been associated with Shiv Sena for 50 years as I was inspired by the thoughts of the late Balasaheb Thackeray. For past three to four decades I have been actively working for the welfare of people in my area and I also ensured social harmony among the Hindu and Muslim people in my constituency. I did everything for the party. In return, I was expecting support and there is nothing wrong with it.\n\nRavindra Waikar during a nomination rally last week. Pic/Sayyed Sameer Abedi\n\nHow do you feel about being criticised by some leaders for joining the Shinde faction and collaborating with the BJP, especially after BJP leaders previously accused you of corruption?\n\nThose who are criticising me now should have supported me when I needed them. They should have stood by me until the end, but unfortunately, they didn't.\n\nHow are people in the constituency responding to you?\n\nWe are getting a positive response to our election campaigning. People know about the development work that I have done as an MLA. They're also aware of the work I have done as a corporator during my years in BMC in the fields of health, education and sanitation. During my tenure as a MLA and minister, I have done a lot of work for the welfare of people and the people are aware of it. During my tenure as a guardian minister of Ratnagiri, I helped provide infrastructure-related facilities like water, roads and electricity to people. The work I have done speaks for me and it has become my brand. I recently visited a ward in my Lok Sabha constituency and I saw that a lot of work still needs to be done. When I meet people during campaigning, they say they want their area developed along the lines of my Assembly constituency which has good infrastructure and facilities. I am confident that I will receive huge support and people will vote for me.\n\nWhat challenges does your constituency face, and how do you envision its future?\n\nThere are many questions pertaining to Mumbai. One of the important issues I would focus on is giving the Marathi language a classical language status. There are also frequent problems related to air traffic congestion in Mumbai and I will take this up with the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation on priority. I will also see to it that the rehabilitation of the slum dwellers on the periphery of the Mumbai airport is done so that the space that is vacated can be used for making two additional runways which will further help reduce air traffic congestion. Another important issue is that of the construction and redevelopment of societies that fall in the air funnel zone. I will work closely with people and the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation to find a solution to this issue. I will also raise the issue of people staying in slum pockets and the issues faced by the fishermen's community and help resolve them.\n\nWhat will be the election outcome in Mumbai and MMR?\n\nI am confident that Mahayuti will do really well in Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). We are getting a very good response from people because they want to see Modi-ji become the PM for the third time. Modi-ji is a visionary leader and his work speaks for it... be it the construction of Ram Madir, the decisions taken in favour of national security, his relations with several countries and world leaders etc. During COVID too, Modi-ji did excellent work which people across the country are praising.\n\nWill widespread sympathy towards Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar after the division within their parties have any noticeable effects?\n\nThis is a national election. People are aware that since I have 35 years of experience in politics and working for the welfare of people, I will effectively raise their voice in parliament as compared to someone who doesn't have any experience in solving issues of the people. People who get elected to Lok Sabha from various parts of the country are intelligent people who have a vision. The people with no experience will not be able to fulfil the expectations and promises made to the people.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [],

Chaturvedi's comments came during a poll rally for Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) candidate for Mumbai North East seat Sanjay Dina Patil in Ghatkopar on Wednesday.\n\nThe rally, which was attended by Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Nitin Bangude Patil, saw Chaturvedi making bold comments against Shrinkant Shinde. Her remarks have gone viral on social media.\n\nWhat did Chaturvedi say?\n\nIn a bid to compare Shinde's decision to breakaway from undivided Shiv Sena and join Mahayuti bloc with the BJP, Chaturvedi used a dialogue from 1975 Amitabh Bachchan-starrer film 'Deewar'.\n\nAddressing the rally, she said, \"You must remember the movie 'Deewar'.

Similarly, 'mera baad gaddar hai (my father is a traitor)'.\" She received applause from the public for the statement.\n\nMahayuti lashes out at Chaturvedi\n\nHowever, the comments did not sit well with the Mahayuti bloc.

She said that 'My father is a traitor' is written on Shrikant's forehead. If she truly believes her statement word for word, then Aditya Thackeray's forehead should say 'My father is a great traitor,'\" Nirupam wrote in a post on X. \"Why? Because the betrayal was committed by his father when he broke the alliance with the BJP. The great betrayal was committed by his father when he abandoned Balasaheb's ideology and aligned with the very Congress he had opposed all his life. Why does the UBT remain silent on this great betrayal?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rane also took to X disapprove Chaturvedi's comments.\n\n\"What nonsense is this...

His father had committed a greater betrayal by not following Balasaheb's ideology and getting into an alliance with the Congress,\" replied Mr. Nirupam.\n\nCalling Ms. Chaturvedi chatur (clever), spokesperson and deputy leader of Mr. Shinde's Sena Sheetal Mhatre commented that her statements are coming at a time when her Rajya Sabha term is coming to an end and the impatience is visible. \"You should tell people how you became an MP,\" she said while adding that Ms. Chaturvedi does not have any connection with Shiv Sena, and should also clarify on her visit to Davos in 2022, \"Also state, who all did you meet last week to get another MP term? You have said that you have what kind of Aaditya's [Thackeray] photographs to get another MP term? Who are you criticising?\"\n\nMs. Chaturvedi was one of the panelists at the World Economic Forum on November 1, 2022. For the programme themed - \"Celebrating Mumbai: The pulse of India paving the way for new trends and positive changes\", she was joined by Mr. Aaditya Thackeray, filmmaker Meghna Ghai Puri, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Arjun Tendulkar, among others.\n\nIn response to Deewar, Ms. Mhatre picked up a dialouge from Bulandi starring Raaj Kumar and Asha Parekh - Billi ke daant gire nahi aur chali sher ke muh mein haat daalne (Cat's teeth haven't fallen and wants to put hand in lion's mouth).\n\nBJP's Nilesh Rane, a former MP and Union Minister Narayan Rane's son too reacted on micro blogging platform X, \"What nonsense is this... Is it appropriate to talk about someone's father on a public platform such as this? What if one of Mahayuti's leaders had said something similar on the Thackerays? Would it be okay, had we spoken the same about her father?\"\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The cadre too are with us. Only the leaders have switched. A politician can't take a voter with him nor can they change their opinion. The loyal Shiv Sainiks are still in Shiv Sena, they are still with us. In fact, because of what has happened, the Sena has become stronger... because there has been a churning, the garbage and dirt have gone out of Sena.\n\nHow does it feel to stand against Eknath Shinde with whom you had a bond?\n\nThe fight that I am fighting right now, it is of \"Gaadars vs Nishtavaad (traitors versus loyalists)\". And certainly, the truth and loyal Sainiks will win in this fight. Whatever they (Eknath Shinde and his faction of Sena) have done is out of their own selfish purposes. They went to hide their sins and the money that they earned through corrupt practices. Eknath Shinde, himself, met Uddhav saheb and then he left Shiv Sena, saying that he cannot go to jail at this point. He left after saying that he would have to go (to BJP).\n\nThane is a huge constituency comprising different areas like Navi Mumbai, Mira Bhayandar, Thane. Each of these areas have a separate set of needs and development demands. What is your vision for your next term?\n\nEvery city under the Thane constituency has a different issue. For example, in Navi Mumbai, the stations had been built by CIDCO 30 years ago. The stations are situated below. Therefore, senior citizens have to climb down the stairs as there are no lifts. We are building lifts and elevators at every station. The tender has been floated and the work will also commence soon.\n\nMainly, we will improve waterways connectivity and my presentation has been given to the department. This work is also in the pipeline. This will be like in Bhayandar, where through the jetty one can reach Vasai in 15 minutes. Earlier, the same distance would take hours. That project is already completed.\n\nWe are also working on remodeling and making a new Thane station, under the Station Area Traffic Improvement Scheme (SATIS) 2 project. Even SATIS 1 was done when I was the mayor. The SATIS was our pilot project, which is being implemented across all stations in the country. We are also making a station between Thane and Mulund, for which, too, we have already received the sanctions. We are also planning to make two new segments in Mira Bhayandar, like Borivali.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nayonika_bose@indianexpress.com", "name": "Nayonika Bose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eknath_Shinde", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eknath Shinde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Sena", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shiv Sena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajan_Vichare", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajan Vichare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navi_Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Navi Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Navi Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thane", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_and_Industrial_Development_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City and Industrial Development Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira-Bhayandar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mira-Bhayandar"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vasai"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulund", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mulund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mulund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhayandar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bhayandar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bhayandar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borivali", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borivali"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borivali"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Internet", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fight_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fight Songs", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Tributes", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Tributes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Rajan-Vicche.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544954", "eventUri": "eng-9544954", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

The infighting in the Shiv Sena and differences with alliance partners like the NCP have affected the poll campaign of candidate and sitting MP Hemant Godse, forcing Shinde to go to Nashik on Wednesday.\n\nThe chief minister held a meeting with local party leaders and tried to pacify them and bring the campaign back on track. In a bid to prevent more damage to the party's prospects, Godse too met NCP minister Chhagan Bhujbal on the insistence of Shinde and requested him to support his campaign.\n\nGodse belongs to the Maratha community and Bhujbal has influence over OBC voters. Bhujbal told Godse he would support him. \"Whenever you call me for a campaign meeting, I will be there,\" he said.\n\nThe Nashik Lok Sabha seat has been a bone of contention in the Mahayuti, as the BJP opposed Godse's candidature and attempted to hand over the seat to the NCP led by deputy CM Ajit Pawar. Bhujbal had expressed a desire to contest from Nashik and also hinted that the BJP high command wanted him to contest the seat on the criterion of \"winnability\". Shinde, reluctant to let go, held long deliberations with his allies and finally succeeded in retaining the seat. The Shiv Sena (UBT) has fielded Rajabhau Waje from Nashik.\n\nShiv Sena district chief Ajay Boraste, who was also eyeing the Nashik constituency, was unhappy with Godse's renomination, and his supporters kept their distance from the campaign. The Sena's alliance partners, the BJP and the NCP, also stayed away even as Godse launched his campaign. With a mere 12 days in hand for campaigning, Godse requested Shinde's intervention. Shinde reached Nashik on Wednesday afternoon to resolve the issues.\n\nIn the course of his visit, the chief minister also managed to convince a Shiv Sena (UBT) rebel, Vijay Karanjkar, to withdraw from the fray, as he would have eaten into the votes of both the rival candidates. Boraste was also pacified with multiple assurances during the meeting on Wednesday. Shinde lauded Karanjkar and Boraste at the meeting, saying, \"Now Vijay Karanjkar, along with his supporters, has joined us and strengthened our party. Ajay Boraste and Karanjkar have the capacity to ensure the victory of MP Godse.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathuram_Godse", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nathuram Godse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhagan_Bhujbal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chhagan Bhujbal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Congress_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nationalist Congress Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashik", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nashik"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashik"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemant_Godse", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hemant Godse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eknath_Shinde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eknath Shinde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Sena", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shiv Sena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Sena_(Uddhav_Balasaheb_Thackeray)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathi people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Pawar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ajit Pawar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/1600x900.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544954", "eventUri": "eng-9544954", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

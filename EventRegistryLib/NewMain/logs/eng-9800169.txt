After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn't know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months,\" Swift, 34, told Elle in March 2019, several months after wrapping up her Reputation stadium tour.\n\nSwift was referring to the 2017 terrorist bombing that left 22 people dead and hundreds injured at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. That same year, a mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert resulted in 58 deaths and more than 800 injuries.\n\nIn her \"30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30\" Elle profile, Swift noted that she and her team put \"a tremendous amount of planning, expense and effort\" into \"keeping my fans safe\" while taking her tour around the world.\n\n\"My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds,\" she revealed. \"Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I've ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things.\"\n\nDespite preparing for the worst-case scenarios, Swift wrote that she tries to \"remind myself of the good in the world, the love I've witnessed and the faith I have in humanity.\" She concluded: \"We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.\"\n\nHer words feel more poignant than ever after news broke on Wednesday, August 7, that Swift's three Vienna shows were canceled after police arrested two suspects in connection to an alleged terror plot. The pop star was scheduled to perform from Thursday, August 8, to Saturday, August 10.\n\n\"Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour Vienna shows canceled due to government officials confirmation of planned terrorist attack,\" concert organizers Barracuda Music wrote in an Instagram statement on Wednesday. \"With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.\"\n\nPolice arrested two teenagers -- a 19-year-old and a 17-year-old -- with suspected ties to ISIS. According to the Associated Press, one of the suspects confessed to the plan to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\"\n\nFollowing news of the cancellation, an eyewitness set to attend Swift's Vienna shows exclusively told Us Weekly that people in their hostel were \"shell-shocked.\" A second person noted that their hotel lobby was \"full of girls\" who were \"just standing around staring at each other in a state of total shock right now.\"\n\nThe second fan added: \"I think we'd just really like to hear from her right now. There's a level of shock and disbelief that obviously can't be fixed but maybe could be eased by hearing from her.\"\n\nSwift has yet to address the alleged terror plot or share plans for the remainder of her tour. With Swift set to perform five nights at London's Wembley Stadium later this month, U.K. Minister for Policing Diana Johnson said that British police will continue to monitor for suspected attacks.\n\n\"Clearly, the police will be looking at all the intelligence and making decisions, they risk assess every event that happens in this country, and that's something for the police,\" Johnson said on Thursday, per The Independent.\n\nA spokesperson for London's Metropolitan Police added in a separate statement that \"there is nothing to indicate that the matters being investigated by the Austrian authorities will have an impact on upcoming events here in London,\" noting, \"As always, we will continue to keep any new information under careful review.\"", "source": {"uri":

She began carrying \"army grade bandage dressing\" specifically \"for gunshot or stab wounds\" after the horrifying events.\n\nSwift's fears were not unfounded. As a global celebrity, she has had to deal with multiple stalkers, heightening her anxiety about personal security.\n\nThe 34-year-old continued: \"You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things.\"\n\nDespite these fears, Swift wrote that she strives to focus on the \"good in the world\" and the \"love and faith\" she has in humanity. \"We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive,\" she concluded, emphasising the importance of not letting fear control her life.\n\nFortunately, Swift's worst fears were averted recently when Austrian authorities intercepted a terrorist plot aimed at her Eras Tour.\n\nHowever Britain's police minister said on Thursday that Scotland Yard will be risk assessing whether it it safe for Swift's concerts to go ahead at Wembley after the plot.\n\nThe American singer-songwriter sold out Wembley Stadium for three nights in June and she is due to return with her Eras Tour to the huge venue for five performances next week.\n\nOrganisers of three Swift concerts in Austria later this week were cancelled after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the Vienna area such as the concerts.\n\nSwift was scheduled to play at the Austrian capital's Ernst Happel Stadium on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\n\nEvent organiser Barracuda Music said in a post on its Instagram channel late on Wednesday that \"we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety\".\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, authorities said they had arrested two suspected extremists, one of whom appeared to be planning an alleged attack on an event in the Vienna area such as upcoming concerts.\n\nThe 19-year-old main suspect was arrested in Ternitz, south of Vienna, and the second person in the Austrian capital.\n\nAsked about the cancellations and the planned concerts at Wembley, Home Office minister Dame Diana Johnson told LBC Radio said: \"Clearly the police will be looking at all the intelligence and making decisions.\n\n\"They risk assess every event that happens in this country.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Swift's team announced the cancellation of all three of her Vienna shows following the arrest of two men plotting a terrorist attack at one of the concerts.\n\nSwift planned to play three shows in Vienna, Austria beginning on Thursday, Aug. 8. One day before the first show, Austrian concert promoter Barracuda Music announced the cancellation of all three dates on Instagram.\n\n\"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Vienna Shows canceled due to government officials confirmation of planned terrorist attack,\" the post read. \"With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety. All tickets will be automatically refunded within the next 10 business days.\"\n\nSwift has yet to comment on the cancelation, but her website reflects the announcement that ticket holders will receive refunds.\n\nAhead of the cancelation, Austrian authorities arrested two suspects. Per The New York Times, the primary suspect is a 19-year-old man with an allegiance to the Islamic State. He confessed his plans to authorities. Franz Ruf, the head of public safety in Austria, shared in a press conference that the suspects intended to use explosives and other weapons to kill as many concertgoers as possible.\n\nA 17-year-old accomplice was arrested outside the stadium. Police also took in a 15-year-old boy for questioning, but they do not believe he participated in the plot. Some media reports claim that a manhunt for two other suspects is currently taking place across Europe.\n\nAustrian intelligence officials say they did not push for the cancellation of the tour dates. Still, they said they understand the decision.\n\nIn 2019, Swift said that the idea of violence at one of her shows is a major fear.\n\n\"After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn't know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months,\" she wrote for Elle. \"There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe.\"\n\nShe said that her level of celebrity has already led to her feeling unsafe. Acts of violence at other shows forced her to take precautions.\n\n\"My fear of violence has continued into my personal life,\" she wrote. \"I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds.

Thousands of fans planned to attend the concerts on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion, so this could have been a massive tragedy if their plan hadn't been stopped by the police in time -- just like the horrific bombing during Ariana Grande's show in Manchester. Or even the devastating mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas.\n\nRelated: 17-Year-Old Charged With Murders Of 3 Children Attending Taylor Swift Event\n\nManchester was shocking to the entire world. A suicide bomber killed 22 people and injured hundreds at the 7 Rings singer's Danger Woman concert in the city back in May 2017. Sadly it wasn't even the only massacre at a concert that year.\n\nJust five months later, a man shot and killed 58 people at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Sin City. The devastating incidents rocked many people at the time, especially in the music industry -- including Taylor. In fact, five years before this week's scare, she admitted in a column for Elle in 2019 that the back-to-back tragedies made her \"completely terrified\" to tour again ahead of Lover Fest as her \"biggest fear\" was the possibility of a terrorist attack at her concert. Oof. She wrote at the time:\n\n\"After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn't know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe.\"\n\nHer \"fear of violence\" continued into her \"personal life,\" too. Following the two catastrophic events, Taylor said she even started to carry \"QuikClot army grade bandage dressing\" for \"gunshot or stab wounds.\" It's heartbreaking she feared for her safety so much she had to take such extreme measures just in case. Sadly, her worries only increased as her personal information became easily accessible online to stalkers:\n\n\"Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I've ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things.\"\n\nDespite her concerns, Taylor tried to remember there is still \"good in the world\", expressing at the time:\n\n\"Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I've witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.\"\n\nAnd she didn't let her \"greatest fears\" rule over her. Taylor fully planned to move forward with Lover Fest, but the shows were canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. A few years later, though, she embarked on her record-breaking The Eras Tour. Except for a scary incident with a stalker, everything was going smoothly out on the road. But as we mentioned, her international leg of the tour took a very scary turn due to the planned terror attack. Again, thankfully, the plot was thwarted before anyone got hurt. But out of an abundance of precaution, the three shows in Vienna are canceled now.\n\nWe cannot imagine how shaken Taylor must feel at this time -- especially as this comes on the heels of the mass stabbing at a dance event themed around her in the UK. Our hearts go out to her and the Swifties in Vienna. We're so glad everyone is safe. Reactions, Perezcious readers? Let us know.\n\nIf you're experiencing emotional distress related to incidents of mass violence, you can call or text the Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990 or visit their website at

Authorities told the Associated Press the suspects had confessed they planned to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue\" by using explosives and knives.\n\nSwift's next Eras Tour stop is a string of five shows at London's Wembley Stadium starting Aug. 15, though Variety reported the venue is increasing security. U.K. policing minister Diana Johnson said police will look \"at all the intelligence\" and \"risk assess\" ahead of Swift's London shows. London Mayor Sadiq Khan told Sky News Thursday the shows will \"carry on, working closely with police ensuring that the Taylor Swift concerts can take place in London safely.\"\n\nSwift told Elle in 2019 she was \"completely terrified\" to embark on her 2018 Reputation Stadium Tour because of her \"fear of violence,\" citing an attack by a suicide bomber on a 2017 Ariana Grande concert in Manchester that killed 22 people and injured hundreds more. \"I didn't know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months,\" Swift told Elle. She said her fear of violence has led her to carry \"QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds.\" She told Elle she has started \"prepping for bad things\" because of stalkers she has faced.

What We Know Post-Vienna Cancelation", "body": "Taylor Swift's stadium tours in Vienna were canceled amid two men being arrested for plotting a terrorist attack. Here's what we know about the frightening incident and what it could mean for Taylor's upcoming shows at London's Wembley Stadium.\n\nThe cancelation of Taylor's Vienna shows was announced on August 7, with promoter Barracuda Music writing in an Instagram statement, \"Taylor Swift The Eras Tour Vienna shows cancelled due to government officials confirmation of planned terrorist attack. With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernest Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.\" They added that all tickets would be refunded within 10 business days.\n\nVienna State Police President Gerhard P\u00fcrstl reportedly noted that~65,000 fans were planning to attend each of Taylor's three shows (and that doesn't include an additional ~15,000 Swifties who were expected outside the stadium).\n\nAccording to the New York Times, one of the two people arrested for the planned terrorist attack is a 19-year-old citizen of Austria who had \"recently pledged allegiance to the Islamic State online and had focused on the Eras tour as a potential target.\"\n\nTaylor's next stop on the Eras tour is scheduled for August 15 at London's Wembley Stadium, and TMZ reports it is going ahead as planned. That said, the outlet notes that \"Taylor's camp is teaming up with the tour promoter AEG and Wembley Arena to beef up security.\"\n\nPer the New York Times, London's Metropolitan Police said there's \"nothing to indicate that the matters being investigated by the Austrian authorities will have an impact on upcoming events here in London.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Deadline reports U.K. Policing Minister Diana Johnson addressed the situation on Thursday, August 8, saying, \"Clearly, the police will be looking at all the intelligence and making decisions, they risk assess every event that happens in this country, and that's something for the police.\"\n\nShe added, \"There is, of course, a commitment in our manifesto in the General Election to introduce Martyn's law, which, again, is about making sure that those... venues which could be subject to terrorist attack have in place everything that they need in terms of keeping people safe, and that will be brought forward by the government shortly.\"\n\nFYI: Martyn's Law is named after Martyn Hett, one of 22 victims in the 2017 attack on Ariana Grande's concert at the Manchester Arena.\n\nIn a 2019, Taylor wrote an essay for ELLE and spoke about her \"biggest fear\" being an attack on her fans during a show.\n\n\"After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn't know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months,\" she explained. \"There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe.

A search of one of the residences of the suspects revealed chemicals and materials to construct homemade explosives.\n\n\"The situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented,\" Austria's Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said Thursday.\n\nThe New York Post is reporting that the plot involved driving a car into a crowd outside of Ernst Happel Stadium, the venue for all three Swift concerts, blowing it up, and attacking individuals in the crowd with machetes.\n\nThe younger suspect had just been hired on as a security guard for the venue.\n\nWe're now learning that the plot had progressed to the point where the preparations for carrying it out were almost complete. The bomb that the suspects were building was almost finished, and the younger suspect had just been hired as a security guard.\n\nThe two young men had been under surveillance by Austrian authorities, according to news sources. It's possible their social media footprint raised red flags after authorities confirmed they had both been radicalized online by the Islamic State:\n\nThe pair had displayed noticeable changes in their behavior in the leadup to their arrests, according to Franz Ruf, public security director at Austria's Interior Ministry.\n\nThe older teen had quit his job on July 25 and told people he had \"something big\" planned, while the 17-year-old recently broke up with his girlfriend, Ruf said.\n\nThe pair had also made contact with others who were apparently aware of the terror plot plans.\n\nA 15-year-old boy was also taken in for questioning Wednesday after the sinister plans were uncovered, though it was unclear if he had been arrested.\n\nTaylor Swift, whose \"Eras\" tour was expected to be seen live by more than 3 million people, had earlier expressed that her biggest fear in playing to such huge crowds was the potential for a terrorist attack.\n\nAfter the ISIS bombing of an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, in May 2017 that killed 22, and the mass shooting at Las Vegas' Route 91 Harvest Music Festival, where 64 people were slaughtered, Ms. Swift penned an article for Elle Magazine.\n\n\"My biggest fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn't know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months,\" she said.\n\n\"There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I've witnessed and the faith I have in humanity.\"\n\n\"We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.\"\n\nSwift's fans were bitterly disappointed. Among them, was Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer.\n\n\"The situation surrounding the apparently planned terror attack in Vienna was very serious,\" he wrote. He thanked to the security services that \"the threat could be recognized early on, tackled and a tragedy prevented.\"\n\nHe added a stirring call to defend \"Western values.\"\n\nWe live in a time when violent means are being used to attack our Western way of life. Islamist terrorism threatens security and freedom in many Western countries. This is precisely why we will not give up our values such as freedom and democracy, but will defend them even more vehemently.\n\nAustria's Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler added in a separate post: \"For many, a dream has been shattered today. On three evenings in Vienna, tens of thousands of #Swifties should have celebrated life together.\n\n\"I am very sorry that you were denied this. Swifties stick together, hate and terror can't destroy that,\" Kogler wrote.\n\nI guess U.S. authorities should take care and watch out for all those right-wing anti-abortion, pro-family Christian conservatives. No need to worry about threats from those Islamist pussycats.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_moran@pjmedia.com", "name": "Rick

Even though two suspects have been arrested, government officials erred on the side of caution while they look other people who are possibly involved. For Swift, this was a nightmare come true.\n\nIn 2019, she wrote an ELLE essay on \"30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30.\" Under the topic of \"My biggest fear,\" Swift discussed how \"the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting\" impacted her as an artist. \"I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn't know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months,\" she revealed. \"There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe.\" Understandably, her high-profile profession requires a lot of security and planning, but those violent incidents also made her change aspects of her personal life, too.\n\n\"My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds,\" she wrote while criticizing \"websites and tabloids\" for doxing her home addresses online. \"You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things,\" she added. Swift isn't wrong to worry about her fans and her personal safety, Sandra Bullock's terrifying home invasion experience feels traumatic to read about even years later.\n\nIn 2014, Bullock was home alone because her then-four-year-old son Louis stayed at the nanny's house that evening. \"It was the one night that our nanny goes, 'Let me just take him to my apartment which is up the street because you're gonna be out late,'\" Bullock told Red Table Talk. \"Had he been home, I would've run to the closet, and it would have changed our destiny forever.\" A stalker had broken into her Bel Air residence while she was sleeping. He was there for more than an hour before she realized an intruder had broken in, according to CNN. The incident changed Bullock's life forever. \"I wasn't the same after that. I was unraveling. I haven't been alone since the day it happened,\" she admitted.\n\nSo, Swift and other A-list celebrities' concerns about safety are valid -- and it's a global issue for them. But as Swift reminded everyone in 2019, there is still \"good in the world.\" She noted, \"We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.\" Still, this major scare will change security for her Wembley Stadium concerts that are still scheduled from Aug. 15-20, and her rumored cameo at the Closing Ceremony at the Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristyn_burtt@sheknows.com", "name": "Kristyn Burtt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyKayla_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MyKayla Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Arena_bombing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Arena bombing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elle (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuikClot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QuikClot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bandage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Bullock", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sandra Bullock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Table_Talk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Table Talk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A-list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bel_Air,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bel Air, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bel Air, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/swift-2.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800169", "eventUri": "eng-9800169", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "dateEnd": "2024-08-20", "textStart": 2751, "textEnd": 2761}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

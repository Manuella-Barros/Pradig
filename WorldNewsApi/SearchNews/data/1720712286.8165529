Her actions ultimately convinced the butcher who sold it to her to quit his business for good.When Maddie Johnson, from California, saw a Facebook post from a farm owner in North Carolina trying to rehome their piglets after a flash flood destroyed their barn, she didn't think twice before embarking on this crazy adventure, which then led to many more rescues.\"He [Pickles] was actually the first animal I ever rescued\u2014I've now rescued, rehabilitated, and found homes for 300 orphaned animals. Pickles and his story were the inspiration behind everything I do now,\" Johnson told Newsweek.In a YouTube video shared last April, the 31-year-old, under the username mercyforanimals, explains that after walking through knee-deep water to rescue Pickles from the flooded barn, she immediately took him to a vet for internal bleeding and that's when she received terrible news.Because he had accidentally ingested some rat poison, Pickles was in life-threatening condition and only had about six hours left to live, unless Johnson was able to find another pig within this timeframe to get a blood transfusion.Although it seemed almost impossible, Johnson wouldn't give up on her new little friend, so she rolled up her sleeves and started looking for a pig until she found one. However, getting blood wasn't as easy as she was hoping.\"I went on Craigslist and I found a butcher who was selling his 450 pound pig and so I called him on the phone and begged him to just let me borrow her for this blood transfusion and he ended up letting me do that,\" Johnson explains in the YouTube video.So she immediately started arranging transportation as time was running out. In the end, the blood transfusion was successful and Pickles made it.After rescuing Pickles, Johnson thought it wasn't fair to let the hero pig who saved his life get sold to slaughter, so she decided to buy the swine instead.\"Tickles the hero pig is also doing great. She lives on a rescue farm, Flat Broke Farm, in Sonoma County. She grew to be over 1,000 pounds, so she is large and in charge,\" Johnson said.Inspired by her kindness, the butcher who sold her Tickles decided to drastically change his path in life. Frank is now retired and uses the land he had previously used for the animals to rent out to people to park their trailers on.\"He and I are planning to visit Tickles at her sanctuary. He spends his time rescuing dogs now. We've promised each other that we will collaborate on a rescue together!\" Johnson said.Meanwhile, after almost losing her little piglet at such a young age, Johnson wanted to make the most of his time with her.\"Pickles is great!\" she said. \"He lives at home with me and all my other rescue animals. He is the happiest pig. He's been on so many adventures with me. I've taken him paddle boarding, sledding, to an official mud run, to dog agility, and many more adventures. He's traveled with me to Los Angeles, Colorado, San Diego, Utah, Portland, and New York City (twice!).\"Johnson added: \"He gets along great with all my foster animals and is regularly seen cuddling with puppies, kittens, and other adorable animals that I foster. Most people are surprised by how smart pigs are. They can walk on a leash, do tricks, come when called, and be potty-trained just like a dog. They're highly intelligent and emotional creatures. Pickles is actually much smarter than my dogs (but don't tell them that).\"Psychology Today article from 2015 confirms that pigs are actually extremely interesting animals, intelligent, emotional, and cognitively complex.\"They're able to solve challenging problems, they love to play, they display a wide range of emotions, and they have unique individual personalities,\" its website says.Do you have funny and adorable videos or pictures of your pet you want to share?

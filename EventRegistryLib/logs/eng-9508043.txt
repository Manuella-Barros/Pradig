The family of illegally detained philanthropist, Ruben Vardanyan, announced today that he entered into a hunger strike to demand the immediate and unconditional release of himself and the other Armenian prisoners illegally held in Baku, Ruben Vardanyan's family has said in a statement.\n\nThe hunger strike began on April 5, 2024, following repeated requests by Vardanyan and counsel to provide a fair and transparent trial in a timely manner in line with international legal standards. Suspiciously his hunger strike began, his family's regular phone calls with him have been cut off, in clear violation of all international norms. The original trial slated for January was extended without cause to May.\n\nLast September, armed forces of the government of Azerbaijan invaded Nagorno-Karabakh, triggering the exodus of the 120,000 inhabitants of the region. During the plight of the refugess, Vardanyan and 7 other former officials were arrested and now face spurious politically motivated charges. They are all political prisoners.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the health and well-being of my father,\" said David Vardanyan, one of Mr. Vardanyan's sons. \"For nearly 200 days, my family has not seen my father. We have had absolutely no contact with him since he launched his hunger strike on April 5th.\"\n\nVardanyan's hunger strike tragically coincides with the 109th anniversary of the Armenian genocide which will occur on April 24th demonstrating how Armenians continue to be targets of ethnic cleansing and are still targeted for persecution around the world.\n\nRuben Vardanyan is a loving husband and a father of four. He is also an influential Armenian business leader, social entrepreneur, and philanthropist. Together with his partners from around the world, he has driven more than $1.5 billion toward advancing economic development, addressing humanitarian challenges, and supporting global education initiatives.\n\nA former State Minister of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic from November 2022-February 2023, Mr. Vardanyan has been charged with false accusations, held in conditions against international law, and faces a trial that will not be up to international standards, especially regarding access of international observers to the proceedings. In addition, Mr. Vardanyan's case has been separated from the other seven political prisoners, raising questions about whether he in particular is being politically targeted.\n\n\"The illegal detention of Ruben and the other former leaders of Artsakh is an egregious abuse of human rights and the international justice system and must be ended,\" said Paul Polman, Selection Committee member of the Aurora Humanitarian Initiative co-founded by Ruben Vardanyan. \"The irony of this entire situation is that Azerbaijan has been selected to host COP 29 in a blatant attempt to \"greenwash\" their international reputation. COP has a major focus on the interconnectivity of climate change and human rights at a time when they are abusing both in plain sight\"\n\nMr. Vardanyan's family demands that:\n\n1. All illegally detained ethnic Armenian prisoners, including Ruben Vardanyan should be released immediately and unconditionally.\n\n2. Should the illegal trials proceed, they must happen before the prisoners' detention orders expire in May, must meet global legal standards, and international observers and media must be allowed to attend.\n\n3. The Azeri government must allow immediate access of the International Red Cross to assess the wellbeing of Ruben and the other prisoners. The family's access to telephone calls with Mr. Vardanyan must be restored.\n\n4. Any peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan must include the release of all ethnic Armenian political prisoners.\n\n5.

The family was finally able to plead with Mr. Vardanyan to end the hunger strike in light of his deteriorating health condition. In their brief conversation, they were able to inform him of the growing pressure on Azerbaijan from government officials around the world. After hearing of this global movement to free Armenian prisoners and after listening to his family's pleas, Mr. Vardanyan reluctantly agreed to pause his hunger strike for his family's sake. Mr. Vardanyan remains in captivity in Baku and faces worsening prison conditions. After his hunger strike began, he was denied regular telephone calls with family, adding to the list of Azerbaijan's violations of international norms. Mr. Vardanyan was also shifted to complete isolation with no access to appropriate health care beyond occasional evaluations of his blood pressure. Serious concerns remain about the true state of his health condition. \"We are gravely concerned about my father's deteriorating health, though we are not surprised by his bravery,\" said David Vardanyan, one of Mr. Vardanyan's sons. \"Despite our initial relief, my father's conditions are only worsening.

Firstly, the composition of the initiative group and the non-disclosure of the members' names raised suspicions.\n\nOn the other hand, the arguments put forward by the initiative group to nominate a prominent figure like Ruben Vardanyan for the Nobel Peace Prize...\n\nBecause Ruben Vardanyan has never been involved in any peace initiatives regarding the Garabagh issue; on the contrary, he has played a significant role in radicalizing Armenian-origin residents of the region and rejecting constructive dialogues proposed by official Baku. On the other hand, he directly contributed to the artificial humanitarian crisis in Garabagh.\n\nThe anti-terrorism measures implemented on September 19-20, 2023, were indeed a logical consequence of Vardanyan's and those like him activities in Garabagh. Instead of accepting constructive dialogue, embracing Azerbaijan's offered integration plan, and creating conditions for Armenian-origin residents to accept Azerbaijani citizenship, Vardanyan continued to fuel hostility among the Armenian residents of Garabagh.\n\nRuben Vardanyan's illegal entry into Garabagh by renouncing his Russian citizenship in September 2022 highlighted this even more prominently. How could his assumption of the fictitious role of \"minister\" in a region unrecognized by any country and accepted globally as an integral part of Azerbaijan constitute a peace initiative?\n\nOn the contrary, from November 2022 to February 2023 - for more than 4 months - Vardanyan, working as the \"minister\" of the puppet regime in Garabagh, contributed negatively to the process of resolving the Garabagh issue. After Azerbaijan restored its customs and border control on the Lachin road, Vardanyan became one of the main architects of the artificial \"humanitarian catastrophe\" and \"blockade show\" created in Garabagh.\n\nIn Ruben Vardanyan's interviews and statements regarding the Garabagh issue, it is almost impossible to find any mention of \"advancing peace initiatives\". His statements consist solely of expressions aimed at escalating the situation.\n\nLet's look at the facts.\n\nOn January 22, 2023, during his interview with BBC's \"HardTalk\" program, Ruben Vardanyan attempted to provoke Western audiences by making radical statements on behalf of the Armenian residents of Garabagh, portraying the actions of Azerbaijani eco-activists on the Lachin road as a \"blockade\", and trying to create the perception of a \"humanitarian catastrophe\" in Garabagh.\n\n\"We have said since the first day of the demand for independence: we understand and accept that we will live side by side, but we will be a separate territory, a separate state. We do not see ourselves as a part of Azerbaijan. \"Artsakh\" will not be a part of Azerbaijan, that is clear,\" Vardanyan said.\n\n\"We are sure that \"Artsakh\" should be independent and not part of Azerbaijan,\" he said in an interview with the Armenia service of Radio Liberty on May 23, 2023.\n\nOn May 29, 2023, Ruben Vardanyan made new radical statements. He reacted unacceptably to Azerbaijan's statement about the necessity for the Armenian residents of Garabagh to accept Azerbaijani citizenship. He described negotiations with Azerbaijan as unacceptable.\n\n\"It is no longer possible to continue the demagogy about supposedly defending the rights of Artsakh's people as a part of Azerbaijan. They want to destroy us or enslave us. The limit has been exceeded: either you stand up for Artsakh's defense, or you are against the entire Armenian people,\" Vardanyan said.\n\nIn his statements like this and others, it is impossible to find a call for peace, an initiative, or even a statement. What is the basis for trying to dress Vardanyan, who has been called to incite, prepare, and provoke the Armenian population against Azerbaijan into the costume of a \"peace bird\"?\n\nOr regarding Vardanyan's supposed services in preventing the \"humanitarian catastrophe\" in Garabagh... After Azerbaijan restored control over the Lachin road, Vardanyan opposed the opening of the Aghdam-Asgaran-Shusha road, tried to create artificial tensions there, and played a key role in creating humanitarian problems for the Armenian residents of Garabagh.\n\n\"Everyone who speaks about using the Aghdam-Shusha road serves Azerbaijan's interests,\" Ruben Vardanyan said on July 19, 2023, while commenting on the blocking of the section of the Aghdam-Shusha road by radical separatists.\n\nVardanyan, nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, directly applauded the prevention of the shipment of 40 tons of flour from the Azerbaijan Red Crescent Society to Azerbaijani citizens of Armenian origin in Garabagh from Baku amidst the humanitarian catastrophe show in Garabagh. Is this how one opposes humanitarian catastrophe?\n\nAnother issue related to Vardanyan involves his involvement in illegal financial activities. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) noted in its 2019 investigation titled \"The Troika Laundromat\" that \"Ruben Vardanyan, through his ownership of Troika Dialog, which was once Russia's largest investment bank, and through elaborate offshore companies created in the names of unsuspecting Armenian citizens, was implicated in laundering billions of dollars and profiting from various illegal operations.\" The investigation noted that the huge offshore network created by Vardanya carried out the circulation of billions of funds through banks belonging to the Russian Federation.\n\nAssociating the influential Nobel Prize with a figure like Vardanyan, whose business activities are entirely shady, is an example of absurdity.\n\nThe facts mentioned above alone indicate the groundlessness of the claims regarding Ruben Vardanyan's involvement in both peace initiatives and humanitarian activities; instead, they provide evidence of his skill as a financial trickster.\n\nThe group behind the idea of nominating Vardanyan for the Nobel Peace Prize also realizes the absurdity of this proposal. So, what is the purpose of spreading such information about Vardanyan and keeping him in the international spotlight?\n\nThe main reason is Ruben Vardanyan's wealth. According to information as of March 2024, the Vardanyan family possesses a fortune worth $1.1 billion. Considering that Ruben Vardanyan may not be able to lead his business empire in the coming years, it can be inferred that he is engaged in a struggle to access financial resources around his wealth. The emergence of suspicious, undisclosed groups behind the scenes, creating publicity around Vardanyan's name, is precisely the direct result of this struggle: how much money will people make from Vardanyan's wealth? Why not? As they say, 'directly permissible.'\n\nIt's no secret to anyone that Ruben Vardanyan's activity in Garabagh only serves to fuel separatist sentiments, escalation, and military confrontation. In this context, his nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize is nothing more than a cheap publicity stunt aimed at making money.\n\nWhat does Trump's return to White House promise for US and the world? -INTERVIEW Endless games of ICRC: Time comes for organization to leave Azerbaijan -ANALYTICS", "source": {"uri": "en.apa.az", "dataType": "news", "title": "Azeri -

According to an OCCRP (Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project) investigation, this company was used for secret money transfers to Putin's close friends. Between 2006 and 2013, more than $4.6 billion were pumped through the accounts of Vardanyan's offshore networks. In 2020, Russia's main opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, recently killed by the Kremlin regime, accused Vardanian of bribery of approximately $50 million.\n\nIn 2019, 22 members of the European Parliament initiated sanctions against Vardanyan as an \"associate of the Kremlin\".\n\nThree years later, in 2022, 46 members of the U.S. Congress put Vardanyan to the draft sanctions list, along with the Moscow regime's chief propagandist, Margarita Simonyan.\n\nAlso in 2022, Zelensky issued a decree, adding Vardanyan to Ukraine's sanctions lists as a person who provides \"Senior management of a systemically important Russian company that is involved in... support of actions that undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine\".\n\nFinally, in 2023, the SBU included Ruben Vardanyan to the \"Peacemaker\" database, stating that Vardanyan is subject to \"immediate transfer to law enforcement agencies of Ukraine or NATO countries\".\n\n\"Today in the Peacemaker, tomorrow the nominee for the Nobel Prize. Absurd!\", - wrote on his personal Facebook page Volodymyr Vatras - an MP from the Servant of the People party.\n\n\"Sometimes it seems to me that the world is going crazy. Last year it was Don Don, this year Vardanyan, maybe next you'll give the Nobel Peace Prize to Putin? It's surreal...\" - echoed his party colleague Anna Skorokhod.\n\nThe authors of the collective letter emphasize that people behind Vardanyan's nomination for the most prestigious award of the planet were Russian agents of influence. The fact that this is an operation to whiten the reputation of \"Putin's man\", who could potentially compete with Pashinyan, is evidenced by the \"launch\" into infospace of the news by Russia's primary media sources, Sputnik and RBC. The owner of the latter, Grigory Berezkin, is also under sanctions by the EU, Canada, Britain and Australia.\n\nIn their letter, Ukrainian parliament members further summarize: \"We call on the Nobel Committee to reject the application of Vardanyan's accomplices, as it is impossible for a proven criminal to serve the cause of peace\".", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.ro", "dataType": "news", "title":

Vardanyan's family has called for the immediate and unconditional release of all illegally detained Armenian prisoners, demanding that their trials, if they proceed, adhere to global legal standards and be open to international observers and media.\n\nAzerbaijan/Russia\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev met at the Kremlin on April 22 to discuss bilateral relations and regional security matters. Putin recognized the strong and evolving nature of the relationship between their two countries. He emphasized the importance of addressing regional security concerns. Aliyev echoed Putin's views, expressing hope that the meeting would invigorate the relationship between Russia and Azerbaijan. He stressed the ongoing presence of regional security issues on their agenda and conveyed satisfaction with their progress in resolving them. Aliyev further emphasized Russia's pivotal role in ensuring regional security, both within the South Caucasus and beyond. He highlighted the critical cooperation between their countries in addressing these challenges and maintaining stability in the broader geographical context.\n\nTurkey\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sparked concern with his recent statements, delivered during a press conference on April 23, one day ahead of Armenian Genocide remembrance day. \"It's time to abandon baseless memories,\" he said. This declaration, coupled with his emphasis on establishing a \"new order\" in the region, raised alarm about Turkey's intentions regarding Armenia. \"It's better to act in accordance with the current realities. Pashinyan understands this as well. Now is the time to create new road maps on a realistic basis,\" Erdogan said. His call for a \"realistic\" road map suggests encroachments on Armenian sovereignty. Erdogan's remarks took a particularly ominous turn when he warned, \"Doors of opportunity don't stay open forever,\" implying that Armenia has limited choices and and could face consequences for defiance.", "source": {"uri": "armenianweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Armenian Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hoory_minoyan@armenianweekly.com", "name": "Hoory Minoyan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Artsakh"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashalty", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dashalty"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dashalty"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shusha", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shusha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shusha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Vardanyan_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruben Vardanyan (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MI5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilham_Aliyev", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilham Aliyev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cultural heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baku"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baku"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Azerbaijan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Azerbaijan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunger strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armenian genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcaucasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transcaucasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Turkey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Turkey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Micronations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Micronations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://armenianweekly.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bleh.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508043", "eventUri": "eng-9508043", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-05", "textStart": 861, "textEnd": 868}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 1491, "textEnd": 1499}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 2410, "textEnd": 2418}], "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Siranush Sahakyan, representative of the interests of Armenian prisoners of war at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and president of the International and Comparative Law Center, spoke about this in an interview with Armenian News-NEWS.am.\n\nThe human rights activist noted that the presence of international organizations was prohibited in that regard: they were deprived of the opportunity to visit Armenians, record the situation, and report to the international community. \"This policy is more strictly applied to the former officials of Artsakh, including Ruben Vardanyan. It is disturbing that Vardanyan exercised his rights through a hunger strike, which, as a rule, is a consequence of laws being broken. A hunger strike is a tool through which one can try to solve problems by attracting the attention of local authorities or the international community,\" added Sahakyan.\n\nShe noted that within the framework of exercising this right, the access of representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is limited, which means that information about his health condition and other important circumstances is being hidden.\n\n\"In that sense, we are dealing with risks that do not arise from the principles of international law and humanitarian law. These individuals have been given the domestic status of an arrested person. They should be protected by international norms, contact with the outside world should be ensured, including meetings and contact with family members as well as with local and foreign lawyers,\" said Sahakyan.\n\nThe human rights activist emphasized that, taking into account Armenian-Azerbaijani relations, the aforementioned individuals are deprived of the right to consular visits.\n\n\"When foreigners are in prison, visits are organized through consular services in order to prevent torture and protect the rights of these persons. Armenia should deal with this issue, even in the conditions where it is impossible for Armenia to directly exercise this right.\n\nIt may be delegated to a third country. There are countries with friendly positions that should take responsibility and visit the Armenians held there at any cost. At this stage, visits to Ruben Vardanyan are particularly important,\" Sahakyan explained. According to her estimation, the state is making certain efforts to return the Armenians kept in Azerbaijan.\n\n\"My main concern was that the political solution to these problems, which were inevitable, was intertwined with the solution to problems of an interstate nature. An autonomous approach to humanitarian issues has not been demonstrated, whereas humanitarian issues should be resolved more easily than political issues related to borders and territorial integrity.\n\nThe humanitarian problems of the Armenians held there should be solved alongside the global issues. We consider this unacceptable,\" said the human rights activist. She called on both the authorities of Armenia and the international community to solve these problems as quickly as possible, regardless of the existence of other issues.\n\n\"This is a question of fundamental rights. We are talking about a person in illegal detention whose rights are violated, including correspondence with relatives, freedom of speech, and the right not to be tortured.\n\nThe question of Ruben Vardanyan and the other leaders of Artsakh is presented within the framework of international protests. The state is presenting the issue of persons captured in the 2023 attack.\n\nPerhaps we should adopt the approach of the complaint submitted to the ECHR and the decisions made within the framework of this process. But there are other international mechanisms. The United Nations has a working group on arbitrary detention, where families submit individual complaints to international human rights organizations.\n\nHere, I will single out the role of local human rights organizations, which should inform international structures, while the latter, through appeals, resolutions and other tools, should record the reality and ensure the release of the illegally arrested. Ruben Vardanyan confirms, even in the current conditions, that values are more important than life itself,\" added Sahakyan.\n\nThe human rights activist attached great importance to the provision of access to independent international structures for illegally detained persons and the organization of an immediate visit of ICRC representatives, as well as the provision of other mechanisms, including consular visits.\n\nAccording to Sahakyan, these are the primary means without which it is not possible to protect life, health, and other fundamental rights. Referring to the ICRC's agreed steps with Azerbaijan, she noted that, under international pressure, Baku should ensure the entry permit of the representatives of the Red Cross.\n\n\"As for the presence of international structures, they should be consistently addressing Azerbaijan, but again, Azerbaijan itself should allow them to visit the Armenians held there. I think, in the case of consistent calls, the bans on Azerbaijani are also important, and the international community should respond to it separately,\" concluded the human rights activist.", "source": {"uri": "news.am", "dataType": "news", "title": "NEWS.am"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Vardanyan_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ruben Vardanyan (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armenians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_activists", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human rights activists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hunger strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Vardanyan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik Vardanyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Artsakh"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Court of Human Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prisoner of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Committee of the Red Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_arrest_and_detention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arbitrary arrest and detention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baku"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baku"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Multi-Issue", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Multi-Issue", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://news.am/img/news/81/97/45/default.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508043", "eventUri": "eng-9508043", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

She must be allowed to return home urgently.\n\n\"This young woman has been treated in the most horrific way and simply wants to go home.\"\n\nSinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald told the D\u00e1il that Ms Towey had been the victim of domestic violence and is subject to a travel ban over alleged charges as she urged the Taoiseach to intervene.\n\nRadha Stirling, CEO of advocacy group Detained in Dubai, described the case and the travel ban against Ms Towey as \"outrageous\".\n\n\"Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive\", added Stirling, who has helped in numerous domestic violence cases including that of Dubai's Princess Latifa.\n\n\"The UAE used to charge rape victims with sex outside marriage. Now they're charging domestic violence victims with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\n\n\"We are calling on Dubai authorities to urgently drop the charges against Tori, remove the travel ban and let her fly home to Ireland with her mother.\n\n\"We are also calling on Ireland's prime minister Simon Harris, the head of Foreign Affairs Miche\u00e1l Martin, Ambassador Alison Milton and local TDs Michael Fitzmaurice, Claire Kerrane and Denis Naughten as well as the UAE's Ambassador to Ireland, HE Mohammed Hmoud Hamad Rahma Alshamsi to help bring Tori home.\"\n\nWhile speaking to RT\u00c9 Radio One's Morning Ireland, Ms Stirling has confirmed Ms Towey is currently living in an Airbnb.\n\n\"Right now, she's just happy to be with her mother in safety, because this is all very recent, but she is able to leave the apartment and move freely within the country,\" she said.\n\nMs Towey would like Taoiseach Simon Harris to speak to Ireland's counterparts in the UAE.\n\n\"Just simply say: 'We can't have this. This is obviously an error on behalf of the Dubai police. This never should have been charged or prosecuted'.\n\n\"And they need to be trained on victim care more than anything, and hopefully the Government of Dubai will see that these charges shouldn't happen and they need to protect women.\n\n\"It's terrible PR for the country. You're going to have people worried to go there in the future. And of course, this is on the back of historically charging rape victims with sex outside marriage so they don't have the best reputation to start with. They've been trying to improve it.\n\n\"So I think there'll be agreeable with the Irish government if there's enough diplomatic pressure put on them, letting them know that we absolutely want Tori home and there's just going to be no negotiation on that,\" she added.\n\nTori Towey is due to appear in court next week.\n\n\"In a best-case scenario, they will simply say: 'We're not going to proceed beyond this hearing- and we're going to let you go'.\n\n\"When it comes to a case like this, it's all about diplomacy. Without the support of the Irish government, she would be likely to face prison and charges and deportation.\n\n\"With the support of the Irish government and diplomacy and there has been a lot - various members of the Irish government have contacted UAE ambassador to Ireland, and of course, Ireland's ambassador in the UAE, and they're trying to get those diplomatic talks happening.\n\n\"If that happens, that is the best and fastest way to get her home,\" Ms Stirling added.\n\nThe 28-year-old Emirates Airlines cabin crew employee, now faces lengthy imprisonment in jails that are notorious for human rights abuses and torture, according to Detained in Dubai.\n\nMs Towey moved to Dubai in April 2023 for a job with Emirates.\n\nThe airline gave her time off work to recover after she suffered the injuries at her home, according to the human rights group.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald told the D\u00e1il she said she had spoken to Ms Towey and that her mother had travelled to Dubai to be with her.\n\n\"Tori wants to come home, simple as that. She is a Roscommon woman and she wants to come home,\" she said.\n\n\"I am asking now, as a matter of absolute urgency, that we have a statement from this House, that you intervene Taoiseach, that the ambassador is called and that it is made absolutely plain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way, and an Irish citizen, an Irish woman will not be treated in this way.\"\n\nMr Harris responded saying he was not aware of Ms Towey's case, and thanked Ms McDonald for bringing it to his attention and that of the Foreign Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin.\n\nHe pledged to work \"to intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen in what sounds to be, based on what you tell me, the most appalling circumstances\".\n\nLocal Sinn F\u00e9in TD Claire Kerrane, who knows Ms Towey's family, said the flight attendant was in a \"living nightmare\".\n\n\"I am determined to work with the ambassador, Foreign Affairs Minister and anyone necessary to ensure that her release is secured without delay,\" she told the Irish Independent.\n\nAccording to Detained in Dubai, Ms Towey found out there was a travel ban against her when replacing her passport, but wasn't sure why.\n\nShe arranged to fly home to Ireland but when she arrived at the airport, was told a case against her had been dropped but that the travel ban remained.\n\n\"She attended the police station who assured her the travel ban would be lifted but it never happened. She was stuck,\" said Ms Stirling.\n\nTori was told nothing could be done and that the cases against her were going to court on July 18, according to Detained in Dubai.\n\n\"The UAE has gone to great public relations efforts to promote alcohol as legal in the country. In reality, people are still regularly charged with alcohol consumption and possession,\" added Stirling.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed it is aware of Ms Towey's situation.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs is aware of the case and is providing consular assistance.\n\n\"As with all consular cases, the department does not comment on the details of individual cases.\"", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The system over there, rather than protecting this woman who is an Irish citizen, chose instead to detain her, to charge her. She's now under the most incredible stress.\"\n\nMs McDonald told the Dail that Ms Towey's passport was blocked and she cannot return to Ireland.\n\n\"Tori wants to come home. It is as simple as that. She is a Roscommon woman, and she wants to come home,\" The Sinn Fein TD told the Dail.\n\nTaoiseach Simon Harris vowed to intervene to help Ms Towey and \"see how we can support an Irish citizen\" in the \"most appalling circumstances\".\n\nHuman rights lawyer Radha Stirling, CEO of campaign group Detained in Dubai, is assisting Ms Towey and her family and called on Dubai authorities to \"urgently drop the charges against Tori\".\n\n\"Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive,\" Ms Stirling said.\n\n\"It's amazing that authorities did not intervene for Tori's protection, given the state her body was in when she was hospitalised the first time.\n\n\"Emirates Airlines, the Irish Embassy and the UAE medical and police services could certainly have done more to help Tori.\"\n\nShe added: \"The UAE used to charge rape victims with sex outside marriage. Now they're charging domestic violence victims with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption. Dubai police need to be educated on victim care.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Harris told the Dail that the travel ban imposed on Ms Towey has been lifted and \"the embassy will take take Tori to the airport as soon as she is ready to go\".\n\nThe Taoiseach said he had spoken to Ms Towey and her mother and told them getting her home was \"a priority issue\".\n\nMr Harris added: \"No effort will be spared by us, by Ireland, to make progress on this matter and to get Tori Towey home.\n\n\"She doesn't need to come home after a court case because she is not a criminal. She is a victim of gender-based violence. We expect her to be able to return here to Ireland as an Irish citizen without delay.\"\n\nIn an update shared on social media on Wednesday afternoon, Detained in Dubai said the charges against Ms Towey have been officially withdrawn by police in Dubai and the travel ban lifted.\n\n\"Tori and her mother are both over the moon and we are ever grateful for widespread support of the public, the media and the Irish government,\" the advocacy group said.\n\n\"We hope her transit at the airport will go smoothly and that no further attempts will be made to keep her in the country.

I'm asking the Taoiseach to please help us.'\n\nThe DiD has said Ms Towey could face a lengthy prison sentence in a jail known for 'human rights abuses and torture'.\n\nIrish premier Simon Harris has said he will work to intervene in the 'appalling' case, while Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald raised Ms Towey's case in the Irish Parliament on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nMr Harris thanked Ms McDonald for bringing the case to his attention, saying: 'I'm not directly appraised of the situation, but I'm very happy to be directly appraised of it now.'\n\nHe said he would work with the deputy 'to intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen in what sounds to be - based on what you tell me - the most appalling circumstances'.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs told the Irish Daily Mail it was aware of the case and was offering consular assistance.\n\nMs McDonald told Dail Eireann that Ms Towey has been the victim of domestic violence and is subject to a travel ban over alleged charges.\n\nMs Towey, who graduated from the Dublin Institute Of Technology, moved to the UAE in April 2023\n\nTori is pictured in 2021, before her move to the UAE - where she now hopes to return to Ireland\n\nShe said she has spoken to Ms Towey, and that the 28-year-old's mother has travelled to Dubai to be with her.\n\n'Tori wants to come home, simple as that. She is a Roscommon woman and she wants to come home,' she said.\n\n'I am asking now, as a matter of absolute urgency, that we have a statement from this House, that you intervene Taoiseach, that the ambassador is called and that it is made absolutely plain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way, and an Irish citizen, an Irish woman will not be treated in this way.'\n\nMr Harris responded saying he was not aware of Ms Towey's case, and thanked Ms McDonald for bringing it to his attention and that of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Micheal Martin.\n\nHe pledged to work 'to intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen in what sounds to be, based on what you tell me, the most appalling circumstances'.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs told the Irish Daily Mail it was aware of the case and was offering consular assistance.\n\nRadha Stirling, CEO of Detained in Dubai (DiD) claims Tori's husband went after her with a knife and punched her, before slamming her arm in the bathroom door trying to break it. She says he was later fired by Emirates over his alleged behaviour.\n\nMs Stirling said: 'We are calling on Dubai authorities to urgently drop the charges against Tori, remove the travel ban and let her fly home to Ireland with her mother. She has been charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\n\n'Strangely, the UAE has gone to great public relations efforts to promote alcohol as legal in the country. In reality, people are still regularly charged with alcohol consumption and possession. Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive.'\n\nRadha Stirling, CEO of DiD says Tori's husband attacked her with a knife and punched her, before slamming her arm in the bathroom door trying to break it. Pictured the injuries said to be from the alleged attack\n\nThe 28-year-old moved to the UAE in April 2023 when she was offered a job as a flight attendant with Emirates\n\nShe explained: 'Tori arranged to fly home to Ireland but, when she arrived at the airport, was told a case against her by her husband had been dropped but the travel ban remained.\n\n'She attended the police station who assured her the travel ban would be lifted but it never happened. The next day, Tori and her husband had some wine and he became enraged, accusing her of having an affair.'\n\nMs Towey then attempted to take her own life and ended up in a police station.\n\nMs Stirling explained: 'The next thing she remembers is an ambulance crew and police waking her up. She was taken to Al Barsha police station and kept for several hours before going home again.\n\n'Her mother pleaded to the Irish Consulate but in the absence of their assistance, boarded a flight to Dubai. When she arrived, she wasn't allowed to see Tori alone, her abuser wouldn't allow it.\n\n'The three met at Emirates mall then attended the prosecutor's office to find out what charges had been registered against her.'\n\nThe airline hostess has been told 'nothing could be done' and that the case will be going to court on July 18.\n\nIf you need to talk to someone, call the Samaritans for

Tori did not deserve to be charged in the first place and should be allowed to go home immediately.'\n\nA spokesperson for the group claimed Ms Towey's South African husband went after her with a knife and punched her, before slamming her arm in the bathroom door trying to break it.\n\nTori Towey has been left stranded in Dubai after being faced with an attempted suicide charge\n\nIt was announced this morning that authorities have offered the Irish Emirates worker a lawyer\n\nTori was pictured with extensive bruises over her body, which she says are from an assault\n\nMs Towey said she tried to take her own life after the attack, which left her with severe bruises and injuries.\n\nBut after being taken to a police station, she is now facing charges of alcohol consumption and attempting suicide by a court in Dubai.\n\nShe said she is unable to leave the country as her passport was blocked, meaning she can't travel back home to Ireland.\n\nSpeaking through outreach group DiD, who are assisting the family, Ms Towey said: 'I don't know what's going to happen in court next week.\n\nDubai's draconian laws: Why attempting suicide and drinking alcohol is a 'crime'\n\nPrior to 2019, anyone found guilty of attempting suicide in Dubai faced a 5000AED fine (\u00a31050) or six months in prison.\n\nThe 'offence' was one of 28 'minor crimes' downgraded to free up space in the Emirates' overcrowded courts system.\n\nThose found guilty of attempting suicide in the Gulf state now have to pay a fine of 1000AED (\u00a3210) instead of facing a judge.\n\nIn the same year, the Gulf state loosened its liquor laws to allow tourists to purchase alcohol in state-controlled stores, previously only accessible to licence-holding residents.\n\nThe new laws also let visitors obtain liquor permits themselves for the first time, by applying online or going to a registered alcohol store to get one for free.\n\nEven in your own home, it is illegal to drink without holding a permit.\n\nIt is also illegal to drink or even be under the influence of alcohol in public, outside of a licensed premises.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'I'm desperate to go home to Ireland and put all of this in the past. I'm asking the Taoiseach to please help us.'\n\nThe DiD has said Ms Towey could face a lengthy prison sentence in a jail known for 'human rights abuses and torture'.\n\nRadha Stirling, CEO of Detained in Dubai, said: 'We are calling on Dubai authorities to urgently drop the charges against Tori, remove the travel ban and let her fly home to Ireland with her mother. She has been charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\n\n'Strangely, the UAE has gone to great public relations efforts to promote alcohol as legal in the country. In reality, people are still regularly charged with alcohol consumption and possession. Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive.'\n\nShe explained: 'Tori arranged to fly home to Ireland but, when she arrived at the airport, was told a case against her by her husband had been dropped but the travel ban remained.\n\n'She attended the police station who assured her the travel ban would be lifted but it never happened. The next day, Tori and her husband had some wine and he became enraged, accusing her of having an affair.'\n\nMs Towey then attempted to take her own life and ended up in a police station.\n\nMs Stirling explained: 'The next thing she remembers is an ambulance crew and police waking her up. She was taken to Al Barsha police station and kept for several hours before going home again.\n\n'Her mother pleaded to the Irish Consulate but in the absence of their assistance, boarded a flight to Dubai. When she arrived, she wasn't allowed to see Tori alone, her abuser wouldn't allow it.\n\n'The three met at Emirates mall then attended the prosecutor's office to find out what charges had been registered against her.'\n\nMs Towey, who graduated from the Dublin Institute Of Technology, moved to the UAE in April 2023\n\nTori is pictured in 2021, before her move to the UAE - where she now hopes to return to Ireland\n\nIrish premier Simon Harris has said he will work to intervene in the 'appalling' case, while Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald raised Ms Towey's case in the Irish Parliament on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nMr Harris thanked Ms McDonald for bringing the case to his attention, saying: 'I'm not directly appraised of the situation, but I'm very happy to be directly appraised of it now.'\n\nHe said he would work with the deputy 'to intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen in what sounds to be - based on what you tell me - the most appalling circumstances'.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs told the Irish Daily Mail it was aware of the case and was offering consular assistance.\n\nMs McDonald told Dail Eireann that Ms Towey has been the victim of domestic violence and is subject to a travel ban over alleged charges.\n\nShe said she has spoken to Ms Towey, and that the 28-year-old's mother has travelled to Dubai to be with her.\n\n'Tori wants to come home, simple as that. She is a Roscommon woman and she wants to come home,' she said.\n\n'I am asking now, as a matter of absolute urgency, that we have a statement from this House, that you intervene Taoiseach, that the ambassador is called and that it is made absolutely plain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way, and an Irish citizen, an Irish woman will not be treated in this way.'\n\nRadha Stirling, CEO of DiD says Tori's husband attacked her with a knife and punched her, before slamming her arm in the bathroom door trying to break it. Pictured the injuries said to be from the alleged attack\n\nThe 28-year-old moved to the UAE in April 2023 when she was offered a job as a flight attendant with Emirates\n\nMr Harris responded saying he was not aware of Ms Towey's case, and thanked Ms McDonald for bringing it to his attention and that of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Micheal Martin.\n\nHe pledged to work 'to intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen in what sounds to be, based on what you tell me, the most appalling circumstances'.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs told the Irish Daily Mail it was aware of the case and was offering consular assistance.\n\nTalking to Sky News, Tori's aunt Ann Flynn said: 'She's doing her best.' She added: 'It's very stressful, it's stressful for all the family.'\n\nShe described her niece as 'a beautiful young woman' who is 'fun-loving and loved to travel'.\n\nMs Flynn said: 'She got the job of her dreams working for Emirates, and she could continue travelling with work.\n\n'She loved Dubai, and had a good network of friends there.'\n\nThe airline hostess has been told 'nothing could be done' and that the case will be going to court on July 18.\n\nIf you need to talk to someone, call the Samaritans for free on 116 123 or visit Samaritans.org", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

Roscommon, is not allowed to leave the country and faces imprisonment instead for attempted suicide as well as drinking alcohol.\n\nTaoiseach Simon Harris yesterday responded to Ms Towey's plight, telling the D\u00e1il he was ready to 'intervene' in the case, which he described as 'appalling'. He was replying to Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald, who called on the Government to take action over the situation.\n\nMs Towey moved to the UAE in April 2023 when she began work as a flight attendant with Emirates. She married a South African man and they had been living together until their relationship allegedly became abusive. It is also alleged he ripped up her passport when she tried to leave and physically abused her. While in the process of replacing her passport, she found out there was a travel ban against her but wasn't sure why.\n\nOutreach group Detained in Dubai (DiD), which is helping Ms Towey, confirmed it is commonplace for spouses to open preemptive cases against the victim to try to immunise themselves from their own criminal cases.\n\nSpeaking through DiD, Ms Towey said: 'I don't know what's going to happen in court next week. I'm desperate to go home to Ireland and put all of this in the past. I'm asking the Taoiseach to please help us.'\n\nMs McDonald told the D\u00e1il: 'Following one particularly severe beating, in which her husband repeatedly tried to break her arm, Tori escaped upstairs and she attempted to take her own life.\n\n'Tori now faces charges in Dubai of attempted suicide and the abuse of alcohol. The system over there, rather than protecting this woman who is an Irish citizen, chose instead to detain her, to charge her. She's now under the most incredible stress.'\n\nShe continued: 'Tori wants to come home, simple as that. She's a Roscommon woman. She wants to come home. And I'm asking now, as a matter of absolute urgency, that we have a statement from this House, that you intervene, Taoiseach, that the Ambassador comes in and that you explain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way. That an Irish citizen, an Irish woman will not be treated in this way.'\n\nMr Harris thanked Ms McDonald for bringing the case to his attention, saying: 'I'm not directly appraised of the situation, but I'm very happy to be directly appraised of it now.'\n\nHe said he would work with the deputy 'to intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen in what sounds to be - based on what you tell me - the most appalling circumstances'.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs said it was aware of the case and was offering consular assistance.\n\nDiD founder Radha Stirling said Ms Towey is terrified she may go to jail and was interrogated for hours. She added: 'Tori arranged to fly home to Ireland but, when she arrived at the airport, was told a case against her by her husband had been dropped but the travel ban remained.\n\n'She attended the police station who assured her the travel ban would be lifted but it never happened. The next day, Tori and her husband had some wine and he became enraged, accusing her of having an affair.'\n\nMs Towey then attempted to take her own life and ended up in a police station.\n\nMs Stirling explained: 'Once she was discharged she was brought to a police station. The next thing she remembers is an ambulance crew and police waking her up. She was taken to Al Barsha police station and kept for several hours before going home again.\n\n'Her mother pleaded to the Irish Consulate but in the absence of their assistance, boarded a flight to Dubai.

Ms Towey was told nothing could be done and the cases against her were going to court on July 18. She had been charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption. 'Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive,' said Ms Stirling.\n\n'It's amazing that authorities did not intervene for Tori's protection, given the state her body was in when she was hospitalised the first time.' She added: 'Worse than failing her, authorities travelbanned her and kept her in the country when she was trying to get away. They put her in a hopeless position resulting in her attempt to kill herself to escape the imminent threat of assault and likely murder.\n\n'As if that wasn't enough, Dubai police then want to prosecute her for trying to get away via the only means she saw available at the time. It's outrageous, it's broken.'", "source": {"uri": "extra.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Extra.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Lou_McDonald", "type":

She has been charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\n\n'Strangely, the UAE has gone to great public relations efforts to promote alcohol as legal in the country. In reality, people are still regularly charged with alcohol consumption and possession. Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive.'\n\nShe explained: 'Tori arranged to fly home to Ireland but, when she arrived at the airport, was told a case against her by her husband had been dropped but the travel ban remained.\n\n'She attended the police station who assured her the travel ban would be lifted but it never happened. The next day, Tori and her husband had some wine and he became enraged, accusing her of having an affair.'\n\nMs Stirling explained: 'The next thing she remembers is an ambulance crew and police waking her up. She was taken to Al Barsha police station and kept for several hours before going home again.\n\n'Her mother pleaded to the Irish Consulate but in the absence of their assistance, boarded a flight to Dubai.

Pictured the injuries said to be from the alleged attack\n\nThe 28-year-old moved to the UAE in April 2023 when she was offered a job as a flight attendant with Emirates\n\nIn 2018, one member of Dubai Police said that they would focus on treatment rather than punishment when it came to suicide victims, even though suicide and suicide attempts are a crime in the country.\n\nBrig Ahmed bin Ghalaita, then director of Al Refaa Police Station, told The National: 'The move is taken to provide support to suicide attempters and deal with them as victims who need moral support and help.\n\n'Suicide cases are being examined by a police unit and experts in the psychology field to identify the causes behind their attempts and find solutions for them.'\n\nIt comes as earlier this year, British wives boasting of luxury new lives funded by millionaire husbands in Dubai have been warned they risk being dumped homeless on the streets at any moment.\n\nExperts have revealed a surge in complaints from not only women but also men betrayed and dumped by wealthy partners after upping sticks for the Middle East.\n\nThe alert comes amid a TikTok and Instagram trend of UK women sharing footage of spending sprees in the United Arab Emirates after wedding wealthy husbands.\n\nMailOnline had also reported on an influx of expats pampered by rich partners, enjoying days filled with shopping trips, extravagant meals and property upgrades.\n\nDubai's draconian laws: Why attempting suicide and drinking alcohol is a 'crime'\n\nPrior to 2019, anyone found guilty of attempting suicide in Dubai faced a 5000AED fine (\u00a31050) or six months in prison.\n\nThe 'offence' was one of 28 'minor crimes' downgraded to free up space in the Emirates' overcrowded courts system.\n\nThose found guilty of attempting suicide in the Gulf state now have to pay a fine of 1000AED (\u00a3210) instead of facing a judge.\n\nIn the same year, the Gulf state loosened its liquor laws to allow tourists to purchase alcohol in state-controlled stores, previously only accessible to licence-holding residents.\n\nThe new laws also let visitors obtain liquor permits themselves for the first time, by applying online or going to a registered alcohol store to get one for free.\n\nWhile visitors must have a permit, it's no longer a criminal offence not to have one.\n\nA 30 per cent tax on alcohol was also axed on New Year's Eve 2022 to encourage tourists to flock to the Emirate.\n\nWhile the relaxation of the laws sends a message that it's safe to drink, the reality is more complicated.\n\nIt is illegal to drink or even be under the influence of alcohol in public outside of a licensed premises.\n\nRadha Stirling, founder and CEO of Detained in Dubai previously told MailOnline: 'Reducing the cost of alcohol in Dubai is sending a clear message to tourists and that is to drink. Considering Dubai's alcohol laws prohibit the possession of alcohol in public, drinking in Dubai is inherently dangerous.\n\n'If a visitor's blood is tested and shows up even one drink, they can be criminally charged. Alcohol tests are often conducted when a complaint is made by a local. If a local is offended by a visitor's dress sense, language or behaviour, they may call the police and have the visitor arrested, even if that person has only consumed a small beer.\n\n'Dubai's laws are highly contradictory. On the one hand, people are encouraged to drink but on the other, it's a criminal offence to have any amount of alcohol in your blood in public. Encouraging visitors to drink more alcohol will most certainly result in increased detentions of Brits abroad in prisons notorious for human rights abuses and police brutality'.", "source": {"uri":

I'm asking the Taoiseach to please help us.\"\n\nTori's mother Caroline added: \"We are calling on our local representatives, the Department of Foreign Affairs, embassy and Taoiseach to please do everything to get my daughter home safely.\n\n\"She's been through the worst time of her life and needs to come home with me and heal.\"\n\nAn advocacy group has also urged the Irish government to intervene to have the charges against Tori dropped and to allow her to travel home.\n\nRadha Stirling, CEO of Detained in Dubai, branded the case and the travel ban against Ms Towey as \"outrageous.\"\n\nStirling, who has helped in numerous domestic violence cases including that of Princess Latifa, said: \"Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive.\n\n\"It's amazing that authorities did not intervene for Tori's protection, given the state her body was in when she was hospitalised the first time.\n\nDubai cops 'need to be educated'\n\n\"Worse than failing her, authorities in Dubai actually travel-banned her and kept her in the country when she was trying to get away.\n\n\"The UAE used to charge rape victims with sex outside marriage. Now they're charging violence victims with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption. Dubai police need to be educated on victim care.\n\n\"We are calling on Dubai authorities to urgently drop the charges against Tori, remove the travel ban and let her fly home to Ireland with her mother.\n\n\"We are also calling on Ireland's Taoiseach Simon Harris, the head of Foreign Affairs Micheal Martin, Ambassador Alison Milton and local TDs, Michael Fitzmaurice, Claire Kerrane and Denis Naughten as well as the UAE's Ambassador to Ireland, H.E. Mohammed Hmoud Hamad Rahma Alshamsi to help bring Tori home.\"\n\nMs McDonald outlined how Tori was being detained in Dubai after attempting to take her own life in the wake of \"one particularly severe beating\".\n\nAnd with Tori stranded in the United Arab Emirates facing criminal charges, the Sinn Fein boss pleaded for the Taoiseach to intervene to help get the Roscommon woman home.\n\nMs McDonald said: \"She has been the victim of the most gross domestic violence.\n\n'Severe beating'\n\n\"Her passport has been destroyed. There was a travel ban imposed on her and she had gone to the authorities seeking protection many times but to absolutely no avail.\n\n\"But following one particularly severe beating in which her husband repeatedly tried to slam doors on her arms and break her limbs, she escaped upstairs and she attempted to take her own life.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Tori now faces charges in Dubai of attempted suicide and the abuse of alcohol, the system over there rather than protecting this woman who is an Irish citizen, chose instead to detain her to charge her.\"\n\nThe Sinn Fein supremo told how she talked to Tori on the phone today.\n\nUnder 'most incredible stress'\n\nMs McDonald continued: \"She's now under the most incredible stress when I spoke to her this afternoon.\n\n\"Her mother Caroline has travelled to be with her. Tori wants to come home. Simple as that. She's a Roscommon woman, she wants to come home.\n\n\"And I'm asking now as a matter of absolute urgency that we have a statement from this house, that you intervene, that the ambassador is called and it made absolutely plain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way. And an Irish citizen, an Irish woman will not be treated in this way.\"\n\nTaoiseach Harris told the Dail that he is ready to \"intervene\" after branding Tori's plight \"the most appalling circumstances\".\n\nHe said: \"Thank you, Deputy McDonald, for bringing the case of Tori to my attention.\n\n\"I'm not directly appraised of the situation, but I'm very happy to be directly appraised of it now.\"\n\nThe Taoiseach pledged to work with the deputy \"to intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen in what sounds to be - based on what you tell me - the most appalling circumstances\".\n\n'Absolutely frightening'\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed it was aware of the case.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department told the Irish Sun: \"The Department of Foreign Affairs is aware of the case and is providing consular assistance. As with all consular cases, the Department does not comment on the details of individual cases.\"\n\nClaire Kerrane, Sinn Fein TD for Roscommon & Galway, also vowed to press Tanaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Micheal Martin for help.\n\nKerrane said: \"This is absolutely frightening. I have been in touch with Micheal Martin and I will be raising this in the Dail. The Irish Government needs to intervene on this urgently.\"\n\nDubai move\n\nTori moved to Dubai in April 2023 when she was offered a job with Emirates Airlines.\n\nBut the cabin crew employee's life in the United Arab Emirates turned into a nightmare after she was attacked in her home.\n\nTori says the trauma of the assault led to an attempt to take her own life.\n\nAnd as the shocked victim tried to return home to Ireland, she later discovered she had been charged by Dubai authorities with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption - and was subject to a travel ban.\n\nDetained in Dubai said: \"The victim is charged.\n\n\"Tori was told nothing could be done and that the cases against her were going to court on the 18th of July.\n\n\"She had been charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\n\n\"Strangely, the UAE has gone to great public relations efforts to promote alcohol as legal in the country.

But I just wanted to inform the House of that news,\" he said.\n\nMs Towey (28) is facing criminal charges and had been banned from leaving Dubai. She suffered severe bruising and other injuries that required hospital treatment after she was allegedly attacked in her home, according to human rights group Detained in Dubai.\n\nMs Towey, who is from Boyle in Co Roscommon, is now facing charges \"of attempted suicide and the abuse of alcohol\" and is desperate to come home.\n\nShe moved to Dubai in April 2023 for a job with Emirates and is due to appear in court next week.\n\nMr Harris this morning described the situation facing Irish woman Tori Towey in Dubai as \"unimaginable\" and said it is his priority to get Ms Towey back to her home in Ireland.\n\nSpeaking to media at Leinster House, Mr Harris said he spoke with Ms Towey and her mother Caroline this morning.\n\n\"I don't want to say too much because there is a lot of diplomatic activity going on in the background. Tori has been through in my view the most horrific situation and it is utterly, utterly unacceptable how an Irish citizen is being treated, that is my language in terms of how I feel,\" the Taoiseach said.\n\n\"Tori has been a victim of male violence and she needs to be supported. She needs to be brought back home to her home here in Ireland,\" Mr Harris added.\n\nThe Taoiseach said earlier he had also spoken to the T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Miche\u00e1l Martin on the situation as well as the Irish Ambassador, who the Taoiseach said has been working on Ms Towey's case for \"a period of time\".\n\nTodays News in 90 Seconds - 10th July 2024\n\n\"I had a conversation with the T\u00e1naiste who is also working on this matter as our Minister for Foreign Affairs.\n\n\"I have spoken to our ambassador in the region as well who have been in constant contact with her on this matter since yesterday.\n\n\"I want to acknowledge our ambassador and embassy team have been working on this case for a period of time and let me just say there is a lot of work going on in the background here,\" the Taoiseach said.\n\nMr Harris described Ms Towey's situation as \"unimaginable\" and said he will support Ms Towey in getting home.\n\n\"What Tori has been through is, I think, unimaginable for so many people. A woman who has been the victim of a brutal attack, to find herself waking up not in a hospital but in a police station,\" the Taoiseach said.\n\n\"It is my absolute priority as the Taoiseach of this country to get Tori, an Irish citizen, back home to Roscommon and I will be staying in regular contact with her and her mum and supporting them,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking to RT\u00c9 Radio One's Morning Ireland, the aunt of Tori Towey said Tori and her mother Caroline are very nervous about the situation and the family in Roscommon are hoping they will get word they are on a plane on the way home.\n\n\"I don't know will this court case go ahead and if it goes, what will happen?,\" Tori's aunt, Ann Flynn, said.\n\n\"You know, we're just very hopeful.\n\n\"And it's really terrible that this has happened to a young woman that was full of life and full of adventure.\n\n\"And she loved travelling. And, you know, she's a beautiful young woman.\"\n\nAnn said she has been in touch with the two women every day, several times a day.\n\nShe added that the pair are trying to keep positive and the family are all hoping that the charges against Tori will not go to court.\n\n\"It's on your mind constantly, and I'm sure it's on their minds because all the family is getting in touch with them, you know?\n\n\"And, it's so far away.\n\n\"But hopefully with Radha Stirling, the Taoiseach and all the ministers that is helping now, hopefully, we'll hear good news.\n\n\"We're hoping that, just something will happen that it won't go to court.\n\n\"It's hard to believe that this young woman has been charged with trying to commit suicide.\n\n\"It is very, very hard to believe,\" Ann added.\n\nRadha Stirling, CEO of advocacy group Detained in Dubai, described the case and the travel ban against Ms Towey as \"outrageous\".\n\n\"Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive\", added Stirling, who has helped in numerous domestic violence cases including that of Dubai's Princess Latifa.\n\nCEO of advocacy group Detained in Dubai Ms Stirling confirmed this morning that Ms Towey is currently living in an Airbnb.\n\n\"Right now, she's just happy to be with her mother in safety, because this is all very recent, but she is able to leave the apartment and move freely within the country,\" she said.\n\nShe continued;\n\n\"It's terrible PR for the country. You're going to have people worried to go there in the future. And of course, this is on the back of historically charging rape victims with sex outside marriage so they don't have the best reputation to start with. They've been trying to improve it.\n\n\"So I think there'll be agreeable with the Irish government if there's enough diplomatic pressure put on them, letting them know that we absolutely want Tori home and there's just going to be no negotiation on that,\" she added.\n\n\"In a best-case scenario, they will simply say: 'We're not going to proceed beyond this hearing- and we're going to let you go'.\n\n\"When it comes to a case like this, it's all about diplomacy. Without the support of the Irish government, she would be likely to face prison and charges and deportation.\n\n\"With the support of the Irish Government and diplomacy and there has been a lot - various members of the Irish government have contacted UAE ambassador to Ireland, and of course, Ireland's ambassador in the UAE, and they're trying to get those diplomatic talks happening.\n\n\"If that happens, that is the best and fastest way to get her home,\" Ms Stirling added.\n\n\"The UAE has gone to great public relations efforts to promote alcohol as legal in the country.

Video: Oireachtas TV\n\nThe Dubai Public Prosecution service has dropped charges of attempted suicide against Co Roscommon woman Tori Towey and the travel ban against her has been lifted.\n\nMs Towey (28), who moved to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) city last year, had been prevented from leaving the country as a result of the charges.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald told the D\u00e1il that Ms Towey was the victim of domestic violence and was subjected to a travel ban over allegations she illegally consumed alcohol and attempted suicide. Attempted suicide is a crime in the Arab state, carrying a sentence of up to six months.\n\nA statement from the Dubai Government to The Irish Times said it had \"closed the case involving Irish national Tori Towey after she and her husband, a South African national, were involved in a case featuring mutual charges of assault, dating back to May 2024. The couple reached a reconciliation and withdrew the complaints filed against each other.\n\n\"Dubai Public Prosecution has also dropped the charges of attempted suicide against her considering the circumstances of the case and to enable her to return to normal life,\" the statement said.\n\nTaoiseach Simon Harris earlier told the D\u00e1il the travel ban on Ms Towey had been lifted.\n\n\"The Embassy will take Tori to the airport as soon as she is ready to go,\" Mr Harris told TDs on Wednesday. \"And the Embassy will of course continue to follow up the case which is still active as of now.\n\n\"I just wanted to inform the House of that and to thank our Embassy,\" he said.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs was providing consular assistance to Ms Towey, who works for Emirates Airlines and whose case was first highlighted by campaign group Dubai Detained.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Harris told Ms McDonald that Ireland's Ambassador to the UAE, Alison Milton, \"has been in very frequent and intense contact with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs\" on Ms Towey's situation.\n\n\"I don't want to say too much more on the record in this House because I don't want to say anything that cuts across a very intense effort that is under way,\" he said.\n\nThe Taoiseach stressed that Ms Towey \"doesn't need to come home after a court case because she is not a criminal. She's a victim of gender-based violence, and we expect her to be able to return to Ireland as an Irish citizen without delay\".\n\n\"I think it's so important. Does everybody around the world including Dubai, UAE, know that we're speaking with one voice in this House in relation to this situation?\n\n\"An Irish woman, an Irish citizen, has been a victim of a horrific male violence, has been the victim of the most brutal, horrific attack one can imagine.\"\n\nT\u00e1naiste Miche\u00e1l Martin has paid tribute to Ms Milton for her role in the lifting of the travel ban against Ms Towey.\n\nSpeaking on RT\u00c9 radio's News at One, Mr Martin said\n\nhe anticipated Ms Towey and her mother, Caroline, would be returning to Ireland at the earliest opportunity now that her passport had been returned.\n\n\"It has been very, very challenging, and traumatic for Tori over the last while. But I think our team there has been in contact and has engaged with the family and indeed with the authorities as well. And, it's been a constructive engagement. And they have responded with the issue being resolved.\"\n\nCommenting earlier on the Government's response, Detained in Dubai chief executive Radha Stirling said: \"I'm super impressed by Ireland's response, it was so swift.\n\n\"When a Government gets behind their citizens, when they go the extra mile, they are successful in getting citizens home,\" she said on Newstalk Breakfast.\n\n\"When it comes to a case like this, it's all about diplomacy. Without the support of the Irish Government, she would be likely to face prison and charges and deportation,\" she said.\n\n\"She is exhausted and she's finding it very overwhelming. But at the same time, we're really, really warmed by all of the support that she's been getting. I don't think she expected all of that. I don't think she expected the Irish Government to motivate themselves as quickly. And this is the fastest I've ever seen this happen from a Government. So I'm super impressed by Ireland's response.\"\n\nAlso earlier today, Ann Flynn, aunt of Ms Towey, said the family was hoping that diplomatic efforts will lead to charges being dropped and her return to Ireland. \"We are just all very, very anxious,\" she told RT\u00c9 radio's Morning Ireland.\n\n\"We keep hoping that we'll get word that they're [Ms Towey and her mother, Caroline] on a plane. On the way home. I don't know. Will this court case go ahead? Or if it goes, what will happen? You know, we're just very hopeful. And it's really terrible that this has happened to a young woman, you know, that was full of life and full of adventure. And she loved travelling. And, you know, she's a beautiful young woman.\n\n\"We're hoping that just something will happen, that it won't go to court. It's hard to believe that this young woman has been charged with trying to commit suicide. And, you know, it's very, very hard to believe it.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Sinn Fein party leader Mary Lou McDonald identified Ms Towey's husband as the alleged perpetrator on Tuesday, stating she was a victim of \"the most gross domestic violence\".\n\nHuman rights activists reported that she wanted to exit the Middle Eastern nation after receiving hospital treatment for severe bruising and other injuries, but was held back. She was then charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption. Campaign group Detained in Dubai warned that Tori could now face a long-term imprisonment in a jail infamous for \"human rights abuses and torture\". They have now called on the government in Dublin to step in and fight to have the charges dismissed.\n\nShocking images have surfaced online showing Tori with severe bruising on her arms. Radha Stirling, the chief of Detained in Dubai, told the Irish Mirror: \"We need Tori home in Ireland.\" After graduating from Dublin Institute of Technology, Tori moved to Dubai in April last year to join Emirates Airlines. But following alleged assaults, Tori attempted to leave Dubai, according to Detained in Dubai's Radha Stirling.\n\nDescribing what happened to her next, Ms Stirling said: \"The thing she remembers is an ambulance crew and police waking her up. She was taken to Al Barsha police station and kept for several hours. Her mother pleaded to the Irish Consulate, but in the absence of their assistance, she boarded a flight to Dubai.\n\n\"Tori arranged to fly home to Ireland but when she arrived at the airport, she was told there was a travel ban. She attended the police station. She was assured that the travel ban would be lifted, but it never happened. She was stuck. Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and, quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive. The Irish Embassy and the UAE medical and police services could certainly have done more to help Tori. She was moments from death.\"\n\nThe Irish Taoiseach Simon Harris vowed to \"intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen\" in the \"most appalling circumstances\". Opposition leader Mary Lou McDonald from the Sinn Fein party had brought up the distressing case after speaking with Tori, and informed the Irish national parliament that the flight attendant's \"passport has been destroyed\" and a \"travel ban was imposed on her\".\n\nShe has spoken out about Tori's harrowing situation and said it had led her to attempt suicide. Ms McDonald said: \"Following one particularly severe beating in which her husband repeatedly tried to break her arm, Tori escaped upstairs and she attempted to take her own life. Tori now faces charges in Dubai of attempted suicide and the abuse of alcohol.\n\n\"The system over there, rather than protecting this woman, who is an Irish citizen, chose instead to detain her, to charge her. She's now under the most incredible stress. I spoke to her. Her mother Caroline has travelled to be with her. Tori wants to come home, simple as that. She's a Roscommon woman. She wants to come home.\"\n\nShe has demanded immediate action, and added: \"I'm asking now, as a matter of absolute urgency, that we have a statement from this House; that you intervene, Taoiseach; that the Ambassador comes in and that you explain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way. That an Irish citizen, an Irish woman will not be treated in this way.\"\n\nAdvocacy group Detained in Dubai has pleaded for charges to be dismissed against Tori prior to her court date next Thursday. Ms Stirling said: \"The case against her is going to court on July 18. She has been charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\"\n\nShe added: \"We are calling on Dubai authorities to urgently drop the charges against Tori, remove the travel ban, and let her fly home to Ireland with her mother. We are also calling on Ireland's Taoiseach Simon Harris, the head of Foreign Affairs Miche\u00e1l Martin, ambassador Alison Milton, and local TDs to help bring Tori home.\"\n\n*If you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

She is now under the most incredible stress.\"\n\nMs McDonald said Ms Towey had been charged with attempted suicide and using alcohol in Dubai. Consuming alcohol is still largely illegal outside of licensed premises such as hotels.\n\nSimon Harris, the Taoiseach (prime minister), called the situation \"the most appalling of circumstances\" and said he would work with Ms McDonald to intervene and support Ms Towey.\n\nMs Towey's mother has travelled to Dubai to be with her daughter, who will appear in court on July 18, according to Radha Stirling, the head of advocacy group Detained in Dubai.\n\n\"Without diplomatic intervention from the Irish government, Tori faces months of hearings which could end with her lengthy and unfair detention,\" Ms Stirling said.\n\nMs McDonald said Ms Towey, who comes from Roscommon in Ireland's north-west, wanted to come home.\n\nMs McDonald requested that the UAE ambassador be called to give an explanation for Ms Towey's detention, and that it be \"made plain to the authorities in Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way and that an Irish citizen, an Irish woman, will not be treated in this way\".\n\nClaire Kerrane, the member for Roscommon and Galway in the Irish parliament, wrote on Facebook to support Ms McDonald's speech and said she had been in direct contact with Ms Towey as well as the Irish foreign minister.\n\n\"I have since spoken to the Taoiseach directly and have been assured of action,\" she wrote.", "source": {"uri": "home.nzcity.co.nz", "dataType":

She was taken to Al Barsha police station and kept for several hours before going home again.\n\n\"Her mother [Caroline] pleaded to the Irish Consulate, but in the absence of their assistance, boarded a flight to Dubai.\n\n\"When she arrived, she wasn't allowed to see Tori alone, her abuser wouldn't allow it. The three met at Emirates mall, then attended the prosecutor's office to find out what charges had been registered against her.\"\n\nTowey had been charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption. She was told nothing could be done and that the cases against her were going to court on July 18.\n\nLater that night, the husband went to the pub. When he returned home, he began verbally abusing Towey again and \"pushing her around.\"\n\nTowey and her mother packed her bags and left the home, \"this time for good.\"\n\nDetained in Dubai launched a campaign to raise awareness about Towey's plight this week, and Taoiseach Simon Harris vowed to intervene after the matter was raised to him by TDs Mary Lou McDonald and Claire Kerrane in the D\u00e1il yesterday, July 9.\n\nMyself and @ClaireKerrane raised the emergency case of Tori Towey with the Taoiseach seeking urgent intervention in her situation.\n\nThe system in Dubai, rather than protecting this Irish citizen chose to detain and charge her.\n\nShe wants to come home.\n\nThe Taoiseach must... pic.twitter.com/X9VF0afrbx -- Mary Lou McDonald (@MaryLouMcDonald)\n\nJuly 9, 2024\n\nOn Wednesday, McDonald announced on X that Towey's travel ban had been lifted and thanked people for their support.\n\nSpeaking with reporters not long later, McDonald said the situation raises \"fundamental questions about the treatment of women in Dubai.\"\n\nTori Towey will now travel home to Ireland. All of the support, all of the goodwill and all of the determination was felt very strongly by Tori and her mum Caroline.\n\nWe await her safe return to Ireland.

He said the Embassy will be taking Towey and her mother to the airport as soon as they're ready to go.\n\nHe later said on X that he spoke with Towey and her mother on the phone today.\n\nNEW: Taoiseach tells D\u00e1il that the UAE's travel ban on Roscommon flight attendant Tori Towey has just been lifted, and that the Irish embassy in UAE will bring her to the airport to travel home as

In one instance, after he was thrown out of the bar for causing \"havoc,\" he launched a \"horrific\" attack on Towey that involved physical abuse.\n\nHe ripped up Towey's two passports during the hours-long \"torture,\" which only ended when some neighbors intervened.\n\nAfterward, Towey, who sustained frightening injuries, filed a police report and Emirates Airlines gave her time off to recover.\n\nHowever, when Towey attempted to replace her passport, she learned that there was a travel ban against her, though she didn't know why. Detained in Dubai confirmed that \"it's commonplace for spouses to open pre-emptive cases against the victim to try to immunize themselves from their own criminal cases.\"\n\nTowey returned home to her husband with the hope that the abuse would stop, similar to so many other abuse victims.\n\nWhen Emirates Airlines fired the husband for \"behavioral issues,\" he began to use Towey's credit cards excessively. Upon noticing, Towey put a stop on her cards, knowing that high debts can lead to travel bans and jail time in Dubai.\n\nTowey predicted that her husband would become enraged with the financial cutoff, so she left their home for a few days and stayed in a hotel that her mother had arranged for her.\n\nWhen Towey returned home, there was relative peace, but it was short-lived.\n\nAccording to Detained in Dubai: \"Tori arranged to fly home to Ireland, but when she arrived at the airport, was told a case against her by her husband had been dropped but the travel ban remained.\n\n\"She attended the police station who assured her the travel ban would be lifted but it never happened.\n\nThe following day, her husband again launched into another rage. Towey believed he was going to kill her, as he had promised before.\n\n\"Feeling like there was no way out, Tori ran upstairs to the bathroom and wrapped an electrical lead around her neck,\" Detained in Dubai says.\n\n\"The next thing she remembers is an ambulance crew and police waking her up. She was taken to Al Barsha police station and kept for several hours before going home again.\n\n\"Her mother pleaded to the Irish Consulate, but in the absence of their assistance, boarded a flight to Dubai.\n\n\"When she arrived, she wasn't allowed to see Tori alone, her abuser wouldn't allow it. The three met at Emirates mall, then attended the prosecutor's office to find out what charges had been registered against her.\"\n\nTowey had been charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption. She was told nothing could be done and that the cases against her were going to court on July 18.\n\nLater that night, the husband went to the pub. When he returned home, he began verbally abusing Towey again and \"pushing her around.\"\n\nTowey and her mother packed her bags and left the home, \"this time for good.\"\n\nRadha Stirling, CEO of Detained in Dubai, has criticized Emirates Airlines, the Irish Embassy, and the UAE medical and police services for their handling of the situation.\n\nStirling said on Tuesday: \"We are calling on Dubai authorities to urgently drop the charges against Tori, remove the travel ban, and let her fly home to Ireland with her mother.\n\n\"We are also calling on Ireland's Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Simon Harris, the head of Foreign Affairs Miche\u00e1l Martin, Ambassador Alison Milton, and local TDs Michael Fitzmaurice, Claire Kerrane, and Denis Naughten, as well as the UAE's Ambassador to Ireland, H.E. Mohammed Hmoud Hamad Rahma Alshamsi to help bring Tori home.\"\n\nTowey's situation was raised in the D\u00e1il on Tuesday by TD Mary Lou McDonald.\n\n\"The system over there, rather than protecting this woman, who is an Irish citizen, chose instead to detain her and charge her,\" McDonald said during Leaders Questions on Tuesday.\n\n\"She is now under the most incredible stress.\"\n\nMcDonald, who said she spoke with Towey's mother that day, continued: \"Tori wants to come home. It is as simple as that. She is a Roscommon woman, and she wants to come home.\n\n\"I am asking that, as a matter of absolute urgency, that we have a statement from this House; that the Taoiseach will intervene; that the

way.\"\n\nMyself and @ClaireKerrane raised the emergency case of Tori Towey with the Taoiseach seeking urgent intervention in her situation.\n\nThe system in Dubai, rather than protecting this Irish

Martin.\n\n\"I am not directly apprised of the situation but I am very happy to be directly apprised of it now and to work with Deputy McDonald to intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen in what sounds to be, from Deputy McDonald has told me, the most appalling of circumstances,\" the Taoiseach said, adding that he would be happy to engage directly with McDonald on the

There was a travel ban imposed on her.\"\n\nRadhi Stirling, a legal expert at Detained in Dubai who is working on Ms Towey's case, said: \"We are calling on Dubai authorities to urgently drop the charges against Tori, remove the travel ban and let her fly home to Ireland with her mother.\n\n\"It's outrageous, it's broken,\" she added.\n\nMs Towey's aunt Ann Flynn on Wednesday said both were trying to stay positive.\n\nMs Stirling said the support of the Irish Government had \"really warmed\" them and \"given them hope and inspiration\".\n\n\"Right now she's just happy to be with her mother in safety. It's all very recent,\" Ms Stirling added.\n\nIrish premier Simon Harris has reportedly agreed \"to intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen in what sounds to be...the most appalling circumstances\".\n\nIf you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

Activists argue that Tori stands accused of violating severe laws in the predominantly Muslim nation despite being a victim of an alleged assault inside her own residence.\n\nSinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald identified Ms Towey's husband as the supposed perpetrator last Tuesday, declaring she was suffering from the \"most gross domestic violence\". Human rights advocates reveal that post receiving hospital treatment for serious bruising and further injuries, she wished to exit the Middle Eastern country but was apprehended.\n\nRead more: Spain tourists blast 'unacceptable' scenes as holidaymakers targeted by protesters\n\nRead more: Taxi driver Raymond Shorten convicted of raping girl, 7, days after her mum's funeral\n\nCampaign group, Detained in Dubai, issued a warning that Tori could be looking at serving time in a prison infamous for \"human rights abuses and torture\". It urged the Irish government to step in, demanding they fight for the charges to be withdrawn, reports the Irish Mirror.\n\nTo this grim scenario, the Taoiseach vowed to \"intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen\" caught up in the \"most appalling circumstances\". Deputy Lou McDonald brought forward this distressing case after conversing with Tori herself. Additionally, she informed the Dail that \"her passport has been destroyed\" and added that a \"travel ban was imposed on her\".\n\nSinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald has spoken out about the harrowing experience of an Irish woman in Dubai, stating: \"Following one particularly severe beating in which her husband repeatedly tried to break her arm, Tori escaped upstairs and she attempted to take her own life. Tori now faces charges in Dubai of attempted suicide and the abuse of alcohol.\"\n\n\"The system over there, rather than protecting this woman, who is an Irish citizen, chose instead to detain her, to charge her. She's now under the most incredible stress. I spoke to her. Her mother Caroline has travelled to be with her. Tori wants to come home, simple as that. She's a Roscommon woman. She wants to come home.\"\n\nMcDonald continued, pressing for immediate action: \"I'm asking now, as a matter of absolute urgency, that we have a statement from this House; that you intervene, Taoiseach; that the Ambassador comes in and that you explain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way. That an Irish citizen, an Irish woman will not be treated in this way.\"\n\nAdding her voice to the call for intervention, Roscommon TD Claire Kerrane demanded that Tori be allowed to return to Ireland, expressing her concern online: \"This is absolutely frightening. I have been in touch with [Tanaiste] Micheal Martin and I will be raising this in the Dail. The Government needs to intervene on this urgently.\n\n\"Tori Towey must be released and allowed to return home to Roscommon urgently. This young woman has been treated in the most horrific way and simply wants to go home. I am determined to work with the Ambassador, Foreign Affairs Minister, and anyone necessary to ensure that her release is secured without delay.\"\n\nShocking images have surfaced online showing Tori, originally from Boyle in Roscommon, displaying severe bruising on her arms. Radha Stirling, the chief of Detained in Dubai, informed the Irish Mirror: \"Tori and her mother are in Dubai and it's illegal for them to talk to the media.\"\n\nFurther support comes from local political figures, as Stirling noted: \"Their local TD has committed to help. Deputy Kerrane responded in record time for calls to help. So heartwarming to see such support. We need Tori home in Ireland.\"\n\nExpressing gratitude, Stirling relayed a message to Deputy Kerrane: \"You are a gem. I've passed [your support] on to Tori and her mum and they are ever thankful.\"\n\nTori, a graduate of Dublin Institute of Technology, relocated to Dubai in April last year to join Emirates Airlines. Following alleged assaults, she attempted to leave Dubai, but her ordeal continued, as detailed by Stirling.\n\nStirling recounted the harrowing experience: \"The thing she remembers is an ambulance crew and police waking her up. She was taken to Al Barsha police station and kept for several hours. Her mother pleaded to the Irish Consulate, but in the absence of their assistance, she boarded a flight to Dubai.\n\n\"Tori arranged to fly home to Ireland but when she arrived at the airport, she was told there was a travel ban. She attended the police station. She was assured that the travel ban would be lifted, but it never happened. She was stuck. Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and, quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive.\"\n\nThe situation could have been handled better, as Stirling continues: \"The Irish Embassy and the UAE medical and police services could certainly have done more to help Tori. She was moments from death.\" Stirling also pointed out the urgency of Tori's case as her court appearance approaches: \"The case against her is going to court on July 18. She has been charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\"\n\nFinally, she made an urgent appeal for action: \"We are calling on Dubai authorities to urgently drop the charges against Tori, remove the travel ban, and let her fly home to Ireland with her mother. We are also calling on Ireland's Taoiseach Simon Harris, the head of Foreign Affairs Micheal Martin, ambassador Alison Milton, and local TDs to help bring Tori home.\"\n\nSign up to the Dublin Live Newsletter to get all the latest Dublin news straight to your inbox.\n\nFor all the latest news from Dublin and surrounding areas visit our homepage.\n\nJoin our Dublin Live breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive your daily dose of Dublin Live content.

Campaigners claim that Tori is accused of breaking strict laws in the Muslim country - even though she is the victim of an alleged attack in her home. Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald named Ms Towey's husband as her alleged attacker on Tuesday and said she was the victim of the \"most gross domestic violence\".\n\nHuman rights campaigners said that she wanted to leave the Middle Eastern state after receiving hospital treatment for severe bruising and other injuries - but was detained.\n\nREAD MORE: James McClean's daughter in hospital after 'taking turn for the worst'\n\nREAD MORE: Ryanair 'flight from hell' forced to divert after mass brawl breaks out over seat swapping\n\nCampaign group Detained in Dubai warned that Tori could now face a lengthy imprisonment in a jail that is notorious for \"human rights abuses and torture\". It urged Ireland to intervene, calling on the Government to fight to have the charges dropped.\n\nThe Taoiseach pledged to \"intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen\" in the \"most appalling circumstances\".\n\nDeputy Lou McDonald raised the harrowing case after speaking with Tori. She told the Dail that \"her passport has been destroyed\" and a \"travel ban was imposed on her\".\n\nThe Sinn Fein president said: \"Following one particularly severe beating in which her husband repeatedly tried to break her arm, Tori escaped upstairs and she attempted to take her own life. Tori now faces charges in Dubai of attempted suicide and the abuse of alcohol.\n\n\"The system over there, rather than protecting this woman, who is an Irish citizen, chose instead to detain her, to charge her. She's now under the most incredible stress. I spoke to her. Her mother Caroline has travelled to be with her. Tori wants to come home, simple as that. She's a Roscommon woman. She wants to come home.\"\n\nShe added: \"I'm asking now, as a matter of absolute urgency, that we have a statement from this House; that you intervene, Taoiseach; that the Ambassador comes in and that you explain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way. That an Irish citizen, an Irish woman will not be treated in this way.\"\n\nRoscommon TD Claire Kerrane also called for Tori to be allowed to travel home to Ireland. Deputy Kerrane posted online: \"This is absolutely frightening. I have been in touch with [Tanaiste] Miche\u00e1l Martin and I will be raising this in the D\u00e1il. The Government needs to intervene on this urgently.\"\n\nShe added: \"Tori Towey must be released and allowed to return home to Roscommon urgently. This young woman has been treated in the most horrific way and simply wants to go home. I am determined to work with the Ambassador, Foreign Affairs Minister, and anyone necessary to ensure that her release is secured without delay.\"\n\nImages online show Tori, whose family is originally from Boyle in Roscommon, holding up her arms to reveal extensive bruising. Detained in Dubai chief Radha Stirling told the Irish Mirror: \"Tori and her mother are in Dubai and it's illegal for them to talk to the media.\"\n\nShe added: \"Their local TD has committed to help. Deputy Kerrane responded in record time for calls to help. So heartwarming to see such support. We need Tori home in Ireland.\"\n\nShe told Deputy Kerrane: \"You are a gem. I've passed [your support] on to Tori and her mum and they are ever thankful.\"\n\nTori graduated from Dublin Institute of Technology and moved to Dubai in April last year to work with Emirates Airlines. After alleged attacks, Tori tried to leave Dubai, according to Detained in Dubai chief Stirling.\n\nShe said: \"The thing she remembers is an ambulance crew and police waking her up. She was taken to Al Barsha police station and kept for several hours. Her mother pleaded to the Irish Consulate, but in the absence of their assistance, she boarded a flight to Dubai.\"\n\nStirling added: \"Tori arranged to fly home to Ireland but when she arrived at the airport, she was told there was a travel ban. She attended the police station. She was assured that the travel ban would be lifted, but it never happened. She was stuck. Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and, quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive.\"\n\nShe continued: \"The Irish Embassy and the UAE medical and police services could certainly have done more to help Tori. She was moments from death.\"\n\nThe Detained in Dubai group wants the charges against Tori dropped before her case reaches court next Thursday. Its chief Stirling said: \"The case against her is going to court on July 18. She has been charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\"\n\nShe added: \"We are calling on Dubai authorities to urgently drop the charges against Tori, remove the travel ban, and let her fly home to Ireland with her mother. We are also calling on Ireland's Taoiseach Simon Harris, the head of Foreign Affairs Miche\u00e1l Martin, ambassador Alison Milton, and local TDs to help bring Tori home.\"\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nAn air hostess is facing prison in Dubai after allegedly being left 'moments from death' following an attack by her husband at home.\n\nTori Towey, 28, from Co Roscommon in Ireland, is accused of violating strict laws in the Muslim country, despite the fact she was the victim of an alleged assault. Sinn Fein party leader Mary Lou McDonald identified Ms Towey's husband as the alleged perpetrator on Tuesday, July 9, stating that she was a victim of \"the most gross domestic violence\".\n\nHuman rights activists reported that Tori wanted to leave the United Arab Emirates after receiving hospital treatment for severe bruising and other injuries, but was held back. She was then charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\n\nCampaign group Detained in Dubai warned that Tori could now face a long-term imprisonment in a jail infamous for \"human rights abuses and torture,\" and have called on the government in Dublin to step in and fight to have the charges dismissed, reports the Mirror.\n\nDisturbing images have surfaced online showing Tori with severe bruising on her arms.\n\nRadha Stirling, the chief of Detained in Dubai, told the Irish Mirror: \"We need Tori home in Ireland.\"\n\nAfter graduating from Dublin Institute of Technology, Tori moved to Dubai in April last year to join Emirates Airlines, but following alleged assaults, Tori attempted to leave Dubai, according to Radha Stirling.\n\nDescribing what happened to her next, Ms Stirling said: \"The thing she remembers is an ambulance crew and police waking her up. She was taken to Al Barsha police station and kept for several hours. Her mother pleaded to the Irish Consulate, but in the absence of their assistance, she boarded a flight to Dubai .\n\n\"Tori arranged to fly home to Ireland but when she arrived at the airport, she was told there was a travel ban. She attended the police station. She was assured that the travel ban would be lifted, but it never happened. She was stuck. Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and, quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive. The Irish Embassy and the UAE medical and police services could certainly have done more to help Tori. She was moments from death.\"\n\nThe Irish Taoiseach Simon Harris vowed to \"intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen\" in the \"most appalling circumstances\".\n\nOpposition leader Mary Lou McDonald from the Sinn Fein party brought up the distressing case after speaking with Tori, and informed the Irish national parliament that the woman's \"passport has been destroyed\" and a \"travel ban was imposed on her\".\n\nShe has spoken out about Tori's harrowing situation and said it had all led her to attempt suicide.\n\nMs McDonald said: \"Following one particularly severe beating in which her husband repeatedly tried to break her arm, Tori escaped upstairs and she attempted to take her own life. Tori now faces charges in Dubai of attempted suicide and the abuse of alcohol.\n\n\"The system over there, rather than protecting this woman, who is an Irish citizen, chose instead to detain her, to charge her. She's now under the most incredible stress. I spoke to her. Her mother Caroline has travelled to be with her. Tori wants to come home, simple as that. She's a Roscommon woman. She wants to come home.\"\n\nShe has demanded immediate action, and added: \"I'm asking now, as a matter of absolute urgency, that we have a statement from this House; that you intervene, Taoiseach; that the Ambassador comes in and that you explain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way. That an Irish citizen, an Irish woman will not be treated in this way.\"\n\nDetained in Dubai has pleaded for charges to be dismissed prior to Tori's court date next Thursday. Ms Stirling said: \"The case against her is going to court on July 18. She has been charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\"\n\nShe added: \"We are calling on Dubai authorities to urgently drop the charges against Tori, remove the travel ban, and let her fly home to Ireland with her mother. We are also calling on Ireland's Taoiseach Simon Harris, the head of Foreign Affairs Miche\u00e1l Martin, ambassador Alison Milton, and local TDs to help bring Tori home.\"\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

Tori now faces charges in Dubai of attempted suicide and the abuse of alcohol.\"\n\n\"The system over there, rather than protecting this woman, who is an Irish citizen, chose instead to detain her, to charge her. She's now under the most incredible stress. I spoke to her. Her mother Caroline has travelled to be with her. Tori wants to come home, simple as that. She's a Roscommon woman. She wants to come home.\"\n\nMcDonald continued, urging for immediate action: \"I'm asking now, as a matter of absolute urgency, that we have a statement from this House; that you intervene, Taoiseach; that the Ambassador comes in and that you explain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way. That an Irish citizen, an Irish woman will not be treated in this way.\"\n\nEchoing the call for intervention, Roscommon TD Claire Kerrane demanded that Tori be allowed to return to Ireland, expressing her worry online: \"This is absolutely frightening. I have been in touch with [Tanaiste] Micheal Martin and I will be raising this in the Dail. The Government needs to intervene on this urgently.\"\n\n\"Tori Towey must be released and allowed to return home to Roscommon urgently. This young woman has been treated in the most horrific way and simply wants to go home. I am determined to work with the Ambassador, Foreign Affairs Minister, and anyone necessary to ensure that her release is secured without delay.\"\n\nDisturbing images have emerged online showing Tori, originally from Boyle in Roscommon, with severe bruising on her arms. Radha Stirling, the head of Detained in Dubai, told the Irish Mirror: \"Tori and her mother are in Dubai and it's illegal for them to talk to the media.\"\n\nFurther backing comes from local political figures, as Stirling highlighted: \"Their local TD has committed to help. Deputy Kerrane responded in record time for calls to help. So heartwarming to see such support. We need Tori home in Ireland.\"\n\nExpressing appreciation, Stirling passed on a message to Deputy Kerrane: \"You are a gem. I've passed [your support] on to Tori and her mum and they are ever thankful.\"\n\nTori, a graduate of Dublin Institute of Technology, moved to Dubai in April last year to join Emirates Airlines. After alleged assaults, she tried to leave Dubai, but her ordeal continued, as outlined by Stirling.\n\nStirling shared the troubling account: \"The thing she remembers is an ambulance crew and police waking her up. She was taken to Al Barsha police station and kept for several hours. Her mother pleaded to the Irish Consulate, but in the absence of their assistance, she boarded a flight to Dubai.\"\n\n\"Tori arranged to fly home to Ireland but when she arrived at the airport, she was told there was a travel ban. She attended the police station. She was assured that the travel ban would be lifted, but it never happened. She was stuck. Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and, quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive.\"\n\nStirling believed there were echoes of neglect throughout the entire situation: \"The Irish Embassy and the UAE medical and police services could certainly have done more to help Tori. She was moments from death.\"\n\nStirling also emphasised the severe urgency of Tori's case since her court appearance is imminent: \"The case against her is going to court on July 18. She has been charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\"\n\nStirling issued a heartfelt plea for swift action to aid in Tori's dire situation: \"We are calling on Dubai authorities to urgently drop the charges against Tori, remove the travel ban, and let her fly home to Ireland with her mother. We are also calling on Ireland's Taoiseach Simon Harris, the head of Foreign Affairs Micheal Martin, ambassador Alison Milton, and local TDs to help bring Tori home.\"\n\nFor all the latest news,

and said he would work with Ms McDonald to intervene and support Ms Towey.\n\nMs Towey's mother has travelled to Dubai to be with her daughter, who will appear in court on July 18, according to Radha Stirling, the head of advocacy group Detained in Dubai.\n\n\"Without diplomatic intervention from the Irish government, Tori faces months of hearings which could end with her lengthy and unfair detention,\" Ms Stirling said.\n\nMs McDonald said Ms Towey, who comes from Roscommon in Ireland's north-west, wanted to come home.\n\nMs McDonald requested that the UAE ambassador be called to give an explanation for Ms Towey's detention, and that it be \"made plain to the authorities in Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way and that an Irish citizen, an Irish woman, will not be treated in this way\".\n\nClaire Kerrane, the member for Roscommon and Galway in the Irish parliament, wrote on Facebook to support Ms McDonald's speech and said she had been in direct contact with Ms Towey as well as the Irish foreign minister.\n\n\"I have since spoken to the Taoiseach directly and have been assured of action,\" she wrote.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news",

Her passport has been destroyed and a travel ban has been imposed on her,\"said McDonald, who along with along with Sinn F\u00e9in Roscommon-Galway TD Claire Kerrane has been in touch with Ms Towey.\n\nShe went to the authorities seeking protection many times, but to no avail. Following one particularly severe beating in which her husband repeatedly tried to slam doors on her arms and break her limbs, she escaped upstairs and she attempted to take her own life.\n\nMcDonald added: \"Unfortunately, Tori now faces charges in Dubai of attempted suicide and the abuse of alcohol.\"\n\n\"The system over there, rather than protecting this woman, who is an Irish citizen, chose instead to detain her and charge her. She is now under the most incredible stress.\"\n\n\"I spoke to her this afternoon. Her mother, Caroline, has travelled to be with her. Tori wants to come home. It is as simple as that. She is a Roscommon woman, and she wants to come home.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs Towey has lived in Dubai since April 2023 after getting a job as an airline attendant.\n\nSpeaking to The Journal, Radha Stirling of human rights advocacy group Detained in Dubai said that Ms Towey is set to appear in court next week and in a worst case scenario could face a prison sentence.\n\nShe explained that often lengthy legal processes in Dubai mean that Ms Towey's immediate future is uncertain.\n\n\"We don't know what's going to happen at that court date. The prosecutors basically told her it was going to court she's been charged. She doesn't have legal representation. It's very expensive in Dubai, and she just, frankly, couldn't afford it.\"\n\n\"So she's going in blind, and the hearings come up really quickly as well. So from the time she found out she was charged, it's only, you know, two, three weeks.\"\n\nDespite the swiftly appointed court date, the process could drag on for months, she said.\n\n\"This could take four to six months for that to happen. That's sort of a best case scenario. In a worst case scenario, she actually goes to prison.\"\n\nTowey and her mother are currently staying in an Airbnb in Dubai while she awaits her court date.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

He said she was the victim of a brutal attack and found herself walking up not in a hospital but in a police station.\n\nThere was a \"lot of diplomatic activity going on in the background\", Mr Harris said. \"She needs to be supported, she needs to be brought back home, to her home here in Ireland, and we need the travel ban lifted to make that happen\".\n\nOutlining the background to the case, Ms Stirling said Ms Towey's case is due to be heard in Dubai next week.\n\nShe said Ms Towey had moved to Dubai last year to pursue an aviation career. \"She was working as cabin crew for Emirates Airlines, and she ended up marrying a South African man. Things went south very quickly, and he became physically abusive to her. She went to hospital and had severe injuries,\" Ms Stirling said.\n\n\"After that, there was another assault and she broke free, ran up to the bathroom, and she woke up with paramedics and police over her, and she was taken to the police station and actually charged with, attempted suicide and consuming alcohol.\"\n\nThe situation was \"absurd\" that a woman who had been assaulted would be further abused by the system, Ms Stirling said.\n\n\"We have seen over the years, we've seen rape victims charged with sex outside marriage. We've seen this kind of culture coming from the UAE before. They had made an effort for public relations purposes, they were starting to take women's rights a bit more seriously, victim rights. But it seems like nothing has changed.\n\n\"And this is truly astonishing that someone who's been beaten to the degree that she has bruises all over her body, and now she's being abused by the system itself again. So I find it outrageous,\" Ms Stiring said.\n\n\"And I can see that's why there's so much support out there from Irish citizens, from politicians, from your leaders in your Government. So it's amazing to see people really standing behind her and wanting her home as soon as possible.\n\n\"When it comes to a case like this, it's all about diplomacy. Without the support of the Irish Government, she would be likely to face prison and charges and deportation,\" she said.\n\n\"Various members of the Irish Government have contacted the UAE ambassador to Ireland and of course Ireland's ambassador in the UAE, and they're trying to get those diplomatic talks happening. If that happens, that is the best and fastest way to get her home.\n\n\"She was told she had been charged with alcohol abuse and attempted suicide. Now I validated this with the Department of Public Prosecutions today and it's exactly as they said. So there's been no differences to the charges. And so they are proceeding on that, which is very bizarre since they allegedly decriminalised attempted suicide in the past couple of years and also have been promoting that they have decriminalised alcohol consumption,\" Ms Stirling said.\n\n\"So it's quite surprising that they would proceed to charge, especially her, under these circumstances, and take her to court, knowing that she obviously needs help, needs to just go home with her family.\"\n\nIreland's ambassador to UAE spoke with Ms Towey last night, and she is staying in an Airbnb with her mother Caroline who flew out to support her, according to Ms Stirling.\n\n\"She is exhausted and she's finding it very overwhelming. But at the same time, we're really, really warmed by all of the support that she's been getting. I don't think she expected all of that. I don't think she expected the Irish Government to motivate themselves as quickly. And this is the fastest I've ever seen this happen from a Government. So I'm super impressed by Ireland's response.\"\n\n\"We've dealt with many human rights issues like this, and when the Government gets behind the citizen and talks to their counterparts, the foreign affairs ministry in the UAE escalates it even to the ruler, Sheikh Mohammed, or the head of the police department and the justice system. When they do that and they go the extra mile rather than just deferring it and pretending they can't do anything, when they actually make the effort, they are successful in getting the citizens home.\"\n\n\"She is very, very much looking forward to coming home and recovering from what's been an extremely terrible, shocking year for her, in fact. So I think she needs to heal. She needs to be around friends and family and the safety of her country,\" Ms Stirling said.\n\nAccording to its website, Detained in Dubai provides confidential legal help in civil and criminal cases and consults with governments internationally on UAE legal issues.\n\nAnne Flynn, aunt of Ms Towey, said the family is hoping that diplomatic efforts will lead to charges being dropped and her return to Ireland. \"We are just all very, very anxious,\" she told RT\u00c9 radio's Morning Ireland.\n\n\"We keep hoping that we'll get word that they're [Ms Towey and her mother, Caroline] on a plane. On the way home. I don't know. Will this court case go ahead? Or if it goes, what will happen? You know, we're just very hopeful. And it's really terrible that this has happened to a young woman, you know, that was full of life and full of adventure. And she loved travelling. And, you know, she's a beautiful young woman.\n\n\"I've been in touch with them every day, several times a day, since all this started - they're both trying to keep positive. We're trying to keep positive as well. But it's on your mind constantly, and I'm sure it's on their minds because all the family gets in touch with them, you know? And, it's so far away, you know, but hopefully with Radha Stirling, the Taoiseach and all the Ministers, this will help. Hopefully, we'll hear good news.\n\n\"We're hoping that just something will happen, that it won't go to court. It's hard to believe that this young woman has been charged with trying to commit suicide. And, you know, it's very, very hard to believe it.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Campaigners claim that the 28-year-old air steward is accused of breaking strict laws in the Muslim country even though she is the victim of an alleged attack in her home.\n\nHuman rights campaigners said that she wanted to leave the Middle Eastern state after receiving hospital treatment for severe bruising and other injuries but was detained. Mr Harris told the Dail: \"I've just been informed that the travel ban has been lifted. The Embassy will take Tori to the airport as soon as she is ready to go. The Embassy of course will continue to follow the case which is still active as of now.\"\n\nRead more: Irish airline stewardess faces jail in Dubai after alleged domestic attack and suicide attempt\n\nRead more: Taoiseach Simon Harris insists 'I am staying in my home' after bomb threat\n\nSpeaking shortly before the announcement that the travel ban was lifted, the Taoiseach stated that Ms Towey is a \"victim\" and not a \"criminal\". He confirmed that he had spoken to Tori and her mother Caroline over the previous hours.\n\n\"An Irish woman, an Irish citizen, has been a victim of horrific male violence, has been the victim of the most brutal, horrific attack one can imagine,\" Mr Harris told the Dail. \"After enduring that horrific brutal attack, Tori Towey didn't wake up in a hospital being supported and cared for and loved. She woke up in a police station. We want Tori Towey back in this country. We want her back home in Roscommon, that's what she wants as well.\"\n\nThe Taoiseach said he had spoken to Ms Towey and her mother and told them getting her home was \"a priority issue\". He has also been in contact with the Ambassador in the United Arab Emirates and that she and the Embassy are \"working extraordinarily hard on this matter\".\n\nMr Harris added: \"No effort will be spared by us, by Ireland, to make progress on this matter and to get Tori Towey home.\" She doesn't need to come home after a court case because she is not a criminal. She is a victim of gender-based violence. We expect her to be able to return here to Ireland as an Irish citizen without delay.\"\n\nSpeaking under privilege, Ms McDonald told the Dail that Ms Towey had gotten married last March. \"Since then, Tori has been subjected to sustained and brutal domestic violence and abuse,\" she said.\n\n\"When she went to the authorities to seek help, instead of being protected, she was sent home with her husband. Her husband then destroyed her passport so she couldn't travel and she couldn't work. She couldn't come back to Ireland.\"\n\n\"Tori was, in effect, held captive by her abuser. Just over two weeks ago, she endured a particularly vicious beating. Her husband repeatedly slammed doors on her arms trying to break her limbs and he tried to strangle her.\n\n\"She fled upstairs in a desperate attempt to escape the violence and in desperation, she tried to take her own life. When Tori came to, she was surrounded by paramedics but instead of being taken to a hospital, she was taken to a police station.\n\n\"There she was charged with attempted suicide and alcohol abuse. Tori was placed in a cell with 50 other women. She wasn't told what she was charged with. She wasn't given any information at all. Tori was released on bail but her passport was blocked. She is banned from leaving the state.\"\n\nMs McDonald urged Mr Harris to act quickly as \"once the Dubai court process kicks in, it becomes harder and harder to get Tori back home to Ireland quickly.\"\n\nFor all the latest news from Dublin and surrounding areas visit our homepage.\n\nJoin our Dublin Live breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive your daily dose of Dublin Live content.

After neighbours intervened, she was taken away by an ambulance.\n\nWhen Towey ultimately tried to leave for Ireland, according to Detained in Dubai, she arrived at the airport to find a travel ban in place due to an earlier complaint lodged by her husband.\n\nSuch \"pre-emptive\" complaints were not uncommon in the UAE, the group said, and allowed men to prevent wives from fleeing abuse.\n\nTowey returned home.\n\n\"The next day, Tori and her husband had some wine, and he became enraged, accusing her of having an affair,\" said Detained in Dubai.\n\nFearing a slow death by torture, Towey ran to a bathroom \"and wrapped an electrical lead around her neck\". She woke up to the police and paramedics and was taken to a police station.\n\nShe had been due to appear on 18 July on charges of alcohol consumption and attempted suicide.\n\nDetained in Dubai CEO Radha Stirling compared the case to previous instances where the UAE charged victims of rape with having sex outside of marriage.\n\n\"Now, they're charging domestic violence victims with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Stirling said Dubai police had dropped the charges against Towey.\n\nPolitical support\n\nSinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald drew attention to the case in the Irish Parliament on Tuesday.\"Tori is a Roscommon woman and she wants to come home,\" she told the Assembly and urged Harris to intervene urgently.\n\nHe immediately agreed.", "source":

There was a travel ban imposed on her and she had gone to the authorities seeking protection many times but to absolutely no avail.\n\n\"But following one particularly severe beating in which her husband repeatedly tried to slam doors on her arms and break her limbs, she escaped upstairs, and she attempted to take her own life.\n\n\"The system over there, rather than protecting this woman, who is an Irish citizen, chose instead to detain her, to charge her.\n\n\"Tori wants to come home. Simple as that. She's a Roscommon woman, she wants to come home.\n\n\"And I'm asking now as a matter of absolute urgency that we have a statement from this house, that you intervene, that the ambassador is called and it made absolutely plain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way. And an Irish citizen, an Irish woman, will not be treated in this way.\"\n\nMs Towey moved to the emirate last year to work as an airline attendant.\n\nShe married a man in March but, according to Roscommon TD Claire Kerrane, she soon began being mentally and physically abused.\n\nMs Kerrane has spoken to Ms Towey and her mother Caroline, who is now with her in Dubai.\n\n\"It's a living nightmare,\" Ms Kerrane said.\n\n\"She was put in a cell with 50 women, there was no information, she wasn't told why she had been arrested, what she was being charged with. Then there's the language barrier too. It's just horrendous.\n\n\"There was a small bit of alcohol in her system so she was charged with alcohol abuse. And with 'attempted suicide'.\"\n\nAlthough Ms Towey went to the police, she was told to go home to her husband, Ms Kerrane said.\n\n\"He ripped up her passport, so she couldn't work as an airline attendant, then she had no money, so she couldn't come home.\"\n\nA travel ban was also placed on her passport so she could not escape.\n\nDuring one allegedly brutal attack in her home, it's understood she escaped into the bathroom and tried to take her own life in a bid to escape her husband, fearing he would torture her to death.\n\n\"The next thing she knew, paramedics were there,\" Ms Kerrane said.\n\n\"Then she was arrested on June 28 and had no idea what she had been arrested for.\"\n\nMs Towey is now hiding in Dubai with her mother and hoping for help.\n\nThey are too scared to talk to the media as they fear it is illegal to do so.\n\n\"They can't speak so we have to speak for them,\" Ms Kerrane said.\n\nA court date has been set for July 18.\n\n\"And we're in the last week of the D\u00e1il so there's that pressure too,\" said Ms Kerrane.\n\nTori Towey's 'very anxious' family hoping charges will be dropped\n\nMs Towey's aunt, Anne Flynn said the family is hoping that diplomatic efforts will lead to the charges being dropped and allow Ms Towey to return to Ireland.\n\n\"We are just all very, very anxious,\" she told RT\u00c9 radio's Morning Ireland.\n\n\"We keep hoping that we'll get word that they're on a plane. On the way home. I don't know. Will this court case go ahead? Or if it goes, what will happen? You know, we're just very hopeful. And it's really terrible that this has happened to a young woman that was full of life and full of adventure. And she loved travelling. And, you know, she's a beautiful young woman.\n\n\"I've been in touch with them every day, several times a day, since all this started. They're both trying to keep positive. We're trying to keep positive as well. But it's on your mind constantly, and I'm sure it's on their minds because all the family gets in touch with them, you know? And, it's so far away. But hopefully with Radha Stirling, the Taoiseach and all the ministers this will help. Hopefully, we'll hear good news.\n\n\"We're hoping that, just something will happen that it won't go to court. It's hard to believe that this young woman has been charged with trying to commit suicide.\"\n\nPoliticians here now plan to work cross-party in a bid to get the Irish woman back home to safety and Taoiseach Simon Harris has said he's ready to intervene in the case.\n\n\"She said today: 'I just want to come home,'\" Ms Kerrane said.\n\n\"Hopefully now the Irish authorities can do something to get her home.\"\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs says it is aware of the case and is providing consular assistance.\n\nConsular assistance has been provided to the family for a number of weeks and T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Miche\u00e1l Martin is speaking to his officials in Dubai.\n\nRadha Stirling, chief executive at the human rights organization Detained in Dubai, who has been helping the Toweys, said: \"It's amazing that authorities did not intervene for Tori's protection, given the state her body was in when she was hospitalized the first time.\n\n\"Worse than failing her, authorities in Dubai actually travel-banned her and kept her in the country when she was trying to get away.\n\n\"The UAE used to charge rape victims with 'sex outside marriage'. Now they're charging domestic violence victims with 'attempted suicide' and alcohol consumption.

Considering Dubai's alcohol laws prohibit the possession of alcohol in public, drinking in Dubai is inherently dangerous.\n\n'If a visitor's blood is tested and shows up even one drink, they can be criminally charged. Alcohol tests are often conducted when a complaint is made by a local. If a local is offended by a visitor's dress sense, language or behaviour, they may call the police and have the visitor arrested, even if that person has only consumed a small beer.\n\n'Dubai's laws are highly contradictory. On the one hand, people are encouraged to drink but on the other, it's a criminal offence to have any amount of alcohol in your blood in public. Encouraging visitors to drink more alcohol will most certainly result in increased detentions of Brits abroad in prisons notorious for human rights abuses and police brutality'.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spokesperson for legal group Detained in Dubai (DiD) claimed Tori's South African husband went after her with a knife and punched her, before slamming her arm in the bathroom door trying to break it.\n\nTori said she tried to take her own life after the attack, which left her with severe bruises and injuries.\n\nBut after being taken to a police station, Ms Towey is now facing charges of alcohol consumption and attempting suicide by a court in Dubai.\n\nShe said she is unable to leave the country as her passport was blocked, meaning she can't travel back home to Ireland.\n\nSpeaking through outreach group DiD, who are assisting the family, Ms Towey said: 'I don't know what's going to happen in court next week.\n\n'I'm desperate to go home to Ireland and put all of this in the past. I'm asking the Taoiseach to please help us.'\n\nThe DiD has said Ms Towey could face a lengthy prison sentence in a jail known for 'human rights abuses and torture'.\n\nRadha Stirling, CEO of Detained in Dubai, said: 'We are calling on Dubai authorities to urgently drop the charges against Tori, remove the travel ban and let her fly home to Ireland with her mother. She has been charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\n\n'Strangely, the UAE has gone to great public relations efforts to promote alcohol as legal in the country. In reality, people are still regularly charged with alcohol consumption and possession. Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive.'\n\nShe explained: 'Tori arranged to fly home to Ireland but, when she arrived at the airport, was told a case against her by her husband had been dropped but the travel ban remained.\n\n'She attended the police station who assured her the travel ban would be lifted but it never happened. The next day, Tori and her husband had some wine and he became enraged, accusing her of having an affair.'\n\nMs Towey then attempted to take her own life and ended up in a police station.\n\nMs Stirling explained: 'The next thing she remembers is an ambulance crew and police waking her up. She was taken to Al Barsha police station and kept for several hours before going home again.\n\n'Her mother pleaded to the Irish Consulate but in the absence of their assistance, boarded a flight to Dubai. When she arrived, she wasn't allowed to see Tori alone, her abuser wouldn't allow it.\n\n'The three met at Emirates mall then attended the prosecutor's office to find out what charges had been registered against her.'\n\nMs Towey, who graduated from the Dublin Institute Of Technology, moved to the UAE in April 2023\n\nTori is pictured in 2021, before her move to the UAE - where she now hopes to return to Ireland\n\nIrish premier Simon Harris has said he will work to intervene in the 'appalling' case, while Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald raised Ms Towey's case in the Irish Parliament on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nMr Harris thanked Ms McDonald for bringing the case to his attention, saying: 'I'm not directly appraised of the situation, but I'm very happy to be directly appraised of it now.'\n\nHe said he would work with the deputy 'to intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen in what sounds to be - based on what you tell me - the most appalling circumstances'.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs told the Irish Daily Mail it was aware of the case and was offering consular assistance.\n\nMs McDonald told Dail Eireann that Ms Towey has been the victim of domestic violence and is subject to a travel ban over alleged charges.\n\nShe said she has spoken to Ms Towey, and that the 28-year-old's mother has travelled to Dubai to be with her.\n\n'Tori wants to come home, simple as that. She is a Roscommon woman and she wants to come home,' she said.\n\n'I am asking now, as a matter of absolute urgency, that we have a statement from this House, that you intervene Taoiseach, that the ambassador is called and that it is made absolutely plain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way, and an Irish citizen, an Irish woman will not be treated in this way.'\n\nRadha Stirling, CEO of DiD says Tori's husband attacked her with a knife and punched her, before slamming her arm in the bathroom door trying to break it. Pictured the injuries said to be from the alleged attack\n\nThe 28-year-old moved to the UAE in April 2023 when she was offered a job as a flight attendant with Emirates\n\nMr Harris responded saying he was not aware of Ms Towey's case, and thanked Ms McDonald for bringing it to his attention and that of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Micheal Martin.\n\nHe pledged to work 'to intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen in what sounds to be, based on what you tell me, the most appalling circumstances'.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs told the Irish Daily Mail it was aware of the case and was offering consular assistance.\n\nTalking to Sky News, Tori's aunt Ann Flynn said: 'She's doing her best.' She added: 'It's very stressful, it's stressful for all the family.'\n\nShe described her niece as 'a beautiful young woman' who is 'fun-loving and loved to travel'.\n\nMs Flynn said: 'She got the job of her dreams working for Emirates, and she could continue travelling with work.\n\n'She loved Dubai, and had a good network of friends there.'\n\nThe airline hostess has been told 'nothing could be done' and that the case will be going to court on July 18.\n\nIn 2018, one member of Dubai Police said that they would focus on treatment rather than punishment when it came to suicide victims, even thought suicide and suicide attempts are a crime in the country.\n\nBrig Ahmed bin Ghalaita, then director of Al Refaa Police Station, told The National: 'The move is taken to provide support to suicide attempters and deal with them as victims who need moral support and help.\n\n'Suicide cases are being examined by a police unit and experts in the psychology field to identify the causes behind their attempts and find solutions for them.'\n\nIt comes as earlier this year, British wives boasting of luxury new lives funded by millionaire husbands in Dubai have been warned they risk being dumped homeless on the streets at any moment.\n\nExperts have revealed a surge in complaints from not only women but also men betrayed and dumped by wealthy partners after upping sticks for the Middle East.\n\nThe alert comes amid a TikTok and Instagram trend of UK women sharing footage of spending sprees in the United Arab Emirates after wedding wealthy husbands.\n\nMail Online had also reported on an influx of expats pampered by rich partners, enjoying days filled with shopping trips, extravagant meals and property upgrades.\n\nYet there is a 'dark side' to Dubai that many women only discover too late, according to Manchester-based Aramas International Lawyers' Samara Iqbal.\n\nAdvice for British wives marrying and moving to the Middle East\n\nManchester-based lawyer Samara Iqbal has suggested potential brides moving abroad put these in place:\n\n1. A pre- or post-nuptial agreement which can be done in the UK or filed with the Abu Dhabi Civil Court\n\n2. A credit card/bank account in her own name with some emergency funds and money should she be 'cut off' from her partner's bank accounts\n\n3. A visa in her own name - as this could also be cancelled and she would need to leave within 30 days if she cannot arrange a visa for herself\n\n4. An agreement regarding the custody of any child/children - possibly in the pre-/post-nuptial agreement\n\n5. Ideally a car and some accommodation under her own name, should she find herself thrown out of the marital home\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe told of being inundated with calls for help from not only women but also men wanting protection amid fears they have been - or could be - exploited by a partner promising an alluring new lifestyle in the Middle East.\n\nAnd she has issued a hitlist of warning signs for anyone feeling tempted - while also highlighting a new civil court in neighbouring Abu Dhabi which could offer more help to women stranded overseas and yet which remains little-known to many.\n\nMs Iqbal's firm is based in Manchester but a surge in cases has seen new branches open in Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.\n\nShe too is a watcher of TikTok videos promoting what seem to be aspirational lives in the Middle East - but is now warning women to beware of hidden dangers.\n\nShe outlined how many women find out only too late their husband might have as many as three other wives - and that while handing over upmarket clothes, cards and credit cards, everything remains documented in only his name.\n\nMs Iqbal told Mail Online: 'We've got lots of British women who are attracted by these promises of a luxurious lifestyle, even though their own families aren't happy about it - and not realising he can cut her off at any moment.\n\n'People are literally being dumped on the street. It looks nice, but there's a dark side to Dubai - it can be very scary out there if you find yourself in this position and don't know what your legal rights are.'\n\nHer firm is increasingly being approached for advice on potential pre-nuptial and also post-nuptial agreements as more and more women feel tempted by marriages to someone they've met here before moving together overseas.\n\nShe said: 'We often deal with cases more and more on a daily basis in which lots of women have married and moved out to the UAE only to be left stranded without any source of money and essentially being 'cut off' by their rich partners.\n\n'While these partners may be providing and funding their luxurious lifestyles - cars, designer items, expensive jewellery, holidays, meals out - none of this actually belongs to these women and there is nothing in their name. It's all in their partners name.\n\n'Women are thrown out of marital homes as they do not belong to them - credit cards cut off and they have no recourse to any of the possessions, houses, companies and assets the partner has solely in his own name.\n\n'These assets come under Sharia law and belongs to the person whose name its registered to and she would not be entitled to any of it if her name is not registered.'\n\nPotential husbands might swoop in during university days together, drinking and nightclubbing in a way they would no longer do when back in the UAE, she suggests.\n\nWomen are not the only ones at risk, according to Ms Iqbal - she described being asked for advice by men serenaded in London and promised a better life abroad but worried they could be abandoned or blackmailed over their sexuality.\n\nIn the past year a new civil court in Abu Dhabi has been opened which does recognise British civil orders and tends to look more favourably on UK wives wanting a settlement or at least joint custody of any children.\n\nYet too many people still remain unaware it exists, Ms Iqbal said.\n\nMs Towey's horrific story is not the first time Brits and Irish citizens in Dubai have been slammed with unfair charges.\n\nRadha Stirling - the founder of Detained in Duabi - was inspired to start up the organisation after in 2008 hearing that a colleague called Cat Le-Huy had been arrested by immigration officials in the nation.\n\nAt first, she assumed it was all a big mistake. Her friend, a London-based producer with whom she worked at the TV production company Endemol, had been initially detained because an unidentified bottle of pills was found in his suitcase.\n\nAfter they turned out to be melatonin, a perfectly legal jetlag medication, customs staff announced with a flourish that they had also discovered cannabis among some dust in the depths of the holidaymaker's bag.\n\nThe quantity of this illegal narcotic was, they claimed, exactly 0.03 grams. That's an amount smaller than a single grain of salt and virtually invisible to the human eye.\n\nCat, who hails from Belsize Park, North London, was promptly slapped in handcuffs and transported to the Al Wathba prison, 40 miles north of the airport.\n\nRadha knew that her friend did not take recreational drugs so, initially, thought he would be promptly released. But she was wrong. Instead, she was told to her horror that he faced a four-year prison sentence for 'drug possession'.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, she helped organise a noisy campaign on Cat's behalf, turning him into an international cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.\n\nFinally, after the best part of a month in custody, he was released without charge and allowed to return home.\n\nAs the dust settled, Radha was contacted by several other Westerners who claimed to be victims of grave miscarriages of justice in the tourist hotspot.\n\n'People were basically saying, 'I saw how you helped him, can you help me, too?' she said in an interview with the Daily Mail.\n\n'I suddenly realised that, behind the facade of this glamorous country, which touts its credentials as a popular destination with beaches and luxury hotels, there were huge problems with the rule of law and human rights, affecting vast numbers of innocent people.'\n\nShe duly founded Detained In Dubai, a pressure group that lobbies on behalf of victims of the Emirate state's hardline laws.\n\nAs of 2021, her organisation had helped an incredible 15,000 people -- an average of roughly three per day -- navigate a draconian legal system.\n\n'We have dealt with cases in which rape victims were prosecuted for unlawful sex, foreigners jailed over social media posts, people convicted on the basis of torture and forced confessions, and victims of gross police and prosecutorial misconduct of a variety that staggers the imagination,' she revealed.\n\n'All involve laws that people don't imagine could possibly exist in the modern era.'\n\nAmong the victims Radha has personally helped is Princess Latifa al-Maktoum, the daughter of Dubai's autocratic ruler Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum, who attempted to flee the country in a yacht in 2018.\n\nThe princess was under armed guard, in 2021 sharing videos telling how she had been seized by commandos while in international waters, before being transported back to Dubai, where she had claimed to have been held hostage ever since.\n\n'I spoke to Princess Latifa when she was on the boat and shots were going off,' Radha said. 'It was extremely harrowing. When even a member of the royal family is denied basic human rights, you can imagine how the country treats normal people who aren't even its citizens.'\n\nHowever, in 2022 the Princess Latifa said she is 'living as she wishes' a year after claiming she was being held against her will by her father.\n\nThese and other high-profile cases shine a light on the dark underbelly of a destination whose status as a celebrity hotspot is deeply at odds with its legal system, under which everything from drinking alcohol to holding hands in public and sharing a bedroom with someone who is not your spouse is officially unlawful, and consensual gay sex can earn you a prison sentence of ten years.\n\nAmong the victims Radha has personally helped is Princess Latifa al-Maktoum, the daughter of Dubai's autocratic ruler. The princess was under armed guard, in 2021 sharing videos (pictured) telling how she had been seized by commandos while in international waters, before being transported back to Dubai, where she had claimed to have been held hostage ever since\n\nAlmost any visitor is also at constant risk of prosecution under strict cyber-crime laws.\n\nShould they or any other foreigner fall foul of a policeman, minor royal, business leader or powerful local, the country's authorities can (and often do) trawl through historic social media posts.\n\n'These rules can, in theory, criminalise almost every Western visitor,' says Radha. 'If you're responsible for a Facebook post from five years ago they don't like, and if they want to go for you, then you are toast.'\n\nOne example was Briton Laleh Shahravesh, who was arrested in Dubai in 2019 following a complaint from a local that she had used the social network to brand her ex-husband's new partner 'horse-face'. She was arrested on arrival in the country and only allowed back to the UK several weeks later, after agreeing to pay a \u00a3625 fine for making the supposedly 'defamatory' claim.\n\nElsewhere Scott Richards, a 42-year-old father of two, was detained in 2016 after the police took exception to a Facebook post in which he had shared a link to a crowd-funding campaign to supply blankets for Afghan refugees.\n\nHe spent three weeks behind bars because of a law that bans soliciting donations for non-profits that have not been approved by the government's 'Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities' department.\n\nIn 2021, Detained In Dubai was also representing a 31-year-old HR manager from Gloucestershire arrested at the airport as she tried to return home after three years living in the country.\n\nHer alleged 'crime' is having told her ex-flatmate to 'f*** off' in a WhatsApp message, during a row over the use of the dining table at their home during lockdown. This is also, apparently, defamatory.\n\nFor years, Sheikh Maktoum (pictured in 2019) has often intervened when ugly legal cases threaten his country's international reputation\n\nIt is women's rights that are most commonly abused. A 2005 law states that 'a husband's rights over his wife' include the wife's 'courteous obedience to him', and places conditions on a married woman's right to work or leave the house.\n\nThese rules are routinely used by estranged husbands to exert control over their spouses, even when both parties are Western expats.\n\nRadha says: 'We had one client, a German woman in the process of separating from her husband, who had decided to get a job. Her husband rang up the company and said, 'I didn't give her permission' and they had to fire her.'\n\nIn Dubai, extra-marital sex is punishable by one year or more in prison. On the basis of this law, Amnesty says, a Swedish-run hospital in Ajman Emirate was forced to report pregnant, unmarried women to the police.\n\nThree years ago, a 29-year-old South African resident of Dubai called Emlyn Culverwell took his fianc\u00e9e, Iryna Nohal, a Ukrainian, to a doctor, complaining of stomach pain.\n\nHe promptly diagnosed that she was pregnant. But rather than offering treatment, the doctor called the police. The couple were arrested and jailed when they could not produce a marriage license.\n\nEventually, they were released, apparently at the behest of Sheikh Maktoum. For years, he often intervened when ugly legal cases threaten his country's international reputation.\n\nIf you need to talk to someone, call the Samaritans for free on 116 123 or visit

McDonald said the Irishwoman would return home with her mother from Dubai, adding: \"We await her safe return.\"\n\nThe opposition party leader had brought Towey's plight to the attention of Ireland's national leader, Taoiseach Simon Harris, during a parliamentary session on Tuesday, stressing that the cabin crew member \"is not a criminal, she is a victim of abuse.\"\n\n\"The Taoiseach must intervene, the UAE Ambassador must be called in and it must be made clear to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way, and an Irish citizen will not be treated in this way,\" McDonald said in a social media post on Tuesday.\n\nIreland's Minister of Foreign Affairs Miche\u00e1l Martin also confirmed that Towey had been permitted to return to Ireland in a tweet on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to DiD, Towey was physically and emotionally abused by her South African husband, whom she met while working in the Emirates. DiD said the man, whom it has not identified, was dismissed by UAE authorities after facing questioning over \"behavioral issues.\"\n\n\"He cut her off from her friends and family. If we tried to contact her, she got in trouble,\" Towey's mother Caroline, who few to Dubai to be with her daughter, told DiD.\n\nDiD said that after the most recent alleged attack by her spouse, Towey locked herself in a bathroom at their home and attempted to take her life.\n\n\"The next thing she remembers is an ambulance crew and police waking her up. She was taken to Al Barsha police station and kept for several hours before going home again,\" the group said.\n\n\"Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive,\" said Radha Stirling, CEO of Detained in Dubai and another advocacy group called Due Process International.\n\n\"The UAE used to charge rape victims with sex outside marriage. Now they're charging domestic violence victims with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption,\" Stirling said. \"Dubai police need to be educated on victim care.\"\n\nMedia in the UAE, a tightly controlled conservative Islamic nation, did not report on Towey's case. CBS News has sought comment from the UAE Ministry of Justice and will update this article with any reply, but the country's authorities rarely comment on specific cases.", "source": {"uri":

Considering Dubai's alcohol laws prohibit the possession of alcohol in public, drinking in Dubai is inherently dangerous.\n\n'If a visitor's blood is tested and shows up even one drink, they can be criminally charged. Alcohol tests are often conducted when a complaint is made by a local. If a local is offended by a visitor's dress sense, language or behaviour, they may call the police and have the visitor arrested, even if that person has only consumed a small beer.\n\n'Dubai's laws are highly contradictory. On the one hand, people are encouraged to drink but on the other, it's a criminal offence to have any amount of alcohol in your blood in public. Encouraging visitors to drink more alcohol will most certainly result in increased detentions of Brits abroad in prisons notorious for human rights abuses and police brutality'.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTori's mum Caroline told MailOnline: 'The support from the Irish government and the Irish people has been incredible and we weren't expecting it at all. It's a small country and the politicians are real people.\n\n'We are both exhausted and desperate to get home. Thank you so much to everyone supporting us.'\n\nShe added that her daughter had been through 'the worst time of her life and needs to come home with me and heal'.\n\nTori's aunt Ann Flynn also told Sky News: 'She's doing her best. It's very stressful, stressful for all the family.\n\n'Tori's a beautiful young woman, fun-loving, loves to travel. She got the job of her dreams working for Emirates, and she could continue travelling with work.'\n\n'It's really terrible that this has happened to a young woman who was full of life and full of adventure.'\n\nA spokesperson for legal group Detained in Dubai (DiD) claimed Tori's South African husband went after her with a knife and punched her, before slamming her arm in the bathroom door trying to break it.\n\nTori said she tried to take her own life after the attack, which left her with severe bruises and injuries.\n\nBut after being taken to a police station, Ms Towey is now facing charges of alcohol consumption and attempting suicide by a court in Dubai.\n\nShe said she is unable to leave the country as her passport was blocked, meaning she can't travel back home to Ireland.\n\nSpeaking through outreach group DiD, who are assisting the family, Ms Towey said: 'I don't know what's going to happen in court next week.\n\n'I'm desperate to go home to Ireland and put all of this in the past. I'm asking the Taoiseach to please help us.'\n\nThe DiD has said Ms Towey could face a lengthy prison sentence in a jail known for 'human rights abuses and torture'.\n\nRadha Stirling, CEO of Detained in Dubai, said: 'We are calling on Dubai authorities to urgently drop the charges against Tori, remove the travel ban and let her fly home to Ireland with her mother. She has been charged with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\n\n'Strangely, the UAE has gone to great public relations efforts to promote alcohol as legal in the country. In reality, people are still regularly charged with alcohol consumption and possession. Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive.'\n\nShe explained: 'Tori arranged to fly home to Ireland but, when she arrived at the airport, was told a case against her by her husband had been dropped but the travel ban remained.\n\n'She attended the police station who assured her the travel ban would be lifted but it never happened. The next day, Tori and her husband had some wine and he became enraged, accusing her of having an affair.'\n\nMs Towey then attempted to take her own life and ended up in a police station.\n\nMs Stirling explained: 'The next thing she remembers is an ambulance crew and police waking her up. She was taken to Al Barsha police station and kept for several hours before going home again.\n\n'Her mother pleaded to the Irish Consulate but in the absence of their assistance, boarded a flight to Dubai. When she arrived, she wasn't allowed to see Tori alone, her abuser wouldn't allow it.\n\n'The three met at Emirates mall then attended the prosecutor's office to find out what charges had been registered against her.'\n\nMs Towey, who graduated from the Dublin Institute Of Technology, moved to the UAE in April 2023\n\nTori is pictured in 2021, before her move to the UAE - where she now hopes to return to Ireland\n\nBe the first to commentBe one of the first to commentCommentsShould Ireland intervene to bring Tori Towey home from Dubai?Comment now\n\nIrish premier Simon Harris has said he will work to intervene in the 'appalling' case, while Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald raised Ms Towey's case in the Irish Parliament on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nMr Harris thanked Ms McDonald for bringing the case to his attention, saying: 'I'm not directly appraised of the situation, but I'm very happy to be directly appraised of it now.'\n\nHe said he would work with the deputy 'to intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen in what sounds to be - based on what you tell me - the most appalling circumstances'.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs told the Irish Daily Mail it was aware of the case and was offering consular assistance.\n\nMs McDonald told Dail Eireann that Ms Towey has been the victim of domestic violence and is subject to a travel ban over alleged charges.\n\nShe said she has spoken to Ms Towey, and that the 28-year-old's mother has travelled to Dubai to be with her.\n\n'Tori wants to come home, simple as that. She is a Roscommon woman and she wants to come home,' she said.\n\n'I am asking now, as a matter of absolute urgency, that we have a statement from this House, that you intervene Taoiseach, that the ambassador is called and that it is made absolutely plain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way, and an Irish citizen, an Irish woman will not be treated in this way.'\n\nRadha Stirling, CEO of DiD says Tori's husband attacked her with a knife and punched her, before slamming her arm in the bathroom door trying to break it. Pictured the injuries said to be from the alleged attack\n\nThe 28-year-old moved to the UAE in April 2023 when she was offered a job as a flight attendant with Emirates\n\nMr Harris responded saying he was not aware of Ms Towey's case, and thanked Ms McDonald for bringing it to his attention and that of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Micheal Martin.\n\nHe pledged to work 'to intervene and see how we can support an Irish citizen in what sounds to be, based on what you tell me, the most appalling circumstances'.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs told the Irish Daily Mail it was aware of the case and was offering consular assistance.\n\nTalking to Sky News, Tori's aunt Ann Flynn said: 'She's doing her best.' She added: 'It's very stressful, it's stressful for all the family.'\n\nShe described her niece as 'a beautiful young woman' who is 'fun-loving and loved to travel'.\n\nMs Flynn said: 'She got the job of her dreams working for Emirates, and she could continue travelling with work.\n\n'She loved Dubai, and had a good network of friends there.'\n\nThe airline hostess has been told 'nothing could be done' and that the case will be going to court on July 18.\n\nIn 2018, one member of Dubai Police said that they would focus on treatment rather than punishment when it came to suicide victims, even thought suicide and suicide attempts are a crime in the country.\n\nBrig Ahmed bin Ghalaita, then director of Al Refaa Police Station, told The National: 'The move is taken to provide support to suicide attempters and deal with them as victims who need moral support and help.\n\n'Suicide cases are being examined by a police unit and experts in the psychology field to identify the causes behind their attempts and find solutions for them.'\n\nIt comes as earlier this year, British wives boasting of luxury new lives funded by millionaire husbands in Dubai have been warned they risk being dumped homeless on the streets at any moment.\n\nExperts have revealed a surge in complaints from not only women but also men betrayed and dumped by wealthy partners after upping sticks for the Middle East.\n\nThe alert comes amid a TikTok and Instagram trend of UK women sharing footage of spending sprees in the United Arab Emirates after wedding wealthy husbands.\n\nMail Online had also reported on an influx of expats pampered by rich partners, enjoying days filled with shopping trips, extravagant meals and property upgrades.\n\nYet there is a 'dark side' to Dubai that many women only discover too late, according to Manchester-based Aramas International Lawyers' Samara Iqbal.\n\nAdvice for British wives marrying and moving to the Middle East\n\nManchester-based lawyer Samara Iqbal has suggested potential brides moving abroad put these in place:\n\n1. A pre- or post-nuptial agreement which can be done in the UK or filed with the Abu Dhabi Civil Court\n\n2. A credit card/bank account in her own name with some emergency funds and money should she be 'cut off' from her partner's bank accounts\n\n3. A visa in her own name - as this could also be cancelled and she would need to leave within 30 days if she cannot arrange a visa for herself\n\n4. An agreement regarding the custody of any child/children - possibly in the pre-/post-nuptial agreement\n\n5. Ideally a car and some accommodation under her own name, should she find herself thrown out of the marital home\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe told of being inundated with calls for help from not only women but also men wanting protection amid fears they have been - or could be - exploited by a partner promising an alluring new lifestyle in the Middle East.\n\nAnd she has issued a hitlist of warning signs for anyone feeling tempted - while also highlighting a new civil court in neighbouring Abu Dhabi which could offer more help to women stranded overseas and yet which remains little-known to many.\n\nMs Iqbal's firm is based in Manchester but a surge in cases has seen new branches open in Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.\n\nShe too is a watcher of TikTok videos promoting what seem to be aspirational lives in the Middle East - but is now warning women to beware of hidden dangers.\n\nShe outlined how many women find out only too late their husband might have as many as three other wives - and that while handing over upmarket clothes, cards and credit cards, everything remains documented in only his name.\n\nMs Iqbal told Mail Online: 'We've got lots of British women who are attracted by these promises of a luxurious lifestyle, even though their own families aren't happy about it - and not realising he can cut her off at any moment.\n\n'People are literally being dumped on the street. It looks nice, but there's a dark side to Dubai - it can be very scary out there if you find yourself in this position and don't know what your legal rights are.'\n\nHer firm is increasingly being approached for advice on potential pre-nuptial and also post-nuptial agreements as more and more women feel tempted by marriages to someone they've met here before moving together overseas.\n\nShe said: 'We often deal with cases more and more on a daily basis in which lots of women have married and moved out to the UAE only to be left stranded without any source of money and essentially being 'cut off' by their rich partners.\n\n'While these partners may be providing and funding their luxurious lifestyles - cars, designer items, expensive jewellery, holidays, meals out - none of this actually belongs to these women and there is nothing in their name. It's all in their partners name.\n\n'Women are thrown out of marital homes as they do not belong to them - credit cards cut off and they have no recourse to any of the possessions, houses, companies and assets the partner has solely in his own name.\n\n'These assets come under Sharia law and belongs to the person whose name its registered to and she would not be entitled to any of it if her name is not registered.'\n\nPotential husbands might swoop in during university days together, drinking and nightclubbing in a way they would no longer do when back in the UAE, she suggests.\n\nWomen are not the only ones at risk, according to Ms Iqbal - she described being asked for advice by men serenaded in London and promised a better life abroad but worried they could be abandoned or blackmailed over their sexuality.\n\nIn the past year a new civil court in Abu Dhabi has been opened which does recognise British civil orders and tends to look more favourably on UK wives wanting a settlement or at least joint custody of any children.\n\nYet too many people still remain unaware it exists, Ms Iqbal said.\n\nMs Towey's horrific story is not the first time Brits and Irish citizens in Dubai have been slammed with unfair charges.\n\nRadha Stirling - the founder of Detained in Duabi - was inspired to start up the organisation after in 2008 hearing that a colleague called Cat Le-Huy had been arrested by immigration officials in the nation.\n\nAt first, she assumed it was all a big mistake. Her friend, a London-based producer with whom she worked at the TV production company Endemol, had been initially detained because an unidentified bottle of pills was found in his suitcase.\n\nAfter they turned out to be melatonin, a perfectly legal jetlag medication, customs staff announced with a flourish that they had also discovered cannabis among some dust in the depths of the holidaymaker's bag.\n\nThe quantity of this illegal narcotic was, they claimed, exactly 0.03 grams. That's an amount smaller than a single grain of salt and virtually invisible to the human eye.\n\nCat, who hails from Belsize Park, North London, was promptly slapped in handcuffs and transported to the Al Wathba prison, 40 miles north of the airport.\n\nRadha knew that her friend did not take recreational drugs so, initially, thought he would be promptly released. But she was wrong. Instead, she was told to her horror that he faced a four-year prison sentence for 'drug possession'.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, she helped organise a noisy campaign on Cat's behalf, turning him into an international cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.\n\nFinally, after the best part of a month in custody, he was released without charge and allowed to return home.\n\nAs the dust settled, Radha was contacted by several other Westerners who claimed to be victims of grave miscarriages of justice in the tourist hotspot.\n\n'People were basically saying, 'I saw how you helped him, can you help me, too?' she said in an interview with the Daily Mail.\n\n'I suddenly realised that, behind the facade of this glamorous country, which touts its credentials as a popular destination with beaches and luxury hotels, there were huge problems with the rule of law and human rights, affecting vast numbers of innocent people.'\n\nShe duly founded Detained In Dubai, a pressure group that lobbies on behalf of victims of the Emirate state's hardline laws.\n\nAs of 2021, her organisation had helped an incredible 15,000 people -- an average of roughly three per day -- navigate a draconian legal system.\n\n'We have dealt with cases in which rape victims were prosecuted for unlawful sex, foreigners jailed over social media posts, people convicted on the basis of torture and forced confessions, and victims of gross police and prosecutorial misconduct of a variety that staggers the imagination,' she revealed.\n\n'All involve laws that people don't imagine could possibly exist in the modern era.'\n\nAmong the victims Radha has personally helped is Princess Latifa al-Maktoum, the daughter of Dubai's autocratic ruler Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum, who attempted to flee the country in a yacht in 2018.\n\nThe princess was under armed guard, in 2021 sharing videos telling how she had been seized by commandos while in international waters, before being transported back to Dubai, where she had claimed to have been held hostage ever since.\n\n'I spoke to Princess Latifa when she was on the boat and shots were going off,' Radha said. 'It was extremely harrowing. When even a member of the royal family is denied basic human rights, you can imagine how the country treats normal people who aren't even its citizens.'\n\nHowever, in 2022 the Princess Latifa said she is 'living as she wishes' a year after claiming she was being held against her will by her father.\n\nThese and other high-profile cases shine a light on the dark underbelly of a destination whose status as a celebrity hotspot is deeply at odds with its legal system, under which everything from drinking alcohol to holding hands in public and sharing a bedroom with someone who is not your spouse is officially unlawful, and consensual gay sex can earn you a prison sentence of ten years.\n\nAmong the victims Radha has personally helped is Princess Latifa al-Maktoum, the daughter of Dubai's autocratic ruler. The princess was under armed guard, in 2021 sharing videos (pictured) telling how she had been seized by commandos while in international waters, before being transported back to Dubai, where she had claimed to have been held hostage ever since\n\nAlmost any visitor is also at constant risk of prosecution under strict cyber-crime laws.\n\nShould they or any other foreigner fall foul of a policeman, minor royal, business leader or powerful local, the country's authorities can (and often do) trawl through historic social media posts.\n\n'These rules can, in theory, criminalise almost every Western visitor,' says Radha. 'If you're responsible for a Facebook post from five years ago they don't like, and if they want to go for you, then you are toast.'\n\nOne example was Briton Laleh Shahravesh, who was arrested in Dubai in 2019 following a complaint from a local that she had used the social network to brand her ex-husband's new partner 'horse-face'. She was arrested on arrival in the country and only allowed back to the UK several weeks later, after agreeing to pay a \u00a3625 fine for making the supposedly 'defamatory' claim.\n\nElsewhere Scott Richards, a 42-year-old father of two, was detained in 2016 after the police took exception to a Facebook post in which he had shared a link to a crowd-funding campaign to supply blankets for Afghan refugees.\n\nHe spent three weeks behind bars because of a law that bans soliciting donations for non-profits that have not been approved by the government's 'Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities' department.\n\nIn 2021, Detained In Dubai was also representing a 31-year-old HR manager from Gloucestershire arrested at the airport as she tried to return home after three years living in the country.\n\nHer alleged 'crime' is having told her ex-flatmate to 'f*** off' in a WhatsApp message, during a row over the use of the dining table at their home during lockdown. This is also, apparently, defamatory.\n\nFor years, Sheikh Maktoum (pictured in 2019) has often intervened when ugly legal cases threaten his country's international reputation\n\nIt is women's rights that are most commonly abused. A 2005 law states that 'a husband's rights over his wife' include the wife's 'courteous obedience to him', and places conditions on a married woman's right to work or leave the house.\n\nThese rules are routinely used by estranged husbands to exert control over their spouses, even when both parties are Western expats.\n\nRadha says: 'We had one client, a German woman in the process of separating from her husband, who had decided to get a job. Her husband rang up the company and said, 'I didn't give her permission' and they had to fire her.'\n\nIn Dubai, extra-marital sex is punishable by one year or more in prison. On the basis of this law, Amnesty says, a Swedish-run hospital in Ajman Emirate was forced to report pregnant, unmarried women to the police.\n\nThree years ago, a 29-year-old South African resident of Dubai called Emlyn Culverwell took his fianc\u00e9e, Iryna Nohal, a Ukrainian, to a doctor, complaining of stomach pain.\n\nHe promptly diagnosed that she was pregnant. But rather than offering treatment, the doctor called the police. The couple were arrested and jailed when they could not produce a marriage license.\n\nEventually, they were released, apparently at the behest of Sheikh Maktoum. For years, he often intervened when ugly legal cases threaten his country's international reputation.\n\nIf you need to talk to someone, call the Samaritans for free on 116 123 or visit

However, he said there was a process to go through, and he could not comment on cases until it was completed.\n\nHe said he anticipated that Ms Towey and her mother Caroline, who had travelled to Dubai to support her daughter, would be returning to Ireland at the earliest opportunity now Ms Towey's passport had been returned.\n\nThe T\u00e1naiste said Ms Milton and her team in the UAE had opened up \"good channels of communication and engagement\" with local authorities, which had facilitated the lifting of charges against Ms Towey.\n\n\"It has been very, very challenging and traumatic for Tori over the last while, but I think our team there has been in contact and has engaged with the family, and indeed with the authorities as well, and it's been a constructive engagement and they have responded with the issue being resolved,\" Mr Martin said.\n\nAdvertisementThat's the importance of very strong diplomats on the ground\n\nHe added: \"Different jurisdictions have different norms, and different approaches which sometimes don't approximate to ours, but we work with the authorities in such situations, and we work to try and resolve issues of this kind.\n\n\"That's the importance of very strong diplomats on the ground. People have good relationships and work those relationships to get the best outcomes for our citizens when difficulties and when challenges arise.\"\n\n\"Our objective always is to make the best judgment calls and to work as effectively as we can to bring about resolutions for our citizens, positive outcomes for our citizens, and I'm glad, in this case with Tori, that we've managed to do that and to be of assistance to her.\"\n\nThe update comes after the Government was commended by a human rights group for its swift action regarding Ms Towey's case.\n\nThe chief executive of Detained in Dubai, Radha Stirling, told Newstalk radio on Wednesday morning: \"I'm super impressed by Ireland's response, it was so swift.\"\n\n\"When a government gets behind their citizens, when they go the extra mile, they are successful in getting citizens home.\"\n\nMs Stirling outlined the background of the case, explaining Ms Towey had moved to Dubai last year to pursue an aviation career.\n\n\"She was working as cabin crew for Emirates Airlines, and she ended up marrying a South African man.\n\n\"Things went south very quickly, and he became physically abusive to her. She went to hospital and had severe injuries.\n\n\"After that, there was another assault, and she broke free, ran up to the bathroom, and she woke up with paramedics and police over her, and she was taken to the police station and actually charged with attempted suicide and consuming alcohol,\" Ms Stirling said.\n\nOn the outpouring of support for Ms Towey, Ms Stirling added: \"It's amazing to see people really standing behind her and wanting her home as soon as possible.\"\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, you can contact Women's Aid (24-hour freephone helpline at 1800-341 900, email helpline@womensaid.ie), Men's Aid Ireland (confidential helpline at 01-554 3811, email hello@mensaid.ie), or the Samaritans (24-hour confidential freephone helpline at 116 123, email jo@samaritans.org) for support and information.

There was a travel ban imposed on her and she had gone to the authorities seeking protection many times but to absolutely no avail.\n\n\"But following one particularly severe beating in which her husband repeatedly tried to slam doors on her arms and break her limbs, she escaped upstairs, and she attempted to take her own life.\n\n\"The system over there, rather than protecting this woman, who is an Irish citizen, chose instead to detain her, to charge her.\n\n\"Tori wants to come home.

Then there's the language barrier too. It's just horrendous.\n\n\"There was a small bit of alcohol in her system so she was charged with alcohol abuse. And with 'attempted suicide'.\"\n\nAlthough Ms Towey went to the police, she was told to go home to her husband, Ms Kerrane said.\n\n\"He ripped up her passport, so she couldn't work as an airline attendant, then she had no money, so she couldn't come home.\"\n\nA travel ban was also placed on her passport so she could not escape.\n\nDuring one allegedly brutal attack in her home, it's understood she escaped into the bathroom and tried to take her own life in a bid to escape her husband, fearing he would torture her to death.\n\n\"The next thing she knew, paramedics were there,\" Ms Kerrane said.\n\n\"Then she was arrested on June 28 and had no idea what she had been arrested for.\"\n\nMs Towey is now hiding in Dubai with her mother and hoping for help.\n\nThey are too scared to talk to the media as they fear it is illegal to do so.\n\n\"They can't speak so we have to speak for them,\" Ms Kerrane said.\n\nA court date has been set for July 18.\n\n\"And we're in the last week of the D\u00e1il so there's that pressure too,\" said Ms Kerrane.\n\nHowever, politicians now plan to work cross-party in a bid to get the Irish woman back home to safety and Taoiseach Simon Harris has said he's ready to intervene in the case.\n\n\"She said today: 'I just want to come home,'\" Ms Kerrane said.\n\n\"Hopefully now the Irish authorities can do something to get her home.\"\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs says it is aware of the case and is providing consular assistance.\n\nConsular assistance has been provided to the family for a number of weeks and T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Miche\u00e1l Martin is speaking to his officials in Dubai.\n\nRadha Stirling, chief executive at the human rights organisation Detained in Dubai, who has been helping the Toweys, said: \"It's amazing that authorities did not intervene for Tori's protection, given the state her body was in when she was hospitalised the first time.\n\n\"Worse than failing her, authorities in Dubai actually travel-banned her and kept her in the country when she was trying to get away.\n\n\"The UAE used to charge rape victims with 'sex outside marriage'.

Towey was charged with consumption of alcohol and attempting suicide, which have historically been criminalized acts in the UAE. Within Detained in Dubai's post about Towey, it is alleged that she was facing domestic abuse from her husband and that he physically attacked her before the incident took place. Her husband has yet to publicly comment on these allegations.\n\nRead More: You can view the CDC's guidance on suicide prevention here.\n\nTowey -- who survived the alleged suicide attempt -- was taken to a local police station, where she had her passport destroyed. Until Wednesday's U-turn decision, she was previously prevented from leaving the country, the D\u00e1il, the lower house of the Oireachtas, Ireland's parliament, heard on Tuesday.\n\nMcDonald told colleagues in the D\u00e1il of Towey's case and called on Taoiseach [Prime Minister] Simon Harris to intervene, The Irish Times reported. \"The system over there, rather than protecting this woman who is an Irish citizen, chose instead to detain her to charge her. She's now under the most incredible stress when I spoke to her this afternoon,\" McDonald said.\n\nMcDonald also said that Towey's mother Caroline had flown to Dubai to be with her daughter.\n\nHarris, who said he was not previously familiar with Towey's case, vowed to offer any support the Irish native requires. The Department of Foreign Affairs has said it is aware of the case and is providing consular assistance to Towey.\n\nTIME has reached out to both the Irish and UAE governments for further information and comment on Towey's case.\n\nRadha Stirling, who founded Detained in Dubai, told BBC News NI she had spoken to Towey on Wednesday morning and remarked on the momentum behind the Irish woman's case.\n\n\"The Irish government is certainly stepping up in record time, we usually don't see them come together that fast,\" Stirling said. \"I'm expecting with that diplomatic push we might be able to get her home even before the court date next week, but of course we have to plan that it could go very badly and she could end up with a prison sentence,\" she added.\n\nTowey's case is set to be heard in court on July 18.\n\nWhile suicide has historically been illegal in the UAE, it was widely reported that 2020 reforms to the Gulf nation's personal status and penal laws would see landmark changes to decriminalize suicide and attempted suicide. While survivors of suicide were rarely prosecuted, the law left them vulnerable to charges and less likely to seek help.\n\nAlcohol consumption was also decriminalized in the same wave of reforms, which aimed to modernize the nation where expats form around 88% of the population.\n\nHowever, per documents from the UAE's Ministry of Justice pertaining to the \"Federal Decree Law No. (15) of 2020,\" those accused of attempting suicide can still be subjected to incarceration of \"no more than six months,\" a fine of \"no more than 5,000 AED\" ($1,361), or both punishments. The court is also given the discretion to order that the detention period be served in a \"healing facility.\" Meanwhile, those accused of aiding an individual attempting suicide are \"subject to the punishment of incarceration.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "armani_syed@time.com", "name": "Armani Syed", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Today, he reiterated this commitment and said her safe return was an \"absolute priority\".\n\nREAD MORE: Taoiseach promises to intervene in case of Irish woman facing charges in Dubai who is 'lucky to be alive'\n\nREAD MORE: Tributes pour in for sports-mad teenager who died after falling from Cliffs of Moher\n\nMs Towey's mother Caroline has travelled to Dubai to be with her daughter, and both women are \"very nervous\" and most anxious to come home, the 28-year-old's aunt told RT\u00c9's Morning Ireland.\n\n\"Tori can't travel so Caroline has to stay with [her], so we're all just very anxious,\" she said.\n\n\"They're very nervous and just can't wait to get home, you know, being in a strange country on their own, it's very hard. We're all just very, very anxious.\n\n\"It's hard to believe that this young woman has been charged with trying to commit suicide... it's very, very hard to believe it.\"\n\nMs Flynn said the whole family is hoping that the phone will ring and they will be told that Caroline and Tori are on a plane on their way home to Ireland. She has been in contact with both women several times a day since the situation emerged.\n\n\"It's really terrible that this has happened to a young woman who was full of life and full of adventure and loved travelling. She's a beautiful young woman,\" Ms Flynn added.\n\n\"They're both trying to keep positive, we're trying to keep positive as well, but it's on your mind constantly, and I'm sure it's on their minds... it's so far away.\"\n\nShe said the family were hoping that a court case in relation to the charges that Ms Towey is facing won't go ahead, and admitted that they didn't know what would happen if it does.\n\nMeanwhile, Radha Stirling of the group Detained in Dubai described the charges as \"bizarre\", given that Dubai had apparently decriminalised attempted suicide in recent years.\n\nShe said the UAE had also promoted the fact that it had decriminalised alcohol consumption, \"so it's quite surprising that they would proceed to... take her to court knowing that she obviously needs help, needs to just go home with her family\".\n\nMs Towey and her mother are currently staying in an Airbnb in Dubai and are free to leave the property. However, it's understood that the authorities have seized Ms Towey's passport and she cannot leave the country.\n\n\"It wouldn't matter if she did have her passport because it will have a travel ban and she wouldn't be able to leave without it. So, if the police drop the case against her, she will be able to get her passport and leave the country,\" Ms Stirling said.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

Attempted suicide is a crime in the Arab state, carrying a sentence of up to six months.\n\nIn response to questions in the D\u00e1il, Taoiseach Simon Harris said he is prepared to intervene and offer any support required by Ms Towey.\n\nHer case is due to be heard next week, explained Ms Stirling, who went on to outline the background to the case.\n\nShe said Ms Towey had moved to Dubai last year to pursue an aviation career. \"She was working as cabin crew for Emirates Airlines, and she ended up marrying a South African man. Things went south very quickly, and he became physically abusive to her. She went to hospital and had severe injuries,\" Ms Stirling said.\n\n\"After that, there was another assault and she broke free, ran up to the bathroom, and she woke up with paramedics and police over her, and she was taken to the police station and actually charged with, attempted suicide and consuming alcohol.\"\n\nThe situation was \"absurd\" that a woman who had been assaulted would be further abused by the system, Ms Stirling said.\n\n\"We have seen over the years, we've seen rape victims charged with sex outside marriage. We've seen this kind of culture coming from the UAE before. They had made an effort for public relations purposes, they were starting to take women's rights a bit more seriously, victim rights. But it seems like nothing has changed.\n\n\"And this is truly astonishing that someone who's been beaten to the degree that she has bruises all over her body, and now she's being abused by the system itself again. So I find it outrageous,\" Ms Stiring said.\n\n\"And I can see that's why there's so much support out there from Irish citizens, from politicians, from your leaders in your Government. So it's amazing to see people really standing behind her and wanting her home as soon as possible.\n\n\"When it comes to a case like this, it's all about diplomacy. Without the support of the Irish Government, she would be likely to face prison and charges and deportation,\" she said.\n\n\"Various members of the Irish Government have contacted the UAE ambassador to Ireland and of course Ireland's ambassador in the UAE, and they're trying to get those diplomatic talks happening. If that happens, that is the best and fastest way to get her home.\n\n\"She was told she had been charged with alcohol abuse and attempted suicide. Now I validated this with the Department of Public Prosecutions today and it's exactly as they said. So there's been no differences to the charges. And so they are proceeding on that, which is very bizarre since they allegedly decriminalised attempted suicide in the past couple of years and also have been promoting that they have decriminalised alcohol consumption,\" Ms Stirling said.\n\n\"So it's quite surprising that they would proceed to charge, especially her, under these circumstances, and take her to court, knowing that she obviously needs help, needs to just go home with her family.\"\n\nIreland's ambassador to UAE spoke with Ms Towey last night, and she is staying in an Airbnb with her mother Caroline who flew out to support her, according to Ms Stirling.\n\n\"She is exhausted and she's finding it very overwhelming. But at the same time, we're really, really warmed by all of the support that she's been getting. I don't think she expected all of that. I don't think she expected the Irish Government to motivate themselves as quickly. And this is the fastest I've ever seen this happen from a government. So I'm super impressed by Ireland's response.\"\n\n\"We've dealt with many human rights issues like this, and when the government gets behind the citizen and talks to their counterparts, the foreign affairs ministry in the UAE escalates it even to the ruler, Sheikh Mohammed, or the head of the police department and the justice system. When they do that and they go the extra mile rather than just deferring it and pretending they can't do anything, when they actually make the effort, they are successful in getting the citizens home.\"\n\n\"She is very, very much looking forward to coming home and recovering from what's been an extremely terrible, shocking year for her, in fact. So I think she needs to heal. She needs to be around friends and family and the safety of her country,\" Ms Stirling said.\n\nAccording to its website, Detained in Dubai provides confidential legal help in civil and criminal cases and consults with governments internationally on UAE legal issues.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Her passport has been destroyed and a travel ban has been imposed on her.\"\n\nThis morning, the Taoiseach said he doesn't want to say too much given the level of diplomatic activity underway but that he has spoken to both Towey and her mother, Caroline.\n\n\"Tori has been through, in my view, the most horrific situation. And it is utterly, utterly unacceptable how an Irish citizen is being treated. That's mild language in terms of how I feel,\" he said.\n\nShe needs to be supported, she needs to be brought back to her home here in Ireland, and we need the travel ban lifted to make that happen.\n\n\"I had a conversation with the T\u00e1naiste who is working on this matter as Minister of Foreign Affairs. I've spoken to our ambassador in the region as well and have been in constant contact with her on this matter since yesterday,\" Harris added.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

I have found this whole episode to be grotesque and medieval, in what it says around how women are treated as objects, as possessions.\n\n\"And I find it really distressing that a woman who had suffered such vicious domestic violence wasn't protected, wasn't supported, but instead was actually charged with offences herself.\"\n\nMcDonald said most people would struggle to get their heads around the details of Towey's ordeal in Dubai.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier, she told the D\u00e1il of how Towey was \"subjected to sustained and brutal domestic violence\" before being charged with attempted suicide and alcohol abuse.\n\n\"This case of Tori, who we will welcome home, highlights the need for Ireland, not alone to get our act together domestically, but also to raise concerns and issues and standards around women's human rights internationally as well,\" McDonald told reporters this afternoon.\n\nWhen asked if Towey's case raises questions for other Irish citizens in Dubai and the UAE, McDonald said there is an obligation on the Irish state to protect Irish citizens.\n\nShe said no woman should suffer what Towey did and said she believes it has been made \"very clear from Ireland\" that \"an Irish citizen, an Irish woman won't be treated like that, not anywhere\".\n\n\"And if that happens, that it will be called out very loudly and very, very clearly,\" McDonald said.\n\nShe added: \"Of course, people are going to travel and travel to Dubai, for recreation, and for other purposes. The point in question here is that when a woman suffers a violent attack, that she is supported, that the perpetrator is the criminal, not the woman.\n\n\"And that message, I think has to be articulated very clearly. And I hope understood, crystal clear by the authorities in Dubai.\"\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nRepresentatives of a 28-year-old air stewardess held in Dubai say she's been freed. Tori Towey, 28, from Ireland, was taken to a police station after she was allegedly attacked, according to reports.\n\nIt resulted in the Emirates Airlines worker having her passport blocked, which prevented her from travelling back home to Ireland. Later this month she was due to face charges in the UAE of alcohol consumption and attempted suicide, reports MirrorOnline.\n\nSince her case was made public, diplomatic pressure was piled on the Middle Eastern state. Now the travel ban imposed by Dubai authorities has been lifted, Ireland's premier has said.\n\nREAD MORE: UK drivers must pay \u00a3120 to enter Europe if they don't have correct number plate\n\nGet breaking news on BirminghamLive WhatsApp, click the link to join\n\nAn update to Ireland's parliament was provided by Taoiseach Simon Harris this afternoon, July 10. He said that Ms Towey would be \"taken to the airport as soon as she is ready\", with the embassy set to follow up the case.\n\nMr Harris said: \"I've just been informed that the travel ban has been lifted, that the embassy will take Tori to the airport as soon as she is ready to go and that the embassy of course will continue to follow up on the case, which is still active as of now.\" The Taoiseach also thanked diplomats for their help after the stewardess was initially left without recourse ahead of her expected court appearance this week.\n\nIrish diplomats were working with campaign group Detained in Dubai (DiD) to free Ms Towey, who had moved to the state in 2021 to start work at Emirates. The group said she is \"over the moon\" after learning she would be able to leave the country earlier today. CEO Radha Stirling, who has assisted the stewardess, said she is \"thrilled and relieved\" to return home.\n\nShe said: \"She said she is over the moon and looking forward to getting home to Ireland and seeing the rest of her family. She is a little nervous too because there is that worry that something could happen before she gets on a plane but the overriding feeling is one of joy.\"\n\nMs Towey's family has since thanked the Irish government and campaigners for their help, with her mum Caroline telling the Daily Mail Online the support \"has been incredible\". She said: \"The support from the Irish government and the Irish people has been incredible and we weren't expecting it at all.\n\n\"It's a small country and the politicians are real people. We are both exhausted and desperate to get home.

We're trying to keep positive as well, but it's on your mind constantly, and I'm sure it's on their minds because all the family gets in touch with them.\"\n\nMs Flynn added that with the help of the Irish Government and a human rights advocacy group, Detained in Dubai, which focusses on these kinds of cases, the family are hopeful of a positive outcome.\n\nMeanwhile, the chief executive of Detained in Dubai, Radha Stirling, spoke to Newstalk Breakfast, praising the speedy response of the Irish Government to Ms Towey's case.\n\n\"I'm super impressed by Ireland's response, it was so swift,\" Ms Stirling said.\n\n\"When a government gets behind their citizens, when they go the extra mile, they are successful in getting citizens home.\"\n\nMs Stirling, who said she is in daily contact with Ms Towey, said she is hopeful that diplomatic efforts by the Department of Foreign Affairs would lead to the case against Ms Towey being dropped, allowing her to return to Ireland.\n\nTori's case is due to be held next week, Ms Stirling added, and outlined the background of the case.\n\nMs Stirling explained Ms Towey had moved to Dubai last year to pursue an aviation career.\n\n\"She was working as cabin crew for Emirates Airlines, and she ended up marrying a South African man.\n\n\"Things went south very quickly, and he became physically abusive to her. She went to hospital and had severe injuries.\n\n\"After that, there was another assault, and she broke free, ran up to the bathroom, and she woke up with paramedics and police over her, and she was taken to the police station and actually charged with attempted suicide and consuming alcohol,\" Ms Stirling said.\n\nShe described it as \"absurd\" that a woman who had been assaulted would be further abused by the system.\n\n\"We have seen over the years rape victims charged with sex outside marriage. We've seen this kind of culture coming from the UAE before.\n\nThis is the fastest I've ever seen this happen from a government, so I'm super impressed by Ireland's response\n\n\"They had made an effort for public relations purposes, they were starting to take women's rights a bit more seriously, victim rights, but it seems like nothing has changed, and this is truly astonishing that someone who's been beaten to the degree that she has bruises all over her body, and now she's being abused by the system itself again.\"\n\nMs Stirling added: \"I find it outrageous, and I can see that's why there's so much support out there from Irish citizens, from politicians, from your leaders in your government. It's amazing to see people really standing behind her and wanting her home as soon as possible.\"\n\nMs Stirling said Tori is currently recuperating in rental accommodation with her mother, and spoke to Ireland's ambassador to the UAE on Monday night.\n\n\"She is exhausted, and she's finding it very overwhelming, but at the same time, we're really, really warmed by all of the support that she's been getting,\" Ms Stirling said.\n\n\"I don't think she expected all of that.

Radha Stirling, the CEO of Detained in Dubai has called on prosecutors to drop the charges and let Tori return home so that she can be with her family.\n\nThe Irish flight attendant moved to Dubai in April 2023 when she landed a coveted job with Emirates and quickly fell in love with a coworker from South Africa. After a whirlwind romance, the pair got married, but it didn't take long for the relationship to turn sour.\n\nThings started to come to head after a night out at McCaffreys Pub, a popular place for a night out for Emirates crew, where Tori's husband had to be restrained by security staff after he started to cause 'havoc'.\n\nPolice were called but Tori's husband was simply sent home without any further intervention. Tori was ordered to go home with him.\n\nOnce they got home, it's alleged that Tori's husband started to brutally beat her, kicking and biting her, threatening her with a knife and repeatedly slamming her arm in a bathroom door in an attempt to break it.\n\nStirling says Tori's husband threatened to kill her and tore up both of their passports before neighbours came to the rescue and got Tori to a hospital in the back of an ambulance.\n\nTori filed a police report against her husband and Emirates gave her some time off work to allow her to recover. During this time, Tori went to replace her passport but discovered that she had been slapped with a travel ban.\n\nTori attempted to fly home to Ireland but was unable to leave due to the travel ban and she eventually returned home to her husband. The first few days were peaceful but after drinking some wine, Tori's husband suddenly accused her of having an affair.\n\nFearing that he would kill her, Tori ran to the bathroom and attempted to take her own life. The next thing she remembers is waking up in an ambulance.\n\nBut instead of taking her to a hospital, Tori was transported to the infamous Al Barsha police station where she was held for several hours. She has since been charged with consuming alcohol and attempted suicide. Her case is due to be heard in court on July 18.\n\n\"Tori's experience is nothing short of tragic and quite frankly, she is lucky to be alive,\" Stirling said after the story came to light. \"It's amazing that authorities did not intervene for Tori's protection, given the state her body was in when she was hospitalised the first time.\"\n\nStirling added: \"Emirates Airlines, the Irish Embassy and the UAE medical and police services could certainly have done more to help Tori.\"\n\n\"Worse than failing her, authorities in Dubai actually travel-banned her and kept her in the country when she was trying to get away. They put her in a hopeless position resulting in her attempt to kill herself to escape the imminent threat of assault and likely murder\".\n\nTori's family hopes that by taking her story public, the Dubai authorities will bow to international pressure drop the charges against her and allow her to return home.\n\nThe Irish embassy is now providing consular assistance and officials have now arranged a lawyer for Tori after a high-level political intervention.\n\nIn 2020, an Emirates crew member from Britain was held for months in Dubai after being charged with possession of cannabis. Derrin Crawford was arrested after going on a date with a new acquaintance and going back to his apartment which was subsequently raided by police.\n\nAt the time, Detained in Dubai said Derrin was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nLocal media in the UAE have not reported Tori's ordeal.", "source": {"uri": "paddleyourownkanoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Paddle Your Own

A spokesperson for the legal group Detained in Dubai (DiD) revealed that the young woman's South African husband chased her with a knife and punched her before slamming her hand into the bathroom door, trying to break it. After the attack, Taui's husband, who also worked for Emirates Airline, was fired from his job.\n\nPsychologically affected by the attack, which left her body covered in cuts and bruises, the Irish flight attendant became drunk and tried to end her life. Fortunately, she did not succeed, but was subsequently taken to the local police station, where she was informed that she would be prosecuted for drinking and attempted suicide. Since then, the 28-year-old has been desperately trying to find a way to return home as the local authorities have blocked her passport and she cannot travel.\n\nSpeaking through the DiD group, which is assisting the family, Taui said: \"I don't know what will happen in court next week. I desperately want to go back to Ireland and put all this behind me. I ask the Irish Prime Minister to help us.\" According to the support group, the girl is at risk of ending up incarcerated in a prison known for \"human rights abuses and torture\".\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris said he would intervene to find a solution to this \"appalling\" case, following a question raised by Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou MacDonald in the Irish parliament on Tuesday afternoon. Mr Harris thanked Ms McDonald for bringing the problem to his attention and pledged to work with the MP to provide help for their young compatriot.\n\nMacDonald said she had spoken to Taui and that the 28-year-old's mother had travelled to Dubai to be with her. \"Tori just wants to go home. She is a woman from Roscommon and she wants to come home,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News, Tori's aunt, Anne Flynn, said the girl is trying to build up her courage. \"It's a very stressful situation for the whole family,\" she said, describing her niece as \"a beautiful young woman\" who \"loves to have fun and travel\".\n\n\"She was hired into her dream job at Emirates and could continue to travel as a flight attendant. She loved Dubai and had several friends there,\" she said of the girl.", "source": {"uri": "en.protothema.gr", "dataType": "news", "title": "protothemanews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "electra_delavogia@en.protothema.gr", "name": "Electra Delavogia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emirate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoiseach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taoiseach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_(airline)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emirates (airline)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Harris_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simon Harris (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oireachtas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oireachtas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinn_F\u00e9in", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sinn F\u00e9in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://en.protothema.gr/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4-8-1024x575.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718655", "eventUri": "eng-9718655", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5294117647058824, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Ms Towey was charged with attempted suicide and alcohol abuse after being attacked, Irish parliamentarians were told.\n\nTori wanted to leave following hospital treatment for bruises and other injuries, according to activists, but she was prevented from doing so. Dubai authorities also banned her from leaving the state, the Dail chamber heard.\n\nDetained in Dubai has said she could face a lengthy jail sentence in a prison known for \"human rights abuses and torture\", highlighting the legal pitfalls that Brits potentially experience when moving to Dubai.\n\nIrish premier Simon Harris has now said a travel ban imposed by Dubai authorities has been lifted. He said: \"I've just been informed that the travel ban has been lifted, that the embassy will take Tori to the airport as soon as she is ready to go, and that the embassy of course will continue to follow up on the case, which is still active as of now.\"\n\nMr Harris said he spoke to Ms Towey and her mother Caroline shortly after the update, and she \"will soon be home\".\n\nTravel vloggers Stefano and Nathalie warned they were oblivious to some of the laws as they enjoyed their lives in Dubai, with Stefano saying: \"So we got to know things that were normal for us but that could actually have gotten us in jail.\"\n\nHere are seven things you probably didn't know were illegal in Dubai, according to Sense the Lens:\n\n1. Having a dirty car in public spaces - fine of up to 500 dirhams\n\nStefano said the reason for this law is because Dubai's authorities believe that a \"dirty car will give a bad image of Dubai\" and dirt can make it difficult for the police to identify a vehicle.\n\n2. Cleaning your dirty car - fine of up to 500 dirhams\n\nDespite the previous law, you can face a fine for cleaning your own car in public because it will \"make the streets dirty\" and \"give a bad image of Dubai\", according to the YouTuber.\n\n3. Spreading rumours and fake news - one year in prison and a fine of up to 100,000 dirhams\n\nAccording to Gulf News, the law applies to \"anyone who uses the internet to publish, circulate or spread false news, rumours or misleading information, contrary to the news published by official sources\".\n\n4. Carrying poppy seeds - up to 20 years in prison\n\nPoppy seeds (which Stefano says are considered a drug in Dubai), posta or khas khas are banned throughout the UAE, reports the Economic Times.\n\n5. Swearing or bad gestures - fine of up to 500,000 dirhams\n\nThe GOV website says swearing and rude gestures are considered obscene acts and are illegal in the UAE, potentially leading to prison and deportation.\n\n6.

I really appreciate it.\"\n\nFrantic Tori had been facing jail time in Dubai after being charged over a bid to take her own life following the attack by her husband.\n\nThe young woman suffered severe bruising and other injuries.\n\nBut in the wake of the horrific domestic abuse, authorities in Dubai instead charged the assault victim with attempted suicide and alcohol consumption.\n\nAnd rather than helping her return to Ireland, Tori was left trapped in Dubai after she was hit with a travel ban ahead of a scheduled court showdown next week.\n\nShe had been forced to stay in a rented apartment in Dubai with mum Caroline, who flew out to support her daughter.\n\nWith Tori due before court on the criminal charges next week, the worried Towey family had urged the Irish Government to intervene and help get her home to Ireland.\n\nAnd in a major development on Wednesday, Taoiseach Simon Harris revealed that Dubai's travel ban on Ms Towey had been lifted.\n\nDelivering an update in \"real time\" in the Dail, Harris said: \"I've just been informed that the travel ban has been lifted, that the embassy will take Tori to the airport as soon as she is ready to go.\"\n\nHarris thanked the Irish embassy in the UAE for its work on the case, describing Tori's ordeal as \"unimaginable\".\n\nHe said: \"A woman who has been a victim of a brutal attack found herself waking up not in hospital, but in a police station.\"\n\nThe Taoiseach issued a special message of thanks to our embassy for its behind-the-scenes work on the case to get Tori free.\n\nCrusading lawyer and human rights campaigner Radha Stirling had first highlighted Tori's plight.\n\nStirling today confirmed police in the UAE have now withdrawn the charges against Ms Towey and lifted the travel ban.\n\nAnd the CEO of advocacy group Detained in Dubai told how the Roscommon native was \"relieved and overjoyed\". Stirling told The Irish Sun: \"Tori is absolutely over the moon.\n\n\"She is so grateful to the support of the Irish people, the media and the Irish Government, who I must commend for their swift response.\n\n\"Diplomatic conversations happened and developed quickly behind closed doors.\n\n\"There was a lot of push by Ireland over the past couple of days.\n\n\"Tori has been really overwhelmed in a good way with all the support she has received.\n\n\"She has been overwhelmed with how much genuine support she has got from Irish citizens, who had been ringing up their own local representatives saying 'please help this woman'.\n\n\"Tori has been really, really amazed at the support from Irish people.\n\n\"And the Irish Government has really stepped in and responded tremendously quickly.\n\n\"It has felt like Ireland has come together and wrapped their arms around Tori.\n\n\"It really hit home with Dubai and forced them to make this decision (letting Tori return to Ireland).\n\n\"This should never have happened to Tori in the first place.\n\n\"She is a victim, it was outrageous that the UAE acted this way towards a woman, a victim of domestic violence.\"\n\nAll charges against Tori have been dropped and the case closed.\n\nTori's overjoyed relatives in Roscommon revealed they were planning a big homecoming party for their girl.\n\nHer aunt, Ann Flynn, beamed: \"It's amazing, you can't believe the relief. But it's amazing. The best news ever.\"\n\nAnd she praised both Government and opposition TDs for the \"amazing\" support they had given to their crisis-hit family.\n\nAnn told how her stressed niece was facing \"no light at the end of the tunnel\" until dramatic diplomatic interventions from Ireland.\n\nTori's family are now looking forward to starting \"a new chapter with her\".\n\nAnn, who spoke to Tori's mum Caroline on the phone after news broke that travel ban had been lifted, said: \"Life starts again.\n\n\"It's all our Christmases come together, we're so excited and can't wait to get the two home.\"\n\nAnother aunt, Trish Beirne, called it \"great news\" that Tori was coming home and also paid tribute to friends in the Roscommon area who had offered support to the family.\n\nTrish said: \"Until the chips are down you don't realise how good people are.\"\n\nSinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald had raised the matter in the Dail on Tuesday, telling how Tori was the victim of domestic violence at the hands of her husband.\n\nMcDonald on Wednesday welcomed news of a breakthrough on Ms Towey's travel ban while blasting the \"medieval, grotesque treatment of women\" in the UAE.\n\nMcDonald said: \"I want to thank everyone for the huge support shown to Tori and Caroline over the last number of days.\n\n\"The ordeal Tori has been subjected to has been horrendous.\n\n\"I know that Tori and her mum are deeply grateful for the solidarity and good will that has been shown towards them across Ireland. We now await their safe return to Ireland and to Roscommon.\"\n\nSinn Fein Roscommon-Galway TD Claire Kerrane also pressed Micheal Martin for help to resolve Tori's \"absolutely frightening\" situation.\n\nTanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Martin paid tribute to the Irish Ambassador to the UAE, Alison Milton, for her role in solving the matter.\n\nThe Tanaiste told how Ms Milton and her team in the UAE had opened up \"good channels of communication and engagement\" with the Dubai authorities that had facilitated the lifting of the travel ban against Ms Towey.", "source":

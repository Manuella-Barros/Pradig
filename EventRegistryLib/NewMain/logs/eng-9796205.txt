Police blocked all the roads into Charleston's downtown peninsula as a precaution. Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that have already seen two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate some residents and waded in waist-deep in floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nMichael Jones said downpours sent water gushing into his home Monday evening, overturning the refrigerator and causing furniture to float. Outside, the water seemed to be everywhere and was too deep to flee safely. So Jones spent a sleepless night on his kitchen table before firefighters going door-to-door came to his home in a boat Tuesday morning.\n\n\"It was hell all night,\" Jones said. He added: \"It was a struggle, but God is good.\"\n\nOfficials in Charleston continued a curfew, closing all roads into the downtown peninsula and letting only essential workers and emergency personnel pass through. Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city hadn't had to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nDebby's center was 10 miles east of Savannah, the National Hurricane Center said in its 5 p.m. advisory Tuesday. It was moving east-northeast at just 3 mph, and right along the coastline near Georgia's Tybee Island.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nThere will be lulls in the rain as dry slots appear in between bands around the center of the poorly organized storm. But some of the rainbands will be heavy and will keep moving over the same places. And it is impossible to precisely predict who will get the deluges before they happen, forecasters said.\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches. A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot of rain were reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, who was on his anchored sailboat and whose body was recovered after a person saw the vessel had partially sunk, WTSP-TV reported.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said more than 200 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it may be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\n\"You're going to see the tributaries rise. That's just inevitable. How much? We'll see,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday. \"It may be that it's not flooded today and it could be flooded tomorrow.\"\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane center predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "opb.org", "dataType":

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby drenched coastal cities in Georgia and South Carolina, stirred up tornadoes and submerged streets with waist-high floodwaters Tuesday in what is just the beginning of a prolonged storm that could dump staggering totals up to 25 inches of rain.\n\nCharleston and Savannah took the first blow, with up to a foot of rain falling along the coast between the two cities in just over 24 hours. Police blocked all the roads into Charleston's downtown peninsula as a precaution. Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that have already seen two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate some residents and waded in waist-deep in floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nMichael Jones said downpours sent water gushing into his home Monday evening, overturning the refrigerator and causing furniture to float. Outside, the water seemed to be everywhere and was too deep to flee safely. So Jones spent a sleepless night on his kitchen table before firefighters going door-to-door came to his home in a boat Tuesday morning.\n\n\"It was hell all night,\" Jones said. He added: \"It was a struggle, but God is good.\"\n\nOfficials in Charleston continued a curfew, closing all roads into the downtown peninsula and letting only essential workers and emergency personnel pass through. Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city hadn't had to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nDebby's center was 10 miles east of Savannah, the National Hurricane Center said in its 5 p.m. advisory Tuesday. It was moving east-northeast at just 3 mph, and right along the coastline near Georgia's Tybee Island.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nThere will be lulls in the rain as dry slots appear in between bands around the center of the poorly organized storm. But some of the rainbands will be heavy and will keep moving over the same places. And it is impossible to precisely predict who will get the deluges before they happen, forecasters said.\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, S.C., reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches. A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot of rain was reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles (48 kilometers) inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it may be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\n\"You're going to see the tributaries rise. That's just inevitable. How much? We'll see,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday. \"It may be that it's not flooded today and it could be flooded tomorrow.\"\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane center predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "news-gazette.com",

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby drenched coastal cities in Georgia and South Carolina, stirred up tornadoes and submerged streets with waist-high floodwaters Tuesday in what is just the beginning of a prolonged storm that could dump staggering rain totals of up to 25 inches (64 centimeters).\n\nCharleston and Savannah took the first blow, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain falling along the coast between the two cities in just over 24 hours. Police blocked all the roads into Charleston's downtown peninsula as a precaution. Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that have already seen two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate some residents and waded in waist-deep in floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nMichael Jones said downpours sent water gushing into his home Monday evening, overturning the refrigerator and causing furniture to float. Outside, the water seemed to be everywhere and was too deep to flee safely. So Jones spent a sleepless night on his kitchen table before firefighters going door-to-door came to his home in a boat Tuesday morning.\n\n\"It was hell all night,\" Jones said. He added: \"It was a struggle, but God is good.\"\n\nOfficials in Charleston continued a curfew, closing all roads into the downtown peninsula and letting only essential workers and emergency personnel pass through. Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city hadn't had to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nDebby's center was 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Savannah, the National Hurricane Center said in its 5 p.m. advisory Tuesday. It was moving east-northeast at just 3 mph (5 kph), and right along the coastline near Georgia's Tybee Island.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nThere will be lulls in the rain as dry slots appear in between bands around the center of the poorly organized storm. But some of the rainbands will be heavy and will keep moving over the same places. And it is impossible to precisely predict who will get the deluges before they happen, forecasters said.\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches (36 centimeters). A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain were reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches (17 centimeters) of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches (14.1 centimeters) of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles (48 kilometers) inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, who was on his anchored sailboat and whose body was recovered after a person saw the vessel had partially sunk, WTSP-TV reported.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said more than 200 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it may be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\n\"You're going to see the tributaries rise. That's just inevitable. How much? We'll see,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday. \"It may be that it's not flooded today and it could be flooded tomorrow.\"\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane center predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby drenched coastal cities in Georgia and South Carolina, stirred up tornadoes and submerged streets with waist-high floodwaters Tuesday in what is just the beginning of a prolonged storm that could dump staggering totals up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain.\n\nCharleston and Savannah took the first blow, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain falling along the coast between the two cities in just over 24 hours. Police blocked all the roads into Charleston's downtown peninsula as a precaution. Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that have already seen two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate some residents and waded in waist-deep in floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nMichael Jones said downpours sent water gushing into his home Monday evening, overturning the refrigerator and causing furniture to float. Outside, the water seemed to be everywhere and was too deep to flee safely. So Jones spent a sleepless night on his kitchen table before firefighters going door-to-door came to his home in a boat Tuesday morning.\n\n\"It was hell all night,\" Jones said. He added: \"It was a struggle, but God is good.\"\n\nOfficials in Charleston continued a curfew, closing all roads into the downtown peninsula and letting only essential workers and emergency personnel pass through. Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city hadn't had to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nDebby's center was 10 miles (15 kilometers) southeast of Savannah, the National Hurricane Center said in its 2 p.m. advisory Tuesday. It was moving east-northeast at just 5 mph (7 kph), and right along the coastline near Georgia's Tybee Island.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches (36 centimeters). A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain were reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches (17 centimeters) of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches (14.1 centimeters) of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles (48 kilometers) inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it may be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\n\"You're going to see the tributaries rise. That's just inevitable. How much? We'll see,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday. \"It may be that it's not flooded today and it could be flooded tomorrow.\"\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane center predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city didn't have to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches. A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot of rain was reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it could be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane center predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.\n\nCoastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in

President Biden authorized emergency declarations from governors in both states as well as South Carolina.\n\nDebby was expected to move offshore of the Georgia coast later on Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center said. As of 2 p.m. EDT Tuesday, Debby's center was some 10 miles southeast of Savannah, Georgia, and 80 miles southwest of Charleston, South Carolina, and was moving east-northeast at 5 mph with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, the hurricane center said.\n\nForecasters warned of serious flood threats to various parts of the southeastern United States this week, with potentially major impacts to Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina over the next few days as Debby lingers near the South Carolina coast. Although the storm is weakening, forecasters said they expect Debby to strengthen again somewhat on Wednesday and Thursday as it moves offshore.\n\n\"Debby is expected to produce potentially historic rainfall totals of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum amounts of 25 inches, bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of southeast Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina, and southeast North Carolina through Friday,\" the Miami-based hurricane center said. \"From northern North Carolina through portions of the Mid-Atlantic States, 4 to 8 inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 12 inches, are expected through Sunday morning. This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with river flooding possible.\"\n\n\"On the forecast track,\" the hurricane center said, \"the center of Debby is expected to move offshore the coast of Georgia later today and tonight, continue to drift offshore through early Thursday, and then move inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\"\n\nTropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 205 miles east of the center, the center added.\n\nCBS News senior weather and climate producer David Parkinson said at 6 a.m. EDT that, \"Much of the low country of South Carolina has already received around a foot of rain. Some bands over the state now are bringing rain at a rate of 2-3 inches per hour. In Savannah, they're beginning to get on the back side of the storm, so the worst rain is over, but another 3 inches or so is possible.\"\n\n\"In Charleston, however, they're in the thick of it right now, and will see torrential rain off and on for at least the next 36 hours,\" he said. \"That area is the best candidate for a total above 2 feet by the conclusion of the storm. There is still another 12-16 inches coming to many areas from Debby.\"\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It weakened to a tropical storm and was moving slowly, bringing drenching rain and severe flooding to many areas.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nOver 100,000 customers had no power Tuesday afternoon in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, according to PowerOutage.us. Most of the outages were reported in Florida, with a few thousand additional outage reports cropping up in North Carolina as the day progressed.\n\nHundreds of flights meant to depart or arrive in the U.S. were canceled on Tuesday, and another 1,400 or so were delayed, according to FlightAware.com. Those numbers were down from upwards of 1,600 flight cancellations nationwide on Monday, many of which were either routing into or from Florida airports.\n\nIn addition to its curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nSouth Carolina Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson warned that, \"The heavy rains and flooding currently predicted this week are historic in scope and scale. Our experts with the National Hurricane Center believe flooding to be catastrophic for many parts of South Carolina. Take no chances with this storm.\"\n\nA tornado hit Monck's Corner, a town in South Carolina, overnight, causing minor damage to a dialysis center and major damage to several businesses including an Arby's and a Walmart, the town's fire chief, Robert Gass, told CBS News on Tuesday morning. One person sustained minor injuries tied to the twister, which also overturned cars in the area, Gass said.\n\nMonck's Corner Mayor Thomas Hamilton said earlier that a suspected tornado had struck the town, adding that there were no major injuries reported but some buildings and vehicles were damaged.\n\nHamilton offered photos of some of the damage:\n\nIn Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nThe Manatee County Emergency Operations Center in Bradenton, Florida, said Tuesday morning that the region was hit with record levels of rain -- with 18 inches falling in some places. Officials said they had already carried out 55 water rescues since Debby struck, for 210 people and two horses, while fielding thousands of emergency calls. Local officials were in touch with the Federal Emergency Management Agency as they braced for another 4 or 5 inches of rain, at least. DeSantis said the area could see as much as 8 more inches of rainfall.\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie.\n\nMr. Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Mr. Biden also approved a request from Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to issue an emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to his state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order he signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.", "source": {"uri": "newson6.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News On 6"}, "authors": [{"uri": "griffin_media@newson6.com", "name": "Griffin Media", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Police blocked all the roads into Charleston's downtown peninsula as a precaution. Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that already saw two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate some residents and waded in waist-deep in floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city didn't have to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches. A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot of rain was reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it could be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane center predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.\n\nCoastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in

A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County fire-rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot of rain were reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches of rainfall just on Monday.

A Walmart, an Arby's, and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles inland from Charleston.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Fla., a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it may be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\nPresident Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.",

Police blocked all the roads into Charleston's downtown peninsula as a precaution. Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that already saw two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate some residents and waded in waist-deep in floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nOfficials in Charleston continued a curfew, closing roads into the downtown peninsula and letting only essential workers and emergency personnel pass through. Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city didn't have to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches. A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot of rain was reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it could be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane center predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.\n\nCoastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in

Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that already saw two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate some residents and waded in waist-deep in floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city didn't have to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches. A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot of rain was reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it could be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane center predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.\n\nCoastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in

Police blocked all the roads into Charleston's downtown peninsula as a precaution. Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that have already seen two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate residents and waded in waist-deep floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nResident Michael Jones said downpours sent water gushing into his home Monday evening, overturning his refrigerator and causing furniture to float. Outside, the water seemed to be everywhere and was too deep to flee safely. So Jones spent a sleepless night on his kitchen table before firefighters going door-to-door came to his home in a boat Tuesday morning.\n\n\"It was hell all night,\" Jones said. He added: \"It was a struggle, but God is good.\"\n\nOfficials in Charleston continued a curfew, closing all roads into the downtown peninsula and letting only essential workers and emergency personnel pass through. Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city hadn't had to do any high-water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents that the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned that up to 38 centimeters (15 inches) of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Two years later, rain and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state on Tuesday.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 36 centimeters (14 inches).\n\nClose to 30 centimeters (12 inches) of rain was reported down the coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 17 centimeters (6.68 inches) of rainfall just on Monday. That's a month's worth of rain in a single day: In August 2023, the city got 14.1 centimeters (5.56 inches) of rain.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it may be two weeks before staff can fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki",

Both cities announced overnight curfews as the rains picked up.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston, South Carolina. Multiple businesses were damaged, and several cars flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles from Charleston.\n\nDebby continued to dump rain on Parris Island, South Carolina.

Police blocked all the roads into Charleston's downtown peninsula as a precaution. Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that already saw two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate some residents and waded in waist-deep in floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city didn't have to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches. A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot of rain was reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it could be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane center predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.\n\nCoastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in

Police blocked all the roads into Charleston's downtown peninsula as a precaution. Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that already saw two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate some residents and waded in waist-deep in floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nOfficials in Charleston continued a curfew, closing roads into the downtown peninsula and letting only essential workers and emergency personnel pass through. Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city didn't have to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches. A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot of rain was reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it could be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane center predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.\n\nCoastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in

(7 km/h), and right along the coastline near Georgia's Tybee Island.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane centre said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches (36 centimetres). A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot (30 centimetres) of rain were reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches (17 centimetres) of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches (14.1 centimetres) of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles (48 kilometres) inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it may be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\n\"You're going to see the tributaries rise. That's just inevitable. How much? We'll see,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday. \"It may be that it's not flooded today and it could be flooded tomorrow.\"\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane centre predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.\n\n------", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca",

Police blocked all the roads into Charleston's downtown peninsula as a precaution. Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that already saw two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate some residents and waded in waist-deep in floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city didn't have to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches.

Police blocked all the roads into Charleston's downtown peninsula as a precaution. Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that have already seen two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate some residents and waded in waist-deep in floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nMichael Jones said downpours sent water gushing into his home Monday evening, overturning the refrigerator and causing furniture to float. Outside, the water seemed to be everywhere and was too deep to flee safely. So Jones spent a sleepless night on his kitchen table before firefighters going door-to-door came to his home in a boat Tuesday morning.\n\n\"It was hell all night,\" Jones said. He added: \"It was a struggle, but God is good.\"\n\nOfficials in Charleston continued a curfew, closing all roads into the downtown peninsula and letting only essential workers and emergency personnel pass through. Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city hadn't had to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nDebby's center was 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Savannah, the National Hurricane Center said in its 5 p.m. advisory Tuesday. It was moving east-northeast at just 3 mph (5 kph), and right along the coastline near Georgia's Tybee Island.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nThere will be lulls in the rain as dry slots appear in between bands around the center of the poorly organized storm. But some of the rainbands will be heavy and will keep moving over the same places. And it is impossible to precisely predict who will get the deluges before they happen, forecasters said.\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches (36 centimeters). A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain were reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches (17 centimeters) of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches (14.1 centimeters) of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles (48 kilometers) inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it may be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\n\"You're going to see the tributaries rise. That's just inevitable. How much? We'll see,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday. \"It may be that it's not flooded today and it could be flooded tomorrow.\"\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane center predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com",

Authorities in states farther north along the coast were closely monitoring its progress.\n\nDebby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. The categorization is based on wind speeds, but meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon based on the potential for strong winds, heavy rains and flooding that could come as Tropical Storm Debby slowly moves up the coast.\n\n\"It's crucial that we work together and remain vigilant during these times to minimize the impact of the storm,\" Youngkin said in a statement. \"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges.\"\n\nThe declaration will mobilize resources and equipment in an effort to respond to the storm, which is expected to begin impacting Virginia on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"The National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center forecasts are predicting the potential for tropical storm force winds, heavy rain, and severe flooding across the entirety of the state,\" Youngkin said.\n\nFirefighters use boats to evacuate residents and deliver supplies in one Savannah neighborhood\n\nFloodwaters swamped several streets in the Tremont Park neighborhood of west Savannah, where firefighters Tuesday used boats to evacuate some residents and waded waist-deep to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nMichael Jones said downpours sent water gushing into his home Monday evening, overturning the refrigerator and causing furniture to float. \"The water was just everywhere,\" Jones said. \"You couldn't get out of the door. You stepped out the door and it almost felt like you stepped in a sinkhole.\"\n\nJones said he spent a sleepless night lying on the kitchen table. Then firefighters checking door-to-door Tuesday showed up with a boat, taking Jones and others to safety.\n\n\"It was hell all night,\" Jones said. \"It was a struggle, but God is good.\"\n\nFlooding threat could persist long after storm moves on, South Carolina governor says\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Tuesday that Tropical Storm Debby hasn't been as bad as feared. But he warned residents that the flooding threat could continue long after the slow-moving system moves on.\n\nDebby was spinning back out to sea Tuesday afternoon and was expected to slowly churn just off South Carolina for more than 24 hours. Forecasters said 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain could fall in rural areas of northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina that were devastated by huge floods in Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018.\n\nAnd if that much rain falls inland, it could send floodwaters on an up to two-week trek to the sea, inundating homes and businesses along its path.\n\n\"It takes time. A lot of this flooding will happen likely after so we're going to have to be alert for a long time,\" McMaster said.\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported since Debby's bands first started hitting the state Monday.\n\nLatest advisory from the National Hurricane Center\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of Savannah, Georgia, and moving east-northeast at near 5 mph (8 kph), the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday in its 2 p.m. advisory.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. Tropical-storm force winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) extend outward over extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km) east of the center.\n\nDebby's center is expected to move off the Georgia coast Tuesday and then move back inland over South Carolina on Thursday, the hurricane center said. The main rainfall threat includes the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday.\n\nHeavy rains spill water over South Carolina dam but structure holds\n\nFlooding from Debby wasn't limited to coastal areas.\n\nWater started spilling over the top of a small dam near Walterboro, South Carolina, but it didn't crumble, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said in a video briefing. An apartment complex in Walterboro did flood and a number of roads in the county were blocked either by standing water or fallen trees, but no major damage was reported, Greene said.\n\nColleton County fire officials sent out a warning Tuesday about the McGrady Dam near Walterboro, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Charleston. They said about 50 people might be affected if the dam was breached.\n\nTo the south, the neighboring community of Green Pond reported 14 inches (36 centimeters) of rain since Debby first started to hit the area Monday, Greene said.\n\nIn South Carolina, uncertainty but preparedness\n\nSouth Carolina residents aren't sure how strong Debby's ultimate punch will be where they are, but they're preparing for any scenario.\n\n\"There's a lot of question marks,\" said David E. Lally, 83, who lives near the coast and stocked up with groceries and a 12-pack of Miller Lite. He worries Debby's forecast heavy rains could cause problems on the Waccamaw River and other streams.\n\nCrooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close Tuesday afternoon as rain bore down and the region faced threats of flash flooding, tornadoes and storm surge.\n\n\"No one can pinpoint exactly what areas the flooding will occur in, and we're unsure of how bad it will be. We just know it is inevitable and want to keep our team as safe as possible,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis wrote in an email.\n\nFlorida keeps a wary eye on parts upstream\n\nOfficials warned Tuesday that all the water expected to fall on Georgia and South Carolina from Tropical Storm Debby could cause serious flooding downstream in Florida for days or weeks to come.\n\n\"We are going to see more flooding in northern Florida,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a briefing in Steinhatchee, near where Debby made initial landfall as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\n\"You're going to see the tributaries rise. That's just inevitable. How much? We'll see,\" he said. \"It may be that it's not flooded today and it could be flooded tomorrow.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service warned that parts of the St. Marys, Suwannee and Santa Fe Rivers are projected to reach major flood stage west of Jacksonville and north of Gainesville, with the potential to inundate roads and houses.\n\nParts of southwest Florida already flooded, leading to 500 rescues from homes in Sarasota County.\n\nOfficials said it may be two weeks before they can fully assess damage in parts of north-central Florida as they wait for rivers to crest.\n\nSavannah largely escapes major flooding -- so far\n\nIn Savannah, Georgia, the steady, soaking rainfall eased, at least temporarily, by late morning Tuesday as the storm's center reached the state's coast. Authorities expressed relief that the most dreadful predictions of 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain had so far not materialized.\n\n\"We are blessed and highly favored for what was predicted to come our way -- we got a majority of it, but we didn't get the brunt,\" Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis said. A curfew put in place Monday night was being lifted, he said.\n\nSignificant flooding was reported in at least one neighborhood, with firefighters using boats to evacuate stranded residents in the Tremont Park section of west Savannah.\n\nOther neighborhoods in Chatham County, which includes Savannah, remained flooded. Authorities asked people to avoid those areas while cleanup continues.\n\nElsewhere, streets that had flooded during downpours Monday evening were mostly clear. With many offices and businesses closed, residents jogged and walked their dogs.\n\nThe forecast called for more rain, some of it heavy, in Savannah in the coming days as Debby crawls offshore. The National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches (16.96 centimeters) of rainfall in Savannah on Monday. That's more rain than Georgia's oldest city saw in all of August last year.\n\nLatest advisory from the National Hurricane Center\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Savannah, Georgia, and moving east-northeast at near 6 mph (9 kph), the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday in its 11 a.m. advisory.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. Tropical-storm force winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) extend outward over 200 miles (330 kilometers) from the center.\n\nDebby's center is expected to move off the Georgia coast later Tuesday, then move back inland over South Carolina on Thursday, the center said.\n\nCharleston extends curfew and tells 'yahoos' to stay off roads\n\nThe peninsula that makes up much of the downtown and older, historic parts of Charleston, South Carolina, will remain closed Tuesday as Tropical Storm Debby spins nearby, Mayor William Cogswell said.\n\nPolice have barricaded all eight roads into the peninsula and let only essential workers and emergency personnel in or out since 11 p.m. Monday. The barriers will remain in place until at least Wednesday morning.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nAttention now turns to Debby moving offshore, perhaps strengthening and sending stronger winds onshore, causing power outages and some tidal flooding Wednesday into Thursday.\n\nGeorgia governor tells residents to stay vigilant\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday at Georgia's emergency management center in Atlanta, Gov. Brian Kemp urged residents in the storm area to remain vigilant and stay off roads. \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nKemp said that in the best case, the storm area will get another 4 or 5 inches (10 or 12.7 centimeters) of rain. But he warned that another model showed the storm stalling and moving back into Georgia, dumping as much as 9 additional inches (22.9 centimeters) of rain.\n\nStill, State Meteorologist Will Lanxton said the possibility of catastrophic flooding is much less likely.\n\nDebby brings flooding, tornadoes to South Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina is bracing for days of rain through Thursday from Tropical Storm Debby. It already spawned tornadoes and caused flooding Tuesday in areas along the state's coast.\n\nThe tornadoes toppled trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Applebee's and other businesses were damaged, and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) inland from Charleston.\n\nRadar estimated more than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain fell between Hilton Head Island and Charleston overnight. There were local reports of flooding, including parts of downtown Charleston that often flood, but no widespread damage.\n\nSome forecasts indicate Debby could bring 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain to rural areas of North and South Carolina that were devastated by floods in Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018. Each caused over $1 billion in damage and killed dozens.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers lacked power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nBiden approves Georgia disaster declaration\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for much of Georgia, making disaster assistance available for the effects of Hurricane Debby, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Tuesday.\n\nThe declaration authorizes FEMA to mobilize equipment and other resources to protect lives, property and public health, including coordinating evacuations and shelters.\n\nCharleston's geography creates a special threat\n\nMuch of South Carolina's historic Charleston peninsula lies on low marshland filled in over the years by dirt and debris.\n\nWith the Ashley and Cooper rivers on either side, the city of about 155,000 is hard to drain, especially during high tide or when the winds blow onshore from the Atlantic Ocean. Rising sea levels have made it harder, with water covering streets more than twice a month now -- even without a storm like Debby looming.\n\nThe rivers and deep port have been critical to Charleston since its founding in 1670.\n\nThe city's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nDebby still getting energy from ocean water, expert says\n\nDebby has weakened over land because tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm water, but part of the circulation was still interacting Tuesday with water over the Atlantic, said Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm's center is expected to move out over the water off the Georgia and South Carolina coast, then move back inland, so it could restrengthen, but it's not clear how much, he said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted from northeastern Florida up into North Carolina, and very heavy rain is expected, leading to catastrophic flooding across parts of southeastern Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday, he said.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" he said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nCharleston ready with sandbags, parking garages\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Youngkin",

Authorities in states farther north along the coast were closely monitoring its progress.\n\nDebby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. The categorization is based on wind speeds, but meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Savannah, Georgia, and moving east-northeast at near 3 mph (5 kph), the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday in its 5 p.m. advisory.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. Tropical storm-force winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) extend outward up to 205 miles (330 kilometers) from the center.\n\nDebby's center is off the Georgia coast and is expected to move back inland over South Carolina on Thursday, the hurricane center said. The main rainfall threat includes the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday.\n\nParts of Virginia, the Middle Atlantic states, western and northern New York State and northern New England could see 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 centimeters) of rain with local amounts reaching 8 inches (20 centimeters) through Saturday, with a threat of flash and urban flooding.\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon based on the potential for strong winds, heavy rains and flooding that could come as Tropical Storm Debby slowly moves up the coast.\n\n\"It's crucial that we work together and remain vigilant during these times to minimize the impact of the storm,\" Youngkin said in a statement. \"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges.\"\n\nThe declaration will mobilize resources and equipment in an effort to respond to the storm, which is expected to begin impacting Virginia on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"The National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center forecasts are predicting the potential for tropical storm force winds, heavy rain, and severe flooding across the entirety of the state,\" Youngkin said.\n\nFloodwaters swamped several streets in the Tremont Park neighborhood of west Savannah, where firefighters Tuesday used boats to evacuate some residents and waded waist-deep to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nMichael Jones said downpours sent water gushing into his home Monday evening, overturning the refrigerator and causing furniture to float. \"The water was just everywhere,\" Jones said. \"You couldn't get out of the door. You stepped out the door and it almost felt like you stepped in a sinkhole.\"\n\nJones said he spent a sleepless night lying on the kitchen table. Then firefighters checking door-to-door Tuesday showed up with a boat, taking Jones and others to safety.\n\n\"It was hell all night,\" Jones said. \"It was a struggle, but God is good.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Tuesday that Tropical Storm Debby hasn't been as bad as feared. But he warned residents that the flooding threat could continue long after the slow-moving system moves on.\n\nDebby was spinning back out to sea Tuesday afternoon and was expected to slowly churn just off South Carolina for more than 24 hours. Forecasters said 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain could fall in rural areas of northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina that were devastated by huge floods in Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018.\n\nAnd if that much rain falls inland, it could send floodwaters on an up to two-week trek to the sea, inundating homes and businesses along its path.\n\n\"It takes time. A lot of this flooding will happen likely after so we're going to have to be alert for a long time,\" McMaster said.\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported since Debby's bands first started hitting the state Monday.\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of Savannah, Georgia, and moving east-northeast at near 5 mph (8 kph), the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday in its 2 p.m. advisory.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. Tropical-storm force winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) extend outward over extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km) east of the center.\n\nDebby's center is expected to move off the Georgia coast Tuesday and then move back inland over South Carolina on Thursday, the hurricane center said. The main rainfall threat includes the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday.\n\nFlooding from Debby wasn't limited to coastal areas.\n\nWater started spilling over the top of a small dam near Walterboro, South Carolina, but it didn't crumble, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said in a video briefing. An apartment complex in Walterboro did flood and a number of roads in the county were blocked either by standing water or fallen trees, but no major damage was reported, Greene said.\n\nColleton County fire officials sent out a warning Tuesday about the McGrady Dam near Walterboro, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Charleston. They said about 50 people might be affected if the dam was breached.\n\nTo the south, the neighboring community of Green Pond reported 14 inches (36 centimeters) of rain since Debby first started to hit the area Monday, Greene said.\n\nSouth Carolina residents aren't sure how strong Debby's ultimate punch will be where they are, but they're preparing for any scenario.\n\n\"There's a lot of question marks,\" said David E. Lally, 83, who lives near the coast and stocked up with groceries and a 12-pack of Miller Lite. He worries Debby's forecast heavy rains could cause problems on the Waccamaw River and other streams.\n\nCrooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close Tuesday afternoon as rain bore down and the region faced threats of flash flooding, tornadoes and storm surge.\n\n\"No one can pinpoint exactly what areas the flooding will occur in, and we're unsure of how bad it will be. We just know it is inevitable and want to keep our team as safe as possible,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis wrote in an email.\n\nOfficials warned Tuesday that all the water expected to fall on Georgia and South Carolina from Tropical Storm Debby could cause serious flooding downstream in Florida for days or weeks to come.\n\n\"We are going to see more flooding in northern Florida,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a briefing in Steinhatchee, near where Debby made initial landfall as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\n\"You're going to see the tributaries rise. That's just inevitable. How much? We'll see,\" he said. \"It may be that it's not flooded today and it could be flooded tomorrow.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service warned that parts of the St. Marys, Suwannee and Santa Fe Rivers are projected to reach major flood stage west of Jacksonville and north of Gainesville, with the potential to inundate roads and houses.\n\nParts of southwest Florida already flooded, leading to 500 rescues from homes in Sarasota County.\n\nOfficials said it may be two weeks before they can fully assess damage in parts of north-central Florida as they wait for rivers to crest.\n\nIn Savannah, Georgia, the steady, soaking rainfall eased, at least temporarily, by late morning Tuesday as the storm's center reached the state's coast. Authorities expressed relief that the most dreadful predictions of 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain had so far not materialized.\n\n\"We are blessed and highly favored for what was predicted to come our way -- we got a majority of it, but we didn't get the brunt,\" Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis said. A curfew put in place Monday night was being lifted, he said.\n\nSignificant flooding was reported in at least one neighborhood, with firefighters using boats to evacuate stranded residents in the Tremont Park section of west Savannah.\n\nOther neighborhoods in Chatham County, which includes Savannah, remained flooded. Authorities asked people to avoid those areas while cleanup continues.\n\nElsewhere, streets that had flooded during downpours Monday evening were mostly clear. With many offices and businesses closed, residents jogged and walked their dogs.\n\nThe forecast called for more rain, some of it heavy, in Savannah in the coming days as Debby crawls offshore. The National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches (16.96 centimeters) of rainfall in Savannah on Monday. That's more rain than Georgia's oldest city saw in all of August last year.\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Savannah, Georgia, and moving east-northeast at near 6 mph (9 kph), the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday in its 11 a.m. advisory.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. Tropical-storm force winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) extend outward over 200 miles (330 kilometers) from the center.\n\nDebby's center is expected to move off the Georgia coast later Tuesday, then move back inland over South Carolina on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe peninsula that makes up much of the downtown and older, historic parts of Charleston, South Carolina, will remain closed Tuesday as Tropical Storm Debby spins nearby, Mayor William Cogswell said.\n\nPolice have barricaded all eight roads into the peninsula and let only essential workers and emergency personnel in or out since 11 p.m. Monday. The barriers will remain in place until at least Wednesday morning.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nAttention now turns to Debby moving offshore, perhaps strengthening and sending stronger winds onshore, causing power outages and some tidal flooding Wednesday into Thursday.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday at Georgia's emergency management center in Atlanta, Gov. Brian Kemp urged residents in the storm area to remain vigilant and stay off roads. \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nKemp said that in the best case, the storm area will get another 4 or 5 inches (10 or 12.7 centimeters) of rain. But he warned that another model showed the storm stalling and moving back into Georgia, dumping as much as 9 additional inches (22.9 centimeters) of rain.\n\nStill, State Meteorologist Will Lanxton said the possibility of catastrophic flooding is much less likely.\n\nSouth Carolina is bracing for days of rain through Thursday from Tropical Storm Debby. It already spawned tornadoes and caused flooding Tuesday in areas along the state's coast.\n\nThe tornadoes toppled trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Applebee's and other businesses were damaged, and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) inland from Charleston.\n\nRadar estimated more than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain fell between Hilton Head Island and Charleston overnight. There were local reports of flooding, including parts of downtown Charleston that often flood, but no widespread damage.\n\nSome forecasts indicate Debby could bring 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain to rural areas of North and South Carolina that were devastated by floods in Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018. Each caused over $1 billion in damage and killed dozens.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers lacked power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for much of Georgia, making disaster assistance available for the effects of Hurricane Debby, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Tuesday.\n\nThe declaration authorizes FEMA to mobilize equipment and other resources to protect lives, property and public health, including coordinating evacuations and shelters.\n\nMuch of South Carolina's historic Charleston peninsula lies on low marshland filled in over the years by dirt and debris.\n\nWith the Ashley and Cooper rivers on either side, the city of about 155,000 is hard to drain, especially during high tide or when the winds blow onshore from the Atlantic Ocean. Rising sea levels have made it harder, with water covering streets more than twice a month now -- even without a storm like Debby looming.\n\nThe rivers and deep port have been critical to Charleston since its founding in 1670.\n\nThe city's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nDebby has weakened over land because tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm water, but part of the circulation was still interacting Tuesday with water over the Atlantic, said Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm's center is expected to move out over the water off the Georgia and South Carolina coast, then move back inland, so it could restrengthen, but it's not clear how much, he said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted from northeastern Florida up into North Carolina, and very heavy rain is expected, leading to catastrophic flooding across parts of southeastern Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday, he said.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" he said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"", "source": {"uri":

Police blocked all the roads into Charleston's downtown peninsula as a precaution. Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that already saw two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate some residents and waded in waist-deep in floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city didn't have to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches. A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot of rain was reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it could be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane center predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.\n\nCoastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in

Authorities in states farther north along the coast were closely monitoring its progress.\n\nDebby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. The categorization is based on wind speeds, but meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nLatest advisory from the National Hurricane Center\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Savannah, Georgia, and moving east-northeast at near 3 mph (5 kph), the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday in its 5 p.m. advisory.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. Tropical storm-force winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) extend outward up to 205 miles (330 kilometers) from the center.\n\nDebby's center is off the Georgia coast and is expected to move back inland over South Carolina on Thursday, the hurricane center said. The main rainfall threat includes the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday.\n\nParts of Virginia, the Middle Atlantic states, western and northern New York State and northern New England could see 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 centimeters) of rain with local amounts reaching 8 inches (20 centimeters) through Saturday, with a threat of flash and urban flooding.\n\nVirginia governor declares state of emergency\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon based on the potential for strong winds, heavy rains and flooding that could come as Tropical Storm Debby slowly moves up the coast.\n\n\"It's crucial that we work together and remain vigilant during these times to minimize the impact of the storm,\" Youngkin said in a statement. \"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges.\"\n\nThe declaration will mobilize resources and equipment in an effort to respond to the storm, which is expected to begin impacting Virginia on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"The National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center forecasts are predicting the potential for tropical storm force winds, heavy rain, and severe flooding across the entirety of the state,\" Youngkin said.\n\nFirefighters use boats to evacuate residents and deliver supplies in one Savannah neighborhood\n\nFloodwaters swamped several streets in the Tremont Park neighborhood of west Savannah, where firefighters Tuesday used boats to evacuate some residents and waded waist-deep to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nMichael Jones said downpours sent water gushing into his home Monday evening, overturning the refrigerator and causing furniture to float. \"The water was just everywhere,\" Jones said. \"You couldn't get out of the door. You stepped out the door and it almost felt like you stepped in a sinkhole.\"\n\nJones said he spent a sleepless night lying on the kitchen table. Then firefighters checking door-to-door Tuesday showed up with a boat, taking Jones and others to safety.\n\n\"It was hell all night,\" Jones said. \"It was a struggle, but God is good.\"\n\nFlooding threat could persist long after storm moves on, South Carolina governor says\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Tuesday that Tropical Storm Debby hasn't been as bad as feared. But he warned residents that the flooding threat could continue long after the slow-moving system moves on.\n\nDebby was spinning back out to sea Tuesday afternoon and was expected to slowly churn just off South Carolina for more than 24 hours. Forecasters said 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain could fall in rural areas of northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina that were devastated by huge floods in Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018.\n\nAnd if that much rain falls inland, it could send floodwaters on an up to two-week trek to the sea, inundating homes and businesses along its path.\n\n\"It takes time. A lot of this flooding will happen likely after so we're going to have to be alert for a long time,\" McMaster said.\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported since Debby's bands first started hitting the state Monday.\n\nLatest advisory from the National Hurricane Center\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of Savannah, Georgia, and moving east-northeast at near 5 mph (8 kph), the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday in its 2 p.m. advisory.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. Tropical-storm force winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) extend outward over extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km) east of the center.\n\nDebby's center is expected to move off the Georgia coast Tuesday and then move back inland over South Carolina on Thursday, the hurricane center said. The main rainfall threat includes the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday.\n\nHeavy rains spill water over South Carolina dam but structure holds\n\nFlooding from Debby wasn't limited to coastal areas.\n\nWater started spilling over the top of a small dam near Walterboro, South Carolina, but it didn't crumble, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said in a video briefing. An apartment complex in Walterboro did flood and a number of roads in the county were blocked either by standing water or fallen trees, but no major damage was reported, Greene said.\n\nColleton County fire officials sent out a warning Tuesday about the McGrady Dam near Walterboro, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Charleston. They said about 50 people might be affected if the dam was breached.\n\nTo the south, the neighboring community of Green Pond reported 14 inches (36 centimeters) of rain since Debby first started to hit the area Monday, Greene said.\n\nIn South Carolina, uncertainty but preparedness\n\nSouth Carolina residents aren't sure how strong Debby's ultimate punch will be where they are, but they're preparing for any scenario.\n\n\"There's a lot of question marks,\" said David E. Lally, 83, who lives near the coast and stocked up with groceries and a 12-pack of Miller Lite. He worries Debby's forecast heavy rains could cause problems on the Waccamaw River and other streams.\n\nCrooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close Tuesday afternoon as rain bore down and the region faced threats of flash flooding, tornadoes and storm surge.\n\n\"No one can pinpoint exactly what areas the flooding will occur in, and we're unsure of how bad it will be. We just know it is inevitable and want to keep our team as safe as possible,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis wrote in an email.\n\nFlorida keeps a wary eye on parts upstream\n\nOfficials warned Tuesday that all the water expected to fall on Georgia and South Carolina from Tropical Storm Debby could cause serious flooding downstream in Florida for days or weeks to come.\n\n\"We are going to see more flooding in northern Florida,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a briefing in Steinhatchee, near where Debby made initial landfall as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\n\"You're going to see the tributaries rise. That's just inevitable. How much? We'll see,\" he said. \"It may be that it's not flooded today and it could be flooded tomorrow.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service warned that parts of the St. Marys, Suwannee and Santa Fe Rivers are projected to reach major flood stage west of Jacksonville and north of Gainesville, with the potential to inundate roads and houses.\n\nParts of southwest Florida already flooded, leading to 500 rescues from homes in Sarasota County.\n\nOfficials said it may be two weeks before they can fully assess damage in parts of north-central Florida as they wait for rivers to crest.\n\nSavannah largely escapes major flooding -- so far\n\nIn Savannah, Georgia, the steady, soaking rainfall eased, at least temporarily, by late morning Tuesday as the storm's center reached the state's coast. Authorities expressed relief that the most dreadful predictions of 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain had so far not materialized.\n\n\"We are blessed and highly favored for what was predicted to come our way -- we got a majority of it, but we didn't get the brunt,\" Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis said. A curfew put in place Monday night was being lifted, he said.\n\nSignificant flooding was reported in at least one neighborhood, with firefighters using boats to evacuate stranded residents in the Tremont Park section of west Savannah.\n\nOther neighborhoods in Chatham County, which includes Savannah, remained flooded. Authorities asked people to avoid those areas while cleanup continues.\n\nElsewhere, streets that had flooded during downpours Monday evening were mostly clear. With many offices and businesses closed, residents jogged and walked their dogs.\n\nThe forecast called for more rain, some of it heavy, in Savannah in the coming days as Debby crawls offshore. The National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches (16.96 centimeters) of rainfall in Savannah on Monday. That's more rain than Georgia's oldest city saw in all of August last year.\n\nLatest advisory from the National Hurricane Center\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Savannah, Georgia, and moving east-northeast at near 6 mph (9 kph), the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday in its 11 a.m. advisory.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. Tropical-storm force winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) extend outward over 200 miles (330 kilometers) from the center.\n\nDebby's center is expected to move off the Georgia coast later Tuesday, then move back inland over South Carolina on Thursday, the center said.\n\nCharleston extends curfew and tells 'yahoos' to stay off roads\n\nThe peninsula that makes up much of the downtown and older, historic parts of Charleston, South Carolina, will remain closed Tuesday as Tropical Storm Debby spins nearby, Mayor William Cogswell said.\n\nPolice have barricaded all eight roads into the peninsula and let only essential workers and emergency personnel in or out since 11 p.m. Monday. The barriers will remain in place until at least Wednesday morning.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nAttention now turns to Debby moving offshore, perhaps strengthening and sending stronger winds onshore, causing power outages and some tidal flooding Wednesday into Thursday.\n\nGeorgia governor tells residents to stay vigilant\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday at Georgia's emergency management center in Atlanta, Gov. Brian Kemp urged residents in the storm area to remain vigilant and stay off roads. \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nKemp said that in the best case, the storm area will get another 4 or 5 inches (10 or 12.7 centimeters) of rain. But he warned that another model showed the storm stalling and moving back into Georgia, dumping as much as 9 additional inches (22.9 centimeters) of rain.\n\nStill, State Meteorologist Will Lanxton said the possibility of catastrophic flooding is much less likely.\n\nDebby brings flooding, tornadoes to South Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina is bracing for days of rain through Thursday from Tropical Storm Debby. It already spawned tornadoes and caused flooding Tuesday in areas along the state's coast.\n\nThe tornadoes toppled trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Applebee's and other businesses were damaged, and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) inland from Charleston.\n\nRadar estimated more than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain fell between Hilton Head Island and Charleston overnight. There were local reports of flooding, including parts of downtown Charleston that often flood, but no widespread damage.\n\nSome forecasts indicate Debby could bring 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain to rural areas of North and South Carolina that were devastated by floods in Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018. Each caused over $1 billion in damage and killed dozens.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers lacked power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nBiden approves Georgia disaster declaration\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for much of Georgia, making disaster assistance available for the effects of Hurricane Debby, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Tuesday.\n\nThe declaration authorizes FEMA to mobilize equipment and other resources to protect lives, property and public health, including coordinating evacuations and shelters.\n\nCharleston's geography creates a special threat\n\nMuch of South Carolina's historic Charleston peninsula lies on low marshland filled in over the years by dirt and debris.\n\nWith the Ashley and Cooper rivers on either side, the city of about 155,000 is hard to drain, especially during high tide or when the winds blow onshore from the Atlantic Ocean. Rising sea levels have made it harder, with water covering streets more than twice a month now -- even without a storm like Debby looming.\n\nThe rivers and deep port have been critical to Charleston since its founding in 1670.\n\nThe city's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nDebby still getting energy from ocean water, expert says\n\nDebby has weakened over land because tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm water, but part of the circulation was still interacting Tuesday with water over the Atlantic, said Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm's center is expected to move out over the water off the Georgia and South Carolina coast, then move back inland, so it could restrengthen, but it's not clear how much, he said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted from northeastern Florida up into North Carolina, and very heavy rain is expected, leading to catastrophic flooding across parts of southeastern Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday, he said.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" he said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nCharleston ready with sandbags, parking garages\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nAttorney Jenna Sutter Joins All Injuries Law Firm\n\nEnergyCAP Appoints Shawn

Authorities in states farther north along the coast were closely monitoring its progress.\n\nDebby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. The categorization is based on wind speeds, but meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nLatest advisory from the National Hurricane Center\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Savannah, Georgia, and moving east-northeast at near 3 mph (5 kph), the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday in its 5 p.m. advisory.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. Tropical storm-force winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) extend outward up to 205 miles (330 kilometers) from the center.\n\nDebby's center is off the Georgia coast and is expected to move back inland over South Carolina on Thursday, the hurricane center said. The main rainfall threat includes the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday.\n\nParts of Virginia, the Middle Atlantic states, western and northern New York State and northern New England could see 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 centimeters) of rain with local amounts reaching 8 inches (20 centimeters) through Saturday, with a threat of flash and urban flooding.\n\nVirginia governor declares state of emergency\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon based on the potential for strong winds, heavy rains and flooding that could come as Tropical Storm Debby slowly moves up the coast.\n\n\"It's crucial that we work together and remain vigilant during these times to minimize the impact of the storm,\" Youngkin said in a statement. \"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges.\"\n\nThe declaration will mobilize resources and equipment in an effort to respond to the storm, which is expected to begin impacting Virginia on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"The National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center forecasts are predicting the potential for tropical storm force winds, heavy rain, and severe flooding across the entirety of the state,\" Youngkin said.\n\nFirefighters use boats to evacuate residents and deliver supplies in one Savannah neighborhood\n\nFloodwaters swamped several streets in the Tremont Park neighborhood of west Savannah, where firefighters Tuesday used boats to evacuate some residents and waded waist-deep to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nMichael Jones said downpours sent water gushing into his home Monday evening, overturning the refrigerator and causing furniture to float. \"The water was just everywhere,\" Jones said. \"You couldn't get out of the door. You stepped out the door and it almost felt like you stepped in a sinkhole.\"\n\nJones said he spent a sleepless night lying on the kitchen table. Then firefighters checking door-to-door Tuesday showed up with a boat, taking Jones and others to safety.\n\n\"It was hell all night,\" Jones said. \"It was a struggle, but God is good.\"\n\nFlooding threat could persist long after storm moves on, South Carolina governor says\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Tuesday that Tropical Storm Debby hasn't been as bad as feared. But he warned residents that the flooding threat could continue long after the slow-moving system moves on.\n\nDebby was spinning back out to sea Tuesday afternoon and was expected to slowly churn just off South Carolina for more than 24 hours. Forecasters said 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain could fall in rural areas of northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina that were devastated by huge floods in Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018.\n\nAnd if that much rain falls inland, it could send floodwaters on an up to two-week trek to the sea, inundating homes and businesses along its path.\n\n\"It takes time. A lot of this flooding will happen likely after so we're going to have to be alert for a long time,\" McMaster said.\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported since Debby's bands first started hitting the state Monday.\n\nLatest advisory from the National Hurricane Center\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of Savannah, Georgia, and moving east-northeast at near 5 mph (8 kph), the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday in its 2 p.m. advisory.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. Tropical-storm force winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) extend outward over extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km) east of the center.\n\nDebby's center is expected to move off the Georgia coast Tuesday and then move back inland over South Carolina on Thursday, the hurricane center said. The main rainfall threat includes the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday.\n\nHeavy rains spill water over South Carolina dam but structure holds\n\nFlooding from Debby wasn't limited to coastal areas.\n\nWater started spilling over the top of a small dam near Walterboro, South Carolina, but it didn't crumble, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said in a video briefing. An apartment complex in Walterboro did flood and a number of roads in the county were blocked either by standing water or fallen trees, but no major damage was reported, Greene said.\n\nColleton County fire officials sent out a warning Tuesday about the McGrady Dam near Walterboro, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Charleston. They said about 50 people might be affected if the dam was breached.\n\nTo the south, the neighboring community of Green Pond reported 14 inches (36 centimeters) of rain since Debby first started to hit the area Monday, Greene said.\n\nIn South Carolina, uncertainty but preparedness\n\nSouth Carolina residents aren't sure how strong Debby's ultimate punch will be where they are, but they're preparing for any scenario.\n\n\"There's a lot of question marks,\" said David E. Lally, 83, who lives near the coast and stocked up with groceries and a 12-pack of Miller Lite. He worries Debby's forecast heavy rains could cause problems on the Waccamaw River and other streams.\n\nCrooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close Tuesday afternoon as rain bore down and the region faced threats of flash flooding, tornadoes and storm surge.\n\n\"No one can pinpoint exactly what areas the flooding will occur in, and we're unsure of how bad it will be. We just know it is inevitable and want to keep our team as safe as possible,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis wrote in an email.\n\nFlorida keeps a wary eye on parts upstream\n\nOfficials warned Tuesday that all the water expected to fall on Georgia and South Carolina from Tropical Storm Debby could cause serious flooding downstream in Florida for days or weeks to come.\n\n\"We are going to see more flooding in northern Florida,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a briefing in Steinhatchee, near where Debby made initial landfall as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\n\"You're going to see the tributaries rise. That's just inevitable. How much? We'll see,\" he said. \"It may be that it's not flooded today and it could be flooded tomorrow.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service warned that parts of the St. Marys, Suwannee and Santa Fe Rivers are projected to reach major flood stage west of Jacksonville and north of Gainesville, with the potential to inundate roads and houses.\n\nParts of southwest Florida already flooded, leading to 500 rescues from homes in Sarasota County.\n\nOfficials said it may be two weeks before they can fully assess damage in parts of north-central Florida as they wait for rivers to crest.\n\nSavannah largely escapes major flooding -- so far\n\nIn Savannah, Georgia, the steady, soaking rainfall eased, at least temporarily, by late morning Tuesday as the storm's center reached the state's coast. Authorities expressed relief that the most dreadful predictions of 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain had so far not materialized.\n\n\"We are blessed and highly favored for what was predicted to come our way -- we got a majority of it, but we didn't get the brunt,\" Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis said. A curfew put in place Monday night was being lifted, he said.\n\nSignificant flooding was reported in at least one neighborhood, with firefighters using boats to evacuate stranded residents in the Tremont Park section of west Savannah.\n\nOther neighborhoods in Chatham County, which includes Savannah, remained flooded. Authorities asked people to avoid those areas while cleanup continues.\n\nElsewhere, streets that had flooded during downpours Monday evening were mostly clear. With many offices and businesses closed, residents jogged and walked their dogs.\n\nThe forecast called for more rain, some of it heavy, in Savannah in the coming days as Debby crawls offshore. The National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches (16.96 centimeters) of rainfall in Savannah on Monday. That's more rain than Georgia's oldest city saw in all of August last year.\n\nLatest advisory from the National Hurricane Center\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Savannah, Georgia, and moving east-northeast at near 6 mph (9 kph), the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday in its 11 a.m. advisory.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. Tropical-storm force winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) extend outward over 200 miles (330 kilometers) from the center.\n\nDebby's center is expected to move off the Georgia coast later Tuesday, then move back inland over South Carolina on Thursday, the center said.\n\nCharleston extends curfew and tells 'yahoos' to stay off roads\n\nThe peninsula that makes up much of the downtown and older, historic parts of Charleston, South Carolina, will remain closed Tuesday as Tropical Storm Debby spins nearby, Mayor William Cogswell said.\n\nPolice have barricaded all eight roads into the peninsula and let only essential workers and emergency personnel in or out since 11 p.m. Monday. The barriers will remain in place until at least Wednesday morning.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nAttention now turns to Debby moving offshore, perhaps strengthening and sending stronger winds onshore, causing power outages and some tidal flooding Wednesday into Thursday.\n\nGeorgia governor tells residents to stay vigilant\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday at Georgia's emergency management center in Atlanta, Gov. Brian Kemp urged residents in the storm area to remain vigilant and stay off roads. \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nKemp said that in the best case, the storm area will get another 4 or 5 inches (10 or 12.7 centimeters) of rain. But he warned that another model showed the storm stalling and moving back into Georgia, dumping as much as 9 additional inches (22.9 centimeters) of rain.\n\nStill, State Meteorologist Will Lanxton said the possibility of catastrophic flooding is much less likely.\n\nDebby brings flooding, tornadoes to South Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina is bracing for days of rain through Thursday from Tropical Storm Debby. It already spawned tornadoes and caused flooding Tuesday in areas along the state's coast.\n\nThe tornadoes toppled trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Applebee's and other businesses were damaged, and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) inland from Charleston.\n\nRadar estimated more than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain fell between Hilton Head Island and Charleston overnight. There were local reports of flooding, including parts of downtown Charleston that often flood, but no widespread damage.\n\nSome forecasts indicate Debby could bring 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain to rural areas of North and South Carolina that were devastated by floods in Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018. Each caused over $1 billion in damage and killed dozens.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers lacked power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nBiden approves Georgia disaster declaration\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for much of Georgia, making disaster assistance available for the effects of Hurricane Debby, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Tuesday.\n\nThe declaration authorizes FEMA to mobilize equipment and other resources to protect lives, property and public health, including coordinating evacuations and shelters.\n\nCharleston's geography creates a special threat\n\nMuch of South Carolina's historic Charleston peninsula lies on low marshland filled in over the years by dirt and debris.\n\nWith the Ashley and Cooper rivers on either side, the city of about 155,000 is hard to drain, especially during high tide or when the winds blow onshore from the Atlantic Ocean. Rising sea levels have made it harder, with water covering streets more than twice a month now -- even without a storm like Debby looming.\n\nThe rivers and deep port have been critical to Charleston since its founding in 1670.\n\nThe city's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nDebby still getting energy from ocean water, expert says\n\nDebby has weakened over land because tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm water, but part of the circulation was still interacting Tuesday with water over the Atlantic, said Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm's center is expected to move out over the water off the Georgia and South Carolina coast, then move back inland, so it could restrengthen, but it's not clear how much, he said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted from northeastern Florida up into North Carolina, and very heavy rain is expected, leading to catastrophic flooding across parts of southeastern Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday, he said.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" he said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nCharleston ready with sandbags, parking garages\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated

Authorities in states farther north along the coast were closely monitoring its progress.\n\nDebby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. The categorization is based on wind speeds, but meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nLatest advisory from the National Hurricane Center\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Savannah, Georgia, and moving east-northeast at near 3 mph (5 kph), the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday in its 5 p.m. advisory.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. Tropical storm-force winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) extend outward up to 205 miles (330 kilometers) from the center.\n\nDebby's center is off the Georgia coast and is expected to move back inland over South Carolina on Thursday, the hurricane center said. The main rainfall threat includes the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday.\n\nParts of Virginia, the Middle Atlantic states, western and northern New York State and northern New England could see 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 centimeters) of rain with local amounts reaching 8 inches (20 centimeters) through Saturday, with a threat of flash and urban flooding.\n\nVirginia governor declares state of emergency\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon based on the potential for strong winds, heavy rains and flooding that could come as Tropical Storm Debby slowly moves up the coast.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"It's crucial that we work together and remain vigilant during these times to minimize the impact of the storm,\" Youngkin said in a statement. \"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges.\"\n\nThe declaration will mobilize resources and equipment in an effort to respond to the storm, which is expected to begin impacting Virginia on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"The National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center forecasts are predicting the potential for tropical storm force winds, heavy rain, and severe flooding across the entirety of the state,\" Youngkin said.\n\nFirefighters use boats to evacuate residents and deliver supplies in one Savannah neighborhood\n\nFloodwaters swamped several streets in the Tremont Park neighborhood of west Savannah, where firefighters Tuesday used boats to evacuate some residents and waded waist-deep to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMichael Jones said downpours sent water gushing into his home Monday evening, overturning the refrigerator and causing furniture to float. \"The water was just everywhere,\" Jones said. \"You couldn't get out of the door. You stepped out the door and it almost felt like you stepped in a sinkhole.\"\n\nJones said he spent a sleepless night lying on the kitchen table. Then firefighters checking door-to-door Tuesday showed up with a boat, taking Jones and others to safety.\n\n\"It was hell all night,\" Jones said. \"It was a struggle, but God is good.\"\n\nFlooding threat could persist long after storm moves on, South Carolina governor says\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Tuesday that Tropical Storm Debby hasn't been as bad as feared. But he warned residents that the flooding threat could continue long after the slow-moving system moves on.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDebby was spinning back out to sea Tuesday afternoon and was expected to slowly churn just off South Carolina for more than 24 hours. Forecasters said 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain could fall in rural areas of northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina that were devastated by huge floods in Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018.\n\nAnd if that much rain falls inland, it could send floodwaters on an up to two-week trek to the sea, inundating homes and businesses along its path.\n\n\"It takes time. A lot of this flooding will happen likely after so we're going to have to be alert for a long time,\" McMaster said.\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported since Debby's bands first started hitting the state Monday.\n\nLatest advisory from the National Hurricane Center\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of Savannah, Georgia, and moving east-northeast at near 5 mph (8 kph), the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday in its 2 p.m. advisory.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. Tropical-storm force winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) extend outward over extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km) east of the center.\n\nDebby's center is expected to move off the Georgia coast Tuesday and then move back inland over South Carolina on Thursday, the hurricane center said. The main rainfall threat includes the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday.\n\nHeavy rains spill water over South Carolina dam but structure holds\n\nFlooding from Debby wasn't limited to coastal areas.\n\nWater started spilling over the top of a small dam near Walterboro, South Carolina, but it didn't crumble, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said in a video briefing. An apartment complex in Walterboro did flood and a number of roads in the county were blocked either by standing water or fallen trees, but no major damage was reported, Greene said.\n\nColleton County fire officials sent out a warning Tuesday about the McGrady Dam near Walterboro, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Charleston. They said about 50 people might be affected if the dam was breached.\n\nTo the south, the neighboring community of Green Pond reported 14 inches (36 centimeters) of rain since Debby first started to hit the area Monday, Greene said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn South Carolina, uncertainty but preparedness\n\nSouth Carolina residents aren't sure how strong Debby's ultimate punch will be where they are, but they're preparing for any scenario.\n\n\"There's a lot of question marks,\" said David E. Lally, 83, who lives near the coast and stocked up with groceries and a 12-pack of Miller Lite. He worries Debby's forecast heavy rains could cause problems on the Waccamaw River and other streams.\n\nCrooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close Tuesday afternoon as rain bore down and the region faced threats of flash flooding, tornadoes and storm surge.\n\n\"No one can pinpoint exactly what areas the flooding will occur in, and we're unsure of how bad it will be. We just know it is inevitable and want to keep our team as safe as possible,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis wrote in an email.\n\nFlorida keeps a wary eye on parts upstream\n\nOfficials warned Tuesday that all the water expected to fall on Georgia and South Carolina from Tropical Storm Debby could cause serious flooding downstream in Florida for days or weeks to come.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We are going to see more flooding in northern Florida,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a briefing in Steinhatchee, near where Debby made initial landfall as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\n\"You're going to see the tributaries rise. That's just inevitable. How much? We'll see,\" he said. \"It may be that it's not flooded today and it could be flooded tomorrow.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service warned that parts of the St. Marys, Suwannee and Santa Fe Rivers are projected to reach major flood stage west of Jacksonville and north of Gainesville, with the potential to inundate roads and houses.\n\nParts of southwest Florida already flooded, leading to 500 rescues from homes in Sarasota County.\n\nOfficials said it may be two weeks before they can fully assess damage in parts of north-central Florida as they wait for rivers to crest.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSavannah largely escapes major flooding -- so far\n\nIn Savannah, Georgia, the steady, soaking rainfall eased, at least temporarily, by late morning Tuesday as the storm's center reached the state's coast. Authorities expressed relief that the most dreadful predictions of 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain had so far not materialized.\n\n\"We are blessed and highly favored for what was predicted to come our way -- we got a majority of it, but we didn't get the brunt,\" Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis said. A curfew put in place Monday night was being lifted, he said.\n\nSignificant flooding was reported in at least one neighborhood, with firefighters using boats to evacuate stranded residents in the Tremont Park section of west Savannah.\n\nOther neighborhoods in Chatham County, which includes Savannah, remained flooded. Authorities asked people to avoid those areas while cleanup continues.\n\nElsewhere, streets that had flooded during downpours Monday evening were mostly clear. With many offices and businesses closed, residents jogged and walked their dogs.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe forecast called for more rain, some of it heavy, in Savannah in the coming days as Debby crawls offshore. The National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches (16.96 centimeters) of rainfall in Savannah on Monday. That's more rain than Georgia's oldest city saw in all of August last year.\n\nLatest advisory from the National Hurricane Center\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Savannah, Georgia, and moving east-northeast at near 6 mph (9 kph), the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday in its 11 a.m. advisory.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. Tropical-storm force winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) extend outward over 200 miles (330 kilometers) from the center.\n\nDebby's center is expected to move off the Georgia coast later Tuesday, then move back inland over South Carolina on Thursday, the center said.\n\nCharleston extends curfew and tells 'yahoos' to stay off roads\n\nThe peninsula that makes up much of the downtown and older, historic parts of Charleston, South Carolina, will remain closed Tuesday as Tropical Storm Debby spins nearby, Mayor William Cogswell said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPolice have barricaded all eight roads into the peninsula and let only essential workers and emergency personnel in or out since 11 p.m. Monday. The barriers will remain in place until at least Wednesday morning.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nAttention now turns to Debby moving offshore, perhaps strengthening and sending stronger winds onshore, causing power outages and some tidal flooding Wednesday into Thursday.\n\nGeorgia governor tells residents to stay vigilant\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday at Georgia's emergency management center in Atlanta, Gov. Brian Kemp urged residents in the storm area to remain vigilant and stay off roads. \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nKemp said that in the best case, the storm area will get another 4 or 5 inches (10 or 12.7 centimeters) of rain. But he warned that another model showed the storm stalling and moving back into Georgia, dumping as much as 9 additional inches (22.9 centimeters) of rain.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nStill, State Meteorologist Will Lanxton said the possibility of catastrophic flooding is much less likely.\n\nDebby brings flooding, tornadoes to South Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina is bracing for days of rain through Thursday from Tropical Storm Debby. It already spawned tornadoes and caused flooding Tuesday in areas along the state's coast.\n\nThe tornadoes toppled trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Applebee's and other businesses were damaged, and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) inland from Charleston.\n\nRadar estimated more than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain fell between Hilton Head Island and Charleston overnight. There were local reports of flooding, including parts of downtown Charleston that often flood, but no widespread damage.\n\nSome forecasts indicate Debby could bring 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain to rural areas of North and South Carolina that were devastated by floods in Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018. Each caused over $1 billion in damage and killed dozens.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMore than 155,000 customers lacked power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nBiden approves Georgia disaster declaration\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for much of Georgia, making disaster assistance available for the effects of Hurricane Debby, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Tuesday.\n\nThe declaration authorizes FEMA to mobilize equipment and other resources to protect lives, property and public health, including coordinating evacuations and shelters.\n\nCharleston's geography creates a special threat\n\nMuch of South Carolina's historic Charleston peninsula lies on low marshland filled in over the years by dirt and debris.\n\nWith the Ashley and Cooper rivers on either side, the city of about 155,000 is hard to drain, especially during high tide or when the winds blow onshore from the Atlantic Ocean. Rising sea levels have made it harder, with water covering streets more than twice a month now -- even without a storm like Debby looming.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe rivers and deep port have been critical to Charleston since its founding in 1670.\n\nThe city's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nDebby still getting energy from ocean water, expert says\n\nDebby has weakened over land because tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm water, but part of the circulation was still interacting Tuesday with water over the Atlantic, said Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm's center is expected to move out over the water off the Georgia and South Carolina coast, then move back inland, so it could restrengthen, but it's not clear how much, he said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted from northeastern Florida up into North Carolina, and very heavy rain is expected, leading to catastrophic flooding across parts of southeastern Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday, he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" he said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nCharleston ready with sandbags, parking garages\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"}, "authors":

Heavy rainfall could cause flooding in parts of the mid-Atlantic through Sunday, the Miami-based center said.\n\nMore than 8 inches of rain have already fallen on Savannah and Valdosta, Georgia, the National Weather Service said. Charleston and Hilton Head, South Carolina, have received between 10 and 12 inches of rain so far, the weather service said, with more on the way.\n\nIn Savannah, rain was coming down hard outside the landmark Bellwether House, a 16-room bed-and-breakfast in the city's historic district, but general manager Victoria Hill was not too concerned.\n\n\"This place was built in 1876,\" she said. \"It's built rock-solid, and you can imagine how many storms have hit over the last century.\"\n\nHill said many tourists had canceled their reservations because of the storm, but a handful of guests were staying on.\n\n\"We here, we're open and we're holding up. We'll all ride this out together.\"\n\nCharleston Mayor William Cogswell said more than two feet of rain was expected in his city before the storm passes. Even at low tide, storm surges of between 4 and 6 feet will prevent floodwaters from draining into the sea, he said.\n\nThere are \"not enough pumps in the world\" to handle that much rain, Cogswell said late on Monday. He has since extended a citywide curfew until Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Nobody should be out on the streets in these conditions unless it is an absolute emergency,\" the mayor said.\n\nAbout 50 miles west of Charleston, fears of a breach at the McGrady Dam in Colleton County, part of the state's Lowcountry, prompted the county sheriff's office to warn residents to evacuate immediately on Tuesday morning.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida's Gulf Coast on Monday morning, dumping 8 to 16 inches of rain in parts of central Florida, according to local reports. The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida and one near Valdosta, Georgia.\n\nMore than 88,000 customers were without power in Florida as of Tuesday afternoon, according to poweroutage.us, down from a peak of 350,000 on Monday. And more than 10,000 were without power in Georgia. Hundreds of flights to and from the state were canceled.\n\nWeather conditions could spawn tornadoes as well, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). A suspected twister flipped over cars and damaged restaurants in Moncks Corner, South Carolina, about 30 miles north of Charleston, early on Tuesday morning. Mayor Thomas Hamilton said there were minor injuries.\n\nThe NHC said Debby would slow down and move east and off Georgia's shore on Tuesday before turning north and drifting inland over South Carolina near Charleston on Thursday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a presidential campaign stop scheduled this week in Savannah, the Savannah Morning News reported.\n\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson said the city could expect a \"once-in-a-thousand-year\" rain event.\n\n\"This will literally create islands in the city,\" Johnson said.\n\nCedrick King, a businessman from coastal Brunswick, Georgia, said he and his family had packed up their belongings on Tuesday and were ready to make the five-hour drive to Atlanta.\n\n\"We're headed north, far away from this storm,\" he said.",

Police blocked all the roads into Charleston's downtown peninsula as a precaution. Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that already saw two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate some residents and waded in waist-deep in floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city didn't have to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches. A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot of rain was reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it could be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane center predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.\n\nCoastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in

Police blocked all the roads into Charleston's downtown peninsula as a precaution. Dozens of roads were closed in the historic city because of flooding similar to what it sees several times a year because of rising sea levels.\n\nAs Debby swirls just offshore, the heavy rain is expected to move north into parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that already saw two billion-dollar floods in eight years.\n\nIn one Savannah neighborhood, firefighters used boats Tuesday afternoon to evacuate some residents and waded in waist-deep in floodwaters to deliver bottled water and supplies to others who refused to leave.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mayor William Cogswell said the move meant the city didn't have to do any high water rescues and kept businesses and homes from unnecessary damage.\n\n\"We especially don't need any yahoos driving through the water and causing damage to properties,\" Cogswell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Debby hasn't yet been as bad as feared, but he warned residents the slow-moving storm was far from over.\n\nIt will be a nervous few days for northern South Carolina and southern North Carolina where forecasters warned up to 15 inches of rain could fall. Those totals are close to what the region saw in a historic flood from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Then two years later, rains and flooding from Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared the same for his state Tuesday.\n\n\"The effects of Debby are far-reaching, and our neighboring states are facing significant challenges,\" Youngkin said.\n\nSeveral areas along North Carolina's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks. Virginia could see impacts including strong winds, heavy rains and flooding.\n\nThe storm was expected to slowly move out to sea, then reverse and creep back onshore Thursday near Charleston.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the hurricane center said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nGreen Pond in rural Colleton County, South Carolina, reported the most rain so far from Debby with just over 14 inches. A nearby dam had water run over its top but did not crumble while trees and washouts blocked a number of roads, Colleton County Fire-Rescue Assistant Chief David Greene said.\n\nClose to a foot of rain was reported down coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches of rainfall just on Monday. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches of rain.\n\nTornadoes knocked down trees and damaged a few homes on Kiawah Island and Edisto Island between Savannah and Charleston. A Walmart, an Arby's and other businesses were damaged and several vehicles flipped in Moncks Corner about 30 miles inland from Charleston.\n\nAs the heavy rain shifted up the coast to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Crooked Hammock Brewery in North Myrtle Beach decided to close early.\n\n\"Flash flooding is super unpredictable, and we'd rather our staff and guests be home and safe,\" marketing coordinator Georgena Dimitriadis said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida. At least five people have died due to the storm, either in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the local police department said. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\nState officials said it could be two weeks before staff are able to fully assess storm damage in parts of north central Florida, as they wait for river levels there to crest.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared a similar message Tuesday morning, warning of more rain and flooding in the coming days: \"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" he said.\n\nMore than 155,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. More than 20,000 others were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby is finally expected to pick up speed Thursday. The hurricane center predicts the system could move up the middle of North Carolina, through Virginia and into the Washington, D.C. area by Saturday.\n\nCoastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in

Heavy rainfall could cause flooding in parts of the mid-Atlantic through Sunday, the Miami-based center said.\n\nMore than 8 inches (20 cm) of rain have already fallen on Savannah and Valdosta, Georgia, the National Weather Service said. Charleston and Hilton Head, South Carolina, have received between 10 and 12 inches (25 and 30 cm) of rain so far, the weather service said, with more on the way.\n\nIn Savannah, rain was coming down hard outside the landmark Bellwether House, a 16-room bed-and-breakfast in the city's historic district, but general manager Victoria Hill was not too concerned.\n\n\"This place was built in 1876,\" she said. \"It's built rock-solid, and you can imagine how many storms have hit over the last century.\"\n\nHill said many tourists had canceled their reservations because of the storm, but a handful of guests were staying on.\n\n\"We here, we're open and we're holding up. We'll all ride this out together.\"\n\nCharleston Mayor William Cogswell said more than 2 feet (61 cm) of rain was expected in his city before the storm passes. Even at low tide, storm surges of between 4 and 6 feet (1.2 and 1.8 meters) will prevent floodwaters from draining into the sea, he said.\n\nThere are \"not enough pumps in the world\" to handle that much rain, Cogswell said late on Monday. He has since extended a citywide curfew until Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Nobody should be out on the streets in these conditions unless it is an absolute emergency,\" the mayor said.\n\nAbout 50 miles (80 km) west of Charleston, fears of a breach at the McGrady Dam in Colleton County, part of the state's Lowcountry, prompted the county sheriff's office to warn residents to evacuate immediately on Tuesday morning.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida's Gulf Coast on Monday morning, dumping 8 to 16 inches (20 to 41 cm) of rain in parts of central Florida, according to local reports. The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida and one near Valdosta, Georgia.\n\nMore than 88,000 customers were without power in Florida as of Tuesday afternoon, according to poweroutage.us, down from a peak of 350,000 on Monday. And more than 10,000 were without power in Georgia. Hundreds of flights to and from the state were canceled.\n\nWeather conditions could spawn tornadoes as well, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). A suspected twister flipped over cars and damaged restaurants in Moncks Corner, South Carolina, about 30 miles (48 km) north of Charleston, early on Tuesday morning. Mayor Thomas Hamilton said there were minor injuries.\n\nThe NHC said Debby would slow down and move east and off Georgia's shore on Tuesday before turning north and drifting inland over South Carolina near Charleston on Thursday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a presidential campaign stop scheduled this week in Savannah, the Savannah Morning News reported.\n\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson said the city could expect a \"once-in-a-thousand-year\" rain event.\n\n\"This will literally create islands in the city,\" Johnson said.\n\nCedrick King, a businessman from coastal Brunswick, Georgia, said he and his family had packed up their belongings on Tuesday and were ready to make the five-hour drive to Atlanta.\n\n\"We're headed north, far away from this storm,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta and Tyler Clifford in New York City; Editing by Frank McGurty, Jonathan Oatis and Sandra Maler)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news",

Please try again later.\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C. -- When Tropical Storm Debby's floodwaters surrounded Damon Black's home in the heart of this flood-prone city, he and his family were ready. They pulled up rugs and moved furniture upstairs, because in little over a year of living there, they had endured five floods.\n\n\"It's virtually just a constant existential fear we have throughout the year,\" Black said of the specter of floods in the historic Harleston Village neighborhood, near the tip of the city's picturesque peninsula. In a December storm, water got inside the house; it didn't breach the floorboards this time.\n\nDebby is just the latest in a series of slow-moving, drenching storms that are threatening communities like this one, already vulnerable to hurricanes and even sunny-day floods and now facing the storms of a changing climate.\n\nWarmer global temperatures mean heavier downpours such as this one, which had dumped more than a foot of rain on parts of coastal South Carolina by Tuesday afternoon, with more rain expected. Flood risks are rising as sea levels surge, too. Here and across the American South, water is rising faster than almost anywhere else on Earth, according to a Washington Post analysis.\n\nThough Charleston hasn't had a direct hit from a hurricane since Hugo in 1989, it is weary from a parade of floods that go back a decade. Before Debby and that freak December nor'easter, there were so many other tropical rains: Florence in 2018; Irma in 2017; Matthew in 2016; and the remnants of Joaquin in 2015.\n\nThe city is taking action to confront the risk, working to build tunnels and pump stations; raise the Battery, its sea wall whose history goes back to the 18th century; and one day perhaps construct some kind of barrier to protect its harbor from storms' surging waters. As it endured the first part of its latest test mostly unscathed, with more rain ahead, Debby offered more proof of how tall a task it faces to protect people, homes and businesses from the next flood.\n\n\"It's no longer a question of if these storms can happen; we've seen them happen now again and again and again,\" said Jessica Whitehead, a Charleston native and executive director of the Institute for Coastal Adaptation and Resilience at Old Dominion University. \"There's only so much you can do to plan for 20 inches of rain in a single storm, and beyond that, it's emergency management.\"\n\nDebby remained a tropical storm Tuesday more than a day after it made landfall in Florida's Big Bend region early Monday as a low-end Category 1 hurricane. The storm killed at least five people in Florida and Georgia, and nearly 80,000 utility customers remained without power in Florida by early Tuesday evening. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said the worst hit is rural Jefferson County, east of Tallahassee, where 99 percent of customers still had no electricity Tuesday morning.\n\nThough the storm was less intense than others that have taken similar paths, including Hurricane Idalia less than a year ago, its main threat was drenching rain as it stalled over South Carolina. It was moving at just 3 mph late Tuesday, having already poured on the Palmetto State for nearly a day.\n\nDebby was raising flooding threats up and down the East Coast. In northern Florida, though the storm had passed, flooding risks are expected to linger for five days or longer as Debby's rainfall filters southward, adding to the already rising Suwannee and Santa Fe rivers, said Troy Roberts, a spokesman for the Suwannee River Water Management District.\n\nMeteorologists expect Debby's core to move northward into the Mid-Atlantic later Thursday into Friday, and then through the Northeast and New England on Friday into Saturday. That could mean 3 to 7 inches of rain along a swath of coast from Virginia to Massachusetts, though it was not certain where the heaviest rain will fall. That includes some potentially heavy rain late Tuesday into Wednesday across the Philadelphia, New York City and Boston regions, indirectly connected to Debby.\n\nBut South Carolina was bearing the brunt of Debby's deluge Tuesday, with rain expected to continue into Friday.\n\nAs of midafternoon, the National Weather Service reported more than a foot of rain in Beaufort and Edisto Beach, coastal communities to the south of Charleston, and more than 14 inches in Green Pond, about 40 miles west of Charleston. Meteorologists were forecasting another 4 to 8 inches of rain would fall into Wednesday morning around Charleston and to its north.\n\nCharleston is in South Carolina's Lowcountry, a region of rivers, estuaries and marshes that extends southward to the Savannah River and the Georgia state line. It has always been a city vulnerable to storms.\n\nBut sea level rise has made it even more so -- Charleston's average sea level has risen by seven inches since 2010, four times as fast as during the previous 30 years, according to The Post's analysis of accelerating sea level rise across the South.\n\nSeas worldwide are rising faster than ever because of human-caused global warming, the result of fossil fuel emissions and the greenhouse effect. Not only is that warming melting ice sheets, but it also causes water to expand.\n\nMinor floods that occurred in Charleston only a handful of times a year from the 1920s through the 1970s have over the past decade hit dozens of times every year, according to Weather Service data. That includes flooding that hit a record 89 times -- nearly one out of every four days -- in 2019.\n\nEight months ago, the city endured its fourth-deepest flood on record when a storm churned up the East Coast. Waters rose more than 4 feet above an average high-tide benchmark, behind the floods caused by three historic hurricanes: The South Carolina hurricane of 1940, Hugo and Irma.\n\nPaul Gayes, a professor of marine science at Coastal Carolina University, remembers the ferocity of Hugo, which killed 13 people in South Carolina.\n\n\"But these slow-moving events are different,\" he said.\n\nAfter a night of pelting rain, thunder and tornado warnings, the streets of downtown Charleston were empty Tuesday as the city braced for more historic rainfall. Storefronts were shuttered and sandbagged, and few cars were on the road. The mayor's office issued a curfew for the city's peninsula from 11 p.m. Monday to Wednesday morning, closing most roads into the city center.\n\nResidents took the threat seriously, filling up city parking garages to avoid floodwaters and staying at home. With so many storms coming before this one, \"they become not easy to dismiss,\" said Dale Morris, who served as Charleston's chief resilience officer until stepping down this summer.\n\nThat was true of Black, who stayed behind to keep watch on his home. His wife, Donna Hintson, and their 13-year-old son, Nate, decamped to a hotel with their long-haired dachshunds, Polly and Poppy. If the water gets to a certain level, Black would have to shut off the electricity.\n\nBy late Tuesday afternoon, Black checked the weather reports and remained cautiously optimistic that the worst was over. But as a former boat captain, he is all too familiar with the weather's unpredictability.\n\nTheir belongings remained piled up, away from water's reach.\n\n\"I wouldn't challenge that fate,\" he said.\n\nDance reported from Washington.

The former hurricane could dump more than 2 feet of rain on coastal cities in Georgia and the Carolinas by the end of the week.\n\nDebby's center is forecast to drift offshore, then refueling with additional moisture from the Atlantic Ocean, and then meander near the South Carolina coast before making a second landfall sometime on Thursday. Governors in Georgia and the Carolinas declared states of emergency and warned residents to prepare for potentially catastrophic flooding, including in places that have never seen rising water before.\n\nHere is what else to know:\n\n\u25aa Flooding fears: Some of Debby's worst impacts in Florida were felt not on the coast but hundreds of miles away, in more densely populated Gulf Coast cities, as high tides further swelled flooding rivers and forced evacuations and emergency rescues. After Debby moves back out to sea, storm surge from the Atlantic could further swell coastal rivers, increasing the flood risk.\n\n\u25aa Fatalities in Florida and Georgia: The storm, which made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane with 80 mph winds on Florida's Big Bend coast, was blamed for four deaths in the state. Three people died in traffic accidents, and a child was killed when a tree fell on a home. In Georgia, a 19-year-old man was also killed by a falling tree.\n\n\u25aa Another hit on Cedar Key: Howling wind and waves crashed high on the fishing pier in Cedar Key, a chain of tiny islands 3 miles into the Gulf of Mexico, as Hurricane Debby slammed ashore. The storm hit the same part of the Big Bend coast where Hurricane Idalia, a more powerful Category 3 storm, made landfall less than a year ago.\n\nClimate's role: Hurricanes have become more destructive over time, in no small part because of the influences of a warming planet. Climate change is producing more powerful storms that generate heavier rainfall and flooding. But humans also make storm damage more extensive by continuing to build in vulnerable parts of the coast.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolinas", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carolinas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walterboro,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walterboro, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Walterboro, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swell_(ocean)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swell (ocean)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bend_(Florida)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Bend (Florida)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Debby_(2000)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Debby (2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Key,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cedar Key, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cedar Key, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/columbus_ledger_enquirer_mcclatchy_articles_419/9ac688728b94c34c94e0f096a0890a5a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796205", "eventUri": "eng-9796205", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

You can check out a more in-depth explanation here.\n\nThis storm is crawling to the Northeast only moving at 5 mph. Its current forecast track could allow it to re-emerge over the Atlantic briefly causing it to strengthen a bit before making possible another landfall somewhere along the North Carolina or South Carolina coast.\n\nThe snail's pace of this storm is a worst-case scenario with a constant stream of moisture in place along the coast.

But the storm remains a serious threat.\n\nIn large part, that's because of the heavy rain it's dropping, like a colossal swirling sponge squeezing itself out over the already flood-prone coastal areas around Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C.\n\nBefore dawn on Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center warned of \"potentially historic heavy rainfall\" across the coastal flanks of the two states, which \"will likely result in areas of likely catastrophic flooding.\"\n\nFor both regions, Debby represents the intersection of acute and chronic crises: the slow, implacable legacy of sea-level rise meeting the sudden outburst of storms fueled by the water-trapping fury of a heating climate.\n\nDebby is currently moving at the speed of a racewalking human above the coastal city of Savannah, which it hit late Tuesday morning, bringing what local officials called some of the worst flooding they had ever seen.\n\nDebby, creeping northeast at just 5 miles per hour, has lost a lot of power since crashing into the Florida's Big Bend -- the part of the state's Gulf Coast that makes a 90 degree turn southwest of the state capitol of Tallahassee.\n\nLike Hurricane Beryl, which left millions in Houston without power for a week following its July onslaught, Debby was a Category I hurricane when it made landfall.\n\nDebby's impact on the Florida power system was relatively minor compared to the crisis Beryl wrought in Texas, however, with just over 100,000 households without power as of Tuesday morning -- a reflection both of the storm's positioning and years of work hardening Florida's electric system, which have made its power grid the envy of its fellow Gulf Coast red states, Texas and Louisiana.\n\nWhen it hit the Big Bend at 7 a.m. Monday, Debby brought winds in excess of 80 miles per hour. By Tuesday morning, those speeds had dropped to 45 miles per hour.\n\nBut the deadliest aspect of hurricanes isn't their winds: It's the flooding caused by their rain, as The Weather Channel reported.\n\nAnd over the next three days, Debbie is going to bring a lot of rain.\n\nHow much water will it bring to the region?\n\n\"Potentially historic\" amounts, the National Hurricane Center forecast Tuesday morning.\n\nDebby's center is expected to cross back over the Atlantic by Tuesday afternoon. The fact that it's leaving land is not especially good news. Water, and particularly the unusually warm waters of the Atlantic, is hurricane fuel -- all the more so as rising fossil fuel pollution in the atmosphere traps solar heat in the oceans in record levels.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Debby's lack of a defined inner core will hinder its ability to gain strength over the next day -- and it is expected to stay far enough from the heat of the Gulf Stream to avoid a significant increase in strength.\n\nBut by late Wednesday or early Thursday, as the storm banks back towards land, it should begin to strengthen again.\n\nSome parts of coastal Georgia and the Carolinas can expect a staggering 25 inches of rain over the following three days, with less impacted areas receiving a still-considerable 10 to 20 inches.\n\nThat's in addition to storm surges of up to four feet along the South Carolina coast, and up to three feet between the North Carolina state line and the Cape Lookout peninsula.\n\nThat surge means a piling up of ocean water that will make urban flooding worse as it overwhelms the ability of sewer systems and local waterways to shunt record rainfall into the oceans.\n\nThe risk of flooding underscores a somewhat paradoxical danger posed by Debby's loss of power.\n\nFor all that hurricanes are seen as more serious than tropical storms -- and although a Category 5 is more dangerous than a Category 1 -- the difference between the classifications is largely a function of wind speed.\n\nAnd by and large, while high winds wreck power systems, houses and infrastructure, it's water that kills people -- and more water falls when storms are slow.\n\nWhy are slow storms more dangerous?\n\nBecause they have more time to dump water over a given area.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, rain-driven flooding killed two-thirds of the 41 people lost in 2001's Tropical Storm Allison and 95 percent of the 68 people who died in 2017's Hurricane Harvey and was responsible for 77 percent of the 22 deaths in 2018's Hurricane Florence,\n\nTo be clear, \"slow\" in this case refers to how quickly the storm system itself moves -- its \"translational motion\" or \"forward speed,\" in meteorology jargon -- rather than the wind speed. For example, Hurricane Dorian hit Grand Bahama in 2019 as a Category 5 with wind gusts up to 220 miles per hour -- but the system as a whole \"slow\" in this case refers to how quickly the storm system itself moves -- its \"translational motion\" or \"forward speed,\" in meteorology jargon -- rather than the wind speed. For example, Hurricane Dorian hit Grand Bahama in 2019 as a Category 5 with wind gusts up to 220 miles per hour -- but the system as a whole moved at a shambling 1.3 mile an hour.\n\nSlower storms in the mid-latitudes -- which include most of the United States -- appear to be a function of a climate being heated by fossil fuel emissions, according to 2020 research out of Princeton University.\n\nHigher temperatures drive stronger \"westerly\" winds, which blow through the mid-latitudes and towards the poles, effectively creating a brake on the movement of storms, the research showed.\n\nAnd 2019 research published in Environmental Research Letters suggested that extreme precipitation from Harvey -- a Category 4 storm which stalled above Houston and Southeast Texas for several days in 2017 -- was made about 20 percent worse by climate change, and that such stalling storms would become more prevalent.\n\nFor the Carolina Lowcountry, a slow Debby means more inches of rain, which likely means more floods, more infrastructure destroyed and, potentially, more deaths. If Debby were moving at, say, 20 miles per hour instead of its current 5, it would have far less time to dump water over a city like Savannah or Charleston.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the National Hurricane Center told WKYC on Tuesday.\n\n\"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nAs things stand, Debby's relatively pokey speed, and the bad luck of its trajectory keeping it in an arc just off the Southeast's coast over the next three days, are set to more than make up for its tropical storm status, leading to equivalent rainfall damage to a Category 3 or 4 storm, according to Yale Climate Connections.\n\nOn Monday alone, Debby dumped 6 inches of rain on Savannah -- more than the city received all last August. Still more rain is expected until the weekend.\n\nThat's bad news for a region that already suffers from significant flooding risk even when it isn't raining.\n\nWhy is the Southeast particularly vulnerable to flooding?\n\nA mixture of geography, sea level rise, a heating planet and a legacy of maladaptive development decisions.\n\nTo start with, the coastal southeast is low, flat and at the constant intersection of both big waterways and tidal flux -- all of which would lead to a significant flood risk even if sea levels weren't rising as global temperatures climb.\n\nHotter water doesn't just fuel hurricanes or melt ice off the poles -- it also takes up more space than cooler water, which translates to sea levels creeping up into sewers and waterways, and also (because the geometry of stormwater drainage relies on seawater levels being lower than the water being drained) causes rain to pool and back up.\n\nThe Southern U.S. is a global hotspot of sea-level rise, with levels in Charleston up an average of 7 inches since 2010, and water levels along the East Coast rising by about 4 millimeters per year.\n\nThat rise makes \"sunny day flooding\" a continual problem in cities like Savannah. And compounding the issue is the fact that, like East Coast cities from Miami to Boston, the Georgia city's demand for water is worsening its drainage problem.\n\nEvery gallon of groundwater pulled from these underground aquifers causes the overlying city to sink, making it even harder to get rid of stormwater -- a dynamic that, along the East Coast as a whole, is lowering cities by about 2 millimeters per year.\n\nPut those trends together, and the effect is sea levels rising along the East Coast by more than 2 inches per decade -- a rate that a 2023 Journal of Climate study suggests is accelerating, particularly in the Southeast.\n\nExperts told The Washington Post that this slow, creeping erosion from saltwater -- which blocks roads and corrodes sewers and asphalt even on sunny days -- is a greater long-term danger than the more dramatic hurricanes.\n\n\"We are preparing for the wrong disaster almost everywhere,\" Rob Young, told the newspaper.\n\n\"These smaller changes will be a greater threat over time than the next hurricane, no question about it.\"\n\nBut as with so many consequences of planetary heating, the crises aren't separate; they build on one another. Storms like Debby are sudden, potentially devastating disasters that are worsened by the ways they interact with the slow-moving one, as higher seas and bigger storm surges combine with more dramatic rainfalls to lead to higher water levels in the streets.\n\nIn the case of 2012's Hurricane Sandy, the combination of rising seas and a hurricane led to billions of dollars in additional damage and over a hundred thousand additional flooded households, according to 2021 study in Nature Communications.\n\nSuch dynamics don't require a hurricane: For example, the city saw some of its highest water levels ever in the wake of a winter storm last December, experiencing over four feet of water above average, according to federal statistics.\n\nIn a troubling mark of the rapid pace of sea level rise, that last 2023 non-hurricane storm drove up sea levels by nearly as much as 2017's Hurricane Irma, which hit Charleston with the third-highest storm surge ever recorded.\n\nDebby's entrance into Georgia's coastal region worsens this already unfavorable math with a new deluge. With the storm still 80 miles from Charleston -- and Debby not expected until Thursday morning -- water levels at federal coastal stations are already at more than two feet above average.\n\nThese trends suggest a grim outlook for the Southeast coast -- so grim that they've prompted suggestions that the most vulnerable communities in the region be abandoned. Coastal development is continuing, however, and a March study in Nature Communications found that government at all levels is effectively subsidizing the rising cost.\n\nThe study's authors acknowledged that these subsidies are keeping communities from facing the price crash that would come from a frank reckoning with the reality of sea level rise -- and holding off climate gentrification. But they argued that these benefits are only temporary.\n\nThey only \"delay precipitous declines as total inundation approaches,\" the authors wrote.\n\nWhere is Debby going next?\n\nThe prevailing story for the next two days will be \"deja vu,\" with the storm's limited movement leading to \"the same areas getting impacted over the course of the forecast,\" the National Weather Service wrote on Tuesday.\n\nIt's hard to know precisely where Debby will go and when, in part because it's moving so slowly that it is much more subject to atmospheric conditions, which are causing it to wander more than a storm with a strong forward momentum.\n\nBut current federal predictions assume that after a wide 24-hour swing around Charleston, Debby will make landfall again near the city on Thursday morning.\n\nIt is then forecast to head up through the North Carolina Piedmont and the mid-Atlantic, where it is expected to dump 4 to 8 inches of rain, with some municipalities possibly getting as much as 12 inches.\n\nFrom there, the cone of uncertainty spreads to encompass the entire Northeastern seaboard, potentially including severely flood-prone communities from Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware Valley to the Jersey Shore, Hudson Valley and Long Island -- though the NWS currently thinks the most likely targets are northern New Jersey and Central or Eastern Pennsylvania.\n\nCurrent projections suggest between 50 and 80 percent of communities in that area -- which butts up against the west side of New York's metro area -- could get an excess of 3 inches of rain by this weekend.",

While Hampton Roads isn't likely to experience sustained wind, the rainfall expected could be dangerous and problematic in areas prone to flooding.\n\nResidents can do a few things to mitigate those issues, including clearing storm drains, and proceed cautiously on local roads, especially low-lying thoroughfares that experience frequent flooding. Our communities shouldn't have much to fear from this system but it's still best to prepare promptly and exercise good judgment as the storm rolls through.\n\nDebby made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, on Monday morning as a relatively weak Category 1 hurricane, with sustained winds of 80 mph. A slow-moving system, the storm's primary threat is not from the gusts of its wind, but from the heavy rainfall it has dumped on coastal and inland communities as it crossed the Sunshine State.\n\nAt least five people in Florida and Georgia are dead, and officials in Sarasota said they conducted more than 500 rescues of people stranded in flooded areas. Storm surge has been a problem along the Gulf Coast, but the staggering rainfall totals -- some places expected 30 inches in a matter of hours -- is causing problems for every community in Debby's path.\n\nForecasting a hurricane's path has improved significantly in recent years, but storms such as this still make predictions difficult. A slow-moving system like this can sit over an area, bringing much higher rainfall than expected, and tend to wobble in their path, meaning places that should be in the clear may still experience severe weather.\n\nThat's the state of play for Hampton Roads. While local forecasts call for elevated rain totals, our region isn't likely to receive the sort of inundation facing coastal cities such as Savannah, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina; and Wilmington, North Carolina. But there's still a chance the track could shift and coastal Virginia could be wetter than expected.\n\nGiven our region's experience with these storms, residents are likely prepared for what may come. They know that heavy rain will lead to flooded streets in predictable locations. They know that homes and businesses in low-lying areas are at greater risk of damage. And they know that substantial precipitation, coupled with wind gusts, can topple trees and fell power lines, causing additional problems.\n\nPower companies and first responders stand at the ready to help, should assistance be needed. The hope, of course, is that the public takes precautions to avoid calling the authorities for help. That means not walking or driving through floodwaters, for instance, since only a little moving water can shove a car or a person off the road and put them in harm's way.\n\nThose workers may be needed elsewhere in the commonwealth as Debby passes through; central Virginia is expected to see far higher rain totals than Hampton Roads. Being smart here will enable them to go where their services are in greater demand.\n\nHampton Roads residents can also help protect their communities by tending to the area around their homes.\n\nCheck storm drains and gutters to make sure they are free from debris, allowing stormwater to flow into drains. Trimming grass and weeds along curbs helps with this as well. And removing dead or diseased limbs from trees -- away from power lines and not during the storm, of course -- can keep them from falling and causing damage on the ground.\n\nGiven what scientists expect from the hurricane season this year, Debby won't be our only brush with severe weather this year. Conditions are favorable for the tropics to spin out a number of larger, more dangerous storms in the coming weeks.\n\nBut by preparing your home and business, stocking supplies, tending to storm drains and landscaping, listening to authorities and avoiding dumb decisions such as driving through floodwaters, residents here can help ensure this system and future ones pass without incident.",

The storm was forecast to move relatively slowly across Southern states, with huge rainfall totals possible in some areas.\n\nThe latest forecast says Debby could restrengthen over the Atlantic Ocean before its center moves inland again by late Wednesday or early Thursday. Debby made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast early Monday as a hurricane. At least six people have died.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nFrequent floods are part of life along the water\n\nGene Taylor was waiting for a few inches of water to drain back out of his home as high tide passed Wednesday afternoon at his home along French Quarter Creek, not far from the Cooper River in Huger and about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston.\n\nThis is the fourth time his home's been flooded in the past nine years, and he heeded the warnings this time, moving things up or out.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said. \"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out.\"\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home -- a common annoyance now.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nWater levels are rising as Tropical Storm Debby's rainfall drains out to sea. The National Weather Service in Charleston tweeted that the Canoochee River in Claxton, Georgia have neared 18 feet, surpassing previous flood record set in 1925.\n\nSouth Carolina's drama is still playing out\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported from Tropical Story Debby in South Carolina, but Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday that the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains Monday and Tuesday that caused flooding that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bans develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA dam could fail, threatening mobile homes\n\nThe \"imminent failure\" of a dam in southeast Georgia is threatening to swamp a mobile home park and other areas downstream, the National Weather Service said in a flash flood warning early Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe Cypress Lake Dam is in Bulloch County, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Savannah.\n\n\"If the dam breaks, flash flooding will occur immediately downstream of the dam,\" the weather service said.\n\nThe Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency posted photos and videos on social media showing torrents of water rushing through neighborhoods and surrounding homes. Local media reported that even more flooding would happen if the dam breaks.\n\nWater 'comes with the territory' along the coast\n\nThe lunch crowd poured into the Brown Dog Deli in downtown Charleston after hunkering down in Tropical Storm Debby.\n\n\"We've got a lot of locals walking in after being cooped up for two days looking for a good meal,\" said Liz Denney, kitchen manager for the deli, which sells an eclectic mix of sandwiches and sides like the Folly Beach Crunch Wrap with turkey, bacon, sea salt chips, honey mustard and guacamole.\n\nThe restaurant does flood, and a little water got around the sandbags employees put up Monday. But they have had worse flooding other times in the past year, Denney said.\n\nThe deli closed early Monday and couldn't open Tuesday if they wanted to because of Charleston's curfew. But Denney said the standing water and the occasional interruption is just part of living on the coast.\n\n\"It comes with the territory,\" Denney said.\n\nNorth Carolina deploys National Guard\n\nNorth Carolinians should prepare for potentially severe flash floods and days of heavy rain, with up to 15 inches in the forecast before Tropical Storm Debby is done with the state, Gov. Roy Cooper said during a Wednesday news conference.\n\nDebby's center will likely cross over areas of southeastern North Carolina devastated by flooding from Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018, and while Debby doesn't appear to pose as much of a threat, that could change as the storm moves north, he said.\n\nWhile officials are paying close attention to southeastern North Carolina, the state's Emergency Management director William Ray said people in western parts of the state also need to look out for flooding risks.\n\n\"All North Carolinians across our state need to be prepared for a deluge, more rain than most of us see in a month or several months,\" Cooper said.\n\nVoluntary evacuations are under way in some regions, and about 350 North Carolina National Guard soldiers have been deployed to assist in storm recovery, Cooper said. There are also 17 water rescue teams stationed at the ready in the eastern and central parts of North Carolina, Ray said.\n\nDebby's wider weather impacts\n\nThe National Weather Service says moisture from Debby has streamed far out from the center of the tropical storm and interacted with a weather front stretching from the Great Lakes to Long Island, N.Y.\n\nScott Kleebauer, a meteorologist with weather prediction center, said another weather disturbance moving out of the Great Lakes area combined with the other events to cause multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms. It produced significant rainfall in many spots.\n\nNearly 340,000 customers were without power in Ohio, and parts of northern New Jersey saw 4 to 6 inches of rain in less than four hours on Tuesday. Lots of rain also fell just north of New York City, and there were multiple water rescues.\n\nStates prepare for disaster\n\nFive states have made emergency declarations as Tropical Storm Debby slowly churns up the Atlantic coast and drenches communities in the southeastern U.S.\n\nStates of emergency have been declared by governors in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland also made a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations for the storm without declaring a state of emergency.\n\nEmergency declarations allow states to quickly respond to major storms and other disasters. The state's response can include providing direct assistance to local communities in the form of supplies and equipment.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. government has approved federal disaster assistance for Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, according to news releases from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nTorrential rain totals\n\nA spot near Lake City in north Florida leads the nation in total rainfall from Tropical Storm Debby at a whopping 19.67 inches (50 centimeters), according to the latest totals from the national Weather Prediction Center. Sarasota, Florida -- hard-hit by flooding after Debby came ashore as a hurricane -- saw 17.78 inches (45 centimeters).\n\nSeveral South Carolina communities are not far behind, with that state's highest total of 17.27 inches (44 centimeters) near Summerville as rain continued in the Carolinas.\n\nThe storm totals are through late Wednesday morning.\n\nDebby-enhanced storms soak New Jersey\n\nSevere thunderstorms soaked most of New Jersey on Tuesday night, causing moderate flooding in many areas and leaving thousands without power.\n\nMore than 2 inches (5 centimeters) of rain fell in several areas, and as much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) was recorded in some southern Jersey communities. Forecasters said the storms were enhanced by moisture drifting up from Tropical Storm Debby. No injuries were reported.\n\nThe storms also caused local flooding of streets and expressways in New York City, stranding some motorists.\n\nCharleston lifts curfew\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, lifted its curfew for its downtown peninsula Wednesday morning, removing the barricades that blocked the eight roads and highways leading to the heart of the low-lying and historic city.\n\nThe curfew was in place for 32 hours. Officials said its goal of keeping unnecessary people out during the worst of the rains from Tropical Storm Debby worked. There were few, if any, high-water rescues, and calls to the fire department were no greater than a normally busy day.\n\nThe curfew cut down on hurricane parties, as bars and restaurants that normally remain open couldn't bring in staff and police warned they would ticket anyone out unnecessarily. Health care employees and other essential workers were allowed into downtown.\n\nThe curfew was meant to protect property, too. Cars and trucks driving through floodwaters can create waves that crash over sandbags and other barriers.\n\nTrash pickup was canceled for the entire week, and parking garages remain open for free until Friday so people can park their cars above ground level.\n\nNational Hurricane Center's late\n\nst advisory\n\nThe center of Tropical Storm Debby is over the Atlantic Ocean, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, the National Hurricane Center said in its 8 a.m. Wednesday advisory.\n\nThe storm has maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 kph) with higher gusts and is moving slowly northeastward at 4 kph (6 kph). A major flood threat continues for parts of the Carolinas, the center said.\n\nWinds of tropical storm force, or at least 39 mph (62 kph), extend outward up to 175 miles (280 kilometers) from the center.\n\nDebby is expected to turn toward the north-northwest Wednesday and bring its center to the South Carolina coast by the evening or early Thursday, forecasters said. Some strengthening is possible before it reaches land again.\n\nThe storm is expected to pick up forward speed as it spins up the Atlantic coast on Thursday and Friday and merges with a frontal boundary, forecasters said.\n\nDebby causes aviation disruptions\n\nAviation disruptions are getting worse after thunderstorms that are being enhanced by Debby hit the New York City area, with cancellations and delayed flights at all three of the region's major airports.\n\nLaGuardia, John F. Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International all endured ground stops Tuesday due to the storms, the Federal Aviation Administration reported.\n\nMore than a third of departures and nearly a third of arrivals from LaGuardia were canceled, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nMassive cancelations can leave planes and crews out of position, snowballing into even more problems in the coming days.\n\nMany canceled flights were also reported at smaller airports in the Southeast, such as Myrtle Beach International Airport in South Carolina. More than 40 percent of flights scheduled to arrive there Tuesday were canceled, the website showed.\n\nHeavy rains in New York City enhanced by Debby, forecasters say\n\nIn New York City, heavy rainstorms that local meteorologists said are being enhanced by moisture associated with Tropical Storm Debby caused localized flooding of streets and expressways Tuesday, leaving some motorists stuck in flood-prone areas.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a flood watch until noon on Wednesday for the entire city.\n\nNew York City Emergency Management warned New Yorkers of the potential for flash flooding, deploying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to urge people living in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice.\n\nThe National Weather Service says more heavy rain is possible in New York from Thursday to Saturday with tropical moisture associated with Debby.\n\nA sixth storm-related death has been reported\n\nA sixth storm-related death has been reported.\n\nA 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, was reported missing Monday after his anchored sailboat was seen partially sunk with the man's dog on it, WTSP-TV reported. Police confirmed on Tuesday that a body recovered was that of the missing man.\n\nBrian Clough had anchored his sailboat about 50 feet (15 meters) from the shoreline, according to the Gulfport Police Department.\n\nAuthorities previously had reported four storm-related deaths in Florida and another in Georgia.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley

The funds will enable WFP to distribute fortified biscuits and locally produced nutritious snacks to students in more than 10,000 schools across eight provinces: Farah, Ghor, Jawzjan, Nangarhar, Nuristan, Paktika, Uruzgan, and Zabul. \u201cHunger can be a barrier to education,\u201d said Raffaella Iodice, the E.U. Charg\u00e9e d\u2019Affaires to Afghanistan. \u201cThe additional E.U. funding to our long-standing partner WFP ensures that more children in Afghanistan receive nutritious food. This is essential for them to have the energy and focus they need to learn effectively and stay healthy. And if these meals encourage parents to prioritize school attendance, this benefits everyone.\u201d According to the WFP, schoolgirls in grades 4 to 6 will receive take-home rations, including vegetable oil or cash for their families. In three provinces with particularly low enrollment rates for boys, boys in grades 4 to 6 will also receive take-home rations. Hsiao-Wei Lee, WFP Country Director in Afghanistan, stated that the program supported 1.5 million school-aged children last year. She emphasized the crucial role of the E.U. as a key partner in these efforts. \u201cWFP in Afghanistan launched its school feeding program more than two decades ago to link food security and better nutrition with education,\u201d Ms. Lee said. For the first time in Afghanistan, WFP will test the local production of vegetarian samosas made from fortified local ingredients through a network of local bakeries. \u201cA planned 2,000 children will receive two samosas per school day, baked with pumpkin, spinach, egg, potato, or soya beans, as a protein-rich and nutritious snack,\u201d the statement read.", "summary": "<img width=\"810\" height=\"472\" src=\"https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/School-in-Nangarhar-1024x597-1.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/School-in-Nangarhar-1024x597-1.jpg 1024w, https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/School-in-Nangarhar-1024x597-1-300x175.jpg 300w, https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/School-in-Nangarhar-1024x597-1-768x448.jpg 768w, https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/School-in-Nangarhar-1024x597-1-810x472.jpg 810w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" />KABUL (amu.tv): The European Union is allocating an additional \u20ac10 million to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) for school feeding activities in Afghanistan, the WFP announced on Wednesday.

{"id": 225002654, "title": "Bronny James' Agent: LeBron's Son to Remain in 2024 NBA Draft amid Lakers Rumors", "text": "Bronny James is keeping his name in the 2024 NBA draft pool and will forgo is remaining years of college eligibility. According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski and Jonathan Givony, agent Rich Paul said Wednesday that Bronny is \"staying in the draft.\" Paul, who represents Bronny and his father, Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James, made the announcement ahead of Wednesday's 11:59 p.m. ET deadline for draft prospects to withdraw from he draft pool. The 19-year-old's initial decision to go through the draft process wasn't a major surprise since he was widely expected to be a one-and-done player before he arrived at USC. His disappointing freshman campaign, did, however, lead some to wonder whether another season of college ball would be in his best interests. Once the predraft process kicked into gear, it became increasingly obvious James would close the door on college for good. The combine didn't get off to a great start for the Trojans guard as he was measured at 6'1\", noticeably below his listed height of 6'4\". Otherwise, he generally performed well for a prospect widely viewed as a second-rounder. More than that, statements coming from James' camp and some of the reporting around him pointed to a level of confidence he'll hear his name called on draft night. Paul confirmed to Bleacher Report's Chris Haynes his client doesn't intend to sign a two-way contract. More tellingly, Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium reported May 28 on FanDuel TV's Run It Back that Bronny was going to be very selective with his team workouts: The latter is a common tactic for the top prospects who have a small window for where they'll realistically land. Prospects in James' range typically don't have that kind of luxury and have to settle for whichever franchise takes them. From the outside, it reflected a level of confidence in getting the young guard to a preferred landing spot, and that's probably where his dad comes in. The tone from LeBron James about playing alongside his son has shifted a bit from when he told The Athletic's Jason Lloyd in 2022 he \"would do whatever it takes to play with my son for one year.\" In May, ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported on Get Up that Paul \"has made an effort to part the concept that drafting Bronny James means you're getting LeBron,\" playing down the likelihood that LeBron and Bronny are a surefire package deal. Paul addressed the narrative as well with Haynes and seemingly corroborated Windhorst's reporting. \"Well, LeBron said he wanted to play with his son. Bronny can't do anything about that,\" he said. \"And that's nothing we should push back on. If he wants to play with his son, that's that. But again, I have a job to do representing Bronny and LeBron. \"LeBron's season's over. I'm focused on Bronny and the rest of our draft class. If it aligns where he can play with his dad, great. Am I necessarily focused on that? No, not at all. I'm focused on a team-plan investment and a seriousness as it pertains to fit and opportunity.\" The chance for LeBron and Bronny remains. The Los Angeles Lakers continue to be linked with Bronny, and taking him would undoubtedly help their sales pitch to re-sign LeBron. Speculation swirled around the Phoenix Suns once they were included on his workout short list, leading some to wonder whether they'd launch their own audacious bid for the King. Where Bronny lands will be one of the most fascinating NBA offseason storylines.", "summary": "Bronny James is keeping his name in the 2024 NBA draft pool and will forgo is remaining years of college eligibility.

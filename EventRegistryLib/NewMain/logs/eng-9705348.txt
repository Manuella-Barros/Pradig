New Hampshire State Fire Marshal Sean P. Toomey and Chief David Emanuel, president of the NH Association of Fire Chiefs, urge residents to celebrate responsibly and with extreme vigilance.\n\nThe safest way to enjoy fireworks is by attending a public display sponsored by your local community or other organization. These displays are set up and shown by trained, licensed professional pyrotechnicians and inspected by public safety officials to ensure they meet all safety standards.\n\nUsing consumer fireworks safely\n\nIf you choose to celebrate with permissible fireworks (those legal consumer devices sold in New Hampshire licensed retail stores), follow these fireworks safety guidelines to protect yourself, your family, and your property:\n\nCheck Local Regulations: Contact your local fire department to ensure fireworks are allowed in your community and to check for any specific restrictions or guidelines.\n\nSet Boundaries and Supervise: Only adults 21 years of age or older are legally allowed to purchase, possess, and display permissible fireworks. Ensure fireworks are stored securely and out of children's reach. Supervision is crucial to prevent accidents, as even sparklers can cause significant injury, burning at temperatures over 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit. For context, most adults will suffer third-degree burns if exposed to 150 degree water for two seconds, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\nFollow the three b's\n\nBe Prepared:\n\nPurchase only the amount of fireworks you will use.\n\nDisplay fireworks only on your property or with written permission from the landowner.\n\nHave a water hose, bucket of water, or fire extinguisher nearby.\n\nCreate a clear, level surface away from flammable materials.\n\nCheck the daily forest fire weather forecast and avoid lighting fireworks in dry, windy conditions.\n\nBe Safe:\n\nAdults should wear eye and hearing protection, as well as gloves.\n\nFollow the safety directions on each firework device.\n\nLight one device at a time and move away quickly.\n\nKeep spectators at a safe distance.\n\nOnly use fireworks outdoors in open spaces, away from buildings, dry grass, or other flammable materials.\n\nBe considerate of your neighbors, pets, and the environment.\n\nBe Responsible:\n\nClean up all debris after your fireworks display.\n\nIf a firework does not ignite, wait at least 15 minutes before handling, then soak it in water.\n\nSecure unused fireworks, matches, and lighters to prevent access by children.\n\nState Law Requirements\n\nState law requires anyone who buys, possesses, or uses fireworks to be at least 21 years old, and any local ordinances or restrictions must be followed. Report illegal fireworks use by calling your local law enforcement agency's non-emergency dispatch. Only call 9-1-1 in an emergency.\n\nClass c fireworks and display fireworks\n\nClass C, Consumer Fireworks: Legal, except those prohibited pursuant to RSA 160-B:16. These can be purchased at licensed retail stores throughout the state. Permissible fireworks are also known as Consumer Fireworks, and the terms are used interchangeably.\n\nDisplay Fireworks: Used only by licensed professionals (pyrotechnicians) and include aerial shells, cakes, candles, and other display pieces that exceed the limits for consumer fireworks. Retail stores that do not have a license to sell New Hampshire-approved permissible fireworks can sell unregulated consumer fireworks classified as novelties, such as sparklers, party poppers, snakes, and snappers.\n\nFireworks usage restrictions\n\nFireworks may only be used on private property that you own, or with written permission from the landowner, or in the owner's presence, except where fireworks are locally prohibited.\n\nProhibited locations for using consumer fireworks include New Hampshire beaches, parks, campgrounds, and State and Federal forest lands.\n\nUsing fireworks where prohibited can result in civil liability for damages to another's property.\n\nThe use of unmanned, free-floating sky lanterns and similar devices using an open flame is illegal in New Hampshire. Tethered or anchored sky lanterns are allowed.\n\nHow to safely enjoy fireworks\n\nRead and follow all directions, caution labels, and warning labels on each individual firework device.\n\nNever allow children to handle, play with, and/or light any type of fireworks.\n\nDo not consume alcohol while handling fireworks.\n\nBe cautious of lighting aerial devices during high wind conditions.\n\nAlways:\n\nDisplay fireworks in a clear, open area that is free of overhead objects.\n\nProvide for a safe distance between buildings and any viewing audience.\n\nIgnite one device at a time.\n\nHave a form of fire suppression nearby (fire extinguisher, hose, or bucket of water).\n\nStore fireworks in a cool, dry place and dispose of them properly.\n\nNever:\n\nExtend any part of your body over the top of any device.\n\nAttempt to reignite, alter, or fix any fireworks device that has failed to fire.\n\nAim, point, throw, or shoot fireworks at another person.\n\nFireworks safety: a shared responsibility\n\n\"Fireworks are explosive devices and can be dangerous and unpredictable. Let's have a safe and happy Fourth of July by taking all necessary precautions when enjoying them,\" Fire Marshal Toomey emphasized.\n\nChief Emanuel added, \"Structure fire property loss can occur due to fireworks, especially those involving rockets that can land on rooftops and cause fires. We encourage people to consider watching a local display in their community, rather than take this risk. For information about community fireworks displays, contact your local fire department.\"\n\nInDepthNH.org is a nonprofit watchdog news website published by the New Hampshire Center for Public Interest Journalism.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkler", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sparkler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_marshal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fire marshal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_lantern", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky lantern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ordinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local ordinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fire department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_hose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fire hose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Consumer_Product_Safety_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-1-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "9-1-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_extinguisher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fire extinguisher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning_and_Stains", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning and Stains", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Safety_Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Safety Products and Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/b0/fb0b631c-35b7-11ef-b6ed-07676e8ce01d/667f6511d9c28.image.jpg?crop=1625%2C853%2C0%2C210&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705348", "eventUri": "eng-9705348", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

It was the first time since 2000 that the Macy's display took place over the Hudson River and not the East River. (Yana Paskova/Getty Images)\n\nIt's almost the Fourth of July - a day of parades, barbecue and, of course, fireworks. But while parades and barbecues are still very popular, shockingly, this year fireworks are less so.\n\nImports of fireworks reached a peak in 2022 of almost US$600 million, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. But today, just two years later, my estimate is that fireworks imports will only reach about $350 million in 2024. What happened to one of U.S.'s favorite Fourth of July activities?\n\nThe answer, I believe, lies in the COVID-19 pandemic, which transformed the economy as billions of people around the world were stuck at home. E-commerce boomed, as did sales of alcohol, indoor exercise equipment and cleaning products. However, this boom was followed by a bust for many products, as people switched back to pre-pandemic buying habits.\n\nThis appears to be what happened with fireworks.\n\nI am a business school professor who has followed the fireworks industry for years. In the U.S., fireworks are a multibillion-dollar industry. They're primarily lit off around Independence Day and New Year's Eve. To handle these two holidays, American businesses import large amounts of fireworks well in advance of these dates to ensure enough supply.\n\nFireworks were invented in China over 2,000 years ago, and most of the world's fireworks are still made there today. Since 2010, China has exported almost 90% of the world's fireworks, United Nations data shows. Much of these are low-priced mass-market products. More expensive fireworks are exported from countries like the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Poland and the U.S.\n\nWhile Americans light off millions of pounds of pyrotechnics each year, only a small amount of professional fireworks are manufactured here. Because so few fireworks are produced in the U.S., by using import and population figures, it's easy to calculate how much explosives are blown up per person each year.\n\nBack in 2010, about two-thirds of a pound of fireworks were lit off per person. In 2019, the year before the pandemic, the figure was three-quarters of a pound per person.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were stuck in their homes and social distancing was common, fireworks use shot up. This makes sense: Setting off pyrotechnics is an outdoor activity where the product instructions explicitly state people igniting them should stand far away from others. In 2021 and 2022, fireworks usage almost doubled to 1.35 pounds per American.\n\nWhile 2024 isn't over yet, most of what will be blown up this Fourth of July has already been imported. Extrapolating from the amount imported so far, 2024 fireworks consumption looks set to end up back at 2010 levels of about two-thirds of a pound per person.\n\nI believe there are three reasons for the big decline. First, as already mentioned, there was the COVID-19 spike as bored people stuck at home looked for something exciting to do outside.\n\nSecond, relatedly, during the pandemic many people lit fireworks because public displays were canceled. The amount of display fireworks, which are shot off only by professionals, plummeted. Today, all of the public displays are back, which reduces demand from more casual consumers. Why worry about lighting dangerous explosives when a professional can take care of it?\n\nThe last reason is that, like so much else, fireworks are more expensive these days. Inflation in the U.S. has soared recently, with the prices of all kinds of goods and services rising. Fireworks are no different.\n\nIn 2021, the average import price for fireworks was $1.13 per pound, figures from the U.S. International Trade Commission show. That cheap price wasn't available to the typical buyer - it's the wholesale price paid for an entire tractor-trailer container, just off the ship.\n\nDuring the first four months of 2024, the bulk price jumped up to $1.61 per pound. This 42% price increase is more than twice the overall increase in the U.S. inflation rate.\n\nAdd in rising labor costs at fireworks stands, and these three explanations make it clear why fireworks use is down since the pandemic's peak.\n\nFireworks are a key part of the Fourth of July holiday, and they are often magnificent spectacles. However, if you're shooting them off, use some common sense, especially if children are around. Each year, thousands of people in the U.S. are injured and a small number die due to fireworks. So be careful.\n\nAnd whether you're lighting fireworks, watching them or just hiding from the noise, I wish you all a happy Independence Day.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Here's what's fine for fourth of July", "body": "As Independence Day is celebrated in Stanislaus County, local officials once again are warning of the risks to public safety and the environment and the legal consequences of using certain fireworks.\n\nIllegal fireworks can result in injury, death, fires, fines and arrests.\n\nAll fireworks vendors in the city of Modesto must obtain a so-called safe and sane fireworks sales permit from a city fire official.\n\nIllegal fireworks, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, include skyrockets, bottle rockets, Roman candles, aerial shells and firecrackers.\n\nTypically, any nonprofessional fireworks that launch into the air are illegal. But, nonaerial fireworks such as M-80s also are illegal because of their explosive potential -- the equivalent to a quarter-stick of dynamite, said Lt. Dave Mullins with the Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"We want to ensure all of our community has a safe and enjoyable holiday celebrating our nation's independence,\" reads a Modesto Police Department post on Facebook. \"There are several area aerial fireworks shows, or even drone shows, you can attend to celebrate.\"\n\nThe Modesto Bee previously reported a list of regional fireworks shows, including the Fireworks-on-the-Water celebration to be held July 6 at Lake Don Pedro.\n\nThe Modesto Police Department said it will use its Sky 1 airplane to detect illegal fireworks set off in Stanislaus County. Last year, more than half of fireworks-related citations were issued as a result of Sky 1's patrols.\n\nAhead of this year's celebrations, 10 citations have been issued. Sky 1 assisted with three of them, according to MPD. The Stanislaus County Sheriff's Office said its Air101 helicopter will assist with enforcement in its jurisdiction.\n\nFines for illegal fireworks are $2,000 for the first violation, $3,000 for the second violation and $4,000 for the third. Any more than three within a 36-month period could result in jail time, according to the Sheriff's Office.\n\nOn June 26, MPD officers arrested a 34-year-old man accused of possessing over 580 pounds of illegal fireworks with the intent to sell them. MPD said the man agreed to sell fireworks to investigators through an Instagram account.\n\nOfficials ask residents not to call 911 to report illegal fireworks, unless there's a related emergency, such as injury, property damage or fire. The fireworks reporting voicemail line can be reached at 209-525-7202. The designated email is fireworks@scr911.com. Residents can also contact their local police department's nonemergency lines.\n\nLast year, fireworks resulted in eight deaths and an estimated 9,700 injuries nationwide, according to the Consumer Products Safety Commission.\n\nFireworks are thought to have sparked a vegetation fire in Paso Robles on Sunday, which burned more than three and a half acres before it was extinguished.\n\n\"Don't get burned, keep your family and community safe while using State Fire Marshal approved fireworks. Each year, Fire and Police respond to emergencies resulting from the use of fireworks including injuries and structure fires,\" reads an MPD Facebook post.\n\nCal Fire recommends carefully reading the instructions on fireworks before use and to never light fireworks indoors or near dry grass. Further, keep a bucket of water or hose nearby in case things get out of hand. Children should be supervised at all times.\n\nWildfires are more common during hot and dry weather. An excessive heat warning was issued for the Modesto area throughout the week. The temperature is forecast to reach 108 degrees on July Fourth.\n\nStanislaus Animal Services Agency offered tips to keep dogs comforted and safe while fireworks are being set.

But while parades and barbecues are still very popular, shockingly, this year fireworks are less so.\n\nImports of fireworks reached a peak in 2022 of almost US$600 million, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. But today, just two years later, my estimate is that fireworks imports will only reach about $350 million in 2024. What happened to one of U.S.'s favorite Fourth of July activities?\n\nThe answer, I believe, lies in the COVID-19 pandemic, which transformed the economy as billions of people around the world were stuck at home. E-commerce boomed, as did sales of alcohol, indoor exercise equipment and cleaning products. However, this boom was followed by a bust for many products, as people switched back to pre-pandemic buying habits.\n\nI am a business school professor who has followed the fireworks industry for years. In the U.S., fireworks are a multibillion-dollar industry. They're primarily lit off around Independence Day and New Year's Eve. To handle these two holidays, American businesses import large amounts of fireworks well in advance of these dates to ensure enough supply.\n\nFireworks were invented in China over 2,000 years ago, and most of the world's fireworks are still made there today. Since 2010, China has exported almost 90% of the world's fireworks, United Nations data shows. Much of these are low-priced mass-market products. More expensive fireworks are exported from countries like the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Poland and the U.S.\n\nWhile Americans light off millions of pounds of pyrotechnics each year, only a small amount of professional fireworks are manufactured here. Because so few fireworks are produced in the U.S., by using import and population figures, it's easy to calculate how much explosives are blown up per person each year.\n\nBack in 2010, about two-thirds of a pound of fireworks were lit off per person. In 2019, the year before the pandemic, the figure was three-quarters of a pound per person.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were stuck in their homes and social distancing was common, fireworks use shot up. This makes sense: Setting off pyrotechnics is an outdoor activity where the product instructions explicitly state people igniting them should stand far away from others. In 2021 and 2022, fireworks usage almost doubled to 1.35 pounds per American.\n\nWhile 2024 isn't over yet, most of what will be blown up this Fourth of July has already been imported. Extrapolating from the amount imported so far, 2024 fireworks consumption looks set to end up back at 2010 levels of about two-thirds of a pound per person.\n\nWhy the big drop?\n\nI believe there are three reasons for the big decline. First, as already mentioned, there was the COVID-19 spike as bored people stuck at home looked for something exciting to do outside.\n\nSecond, relatedly, during the pandemic many people lit fireworks because public displays were canceled. The amount of display fireworks, which are shot off only by professionals, plummeted. Today, all of the public displays are back, which reduces demand from more casual consumers. Why worry about lighting dangerous explosives when a professional can take care of it?\n\nThe last reason is that, like so much else, fireworks are more expensive these days. Inflation in the U.S. has soared recently, with the prices of all kinds of goods and services rising. Fireworks are no different.\n\nIn 2021, the average import price for fireworks was $1.13 per pound, figures from the U.S. International Trade Commission show. That cheap price wasn't available to the typical buyer - it's the wholesale price paid for an entire tractor-trailer container, just off the ship.\n\nDuring the first four months of 2024, the bulk price jumped up to $1.61 per pound. This 42% price increase is more than twice the overall increase in the U.S. inflation rate.\n\nAdd in rising labor costs at fireworks stands, and these three explanations make it clear why fireworks use is down since the pandemic's peak.\n\nFireworks are a key part of the Fourth of July holiday, and they are often magnificent spectacles. However, if you're shooting them off, use some common sense, especially if children are around. Each year, thousands of people in the U.S. are injured and a small number die due to fireworks. So be careful.\n\nAnd whether you're lighting fireworks, watching them or just hiding from the noise, I wish you all a happy Independence Day.\n\nWritten by JAY L.

On any July Fourth or New Year's Eve, it's common to experience the loud pop of a firework or see it colorfully explode into the sky and hang there briefly.\n\nPyrotechnic amusements from sparklers to Roman candles have long been a staple of celebrations in the U.S. and beyond, helping to mark national holidays, sporting events and more.\n\n\"They have become a global phenomenon, and they have become almost, if you like, the accepted way in which big events are celebrated,\" said John Withington, author of the upcoming book, A History of Fireworks from Their Origins to the Present Day.\n\nBut the elaborate, computer-controlled displays of contemporary fireworks shows are a long way from the medium's simpler beginnings in ancient China.\n\nThe thinking goes that someone living in China around the first century B.C. threw a piece of bamboo on a fire and it exploded with a bang. Bamboo stalks contain air pockets that can expand and blow up in extreme heat. According to Withington, Chinese travelers would carry bamboo on journeys in case they needed to create a loud noise to scare away wild animals.\n\nThe next major development came around the ninth century, when gunpowder was invented. Chinese fabricators loaded up bamboo stalks with gunpowder to create perhaps the world's first manufactured fireworks, and later began using paper tubes as well, History.com said. These were deployed to ward off evil spirits and celebrate births and weddings, according to the Smithsonian.\n\nBy the 12th century, fireworks were being lit for entertainment purposes in China's imperial court, Withington said. Rudimentary fireworks then made their way to Europe around the 14th century, where Italian artists constructed displays resembling theatrical sets called \"machines\" and set off fireworks inside them.\n\nFireworks became even more complex thanks to advances in chemistry. The 19th century saw potassium chlorate used to elicit brilliant colors in fireworks, such as red and green, and enhance their brightness, according to Withington.\n\nOver the years, innovations in technology led to some curious suggestions for how fireworks could help solve modern problems. Whalers experimented with rocket-powered harpoons in the late 1800s, and inventor Gerhard Zucker attempted to use pyrotechnic rockets to deliver mail in the 1930s.\n\nEuropeans who made their way to the Americas brought fireworks with them. It's possible that Capt. John Smith, who was saved by Pocahontas according to legend, set off fireworks in Jamestown in 1608.\n\nOn July 3, 1776, the day after the Continental Congress voted for independence from Great Britain, John Adams wrote a letter to his wife, Abigail, imagining future celebrations of the occasion. (Though Congress voted for the Declaration of Independence on the 2nd, it was approved, signed and printed on the 4th.) Adams suggested those observances should include \"illuminations,\" or fireworks.\n\n\"It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more,\" Adams wrote.\n\nThe following year, one of the first organized July Fourth celebrations was held in Philadelphia and included a fireworks display. \"The evening was closed with the ringing of bells, and at night there was a grand exhibition of fireworks (which began and concluded with thirteen rockets) on the Commons, and the city was beautifully illuminated,\" a story in the Pennsylvania Evening Post reported.\n\nTo critics, however, fireworks weren't just a flashy racket -- they were also deadly. On Independence Day of 1903, more than 460 people were killed in fireworks accidents, according to Withington.\n\nA Pennsylvania attorney named Charles Pennypacker wrote in a letter to the Philadelphia Inquirer that year that Americans should hold a \"quiet and sane observance\" of the holiday. They could take a trolley ride, sit under a tree or bake a cake, Pennypacker suggested.\n\nIt didn't go over too well with some. \"On July 3, 1904, so the day before Independence Day,\" Withington said, \"some local young people gathered outside his house and started letting off fireworks and generally creating mayhem.\"\n\nStill, the \"Safe and Sane\" movement gained traction among some city officials who hoped to create calmer July Fourth celebrations. Chicago's mayor outlawed the discharge of fireworks, while Santa Fe held a beauty pageant in place of the typical festivities, according to Smithsonian Magazine.\n\nThe interest in fireworks never fizzled out, and they remain available across almost the entire U.S. today.\n\nOnly Massachusetts bans all forms of consumer fireworks, according to the American Pyrotechnics Association (APA). Every other state and the District of Columbia permit the sale of some or all types of fireworks.\n\nAccording to the APA, fireworks remain popular. Consumers bought 246.5 million pounds of fireworks last year and 436.4 million pounds the year before that, industry figures show.\n\nYet they continue to pose a safety risk both to professionals working with commercial-grade fireworks and those lighting the odd firecracker for fun.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, 9,700 people were treated in emergency rooms for fireworks injuries last year, eight of whom died. Two-thirds of the injuries occurred in the weeks before and after July 4.\n\nBut safety experts say there are some best practices people can follow to have a blast without getting hurt, such as lighting fireworks outside, not holding lit fireworks in your hand and not using fireworks when impaired by alcohol or drugs.\n\nAccording to KCUR, fireworks can also pose a risk to human health by producing particulate matter and other pollutants and harm the environment by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.", "source": {"uri": "weku.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "weku.org"},

Her work has appeared in Philadelphia Wedding Magazine, Washingtonian Weddings, Bethesda Magazine, and The Huffington Post.\n\nFor couples looking to literally go out with a bang on their wedding day, there's something supremely enchanting about a fireworks display. After all, what could be more celebratory than a dazzling array of sparks and starbursts in the sky above?\n\nOften set off just before the second half of the wedding reception, fireworks also add pizzazz to the transition from dinner to dancing, thus reinvigorating the spirit of the night. \"It's the perfect 'the party starts now' kind of wow factor,\" says wedding planning expert Kristin Phalines.\n\nInterested in setting off fireworks at your own nuptials? You've come to the right place! Exciting as they may be, fireworks do require careful planning in advance and cooperation with local bylaws in order to be executed safely and successfully. Read on for answers to the most commonly asked questions about wedding fireworks packages, including how much they typically cost. (Hint: it's less than you might think!)\n\nWhat venues are best for fireworks displays?\n\nPhalines prefers venues overlooking a river, beach, or another body of water because the fireworks can be set off from a barge. The separation from the venue helps minimize safety risks, and the fireworks look all the more dazzling when they're reflected off the glassy surface of the water.\n\n\"If you don't have water, then you need a space of land that is not surrounded by anything,\" she adds. For this reason, country clubs and golf courses work well, because there's typically lots of wide open space without many trees in the way.\n\nAre wedding fireworks legal near me?\n\nBefore you get too excited about the idea of fireworks at your wedding, be sure to consult your venue on whether or not they permit fireworks displays. If this is something they do allow, the venue will likely have a list of recommended vendors you can hire to produce your display. The venue and fireworks professionals will work together to secure the paperwork, permits, and safety officials necessary for legally setting off the fireworks.\n\nHosting an at-home wedding or marrying on private property? You'll need to do a little more research. For an overview, try Googling \"fireworks laws [county of wedding] [state of wedding].\" (If you're marrying in Atlanta, for example, you'll Google \"fireworks laws fulton county ga.\") Click on results from county or city government offices for the most factual information on restricted spaces and dates, curfews on displays, and more.\n\nIf \"consumer fireworks\" displays are allowed in your county, that's a good sign that professional fireworks displays on private property are also legal. From here, the easiest next step is to consult with a local pyrotechnic professional that produces wedding fireworks displays. They'll know which questions to ask, what permits to acquire, and what, if any, fire marshals or other safety officials need to be present for the display.\n\nNo matter where you get hitched, wedding fireworks should never be DIY. Hire pyrotechnic professionals and you're guaranteed a more dazzling display that won't get you in trouble with the law -- or put any of your beloved guests in harm's way.\n\nWhen should we set off the fireworks?\n\nYour county or state will likely have curfews in place for fireworks displays. In Pennsylvania, for example, the curfew is 10 P.M with the exception of a few holidays, so all fireworks displays need to be over and finished before 10 P.M.\n\nEven without curfews, Phalines still wouldn't schedule a fireworks display as the last element of the reception. \"An hour-and-a-half to two hours before the end of the night is the ideal time frame for fireworks,\" she says. The reason being: Dinner is over, dessert or the cake cutting is happening, and everyone can use a bit of a break. A fireworks display will fill the lull, and get folks revved up and ready to hit the dance floor.\n\nHow long should the fireworks last?\n\nThree to five minutes tops. \"We've done 12 minutes, and it was awful,\" says Phalines. \"Twelve minutes on a wedding day is like 30 minutes -- it's far too long.\"\n\nHow much do wedding fireworks cost?\n\n\"One of the biggest misconceptions about fireworks is how expensive they are,\" says Phalines. \"It's not affordable for everyone, of course, but it's not a crazy number.\" She typically recommends budgeting around $5,000 for a three-to-five minute display, but many reputable companies offer packages between $2,500 and $3,000. Important to note: If your display will be happening from the water, the barge or boat rental will likely be a separate cost.\n\nWhat seasons are best for wedding fireworks?\n\nFireworks make a great addition to weddings in every season, though they're most common at summer weddings and winter weddings and on holidays such as the 4th of July and New Year's Eve. Spring typically sees more thunderstorms and rain showers, which can make it trickier -- but certainly not impossible! -- to pull off an outdoor fireworks display.\n\nWhat happens if it rains?\n\nFortunately, fireworks displays can still happen even underneath a light drizzle. If, however, severe thunderstorms, heavy winds, or heavy downpours are plaguing your wedding day, you'll likely have to nix the fireworks. (Once the fuses are soaked, the fireworks won't light properly, and heavy winds would carry debris into unsafe areas.)\n\nIf rain cancellation policies aren't written into your contract, you'll likely have to eat the cost. Or, you can get a little crafty with who picks up the tab. If you're marrying at an established venue, Phalines suggests seeing if another couple who is interested in fireworks might be open to buying out your contract. That way, the company will still be rendering the same services at the same location, just on a different date. Of course, you'll need to first confirm with both the venue and the fireworks provider that they are open to this approach.\n\nWhat are some less-costly fireworks alternatives?\n\nCold sparklers, which don't produce flammable sparks, are trending hot as a way to bring pyrotechnics to indoor receptions. These displays shoot pyrotechnics up from the ground in a controlled column and can be used to frame the dance floor, mark the couple's entrance to the reception, or even surround the cake cutting. They typically rent for around $250 apiece.\n\nThen, of course, there's the classic sparkler send-off, which involves guests waving hand-held sparkler wands as the couple exits the reception venue. This makes for a fantastic photo op, and cases of sparklers can typically be purchased for under $150.", "source": {"uri": "brides.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brides"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HuffPost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HuffPost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washingtonian_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washingtonian (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_reception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wedding reception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrotechnics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pyrotechnics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bethesda, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Marshals Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Do it yourself"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wedding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_(explosives)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuse (explosives)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sparkler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Eve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Eve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cake"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Pyrotechnics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Pyrotechnics", "wgt": 62}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Fireworks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Fireworks", "wgt": 70}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Equipment", "wgt": 23}], "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/xr-pQdPt-pbQPlh681cIV95nT5s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1168346257-63d98af615434e4b9d0ec47c822e70bf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705348", "eventUri": "eng-9705348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 4994, "textEnd": 5005}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Many families across the Centennial State look forward to cozying up together and watching the night sky light up with spectacular colors. But as snazzy as they may be, fireworks are incredibly dangerous and can be disruptive to veterans, pets, young children, babies, and other folks with sensitive ears. Not to mention that without the proper licensing, many fireworks are illegal for personal use in many Colorado communities.\n\nFollow these safety guidelines to ensure that you and your loved ones have a happy and safe Fourth of July and avoid serious fines and citations.\n\nIn years past, Commerce City banned the sale, purchase, possession and use of personal fireworks, except for those items that don't require a flame or a fuse, like \"snappers\" or \"poppers.\" As of this June, the city council declared personal fireworks that are legal under state law as legal in Commerce City limits, but only on July 3 and 4.\n\nThe fines for fireworks violations start at $1,000 for a first offense and $2,000 for a second. Additionally, the fire danger in Adams County is currently high, so take a page out of Smokey Bear's book and use any personal fireworks with extreme caution. Even snappers and poppers can cause injury if used improperly, so be sure to follow all directions and always keep them out of the reach of children and animals.\n\nGood question. Colorado state law prohibits the use of any type of fireworks that leave the ground. That means the kind of fireworks that you set down, light up, run away from, and watch shoot up into the air are out of the question for personal use. As the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control says, \"Leave the big shows to the pro's!\"\n\nIn some Colorado cities, all fireworks requiring a flame to use are prohibited. However, in Commerce City, certain personal fireworks that require a flame to use are still legal, such as illuminating torches, sparklers, wheels, ground spinners and fountains. They also may not contain more than 50 milligrams of explosive composition. But again, these are only legal on the third and Fourth of July!\n\nThere are few things more heart-wrenching than a scared puppy. If you or your neighbors have dogs that are less than fond of fireworks, there are a few options to consider to help calm an anxious pup. Dogs have very sensitive ears, so your first line of defense might be dog ear protection. You can find a variety of dog ear muffs, ear plugs, \"happy hoodies\" and more at most pet stores or online, and Pinterest even has some great DIY options you can make in a pinch. If your dog is the type that would pull any sort of contraption like that off, consider using a white noise machine or playing soothing music for pets on the TV. If all else fails, pet CBD treats have been proven to be a safe and effective natural remedy for nervous animals. Here's a full story with more tips.\n\nKiddos often enjoy playing with their friends and watching fireworks with their families this time of year, but it's extremely important to protect their ears. Many of us didn't grow up wearing ear protection to loud festivals or concerts, let alone fireworks shows, and if the rising rates of hearing loss among U.S. adults are any indication, we're paying for it. Pediatricians at Phoenix Children's Hospital recommend parents use ear protection for their children at Fourth of July fireworks shows. To protect children from hearing loss, earplugs are recommended. For babies, it's advised to use earmuffs.\n\nThe responsibility falls on all of us to prevent injuries, fires and other problems this Fourth of July. To report a fireworks violation, call the non-emergency dispatch line at 303-288-1535 or visit c3.gov.com/Police. Do not call 911 to report fireworks violations, since this could slow down response times for life-threatening emergencies.", "source": {"uri": "coloradocommunitymedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Community Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_City,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commerce City, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Commerce City, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_(electrical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuse (electrical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ear protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_Bear", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smokey Bear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flashlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_(textiles)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spinning (textiles)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adams County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adams County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hearing loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Children's_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Children's Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White noise machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earmuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earmuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earplug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earplug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hoodie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_business_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central business district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Do it yourself"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://coloradocommunitymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230619-114603-shutterstock_63453616.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705348", "eventUri": "eng-9705348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "dateEnd": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 967, "textEnd": 979}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The Idaho Falls Fire Department responded to 15 fireworks-related blazes.\n\nAnd yet, Ada County Commissioner Ryan Davidson, for the fourth year in a row, voted against Ada County's ordinance banning all fireworks in unincorporated areas of the county.\n\n\"I don't believe in banning fireworks, and I generally don't think the ban accomplishes what it sets out to because fires occur even with the ban, so that's why, for America, I will vote against this fireworks ban,\" Davidson said during a commission meeting on June 11.\n\nBased on that logic -- to use the term ultra-loosely -- Ada County commissioners should start working to get rid of speed limits, red lights, loitering and noise ordinances, and a slew of other things.\n\nFortunately, Ada County's fireworks ordinance did pass, thanks to the votes of Commissioners Tom Dayley and Rod Beck.\n\n\"Well, I think it does provide safety for the community,\" Dayley said in support of the measure. \"Obviously, no matter what law we pass or ordinance we pass, people can violate it and have consequences as a result of the violation.\"\n\nFor those of you who are planning to set off illegal aerial fireworks July 4, as the Idaho Statesman's Nicole Blanchard clarified in a story this week, illegal fireworks are -- well, illegal.\n\nIt's also, according to the Idaho Attorney General's Office, illegal to sell those illegal aerial fireworks being sold by the thousands.\n\nThat waiver that you sign saying you won't set off the fireworks in Idaho is just made up, likely for the liability protection of the people selling you the fireworks.\n\nAs a wise editorial writer once wrote, that would be like buying marijuana at the corner store in Idaho as long as you signed a piece of paper saying you won't smoke it in Idaho.

Anyone who turned in illegal fireworks got safe and sane fireworks in exchange.\n\n\"It's important that the public helps us with trying to prevent any dangerous circumstances,\" Lt. Jason Winger with the West Sacramento Police Department said. \"In the current temperatures and fire conditions, it's extremely hazardous to have illegal fireworks set off.\"\n\nHe said a lot of departments are doing more this year to be proactive when it comes to enforcement.\n\n\"There's a lot of communities that are trying to work together with a variety of different ways to tackle the problem of illegal fireworks in the Sacramento region and in California,\" he said.\n\nOne of those communities is Roseville. The city has increased its fine to $750 for a first warning for illegal fireworks. It was $100 last year.\n\nEvery illegal firework found after that is a $1,000 fine. So, three illegal fireworks found would cost people more than $2,700.\n\n\"If you are in possession, or you are shooting off an illegal firework, it will get very expensive in Roseville very quickly,\" Roseville Deputy City Manager Megan Scheid said. \"We want people to be safe in their neighborhoods, and we're hoping that this serves as a deterrent.\"\n\nScheid said people can report illegal fireworks on the My Roseville App. They can share photos and videos, which will be used to file a case against the person using illegal fireworks.\n\nRoseville police said they'll have extra patrols staffed with illegal fireworks enforcement as their only focus.\n\nWith enhanced fire danger this week, Winger said he hopes people are smart this Fourth of July.\n\n\"We ask the community to be very cautious, even using safe and sane fireworks in these current conditions, let alone illegal fireworks. Our resources are stretched very thin. There's fires occurring all over northern California right now,\" Winder said.\n\nWinger recommends calling the non-emergency line of the local police jurisdiction or using the local online reporting system to report illegal fireworks.

In his research, Withington found Philadelphia was one of the many key cities in developing fireworks. From the United States' first Independence Day on July 4, 1776, to modern day displays of skies lit with colorful lights, fireworks have maintained a history in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania as a whole.\n\nAhead of July Fourth, Withington spoke with The Inquirer to discuss the creation of the book, the history of fireworks, and the important role Philadelphia played in their development.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIt came out of a discussion with my publisher. He pointed out that there had not been a comprehensive history of fireworks since about 1949, and that even that had not really been a world history. I had always wanted to write a history of an everyday thing with which we were all familiar so this seemed the perfect opportunity.\n\nI was inspired by memories of when I was growing up in Manchester, England, in the 1950s. Fireworks then meant \"Bonfire Night,\" 5 November, when people celebrated the failure of the Gunpowder Plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605, by letting off fireworks and burning a \"guy\" -- an effigy of the conspirator Guy Fawkes. In those days I never saw fireworks at private celebrations such as birthdays or weddings, or even on New Year's Eve. It took me about three years to research and write.\n\nOn 3 July 1776, the day before the Declaration of Independence, John Adams, who would become the United States' second president, wrote to his wife that the next day would be \"the most memorable in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival,\" to be marked with parades, bonfires, and what he called \"illuminations.\" In other words fireworks.\n\nOn 4 July 1776, the War of Independence was still being fought, and the celebrations were pretty muted, with a couple of dozen rockets being set off in Philadelphia. The following year, despite continued hostilities, the city of the Liberty Bell put on a much bigger show, including, according to the Virginia Gazette, \"a grand exhibition of fireworks, which began and concluded with thirteen rockets on the commons, and the city was beautifully illuminated.\" Boston and other cities rejoiced too, and the tradition of fireworks on 4 July was firmly established. By 1783 ordinary folk were starting to hold their own celebrations, with a Philadelphia merchant, advertising \"a large and curious assortment of fireworks\" for sale.\n\nIn 1876 leading British pyrotechnist Charles Brock put on four displays at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. According to Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, this \"far surpassed anything of the kind seen in this country.\" The climax was a barrage of 2,000 large rockets ... The Fourth of July display attracted more than a quarter of a million people.\n\nNot everyone was thrilled that Independence Day came to mean fireworks. A Pennsylvania man confided to his diary in 1866: \"4 July is the most hateful day of the year, when the birth of democracy is celebrated by license and noise.\" There were stories of fireworks being thrown at horses or put under milk bottles or flowerpots so the explosion flung out nasty shrapnel. Around the same time, in Philadelphia, it was said that \"as a general rule, 30 or 40 houses are set afire every 4 July.\"\n\nOn 4 July 1903, 466 people were killed in firework accidents and nearly 4,000 injured. ... The Playground Association of America noted, \"The killed and injured at the battle of Bunker Hill were only 1,474 as compared with 1,622 killed and injured while celebrating Fourth of July in 1909.\" In 1903 a Pennsylvania lawyer named Charles Pennypacker [who is from West Chester] had decided to do something about it.\" He urged people to move to a \"quiet and sane\" celebration, suggesting that rather than letting off fireworks, they should pass \"a quiet day under the trees\" or bake a nice cake, and spend their money on \"sandwiches instead of squibs.\" According to a local newspaper, young men in his area \"resented\" his initiative, and at midnight on July 3, 1904, a \"large number gathered outside his house with Roman candles and other fireworks and created merry hell for the next fifteen minutes.\"\n\nBut across America, Pennypacker's ideas inspired the movement for a \"Safe and Sane Fourth.\" The year he spoke out, the mayor of Chicago banned the discharges of fireworks, firecrackers, gunpowder, or other explosives in any alley, backyard, or other confined space. Cannon crackers got a complete ban, as did firearms, dynamite and putting explosives on the tracks of any street railway.\n\nThe story of fireworks from their mysterious origins as a by-product of the search for eternal life to the pyrotechnic spectaculars of today.\n\nHow they appeared in Europe in the 14th century, enlivening state occasions such as coronations, as royal families competed for star pyrotechnists with big money. ... In the 19th [century], they would conquer the British Empire, being carried through jungles on the heads of porters to reach its most remote corners, while colors got brighter and more vivid, and fads like \"living fireworks\" emerged. The 20th century saw the computer revolution that has brought today's breathtaking shows televised across the globe with ever-more-audacious effects.\n\nAnd fireworks are not just for fun. They have been deployed on battlefields for centuries, while in peacetime, they have been used to rescue wrecked mariners, deliver mail, or even prevent hail storms. But they can also be dangerous, and they have been at the center of many accidents. Now they also face new challenges, with growing concern over pollution and the effect they have on animals.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia

Your city or town might have an officially sanctioned display, but it might not be legal to purchase certain fireworks in your state. If you live in Massachusetts, private citizens are prohibited from even possessing fireworks. It might sound fun to be a smuggler for a day, but just hear me out before you grab your keys and head out the door.\n\nYes, plenty of people move fireworks across state lines from sea to shining sea. A supervisor at New Hamshire fireworks store told NHPR:\n\n\"People come up from Massachusetts, they come up from Connecticut, and they come up from New York. They'll come up, they'll buy stuff, and then once it hits nighttime, even though it's illegal, cops can't see the fireworks in your car, so then they get back down.\"\n\nNow, I promise you that I'm not a cop, but there are dangers and consequences to moving explosives in your car. You can simply get caught by police, like a 22-year-old man in Massachusetts last year. According to WBTS, the 2019 Infiniti SUV was pulled over by the Massachusetts State Police for canceled insurance and the trooper saw over 64 packages of fireworks in the vehicle. The potential legal penalty for fireworks possession in the Bay State is fairly lenient, a fine of up to $100 and confiscation of the contraband.\n\nThe most immediate danger is crashing the car. Earlier this year in North Carolina, a multi-car pileup on I-95 was complicated by a vehicle filled to the brim with fireworks. Eight cars were involved in the blaze and six people were injured, the Daily Record reported. The local fire department ran out of water attempting to put out the inferno and switched to carbon dioxide extinguishers in a last-gasp effort as they waited for aid from another department.\n\nThe trend these days is towards relaxation of bans. Nineteen states have loosened fireworks laws since 2009, NPR reports, and with less regulation comes less smuggling. So please enjoy Independence Day responsibly and handle your legally procured explosives with care. Don't go breaking any laws and don't attack a city bus with fireworks like people did during a street takeover in Los Angeles earlier this week.", "source": {"uri": "jalopnik.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jalopnik"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBTS-CD", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WBTS-CD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Explosive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trooper_(police_rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trooper (police rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smuggling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraband", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contraband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_95", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 95"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fire department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Gifts_in_Kind", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Gifts in Kind", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/5c2c37f7e50adf42a34d782e0caf1eea.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705348", "eventUri": "eng-9705348", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Utahans are no different as folks are looking for that breathtaking magic moment. Some will take part in parades, while others will rest before the big night of flashes and patriotic sounds.\n\nAre the best fireworks in the West in Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, Denver, or another unknown location? We'll get back to that answer in a moment. However, it's always important to practice safety when celebrating the Fourth of July.\n\nAs we approach the season of Independence Day celebrations, it's important to remember that while most will have the day off to enjoy food, fun, parades, and fireworks, attempting an amateur fireworks show can be extremely dangerous. \ufffc\n\nIt's best to leave it to the professionals. No one wants to end up at the emergency room because of a dumb mistake.\n\nMost cities, and even some small towns, have an official fireworks show. These events are not just about the fireworks but also about coming together as a community to celebrate our nation's independence.\n\nMost believe that big states like Washington, California, Texas, or Arizona would have the most impressive fireworks shows west of the Mississippi. Big cities like Seattle, Portland, Dallas, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Francisco pride themselves on holding unrivaled shows of splash and dash. Let's not forget Denver and Salt Lake City when we're examining who has the best fireworks show in the West.\n\nHowever, none of these large cities can rival a small town whose population doubles, if not triples, during its Fourth of July Independence Day Celebrations. The celebrations are free to all who attend, and the details of this amazing fireworks show are unmatched in the Western United States.\n\nThis show will feature 18,505 fireworks for over thirty-one minutes. Can any show in the country say they're shooting 597 shells per minute? You can do the math or believe us when we report there are 9.9 fireworks every second.\n\nThe crowd for this event is expected to once again exceed two hundred thousand Patriots. It takes a long time to create the fireworks and coordinate their firings safely and on time.\n\nIf you live in Idaho, you have a short drive to the 31st Annual Melaleuca Freedom Celebration in Idaho Falls. The fireworks show has been recognized nationally for its incredible, mind-blowing displays of explosives coordinated with patriotic music. (Don't worry about not being able to hear the music; there'll be over one hundred speakers to make sure you don't miss a synchronized beat.)\n\n\"The Melaleuca Freedom Celebration is more than just entertainment on the Fourth of July,\" said Melaleuca Executive Chairman Frank VanderSloot. \"The combination of fireworks, music, and message provides magical moments of reflection and an opportunity to re-pledge allegiance to the flag representing our nation. On a different level, it's a heartfelt, unifying event for the community -- but more importantly, it's a tribute of gratitude to America's heroes.\"\n\nYou won't miss the exciting conclusion featuring red, white, and blue stars and a thunderous visual display. If you live anywhere in the West, hopping in your car for a quick trip to Idaho Falls is still time. Here's a link to all the details.", "source": {"uri": "kidotalkradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KIDO Talk Radio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_miller@kidotalkradio.com", "name": "Kevin

Illegal should mean illegal | Opinion", "body": "Sometimes, the Idaho Legislature does the right thing.\n\nTake, for instance, the Fireworks Act of 1997, which allows non-aerial fireworks, so-called safe and sane fireworks, but bans aerial fireworks.\n\nWhy would legislators ban aerial fireworks?\n\nIt's because we live in a dry, high-desert climate, prone to wildfires, and such aerial fireworks pose a giant risk.\n\nTo wit:\n\nThe Boise Fire Department responded to 25 fireworks-caused fires on the Fourth of July last year. The Idaho Falls Fire Department responded to 15 fireworks-related blazes.\n\nAnd yet, Ada County Commissioner Ryan Davidson, for the fourth year in a row, voted against Ada County's ordinance banning all fireworks in unincorporated areas of the county.\n\n\"I don't believe in banning fireworks, and I generally don't think the ban accomplishes what it sets out to because fires occur even with the ban, so that's why, for America, I will vote against this fireworks ban,\" Davidson said during a commission meeting on June 11.\n\nBased on that logic -- to use the term ultra-loosely -- Ada County commissioners should start working to get rid of speed limits, red lights, loitering and noise ordinances, and a slew of other things.\n\nFortunately, Ada County's fireworks ordinance did pass, thanks to the votes of Commissioners Tom Dayley and Rod Beck.\n\n\"Well, I think it does provide safety for the community,\" Dayley said in support of the measure. \"Obviously, no matter what law we pass or ordinance we pass, people can violate it and have consequences as a result of the violation.\"\n\nFor those of you who are planning to set off illegal aerial fireworks July 4, as the Idaho Statesman's Nicole Blanchard clarified in a story this week, illegal fireworks are -- well, illegal.\n\nIt's also, according to the Idaho Attorney General's Office, illegal to sell those illegal aerial fireworks being sold by the thousands.\n\nThat waiver that you sign saying you won't set off the fireworks in Idaho is just made up, likely for the liability protection of the people selling you the fireworks.\n\nAs a wise editorial writer once wrote, that would be like buying marijuana at the corner store in Idaho as long as you signed a piece of paper saying you won't smoke it in Idaho. Yeah, right.\n\nIllegal means illegal.\n\nAnd yet, every year, the skies over the Treasure Valley are lit up like hundreds of Christmas trees, sparks raining down with the potential to cause disaster.\n\nIt's mind-boggling when all of Southwest Idaho has so many spectacular and sanctioned -- and legal -- fireworks shows.\n\nWe (sort of) get it that people enjoy aerial fireworks year after year after year, and love setting them off from the comfort and convenience of the public street in front of their house.\n\nIf you enjoy it so much, though, go to the Legislature and get the Fireworks Act of 1997 repealed.\n\nUntil then, it's illegal. And fortunately, in unincorporated Ada County, it's illegal to set off any and all fireworks, because of the inherent risks.\n\nFor public safety and preventing devastating fires, abstaining from fireworks -- especially aerial ones -- is the right thing to do.\n\nIt's also the law.\n\nStatesman editorials are the unsigned opinion of the Idaho Statesman's editorial board.

Moreover, a huge majority takes place in the weeks right before and after the festive Fourth of July. Children are involved in roughly 30% of cases.\n\nTo keep the eyes protected, using eye protection is necessary. Moreover, the location of the fireworks lighting should also have an available water supply. The fireworks should also not be close to vehicles, houses, woodpiles, or flammable liquids.\n\nIndividuals who experience eye injuries should be brought to the emergency room.\n\nALSO READ: Independence Day: Fourth of July Fireworks Could Cause PTSD; Here's How to Cope Up After Celebration\n\nEar Protection\n\nThough fireworks can be a visual feat, they are incredibly loud. They can also lead to pain and even hearing damage.\n\nAccording to Leigh Ann Reel, the director of the Center of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research at the TTUHSC, noise-induced hearing loss can result from prolonged or moderate exposure to noise that exceeds 85 decibels. Fireworks greatly exceed this level, with sounds going up to 140 to 160 decibels.\n\nThe director advises watching fireworks from a distance of at least 500 feet. If a person is closer than this distance, hearing protection is necessary, especially for the individual handling the fireworks.\n\nChild and infant safety should also be considered. Infants should not be exposed to fireworks in any situation.\n\nSince the sound is strengthened in small spaces, such as the tiny ear canals of infants, they have a higher risk of hearing damage compared to adolescents and adults.\n\nHeat Safety\n\nExcessive sun exposure could lead to heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Children are also particularly susceptible to overheating.\n\nTo stay safe amidst the heat during Fourth of July festivities, the American Red Cross recommends slowing down or limiting activities outdoors and staying hydrated.\n\nChildren should have much water supply and be dressed in loose, lightweight, and light-colored clothes. If they exhibit signs of overheating, they should be brought inside.\n\nFor people who are celebrating the Fourth of July in areas where it is legal to buy and use consumer fireworks, they should never allow children to handle fireworks.\n\nMoreover, individuals should also never use fireworks if they have taken either drugs or alcohol. They must also never re-light fireworks that appear to malfunction.\n\nIt is also crucial to keep a nearby water supply when lighting fireworks this Fourth of July in order to extinguish sparks that don't stop or that grow to become full-blown fires.", "source": {"uri": "sciencetimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Science Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kendra_stacy@sciencetimes.com", "name": "Kendra Stacy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ophthalmology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hearing loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decibel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_protection_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hearing protection device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise-induced_hearing_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noise-induced hearing loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exhaustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat exhaustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ear canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Children_and_Adolescents", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Children and Adolescents", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning_and_Stains", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning and Stains", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://1721181113.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/54659/820/0/0/0/fireworks-go-off-across-los-angeles-on-fourth-of-july.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705348", "eventUri": "eng-9705348", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

But before you light up the sky, let's make sure you're keeping it safe.\n\nWhether you're celebrating in the city, chilling in the countryside, or kicking back in the suburbs, these fireworks safety tips will keep your day lit without any mishaps.\n\n1. Know the Rules: Cities often have strict rules on fireworks. Avoid fines and keep it legal by checking out your local laws. When in doubt, hit up a public fireworks show.\n\n2. Use Safe Spaces: If you can use fireworks, find a big open spot away from buildings, cars, and crowds. Parking lots or parks can work.\n\n3. Be a Good Neighbor: Keep the noise down if you can. Remember, your neighbors might have pets, babies, or might not love the loud bangs as much as you do.\n\n4. Stay Ready: Keep a bucket of water or a hose nearby just in case something catches fire. Better safe than sorry.\n\n1. Check Local Restrictions: Fire season is real in the countryside. Always check local fire restrictions before lighting anything up.\n\n2. Clear the Area: Make sure there's no dry grass, leaves, or anything that can catch fire. Open fields are perfect.\n\n3. Think About The Wildlife: Animals don't love fireworks as much as we do. Choose spots that won't stress out local wildlife or livestock.\n\n4. Have Water Handy: Bring big water tanks or lots of buckets. If a fire starts, you'll need to put it out fast.\n\n1. Respect the Rules: Suburbs usually have their own fireworks rules. Make sure you know what's cool and what's not.\n\n2. Pick a Safe Spot: Light fireworks in open areas away from homes, trees, and power lines. Your driveway or backyard can work if it's big enough.\n\n3. Watch the Kids: Keep kids at a safe distance and always supervise them. Sparklers are fun but can still burn.\n\n4. Clean Up: After the show, soak used fireworks in water before tossing them out. Prevent any sneaky fires.\n\n- Read the Manual: Always read and follow the instructions on the fireworks.\n\n- Stay Sober: Handle fireworks responsibly. Save the drinks for after the show.\n\n- Suit Up: Wear safety glasses and keep your face and body away from fireworks when lighting them.\n\n- Step Back: After lighting a firework, move back quickly to a safe distance.\n\n- Don't Relight Duds: If a firework doesn't go off, don't try to relight it. Wait 20 minutes and then soak it in water.\n\n- Keep Pets Inside: Fireworks can scare pets.

Why do we commemorate Independence Day by setting off thousands of small explosions?\n\nBecause John Adams wanted us to. Before the Declaration of Independence was even signed, he envisioned fireworks as a part of the festivities. In a letter to Abigail Adams on July 3, 1776, he wrote that the occasion should be commemorated \"with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.\" The first commemorative Independence Day fireworks were set off on July 4, 1777. The Pennsylvania Evening Post wrote that in Philadelphia, \"The evening was closed with the ring of bells, and at night there was a grand exhibition of fireworks (which began and concluded with thirteen rockets) on the Commons, and the city was beautifully illuminated.\" The paper noted that \"Everything was conducted with the greatest order and decorum, and the face of joy and gladness was universal.\" That same year, fireworks also lit up the sky in Boston, where they were exhibited by Col. Thomas Crafts over the common. By 1783 a large variety of fireworks were available to the public. In 1784 one merchant offered a range of pyrotechnics that included \"rockets, serpents, wheels, table rockets, cherry trees, fountains, and sun flowers.\"\n\nWhile some historians have suggested that India first invented fireworks, modern fireworks seem to have come to the West by way of China. Most early fireworks were simply repurposed military munitions, fired for entertainment rather than to frighten or kill the enemy. In the 12 century, the Chinese improved the burning fire arrow (a long-established weapon) by affixing small packs of gunpowder to it. From there it was not long before they invented rockets, simply stuffing a container with gunpowder and leaving a hole in one end for propulsion. These \"ground-rats\" or \"fire-rats,\" as they were called, were wildly unpredictable, however, and while this made them less effective, it did contribute to their entertainment value. These rockets made their palace hall debut when emperor Li Tsung brought them before the empress Kung Sheng, but when one scurried up to her, she gathered up her skirts and brought the feast to a halt. During the Renaissance, fireworks became popular in Europe and were used in nationalist and imperialist celebrations by figures like Peter the Great and Louis XIV, who were especially big fans of the pyrotechnics.\n\nTradition alone, of course, does not explain the popularity of fireworks here and abroad. As with many festive decorations, including streamers, confetti, festival lights, and balloons, people often appreciate them simply for their bright colors. Others may appreciate the technical ingenuity and the choreography that goes into the show. And others just like dramatic loud noises, the sense of destruction, and the thrill of danger. Over time, fireworks shows can bring back memories of other festive occasions and warm summer nights. On the other hand, there are the occasional fireworks haters.\n\nGot a question about today's news?

LOUIS (AP) -- The Fourth of July is Americana at its core: parades and cookouts and cold beer and, of course, fireworks.\n\nThose pyrotechnics also make it an especially dangerous holiday, typically resulting in more than 10,000 trips to the emergency room. Yet fireworks remain at the center of Independence Day, a holiday 247 years in the making.\n\nHere are five things to know about July Fourth, including the origin of the holiday and how fireworks became part of the tradition.\n\nWHAT'S THE ORIGIN OF INDEPENDENCE DAY?\n\nThe holiday celebrates the Second Continental Congress' unanimous adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, a document announcing the colonies' separation from Great Britain.\n\nOne year later, according to the Library of Congress, a spontaneous celebration in Philadelphia marked the anniversary of American independence.\n\nBut across the burgeoning nation, observations didn't become commonplace until after the War of 1812. It quickly took off: The Library of Congress notes that major historic events in the 19th century, such as groundbreaking ceremonies for the Erie Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, were scheduled to coincide with Fourth of July festivities.\n\nHOW DID FIREWORKS BECAME A JULY FOURTH TRADITION?\n\nThe display of pyrotechnics has been a big part of Independence Day from the outset. Founding Father John Adams saw it coming.\n\nCommemoration of America's independence \"ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more,\" Adams wrote in a letter to his wife, Abigail, dated July 3, 1776.\n\nFireworks were around centuries before America became a nation. The American Pyrotechnics Association says many historians believe fireworks were first developed in the second century B.C. in ancient China by throwing bamboo stalks into fires, causing explosions as the hollow air pockets overheated.\n\nBy the 15th century, fireworks were widely used for religious festivals and public entertainment in Europe and early U.S. settlers carried on those traditions, the association said.\n\nHAS A PRESIDENT EVER REFUSED TO CELEBRATE?\n\nPresidents from George Washington to Joe Biden have celebrated the nation's birth on the Fourth of July, with one exception: Adams.\n\nHis letter to his wife aside, Adams refused to celebrate the holiday on July 4 because he felt July 2 was the real Independence Day. Why? It was on July 2, 1776, that the Continental Congress voted in favor of the resolution for independence, though the Declaration of Independence wasn't formally adopted until two days later.\n\nAdams was so adamant that he turned down invitations to festivals and other events, even while serving as the nation's second president. Ironically, Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, both died on the 50th anniversary of the document's formal adoption, July 4, 1826.\n\nHOW POPULAR ARE FIREWORKS?\n\nConsumer sales of fireworks have grown rapidly over the past two decades.\n\nStatistics from the American Pyrotechnics Association show that in 2000, American consumers spent $407 million on fireworks. By 2022, that figure rose to $2.3 billion. The biggest jump came during the COVID-19 pandemic, when public fireworks displays were shut down. Consumer sales jumped from $1 billion in 2019 to $1.9 billion in 2020.\n\n\"People went to the fireworks store beginning Memorial Day weekend and they just didn't stop,\" said Julie Heckman, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association. \"They were firing off fireworks all of 2020. It shocked the industry, to be quite honest with you.\"\n\nSales are expected to rise another $100 million this year, the association said. It helps that the Fourth of July is on a Tuesday, creating essentially a four-day weekend.\n\nARE FIREWORKS DANGEROUS?\n\nDespite widespread education efforts, thousands of Americans are badly injured by fireworks each year, and this year is no exception.\n\nLate Saturday night, firefighters and medics were called to Lexington Township, a suburb of Kansas City, Kansas, for reports of a shed on fire and arrived to find fireworks actively exploding from the burning shed and several people lying injured on the ground. Firefighters, medics and local police dragged the victims from the area to safety, and four people were taken to hospitals -- two with serious injuries, Northwest Consolidated Fire District Chief Todd Maxton said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reports that in 2022, 10,200 people were treated at emergency rooms and 11 deaths were blamed on fireworks. About three-quarters of injuries happened in the period around the Fourth of July.\n\nAbout one-third of the injuries were to the head, face, ears or eyes. Finger, hand and leg injuries are common, too.\n\n\"I have seen people who have blown off fingers,\" said Dr. Tiffany Osborn, an emergency room physician at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. \"I've seen people who have lost eyes. I've seen people who have significant facial injuries.\"\n\nChildren under 15 make up nearly one-third of those injured by fireworks. Sparklers often are blamed for burns to children under age 5. Osborn suggested giving small children glow sticks or colorful streamers instead.\n\nFor those planning to shoot off fireworks, Heckman urged finding a flat, hard, level surface away from structures and other things that could catch fire. The person responsible for the fireworks should avoid alcohol. Children should never ignite them.\n\nOsborn encouraged having a bucket or hose nearby in case of fire or explosion. Shoot off one at a time and walk away quickly after igniting, she said, and never relight or handle a malfunctioned firework. When done, shovel up the remains and soak them before disposing.", "source": {"uri": "wowo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WOWO 1190 AM | 107.5 FM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He said it's an annual tradition for dozens of friends to gather along the waterfront. \"For the 3rd, everybody literally comes back down here to celebrate.\"\n\nBut this year's party looks a lot different for Chancellor and his friends, some of whom travel home from across the country for Milwaukee's fireworks celebration.\n\nThis year, he told us, \"It's not the same. We do this all day in anticipation of the fireworks at the end, but now it's not the same.\"\n\nA lot of people shared in Chancellor's disappointment, like Sharon Johnson of Milwaukee, who said, \"I'm very upset about this. Because I have grandkids that would love to see the fireworks.\"\n\nEdward Hale moved away for 12 years but recently moved back, looking forward to reconnecting with Milwaukee's traditions.\n\nHale said, \"I came back to a lot of changes, some good, some bad. But this one is one of the bad ones. I love the fireworks.\"\n\nPeople told us it not only feels different this year, but it also looks very different: there are no crowds in the prime viewing locations.\n\nSome said that in years past, they've had to camp out starting at midnight the day before just to get a spot in the best locations.\n\nBut the lakefront wasn't completely empty. People still walked along the water, flew kites, and went to the beer garden.\n\nAnd not everyone is bothered by the cancellation.\n\nSelf-described introvert Fatima Gomez told us, \"It's kind of nice to have a nice summer day in the park where there's a place to be where there's not a ton of people.\"\n\nStill, most people wished someone had stepped up to foot the bill to ensure a decades-long tradition could continue.\n\nCharles Lawler of Shorewood was at the beer garden at War Memorial Park. He'd gone to the fireworks for years since childhood.\n\nBut Wednesday he lamented, \"What's the holiday? There's no holiday here. There's nothing special about it. It's just lifeless.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, the parks department estimated the cost of the fireworks celebration topped $370,000. They also said there's a good chance the fireworks will not return at all in the future.", "source": {"uri": "cbs58.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS58"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hale_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edward Hale (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDJT-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WDJT-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beer garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorewood,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shorewood, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shorewood, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://newscdn2.weigelbroadcasting.com/3zqAx-1720060907-281972-blog-1000P_AR%20NO%20JULY%203%20FIRE_WDJTFXEZ.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705348", "eventUri": "eng-9705348", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

(FOX5) - As the nation celebrates the Fourth of July, fireworks will light up the night but in Clark County many of them will be illegal. Only \"safe and sane\" fireworks are allowed.\n\nMetro police have been cracking down on illegal fireworks in the valley, so far this year issuing more than 130 citations. Between the city and county 15,000 pounds of fireworks have been confiscated, more than ever before.\n\n\"It just seems like every year the problem continues to get worse,\" shared Scott Thompson, Fire Inspector for Las Vegas Fire and Rescue. That despite fines being up this year, at minimum $500 a pop. The City of Las Vegas alone has filled nearly an entire shipping container with the illegal explosives seized.\n\n\"I think people just see people doing it and they think it is okay,\" Thompson reported.\n\nSo, what happens to all those confiscated illegal fireworks? Thompson explained hazardous materials can't be shipped off to a landfill.\n\n\"Fireworks are an explosive so they need to be treated as such. You can't just dump them. You can't just blow them up because you can cause injury, you can cause wildland fires. If you are going to destroy them, they have to be at an armory... It is that serious,\" Thompson contended.\n\nOne 55 gallon drum of hazardous waste can cost $10,000 to dispose of. Clark County and the cities within it have entered an agreement with local wholesalers TNT and Phantom Fireworks and will re-sell everything taken in.\n\n\"At the end of the season, they take all the illegal fireworks, and they pay us pennies on the pound... They are taken to a distribution center in a state that does not touch Nevada,\" Thompson revealed.\n\nBy participating in this program taxpayers are saved tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars every year in disposal costs. The money made also covers future firework enforcement which there is also more of this Fourth of July.\n\nYou can make sure you are buying legal fireworks and supporting local nonprofits at the same time by buying from booths within the valley.\n\nThe booth in the parking lot of Smiths in Cadence in Henderson is supporting the Pinecrest Cadence Marching Band. They will be open through the Fourth of July until 11:59pm.\n\nYou can also find fireworks for sale at locations other than TNT and Phantom Fireworks booths, but make sure they have the \"safe and sane\" label on them.\n\nThompson suggested always keeping a bucket of water or hose nearby when setting off legal fireworks just in case they spark a fire.", "source": {"uri": "fox5vegas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.fox5vegas.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Thompson_(comedian)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scott Thompson (comedian)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_(container)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drum (container)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_container", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shipping container"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_goods", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dangerous goods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazardous_waste", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hazardous waste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_band", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marching band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://gray-kvvu-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/WIH3CE4GRBEWLKY5XHQBQTMNCM.png?auth=2e473de687999e0034b5a69ba788dba4859bbfa414051f73d85e349b3e97be6a&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705348", "eventUri": "eng-9705348", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The eye care professionals are reemphasizing the potential damage to eyesight when even lighting what seem like less dangerous fireworks.\n\n\"Most people just don't see the harm in sparklers, spinners, firecrackers, and bottle rockets, and they learn too late the necessity of wearing eye protection,\" said Dianna Seldomridge, clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.\n\n\"It's best to leave fireworks to the professionals. But if you choose to celebrate with fireworks, wear safety goggles and take all the necessary precautions to keep your family safe.\"\n\nThe eye care organizations are also reminding Americans that there are plenty of myths about fireworks. And they're looking to dispel those myths on Independence Day.\n\nHere are just some of the reminders from the eye care medical professionals:\n\n-- Myth 1: Consumer fireworks are harmless. Fireworks can cause blinding eye injuries such as chemical and thermal burns, corneal abrasions or retinal detachment. If you live in a state where consumer fireworks are legal and have plans to use them, wear eye protection.\n\n-- Myth 2: Sparklers are made for kids and aren't dangerous. Don't let their small size fool you; sparklers burn at more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That's hot enough to melt certain metals.\n\n-- Myth 3: Duds are harmless. Malfunctioning fireworks should be handled with caution. Never look down the barrel of a firework and make sure to point it away from others. Do not try to relight faulty fireworks. Instead, soak it in water and throw the dud away.\n\n-- Myth 4: Only those handling the fireworks are at risk. The majority of firework-related eye injuries happen to bystanders. Watch fireworks from at least 500 feet away and make sure everyone is wearing eye protection.\n\n\"Last year, more than 6,000 fireworks-related injuries were treated in U.S. emergency rooms around the Fourth of July period and eyes are among the parts of the body most often injured,\" said Megan Scott Carlton, a member of the Florida Society of Ophthalmology board and owner of Palm Valley Eye Care & Surgeons in Ponte Vedra Beach.\n\n\"There are many myths surrounding consumer fireworks and it is important to understand all the risks before deciding on how to celebrate Independence Day this year.\"", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

By observing these essential safety guidelines, you can guarantee a safe and happy Fourth of July for everyone.\"\n\nPatronis' office, which recorded two Fourth of July Safety PSA videos and a pair of audio-only clips, is recommending that Floridians abide by these four Independence Day safety tips:\n\n-- Consider attending a professional fireworks show rather than using fireworks at home. \"The best opportunity to protect yourself from firework injuries is to let a trained professional handle the fireworks,\" his office said.\n\n-- Light one firework/sparkler at a time, and never relight a dud. \"If too many fireworks are lit at one time,\" Patronis' office said, \"it can cause confusion about which ones are active, leading to possible injury or fire. Also, dudes can malfunction and explode improperly if you try to relight them.\"\n\n-- Keep a fire extinguisher nearby. \"Be careful of how you dispose of fireworks and sparklers, and make sure you always have a fire extinguisher or water hose on hand. Once fireworks have stopped working, they are still extremely hot and need to be cooled off with water or a fire extinguisher so they can be disposed of properly.\"\n\n-- Be smart around the grill. \"If cooking with propane, always check the tank hose and connections for leaks before turning on the grill. Keep the grill away from homes, overhanging branches, and decks. Put pets on leashes and make sure children are supervised when grilling.\"\n\nClick here to view more fireworks safety tips from the National Safety Council.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

Then they take to the water and shoot the fireworks from the lake.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n\"Safety has got to be number one. Cleaning the tubes out is our first step. I go by and check every time before we start getting power to it just to make sure that it's all hooked up properly.

Roasting a bamboo stalk in a fire would cause a loud bang when the air pocket in the hollow bamboo expanded and exploded. One Chinese legend tells of Nian, the word meaning year, a frightening monster that appeared on the night before Chinese New Years Eve. Nian ate people and destroyed crops. When the Chinese people discovered that Nian feared fire and loud noises, they began using bamboo firecrackers to scare away the New Year's monster.\n\n\"Firecrackers in Honor of the Kitchen God\" is a painting made in China in 1930. Although it is not a piece of ancient art, it illustrates the significance firecrackers played. The Chinese belief system grew to include monsters who were said to be afraid of fire, sparks, loud noises, bright lights, the color red, and smoke. Firecrackers were used to drive away bad luck and scare evil spirits. The smoke made Yang energy, a positive life energy. Strings of firecrackers became popular during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) when an alchemist accidentally discovered gunpower while trying to make the elixir of life. By the Song Dynasty (960-1279), gunpowder packed in a paper roll with a tissue paper fuse resembled modern fireworks.\n\nOne of the most popular fireworks in China continues to be the firecracker, composed of several small firecrackers strung together. \"Firecrackers in Honor of the Kitchen God\" (1930) is a painting of the man of the family holding a string of red firecrackers on a pole. A single red firecracker, placed on a rock in the garden, shoots high into the air. The women and children of the family look on from a window with varying degrees of surprise. A woman in the garden comforts a frightened child who clings to her. Another little boy is having a great time. Use of fireworks expanded rapidly beyond driving away evil spirits and protecting the many Chinese gods to celebrating weddings, births, birthdays, moving to a new house, opening businesses, to name a few.\n\nGunpowder made its way from China to the rest of Asia and to Europe by the 13th Century through missionaries and European diplomats. Europeans developed muskets, cannons, and advanced the development of fireworks. Aerial fireworks were limited to the color of orange. Firemasters and their assistants, known as green men, set off the fireworks. \"The Green Men\" (1634) is the cover for The Second Booke, a guide to making and using fireworks. The green men were so-called because they wore fresh green leaves on their heads and clothing to protect themselves from the sparks, Before the celebration, they told jokes while they prepared for the display. The profession was dangerous, and many green men were injured or died when the fireworks malfunctioned.\n\n\"For his Grace the Duke of Richmond at Whitehall on the River Thames, on Monday, 15 May 1749'' (hand colored etching) is a depiction of the fireworks display dedicated to King George II upon his signing the Treaty of Aix la Chapelle in 1748, ending the War of the Australian Succession. The fireworks presentation was produced by the Ruggieri family, five Italian brothers, who pioneered dramatic firework productions for European and other royalty. The event was produced by the Ruggieri brothers, who moved from Italy to France at the invitation of King Louis XV. They mounted fireworks on moving and fixed iron armatures to be set off during the theatrical performance. The fireworks depicted here were still limited to one color, orange. However, the armatures were used to create different shapes as depicted on the borders of the print. Later the Ruggieri brothers introduced color into fireworks with a more spectacular effect. The Ruggieri family business continues in France today.\n\nKing George II commissioned a German composer, who settled in London in 1712, to create music to accompany this celebration. The composer was George Frideric Handel (1685-1759) and the music was titled Music for the Royal Fireworks. The work continues to be a popular accompaniment to fireworks today.\n\nFireworks displays were loved by rulers world-wide, and the Ruggieri family provided many of them. The ''Pyrotechnic Celebration following Napoleon's Marriage to Marie Louise'' (1821) (broadside print) is a depiction of the event hosted by the City of Paris. The wedding celebration lasted for the month in June in 1810. This print by Pierre Benard describes the final act of this performance that took place on June 14, 1810, at the residence of Princess Paulina Borghese at the Palais De Neuilly. The event consisted of three acts and employed over 500 actors. It began with a mock battle that took place between the two large columns. The ship City of Paris arrived and anchored between the two forts which erupted with fireworks. The second act of the performance concentrated on the Temple of Peace at the center of the composition. The seated figure inside, wearing gold robes, is most probably a copy of the figure of Zeus in his temple at Olympus. There were fireworks. The third act took place at the Temple of Hymen, the Greek god of marriage, at the top of the mountain. A man and a women stand hand in hand at the front of the altar. And then there were more fireworks\n\nMakers of fireworks added strontium to create deep reds, barium for bright greens, copper for blues, and sodium for yellows. Modern fireworks were born in the 1830's. \"The Grand Display of Fireworks and Illuminations at the Opening of the Great Suspension Bridge between New York and Brooklyn on the Evening of May 24, 1883.\" (1883) (color lithograph) (12\"x17,5\") was published by Currier & Ives. Built by John Augustus Roebling, a German engineer, to connect Manhattan and Brooklyn, the Brooklyn Bridge was the longest suspension bridge at 1,595.5 feet The fireworks were set off from boats in the East River and from the tops of the two stone and concrete towers that stand 276.5 feet over the water. Fireworks were also set off from balloons. The event included canon fire. The view is from Manhattan looking toward Brooklyn\n\nPresident Chester A. Arthur and New York Mayor Franklin Edison made the first crossing as a part of the ceremony. They were greeted by Brooklyn Mayor Seth Low at the eastern end of the bridge. On the next day, 1,800 vehicles and 150,000 people crossed the bridge.\n\n\"This day will be most memorable in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival...It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, bonfires and illuminations [fireworks]...from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward forevermore.\" (John Adams's letter to his wife on July 2, 1776, two days before the Declaration of Independence was signed.)\n\nBeverly Hall Smith was a professor of art history for 40 years.

Then, the focus moves to our nation's capital for the National Independence Day Parade.\n\nAfter that, we'll get coverage from the West Coast when the Alameda, California parade kicks off before returning to Galveston, Texas.\n\nIn New York, the massive fireworks display will launch from the Hudson River - rather than the East River - for the first time in 10 years.\n\nA number of other shows are on the schedule, from Florida to Minnesota and out to California - and, of course, the big fireworks show in Washington, DC.\n\nHere's a look at the streaming schedule for LiveNOW from FOX, pending breaking news coverage. You can watch in the live player above.\n\nNote: We may not take each event in full, especially while simultaneous events are under way. And of course, each event is dependent on local weather.\n\nIndependence Day, informally called July 4th, marks America's independence from England. It was on July 4, 1776 that the Declaration of Independence was signed, announcing the United States of America as its own country - no longer 13 British colonies.\n\nRELATED: What's open and closed on July 4th\n\nThe Revolutionary War followed, culminating with Lord Cornwallis's surrender at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, and Britain formally recognized the independence of the United States via the Treaties of Paris in 1782 and 1783.\n\nIn addition to the large civic displays, many Americans like to fire off their own fireworks to celebrate Independence Day.\n\nWhile they are mesmerizing to watch and just downright fun to light up, they can also be very dangerous, so some states have limited their use. For example, in New York state, only sparkling devices (or sparklers) are legal for residents to use, however they are not legal in New York City or on Long Island.\n\nIn California, depending on the city or county in which you reside, fireworks could be illegal, especially since there is a risk of sparking a wildfire.\n\nRELATED: Are fireworks legal in your state?\n\nCheck your local town and

The Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region says across the country, more pets are lost on the 4th of July than any other day out of the year.\n\nData form the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission also shows that last year, eight people across the country died from firework-related injuries. Overall, nearly 10,000 people were hurt, and more than half were children.\n\n\"So, let's make sure that we're celebrating responsibly,\" said Caitlin Ford with Colorado Springs Police Department (CSPD).\n\nIn Colorado Springs, if a firework leaves the ground or explodes, it is not legal.\n\n\"Make sure you go to one of the numerous professional shows that we do have here in town. They're going to be great. They're going to be spectacular to go see those, leave those fireworks to the professionals, so that you can make sure to stay safe. We don't want to be responding to any burn calls, lost fingers, loss of hands,\" added Ford.\n\nHowever, depending on where you live or plan to celebrate, in Southern Colorado certain types of fireworks might be allowed, like sparklers, snakes, fountains, tanks, smoke bombs, spinning wheels and ground spinners.\n\nThe 4th of July is also a busy time for the Humane society of the Pikes Peak Region (HSPPR). The shelter said keeping animals safe means knowing your pet and their reactions to loud noises like fireworks.\n\n\"Dogs, you know, have much better hearing than us humans. So, when we hear the loud bangs, it's even scarier for our furry friends. And that's why it can be a lot more startling. And, you know, they don't know exactly what's going on. So, it can be a scary experience for them,\" said Cody Costra with HSPPR.\n\nHSPPR said if you're having people over, always watch the door and gates, and suggest keeping them in a quiet room with white noise or calm music. Also make sure to have your pet's tag on them.\n\n\"If you have a dog that either needs some medication or something that can help them calm down, that can be an option as well,\" added Costra.\n\nIt's also important to remember that pets are not the only ones sensitive to concussive sound. A study published by Penn Medicine News found that veterans struggle with firework celebrations from the inconsistent bright flashes and loud noises.\n\n\"You never know if a person might react badly to fireworks, or a dog. So, in that situation, you know, hopefully you know your neighbors pretty well and can check with them that, if it's okay to light off fireworks,\" said Costra.\n\nCSPD reminds the community not to call 911 to report any illegal fireworks, to ensure that the line is available for emergencies. Instead, they ask that you call their non-emergency line at 719-444-7000.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the days surrounding the Fourth of July are consistently the most common days for human-started fires, twice as many as on other summer days, all thanks to firework celebrations.\n\nThis data doesn't even include building or household fires. One such fire last week, caused by kids setting off illegal Roman candles, destroyed a 76-person apartment building in Washington, D.C. Luckily, no one was killed or seriously injured.\n\nAnd fireworks cause not just wildfires. In 2023 eight people died, and an estimated 9,700 people were treated in emergency rooms with firework-related injuries. Kids under the age of 19 -- predominantly teenage boys -- made up almost half of those injuries.\n\nIn many fire-prone states and cities, selling fireworks is already illegal. Municipal or state fireworks displays are still the best solution for a safe and exciting way to celebrate the holiday with your community. Since these professional displays still produce quite a bit of noise, pollution and trash on top of the fire risk, some places such as Napa Valley and Lake Tahoe in California have even opted to replace their fireworks celebrations with spectacular drone displays. Other communities should follow their lead.\n\nFireworks are fun.

Gavin Newsom signed the bill, which doubled the range of illegal firework fines. The maximum -- for possessing at least 5,000 pounds -- jumped from $50,000 to $100,000.\n\nAn earlier version of the bill set aside a portion of the state sales tax on \"safe and sane\" fireworks to fund increased statewide enforcement against illegal fireworks. The provision was removed, and that's when Revell came up with a new plan that he proposed to a fire marshal's advisory committee: California and Nevada should work together to stop illegal firework sales earlier.\n\nFirework stores in Nevada are already required to log information about their customers, including their ID. Through an interstate compact, Revell said, Nevada could require stores to put this information into a state database and alert California law enforcement when a California resident buys fireworks that are illegal here.\n\nThe proposal is now in Berlant's hands. He's reviewing it, and if it moves forward, Berlant will present it to Gov. Gavin Newsom's office, which would discuss it with Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo.\n\nNewsom has signed other interstate compacts, including a 2020 agreement with four Western states to curb COVID-19's effect on the economy and a 2022 deal with the governors of Oregon and Washington and the premier of British Columbia to combat climate change.\n\nBecause of this history, Revell said he thinks Newsom will be receptive to an agreement with Nevada. \"I wish there was a better solution, but it's the best we've been able to come up with given the circumstances that we're facing,\" Revell said.\n\nIf the compact requires approval from Nevada's legislature, it is out of session until 2025.\n\n\"We have a very short time window to try and accomplish this, and we fully expect that the majority of Nevada firework stores will fight that effort if it requires any legislation, because of the potential impact it could have on their business,\" Revell said.\n\nIn some California cities, fireworks are completely banned -- even those labeled \"safe and sane.\" Among these cities are Los Angeles, San Diego and Long Beach.\n\nLocated just outside Los Angeles, Vernon has only 222 residents, according to the 2020 Census. But Salazar -- treasurer of the Rotary Club of Rio Hondo-Vernon -- said his fireworks cart makes about $12,000 to $15,000 each year.\n\n\"Our advantage is we get a lot of people that come from the Valley, over there it's illegal,\" Salazar said. \"We're literally the first one off the freeways.\"\n\nSalazar said \"safe and sane\" fireworks should be legal throughout the state. Many TNT stands are operated by nonprofits -- such as the Rotary Club -- that split the proceeds with the company. Under AB 1403, cities that allow the sale of legal fireworks collect 7% of profits to put toward local efforts to combat illegal fireworks.\n\n\"Not only do you take away from most of the nonprofits in the area that could generate a decent amount of money and do some good in the community,\" Salazar said, \"but you're also losing that tax.\"\n\nOn the other hand, fireworks safety is always a concern.\n\nAnd state fire officials are warning Californians about the dangers of setting off fireworks in the middle of a triple-digit heat wave when the wildfire risk is already elevated. Red flag warnings are in place in seven California counties, and two wildfires broke out Tuesday morning in Northern California.\n\nIn Tuesday's press conference, state fire officials said that some \"safe and sane\" fireworks, such as sparklers, can get as hot as 12,000 degrees.\n\nCalifornians who use \"safe and sane\" fireworks this holiday should avoid setting them off near flammable objects or vegetation.\n\n\"The dry grass, the vegetation across the state, coupled with triple-digit temperatures and the wind is a perfect recipe for a disaster,\" Berlant said.", "source": {"uri":

Keep them away from small kids. Make sure it's always an adult lighting them. That's always our biggest thing that we try to preach,\" Smith said.\n\nHe adds that keeping a water hose handy just in case is also a good idea.\n\nAccording to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, 9,700 people went to the emergency room for fireworks injuries, and 8 people died from fireworks in 2023.\n\nIn the midst of the celebrations -- there are some ways to help keep your pets safe too.\n\n\"More dogs go missing on 4th of July than any other day of the year by far,\" Tammy Curtiss with the Wiregrass Humane Society said.\n\nHere's what Curtiss recommends:\n\n\"Bring them inside if there's any way you can.

We issue very few citations.", "body": "Fireworks explode all over the metro, as seen here from atop Ruby Hill. July 4, 2021.\n\nMost fireworks are illegal in Colorado, but you wouldn't know it if you've ever stood atop Ruby Hill on the Fourth of July. From there, any observer can see that the surrounding neighborhoods -- nay, the whole city -- erupt with color and flame on the big day. People who live nearby know the chorus of booms and bangs have been growing as the holiday inches closer.\n\nA Denverite reader wrote to us, requesting we ask the Denver Police Department why there isn't more enforcement on this issue. DPD sent us some data that confirms enforcement is low this time of year.\n\nThe department issued only four citations between June 15th and July 6th in 2023, and zero so far this year, as of Tuesday. 2017 was the top enforcement year in the numbers they shared, with 57 citations. These could be for anything from selling illegal explosives to just possessing them.\n\nIn contrast, 311 data shows the city can get as many as 416 complaints about fireworks in a single day -- that was the case in 2022.\n\nJay Casillas, a department spokesperson, said there are \"different challenges\" that might explain lower enforcement numbers.\n\n\"The large number of calls for service often do not provide much information to help officers locate the offender. A complainant, in many cases, is also required to be a witness that signs the complaint of the fireworks use and many are unwilling to do that. This makes it difficult for an officer to issue a citation, because if they do not witness the person lighting the firework, they cannot issue a citation,\" he wrote us in an email. \"Additionally, many complaints are not addressed due to the fact that officers are responding to other calls.\"\n\nYes, he confirmed, police usually have bigger fish to fry while the entire city parties around them.\n\n\"We try to address the fireworks complaints, but other calls might be more urgent and require more immediate police response,\" he said.\n\nBut Casillas also told us that officers try not to issue tickets.\n\n\"When it comes to possession, officers work to gain voluntary compliance from individuals. If they relinquish the fireworks, they are usually not cited,\" he wrote.\n\nStill, he said DPD invites anyone to complain. They just want you to provide more information if you do.\n\n\"Provide as much information possible, without compromising safety, to help us address this issue as well,\" he wrote. \"We also encourage people to report illegal sales of fireworks in the city. Such investigations have led to large confiscations of fireworks in the past, which have kept them out of the hands of celebrants.\"\n\nBesides the legality issue, local authorities held a recent press conference to explain why you should try to keep these things off the streets. Basically, you could blow yourself up or start a fire. The barrage of explosions also tends to cause air pollution to seriously spike.\n\nJD Chism, spokesperson for Denver Fire, said he's hoping you just won't light off any explosives. But if you must, he said, be careful when you're cleaning up.

Noise-canceling headphones and sunglasses can also be helpful for those with autism.\n\nOpting to watch fireworks from a quiet viewing spot in the car can also be an option for those looking to avoid big crowds.\n\n\"If that's still too much, you can do a viewing party at home with some fireworks on YouTube or something like that,\" she said.\n\nRelated Story: How did the Fourth of July become the fireworks holiday?\n\nMost importantly, parents shouldn't feel guilty about missing those big celebrations if their child isn't going to enjoy them.\n\nClick here for more tips to have an autism-friendly Fourth of July.", "source": {"uri": "denver7.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Denver 7 Colorado News (KMGH)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Autism spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripps_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scripps News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_overload", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sensory overload"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Speaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autism Speaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_and_mutton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamb and mutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbecue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbecue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Headphones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Lifestyle", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Lifestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2aabf88/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5470x2872+0+388/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fd6%2Ff4%2F498dc0004ac3bfe7596724d952f1%2Fap23186532689284.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705348", "eventUri": "eng-9705348", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Australia and New Zealand have sent airplanes to New Caledonia to begin bringing home stranded citizens from the violence-wracked French South Pacific territory. (LAC Adam Abela/Royal Australian Airfare via AP)PARIS (AP) - French President Emmanuel Macron is making a surprise trip to riot-hit New Caledonia, the French Pacific territory that has been gripped by days of deadly unrest and where indigenous people have long sought independence. \"He will go there tonight,\"\u009d government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot said after a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday where the president said he'd decided to make the more than 33,000-kilometer (20,000-mile) round trip himself to the archipelago east of Australia. Six people have been killed, including two gendarmes, and hundreds of others injured in New Caledonia amid armed clashes, looting and arson, raising new questions about Macron's handling of France's colonial legacy. There have been decades of tensions between indigenous Kanaks who seek independence for the archipelago of 270,000 people, and descendants of colonizers who want to remain part of France. The unrest erupted May 13 as the French legislature in Paris debated amending the French Constitution to make changes to New Caledonia voter lists. Opponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia and further marginalize Kanaks who once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination. The violence is the most severe to shake New Caledonia since the 1980s, when France also imposed emergency measures on the island that became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III. Paris last Wednesday declared a 12-day minimum state of emergency on the island and rushed in 1,000 reinforcements to bolster security forces that lost control of parts of the capital, Noum\u00e9a. \"Faced with the outbreak of violence, the priority is the return of order to allow dialogue to resume in New Caledonia,\" Thevenot, the government spokeswoman, said. \"We are clear: Much remains to be done before the return to normal. The government is fully mobilized.\" She gave no details about how long Macron will stay or who he will meet. But Macron will see the destruction that turned parts of Noum\u00e9a into no-go zones, with buildings torched, shops pillaged and barricades erected both by pro-independence supporters, some armed, and people banding together to protect livelihoods and homes. With police given emergency powers and a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew in effect, French authorities say security forces are starting to contain unrest. They announced another 22 arrests Tuesday for a total number near 300. The Associated Press could not reach those behind the unrest or from Kanak representatives, some of whom have called for calm. The violence in New Caledonia has led to fresh discussion about France's colonial past. Macron's efforts to address that have largely focused on Africa, where France had colonies and where local frustration in some countries has led to recent calls for French forces to get out. A priority for French authorities in New Caledonia since the weekend has been clearing the highway to Noum\u00e9a's international airport of barricades and the burned hulks of vehicles, raising the prospect for stranded tourists of being able to leave. Australia and New Zealand sent planes to New Caledonia on Tuesday to begin bringing citizens home. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Australia received clearance from French authorities for two evacuation flights and would work on further ones. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs said 300 Australians were in New Caledonia. It did not immediately confirm whether the flights would evacuate other stranded foreign nationals, believed to number in the thousands. New Zealand's government announced an evacuation effort for about 50 citizens. \"New Zealanders in New Caledonia have faced a challenging few days - and bringing them home has been an urgent priority for the government,\"\u009d Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said. \"In cooperation with France and Australia, we are working on subsequent flights in coming days.\"\u009d ___ John Leicester

Australia and New Zealand have sent airplanes to New Caledonia to begin bringing home stranded citizens from the violence-wracked French South Pacific territory. (David Clark/Courier Mail/AAP via AP)\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is making a surprise trip to riot-hit New Caledonia, the French Pacific territory that has been gripped by days of deadly unrest and where indigenous people have long sought independence.\n\n\"He will go there tonight,\" government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot said after a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday where the president said he'd decided to make the more than 33,000-kilometer (20,000-mile) round trip himself to the archipelago east of Australia.\n\nSix people have been killed, including two gendarmes, and hundreds of others injured in New Caledonia amid armed clashes, looting and arson, raising new questions about Macron's handling of France's colonial legacy.\n\nThere have been decades of tensions between indigenous Kanaks who seek independence for the archipelago of 270,000 people, and descendants of colonizers and colonists who want to remain part of France.\n\nThe unrest erupted May 13 as the French legislature in Paris debated amending the French Constitution to make changes to New Caledonia voter lists. Opponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia and further marginalize Kanaks who once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination.\n\nThe violence is the most severe to shake New Caledonia since the 1980s, when France also imposed emergency measures on the island that became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III.\n\nParis last Wednesday declared a 12-day minimum state of emergency on the island and rushed in 1,000 reinforcements to bolster security forces that lost control of parts of the capital, Noum\u00e9a.\n\n\"Faced with the outbreak of violence, the priority is the return of order to allow dialogue to resume in New Caledonia,\" Thevenot, the government spokeswoman, said. \"We are clear: Much remains to be done before the return to normal. The government is fully mobilized.\"\n\nShe gave no details about how long Macron will stay or who he will meet.\n\nBut Macron will see the destruction that turned parts of Noum\u00e9a into no-go zones, with buildings torched, shops pillaged and barricades erected both by pro-independence supporters, some armed, and people banding together to protect livelihoods and homes.\n\nWith police given emergency powers and a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew in effect, French authorities say security forces are starting to contain unrest. They announced another 22 arrests Tuesday for a total number near 300.\n\nThe Associated Press could not reach those behind the unrest or from Kanak representatives, some of whom have called for calm.\n\nThe violence in New Caledonia has led to fresh discussion about France's colonial past. Macron's efforts to address that have largely focused on Africa, where France had colonies and where local frustration in some countries has led to recent calls for French forces to get out.\n\nA priority for French authorities in New Caledonia since the weekend has been clearing the highway to Noum\u00e9a's international airport of barricades and the burned hulks of vehicles, raising the prospect for stranded tourists of being able to leave.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand sent planes to New Caledonia on Tuesday to begin bringing citizens home. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Australia received clearance from French authorities for two evacuation flights and would work on further ones.\n\nAustralia's Department of Foreign Affairs said 300 Australians were in New Caledonia. It did not immediately confirm whether the flights would evacuate other stranded foreign nationals, believed to number in the thousands.\n\nNew Zealand's government announced an evacuation effort for about 50 citizens.\n\n\"New Zealanders in New Caledonia have faced a challenging few days -- and bringing them home has been an urgent priority for the government,\" Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said. \"In cooperation with France and Australia, we are working on subsequent flights in coming days.\"", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors":

The National Assembly in Paris approved a bill that would, among other changes, allow residents who have lived in New Caledonia for 10 years to cast ballots in provincial elections.\n\nOpponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia and further marginalize Kanaks who once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Wong", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penny Wong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archipelago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noum\u00e9a", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanak_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kanak people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_05_37_3344557.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580739", "eventUri": "eng-9580739", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 2065, "textEnd": 2071}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Local leaders fear the change will dilute the Kanak vote, as per Reuters.\n\nAt least six people have been killed since the unrest began in the capital, Noumea. Three of the six people killed were young Kanaks shot by armed civilians.\n\nAlso Read | New Caledonia unrest: Australia, New Zealand send evacuation flights, Macron holds security meet\n\nThere have been several confrontations between Kanak protesters and armed self-defence groups or civilian militias formed to protect themselves.\n\nA plane full of Australian tourists who had been stranded in New Caledonia amid a week of rioting and looting arrived in Brisbane late Tuesday, reported AFP.\n\nThe Royal Australian Air Force C130 Hercules was the first evacuation flight to leave French territory since the unrest began on May 13.\n\nThe high commission, on Tuesday, said that the airport remains closed for commercial flights, and it will deploy the military to protect public buildings.\n\nAround 3,200 people are waiting to leave or enter New Caledonia as commercial flights were cancelled, reported Reuters citing the local government. This comes as the main international airport in the capital remains closed for commercial aircraft.\n\nAlso Read | Protestors block New Caledonia roads as French police pour in\n\n\"Passengers are being prioritised based on need. We continue to work on further flights,\" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a post on social media announcing the two flights.\n\nAccording to officials in Australia, around 300 citizens have registered for possible evacuation, but it was not immediately clear how many were evacuated on Tuesday's flights.\n\nThe New Zealand Defence Force plane was expected to carry about \"50 passengers with the most pressing needs,\" said Foreign Minister Winston Peters, adding that they are working with France and Australia on \"subsequent flights in coming days.\"", "source": {"uri":

Opponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia and further marginalize Kanaks who once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination.\n\nThe violence is the most severe to shake New Caledonia since the 1980s, when France also imposed emergency measures on the island that became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III.\n\nParis last Wednesday declared a 12-day minimum state of emergency on the island and rushed in 1,000 reinforcements to bolster security forces that lost control of parts of the capital, Noum\u00e9a.\n\n\"Faced with the outbreak of violence, the priority is the return of order to allow dialogue to resume in New Caledonia,\" Thevenot, the government spokeswoman, said. \"We are clear: Much remains to be done before the return to normal. The government is fully mobilized.\"\n\nLeaving Tuesday night will, because of the distance and time difference, see Macron arrive Thursday morning in New Caledonia, his office said. It said he is expected to stay for one day.\n\nMacron will meet with political, business, civic and youth leaders and aim to \"renew the thread of dialogue\" in search of \"a comprehensive political agreement,\" Prime Minister Gabriel Attal told parliament, where lawmakers stood for a moment of silence for the six people killed in the violence.\n\nInterior Minister Gerald Darmanin said he'll join Macron, along with the ministers for defense and for France's overseas territories. The visit will give Macron and his ministers a first-hand look at some of the destruction that turned parts of Noum\u00e9a into no-go zones, with buildings torched, shops pillaged and barricades erected both by pro-independence supporters, some armed, and people banding together to protect livelihoods and homes.\n\nWith police given emergency powers and a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew in effect, French authorities say security forces are starting to contain unrest. They announced another 22 arrests Tuesday for a total number near 300.\n\nThe violence in New Caledonia has led to fresh discussion about France's colonial past. Macron's efforts to address that have largely focused on Africa, where France had colonies and where local frustration in some countries has led to recent calls for French forces to get out.\n\nA priority for French authorities in New Caledonia since the weekend has been clearing the highway to Noum\u00e9a's international airport of barricades and the burned hulks of vehicles, raising the prospect for stranded tourists of being able to leave.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand sent planes to New Caledonia on Tuesday to begin bringing citizens home. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Australia received clearance from French authorities for two evacuation flights and would work on further ones.\n\nAustralia's Department of Foreign Affairs said 300 Australians were in New Caledonia. It did not immediately confirm whether the flights would evacuate other stranded foreign nationals, believed to number in the thousands.\n\nNew Zealand's government announced an evacuation effort for about 50 citizens.\n\n\"New Zealanders in New Caledonia have faced a challenging few days -- and bringing them home has been an urgent priority for the government,\" Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said. \"In cooperation with France and Australia, we are working on subsequent flights in coming days.\"\n\n___\n\nLeicester reported from Le Pecq, France, and Smith from Newcastle,

Opponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia and further marginalise Kanaks who once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination.\n\nThe violence is the most severe to shake New Caledonia since the 1980s, when France also imposed emergency measures on the island that became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III.\n\nParis last Wednesday declared a 12-day minimum state of emergency on the island and rushed in 1,000 reinforcements to bolster security forces that lost control of parts of the capital, Noum\u00e9a.\n\n\"Faced with the outbreak of violence, the priority is the return of order to allow dialogue to resume in New Caledonia,\" Thevenot, the government spokeswoman, said. \"We are clear: Much remains to be done before the return to normal. The government is fully mobilised.\"\n\nShe gave no details about how long Macron will stay or who he will meet.\n\nBut Macron will see the destruction that turned parts of Noum\u00e9a into no-go zones, with buildings torched, shops pillaged and barricades erected both by pro-independence supporters, some armed, and people banding together to protect livelihoods and homes.\n\nWith police given emergency powers and a 6 pm to 6 am curfew in effect, French authorities say security forces are starting to contain unrest. They announced another 22 arrests Tuesday for a total number near 300.\n\nThe Associated Press could not reach those behind the unrest or from Kanak representatives, some of whom have called for calm.\n\nThe violence in New Caledonia has led to fresh discussion about France's colonial past. Macron's efforts to address that have largely focused on Africa, where France had colonies and where local frustration in some countries has led to recent calls for French forces to get out.\n\nA priority for French authorities in New Caledonia since the weekend has been clearing the highway to Noum\u00e9a's international airport of barricades and the burned hulks of vehicles, raising the prospect for stranded tourists of being able to leave.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand sent planes to New Caledonia on Tuesday to begin bringing citizens home. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Australia received clearance from French authorities for two evacuation flights and would work on further ones.\n\nAustralia's Department of Foreign Affairs said 300 Australians were in New Caledonia. It did not immediately confirm whether the flights would evacuate other stranded foreign nationals, believed to number in the thousands.\n\nNew Zealand's government announced an evacuation effort for about 50 citizens.\n\n\"New Zealanders in New Caledonia have faced a challenging few days -- and bringing them home has been an urgent priority for the government,\" Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said. \"In cooperation with France and Australia, we are working on subsequent flights in coming days.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"},

He had previously been scheduled to be in Normandy on Wednesday.\n\n\"He will go there tonight,\" she said, after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday where the president announced he had decided to travel to New Caledonia himself.\n\nAn extra 1,000 personnel have been sent to the archipelago in addition to the 1,700 already deployed, after France imposed a state of emergency to tackle the unrest, which included a curfew and a ban on the social media app, TikTok.\n\n\"Faced with the outbreak of violence, the priority is the return of order to allow dialogue to resume in New Caledonia,\" Ms Thevenot said.\n\n\"The return to calm is starting to arrive. The situation is not quite totally normalised, but the situation is improving.\n\n\"We are clear: Much remains to be done before the return to normal. The government is fully mobilised.\"\n\nA priority for French officials has been clearing the highway to the airport.\n\nOn Tuesday, Australia, and New Zealand, sent planes to the island to begin bringing home stranded citizens.\n\nAustralian foreign minister Penny Wong said Australia had received clearance from French authorities for two evacuation flights.\n\nA Royal Australian Air Force C-130 Hercules touched down in the capital Noumea. The plane can carry 124 passengers, according to the Defence Department.\n\n\"We continue to work on further flights,\" Ms Wong said in a post on social media platform, X.\n\n\"New Zealanders in New Caledonia have faced a challenging few days - and bringing them home has been an urgent priority for the government,\" New Zealand's foreign minister Winston Peters said.\n\nThe New Zealand Herald reported a defence force plane had landed in Auckland with around 50 citizens evacuated from New Caledonia.\n\nAround 3,200 people are waiting to leave or enter New Caledonia after commercial flights were cancelled last week due to the unrest, the local government has said.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nOne dead in turbulence on London-Singapore flight\n\nElvis's granddaughter fights Graceland

Australia.\n\nNew Caledonia has been a French territory since the mid-1800s.\n\nThe island held three independence votes in three years from 2018 to 2021, with the closest in 2020 - a 53% to 47% result in favour of remaining.\n\nThe 2021 result was 96.5% in favour of remaining, following a boycott of the vote by pro-independence groups, including the indigenous Kanak population.", "source":

"Australia and New Zealand say they have received clearance to send planes to New Caledonia to pick up travellers stranded after unrest shut down the international airport.\n\nAustralia is deploying two planes on Tuesday to evacuate some of the 300 of its citizens who have registered for assistance in the French Pacific territory.\n\nThe first of \"a series\" of proposed flights will also leave New Zealand and bring about 50 people home, the government in Wellington said.\n\nThe unrest began last week after lawmakers in Paris voted through changes that will allow more French residents to vote in local elections, a move indigenous leaders say will dilute the political influence of native people.\n\nFour civilians - including at least three indigenous Kanak residents - have been killed in riots along with two police officers.\n\nDozens more have been injured and more than 200 people have so far been arrested.\n\nBoth Australia and New Zealand said they would prioritise flying out those with the most \"pressing need\", with passenger lists being organised by consular staff.\n\nTourists from \"other countries\" would also be assisted, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said.\n\nAs well as witnessing fires and looting, holidaymakers who have been stuck for more than a week have reported food shortages.\n\n\"The situation in New Caledonia remains dynamic, and New Zealand officials are continuing to work with French counterparts and other partners especially Australia to understand what is needed to ensure the safety of our people there,\" New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.\n\nAround 290 New Zealanders are believed to be in New Caledonia.\n\nAustralian tourist Maxwell Winchester told AFP that he and and his wife Tiffany were \"ecstatic\" at the prospect of getting home after being confined to a resort near Noum\u00e9a for over a week.\n\n\"We realise we probably won't get on these flights, because those who have higher needs will get on them, but we at least know we have a way out in the next few days,\" he said.\n\nThe French High Commission in New Caledonia say French gendarmes trying to take back control of the 60km (37 mile) road between Noum\u00e9a and La Tontouta international have \"neutralised\" 76 roadblocks and are now clearing debris such as burnt-out vehicles.\n\nTravel advice by the Australian government has warned people not to try and get to the airport themselves saying the route \"is not yet considered safe\".\n\nThe airport remains closed for commercial flights, and a decision on when to reopen it will be reassessed on Thursday, the local government said.\n\nIt has estimated that about 3,200 people are waiting to leave or enter New Caledonia.\n\nFrance has flown in 1,050 extra police to boost security in the territory, with a further 600 reinforcements to arrive \"in the coming hours\", France's High Commission in New Caledonia said on Tuesday.\n\nThe military is being deployed to protect public buildings, it added.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron warned that the military would need to remain deployed in New Caledonia \"for some time\".", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Opponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia and further marginalize Kanaks who once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination.\n\nThe violence is the most severe to shake New Caledonia since the 1980s, when France also imposed emergency measures on the island that became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III.\n\nLast Wednesday, Paris declared a 12-day minimum state of emergency on the island and rushed in 1,000 reinforcements to bolster security forces that lost control of parts of the capital, Noum\u00e9a.\n\n\"Faced with the outbreak of violence, the priority is the return of order to allow dialogue to resume in New Caledonia,\" Thevenot, the government spokeswoman, said. \"We are clear: Much remains to be done before the return to normal. The government is fully mobilized.\"\n\nLeaving Tuesday night will, because of the distance and time difference, see Macron arrive Thursday morning in New Caledonia, his office said. It said he is expected to stay for one day.\n\nMacron will meet with political, business, civic, and youth leaders and aim to \"renew the thread of dialogue\" in search of \"a comprehensive political agreement,\" Prime Minister Gabriel Attal told parliament, where lawmakers stood for a moment of silence for the six people killed in the violence.\n\nInterior Minister Gerald Darmanin said he'll join Macron, along with the ministers for defense and for France's overseas territories. The visit will give Macron and his ministers a first-hand look at some of the destruction that turned parts of Noum\u00e9a into no-go zones, with buildings torched, shops pillaged, and barricades erected both by pro-independence supporters, some armed, and people banding together to protect livelihoods and homes.\n\nWith police given emergency powers and a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew in effect, French authorities say security forces are starting to contain unrest. They announced another 22 arrests Tuesday for a total number near 300.\n\nThe violence in New Caledonia has led to fresh discussion about France's colonial past. Macron's efforts to address that have largely focused on Africa, where France had colonies and where local frustration in some countries has led to recent calls for French forces to get out.\n\nA priority for French authorities in New Caledonia since the weekend has been clearing the highway to Noum\u00e9a's international airport of barricades and the burned hulks of vehicles, raising the prospect for stranded tourists of being able to leave.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand sent planes to New Caledonia on Tuesday to begin bringing citizens home. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Australia received clearance from French authorities for two evacuation flights and would work on further ones.\n\nAustralia's Department of Foreign Affairs said 300 Australians were in New Caledonia. It did not immediately confirm whether the flights would evacuate other stranded foreign nationals, believed to number in the thousands.\n\nNew Zealand's government announced an evacuation effort for about 50 citizens.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanak_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kanak people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gendarmerie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archipelago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noum\u00e9a", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Attal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Attal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\u00e9rald_Darmanin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "G\u00e9rald Darmanin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_III", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Napoleon III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_the_Interior_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of the Interior (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overseas France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Wong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penny Wong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Micronations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Micronations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/bI-e47GU5VOF_aSrxPrR9AFriZg=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/33CK4ISN2EJFID64ETCUOR74DA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580739", "eventUri": "eng-9580739", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 475, "textEnd": 481}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

evacuation of foreigners from New Caledonia came as French President Emmanuel Macron convened a third defense and national security council meeting on Monday over riots in the overseas territory of New Caledonia.\n\nThe unrest has gripped New Caledonia for a week, prompting Paris to declare a state of emergency.\n\nFrench territorial High Commission on the island had said that more than 1,000 police officers, gendarmes, and civil security agents were sent to assist the local forces to reinstate order.\n\nThe French forces launched an operation on Sunday to regain access to some parts of the capital Noumea and also to reopen the airport.\n\nAt least six people, including two gendarmes, were killed during the riots, and 240 rioters arrested, the statement noted.\n\nThe unrest was sparked by a constitutional review initiated by Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin in New Caledonia.\n\nIf the changes are adopted, French nationals who have lived on the island for at least 10 years will be eligible to vote in local elections.\n\nLocals, however, are concerned that such changes will dilute the indigenous Kanak population's vote. -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com",

The movement is concerned it will weaken the local indigenous Kanak vote by giving voting rights to French residents who have lived in the territory for over 10 years.\n\nThe rioters caused significant damage to the territory as they set buildings alight, looted shops, destroyed vehicles and barricaded roads.\n\nAs the riot escalated, violence was no longer confined to pro-independence protesters and French police and spread to demonstrators and civilian groups of pro-French residents, with frequent clashes between them.\n\nThe French government has deployed 1,000 security personnel to the territory to stabilise the situation, with hundreds more to be sent.\n\nSo far, 270 rioters have been arrested, while the territory is under a 12-hour curfew between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n\nThe president will arrive on May 23 and is expected to stay in the territory for one day.\n\n\"Faced with the outbreak of violence, the priority is the return of order to allow dialogue to resume in New Caledonia,\" French government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot said.\n\n\"We are clear: Much remains to be done before the return to normal.

Six fatalities and hundreds of injuries have already resulted from the clashes. French and Australian officials are coordinating repatriation efforts, prioritizing vulnerable citizens. French President Macron's visit brings further scrutiny to France's colonial legacy.\n\nThe Australian military has flown 115 passengers on two flights from the restive French Pacific territory of New Caledonia and a French government flight was expected to evacuate another 100 stranded passengers on Wednesday, an Australian government minister said.\n\nSix people have been killed, including two police officers, and hundreds have been injured during recent armed clashes, looting and arson in New Caledonia.\n\nThe unrest erupted May 13 as the French legislature in Paris debated amending the French Constitution to make changes to New Caledonia voter lists. Opponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia and further marginalise Kanaks, who once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is expected to land on Thursday in New Caledonia, where Indigenous people have long sought independence. The unrest has raised new questions about Macron's handling of France's colonial legacy.\n\nAustralian citizens accounted for 84 of the passengers who were flown on two Royal Australian Airforce C-130 Hercules from the capital Noumea to the Australian east coast city of Brisbane late Tuesday, Pacific Minister Pat Conroy said.\n\nConroy did not say what nationalities were among the remaining 31 passengers. But he said Australia had reciprocal arrangements with Canada and Japan to help their citizens in crises.\n\nMore than 200 other Australians were registered with Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to leave the South Pacific territory, where a 12-day state of emergency has been declared.\n\n\"We've prioritised the elderly, the pregnant and the most vulnerable,\" Conroy told Nine Network television.\n\n\"We'll continue to work with the French government to make sure we get every Australian out of New Caledonia who does want to leave,\" Conroy added.\n\nConroy said he had been advised France was planning more flights to Brisbane on Wednesday.\n\n\"The French have indicated they intend to continue repatriating foreign nationals, particularly tourists so the primary plan is more French flights but ... we do have contingency plans and we do have planes on standby should there be an issue with that course of action,\" Conroy later told Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\n\"A French plane is expected to leave for Brisbane this afternoon or this evening and we expect around 100 Australians to be on it,\" Conroy added. A New Zealand Defence Force C-130 Hercules flew 48 passengers \"with the most pressing needs\" from Noumea to the New Zealand city of Auckland on Tuesday night, the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement.\n\nA French-operated flight would bring stranded New Zealanders home via Brisbane later Wednesday, the statement said. The New Zealand military would fly the Brisbane-Auckland leg. Around 265 New Zealanders wanted to leave New Caledonia.\n\nAustralian tourist Malisa Plesa said she had hoped to be evacuated by the Australian air force on Tuesday but remained in a Noumeau hotel on Wednesday.\n\n\"We didn't actually receive any notification that we wouldn't be on those flights. We were basically told to standby all day because we could be provided with 20 minutes notice to get on one of these flights,\" Plesa told Nine.\n\n\"However at about 9 p.m. last night we received communications saying that the French authorities will now be coordinating the evacuation of all tourists that still remain within New Caledonia so for us I think that means that we don't know when we'll be able to get home,\" she added.\n\nAustralian tourist Fadi Chemali had been aboard the first Australian military flight to Brisbane.\n\n\"Everyone clapped once we landed, we were all just so happy,\" he said at Brisbane Airport.\n\nChemali had been on vacation with his wife and young daughter for a week before the riots broke out and spent eight days scrambling to find a way home.\n\n\"I didn't see any of the violence up close but we heard a lot, including gunshots from where we were. It has been fairly intense,\" Chamali said.\n\nThe road to New Caledonia's international airport remained closed on Wednesday.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

Local leaders fear the change will dilute the Kanak vote.\n\nMacron will meet elected officials and local representatives on Thursday for a day of talks focused on politics and on the reconstruction of the island, aides said.\n\nMacron \"will discuss with all the forces in New Caledonia\", French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said. \"The objective is to ... prepare and anticipate reconstruction.\"\n\n\"The president is also going there to re-establish dialogue,\" Attal said.\n\nDialogue\n\nInitial reaction showed renewing dialogue will not be an easy task, all the more so as pro-independence leaders blame the riots on Macron pushing through the electoral reform despite local opposition.\n\n\"Here comes the fireman after he set the fire!\" Jimmy Naouna, from the Front de Liberation Nationale Kanak et Socialiste (FLNKS) of New Caledonia, wrote on X in response to news of Macron's visit.\n\nFrance annexed New Caledonia in 1853 and gave the colony the status of overseas territory in 1946. New Caledonia is the world's No. 3 nickel miner but the sector is in crisis and one-in-five residents live below the poverty threshold.\n\nThe island lies some 20,000 km (12,430 miles) away from mainland France, and some 1,500 km (930 miles) east of Australia. It has longed been rocked by pro-independence movements. The past week's violence has been the worst there in 40 years.\n\nThe opposition in Paris, former French prime ministers, and leaders of other Pacific islands have also said Macron should scrap or suspend the electoral reform, which parliament in Paris adopted last Tuesday.\n\nVanuatu Foreign Minister Matai Seremaiah urged France to \"do the right thing, to resolve all outstanding decolonisation issues\" and seriously engage with Kanak leaders.\n\nItem 1 of 6 France's President Emmanuel Macron waves as he boards his Presidential plane to travel to the Pacific archipelago of New Caledonia in an attempt to resolve a political crisis, at the Orly airport, a suburb of Paris on May 21, 2024. LUDOVIC MARIN/Pool via REUTERS\n\nEvacuations\n\nSome 108 Australians and other tourists landed in Brisbane on two government flights, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on X. A Defence Force plane landed in Auckland with some 50 people on board, the New Zealand Herald reported.\n\nMore flights were expected in coming days to evacuate some 500 French and foreign tourists in total, France's High Commission in New Caledonia said.\n\nAs she arrived in Brisbane, Australian tourist Mary Hatten said she had been largely confined to her hotel. \"The place was just in a mess,\" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nChris Salmon, who works in the mining industry in New Caledonia, hugged his family and said he was relieved to have left the French island. \"It feels all pretty awful, pretty senseless,\" he said.\n\nThe airport, shut since the start of the riots, remained closed for commercial flights.\n\nAround 3,200 people were waiting to leave or enter New Caledonia after commercial flights were cancelled last week due to the unrest, the local government has said.\n\nAustralian officials said passengers were being prioritized based on need. Those left behind were frustrated, said Australian Benen Huntley, honeymooning with wife Emily.\n\n\"My wife is quite upset, we just want to get home,\" he said in a telephone interview. \"We opened our hotel door this morning and you could just see an enormous billow of smoke coming off a building in the distance.\"\n\nMore than 1,000 gendarmes and police from France were on patrol and another 600 would be added, France's High Commission said.\n\nThree of the six people killed in the unrest were young Kanaks shot by armed civilians, and there have been confrontations between Kanak protesters and armed self-defense groups or civilian militias formed to protect themselves.\n\n\"The French government doesn't know how to control people here,\" said Viro Xulue, part of a community group providing social assistance to other Kanaks.\n\nThe situation on the ground was improving but much more needed to be done, French government spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot said.", "source": {"uri":

Australia and New Zealand have sent airplanes to New Caledonia to begin bringing home stranded citizens from the violence-wracked French South Pacific territory. (David Clark/Courier Mail/AAP via AP)\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- The Australian military had flown 115 passengers in two flights from the restive French Pacific territory of New Caledonia and would continue to work with France to repatriate all Australians who want to leave, an Australian government minister said Wednesday.\n\nAustralian citizens accounted for 84 of the passengers who were flown in two Royal Australian Airforce C-130 Hercules from the capital Noumea to the Australian east coast city of Brisbane late Tuesday, Pacific Minister Pat Conroy said.\n\nConroy did not say what nationalities were among the remaining 31 passengers. But he said Australia had reciprocal arrangements with Canada and Japan to help their citizens in crises.\n\nAnother more than 200 Australians were registered with Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to leave the South Pacific territory where a 12-day state of emergency has been declared.\n\n\"We've prioritized the elderly, the pregnant and the most vulnerable,\" Conroy told Nine Network television.\n\n\"We'll continue to work with the French government to make sure we get every\n\nAustralian out of New Caledonia who does want to leave,\" Conroy added.\n\nConroy said he had been advised France was planning more flights to Brisbane on Wednesday.\n\n\"We're working very hard to make sure as many Australians as possible are on those flights,\" Conroy said.\n\nA second round of 100 New Zealanders were being flown home from New Caledonia via Brisbane on Wednesday after around 100 were flown to the New Zealand city of Auckland on Tuesday night, The New Zealand Herald newspaper reported.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is expected to land on Thursday on New Caledonia where Indigenous people have long sought independence.\n\nSix people have been killed, including two police officers, and hundreds have been injured in New Caledonia during armed clashes, looting and arson, raising new questions about Macron's handling of France's colonial legacy.\n\nThe unrest erupted May 13 as the French legislature in Paris debated amending the French Constitution to make changes to New Caledonia voter lists. Opponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia and further marginalize Kanaks, who once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination.\n\nThe road to New Caledonia's international airport remained closed on Wednesday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The riots have caused significant destruction and loss of life. Macron aims to restore order and address local concerns. Meanwhile, evacuations of Australian and New Zealand nationals are ongoing as security forces work to maintain peace.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron will travel to the Pacific island of New Caledonia on Tuesday, a government spokesperson said, just over a week after riots erupted in the French overseas territory, leaving six dead. The riots over electoral reform have left a trail of destruction with shops looted, cars burnt and road barricades restricting access to medicine and food. The island's business chamber said 150 companies had been looted and burnt.\n\nSpeaking after a cabinet meeting, French government spokesman Prisca Thevenot said Macron would travel to \"set up a mission,\" without saying what it could entail. Some politicians have called for veteran politicians to be named as mediators, but Thevenot did not say if this was what Macron had in mind.\n\n\"Our priority is the return to calm and order,\" Thevenot said, noting the situation on the ground was improving but more needed to be done. Australia and New Zealand have already begun evacuating nationals from New Caledonia.\n\nAround 3,200 people are waiting to leave or enter New Caledonia after commercial flights were cancelled last week due to the unrest, the local government has said. \"New Zealanders in New Caledonia have faced a challenging few days - and bringing them home has been an urgent priority for the government,\" New Zealand foreign minister Winston Peters said.\n\nThe New Zealand Herald reported that a defence force plane had landed in Auckland with some 50 citizens evacuated from New Caledonia. Further flights were expected in the coming days. Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said clearance had been received for two Australian government assisted-departure flights on Tuesday for tourists wanting to leave.\n\nFrance's High Commission in New Caledonia said the airport remained closed for commercial flights, and it will deploy the military to protect public buildings. MORE POLICE\n\nAustralian officials said passengers were being prioritised based on need. Those left behind were frustrated, said Australian Benen Huntley, honeymooning with wife Emily. \"My wife is quite upset, we just want to get home,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We opened our hotel door this morning and you could just see an enormous billow of smoke coming off a building in the distance.\" Queueing to buy bread, the Adelaide couple had seen dozens of gendarmes guarding a petrol station.\n\nOver 1,000 gendarmes and police from France were at work, and another 600 personnel would be added, France's High Commission said. The commission asked French residents who normally live outside New Caledonia to register their details for support to return home.\n\nProtests erupted last week, sparked by anger among indigenous Kanak people over a constitutional amendment approved in France that would change who is allowed to participate in elections. Local leaders fear the change will dilute the Kanak vote. Viro Xulue, part of a community group providing social assistance to other Kanaks, said it felt like a return to the civil war of the 1980s, and people were scared.\n\n\"We are really scared about the police, the French soldiers, and we are scared about the anti-Kanak militia terrorist group,\" Xulue told Reuters in a video interview. Three of the six people killed in the unrest were young Kanaks shot by armed civilians, and there have been confrontations between Kanak protesters and armed self-defence groups or civilian militias formed to protect themselves.\n\n\"The French Government doesn't know how to control people here. They send more than 2,000 military to control, but it fails,\" Xulue said. Pro-independence political parties say they want the French government to withdraw the electoral reform before they restart talks, while France said re-establishing order was a precondition to dialogue.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"},

Local leaders fear the change will dilute the Kanak vote.\n\nMacron will meet elected officials and local representatives on Thursday for a day of talks focused on politics and on the reconstruction of the island, aides said.\n\nMacron \"will discuss with all the forces in New Caledonia\", French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said. \"The objective is to ... prepare and anticipate reconstruction.\"\n\n\"The president is also going there to re-establish dialogue,\" Attal said.\n\nDIALOGUE\n\nInitial reaction showed renewing dialogue will not be an easy task, all the more so as pro-independence leaders blame the riots on Macron pushing through the electoral reform despite local opposition.\n\n\"Here comes the fireman after he set the fire!\" Jimmy Naouna, from the Front de Liberation Nationale Kanak et Socialiste (FLNKS) of New Caledonia, wrote on X in response to news of Macron's visit.\n\nFrance annexed New Caledonia in 1853 and gave the colony the status of overseas territory in 1946. New Caledonia is the world's No. 3 nickel miner but the sector is in crisis and one-in-five residents live below the poverty threshold.\n\nThe island lies some 20 000 km (12 430 miles) away from mainland France, and some 1 500 km (930 miles) east of Australia. It has longed been rocked by pro-independence movements. The past week's violence has been the worst there in 40 years.\n\nThe opposition in Paris, former French prime ministers, and leaders of other Pacific islands have also said Macron should scrap or suspend the electoral reform, which parliament in Paris adopted last Tuesday.\n\nVanuatu Foreign Minister Matai Seremaiah urged France to \"do the right thing, to resolve all outstanding decolonisation issues\" and seriously engage with Kanak leaders.\n\nEVACUATIONS\n\nSome 108 Australians and other tourists landed in Brisbane on two government flights, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on X. A Defence Force plane landed in Auckland with some 50 people on board, the New Zealand Herald reported.\n\nMore flights were expected in coming days to evacuate some 500 French and foreign tourists in total, France's High Commission in New Caledonia said.\n\nAs she arrived in Brisbane, Australian tourist Mary Hatten said she had been largely confined to her hotel. \"The place was just in a mess,\" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nChris Salmon, who works in the mining industry in New Caledonia, hugged his family and said he was relieved to have left the French island. \"It feels all pretty awful, pretty senseless,\" he said.\n\nThe airport, shut since the start of the riots, remained closed for commercial flights.\n\nAround 3 200 people were waiting to leave or enter New Caledonia after commercial flights were cancelled last week due to the unrest, the local government has said.\n\nAustralian officials said passengers were being prioritised based on need. Those left behind were frustrated, said Australian Benen Huntley, honeymooning with wife Emily.\n\n\"My wife is quite upset, we just want to get home,\" he said in a telephone interview. \"We opened our hotel door this morning and you could just see an enormous billow of smoke coming off a building in the distance.\"\n\nMore than 1 000 gendarmes and police from France were on patrol and another 600 would be added, France's High Commission said.\n\nThree of the six people killed in the unrest were young Kanaks shot by armed civilians, and there have been confrontations between Kanak protesters and armed self-defence groups or civilian militias formed to protect themselves.\n\n\"The French government doesn't know how to control people here,\" said Viro Xulue, part of a community group providing social assistance to other Kanaks.\n\nThe situation on the ground was improving but much more needed to be done, French government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot said.", "source": {"uri": "sabcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SABC News - Breaking news, special reports, world, business, sport coverage of all South African current events.

Opponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia and further marginalize Kanaks, who once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is expected to land Thursday in New Caledonia, where Indigenous people have long sought independence. The unrest has raised new questions about Macron's handling of France's colonial legacy.\n\nAustralian citizens accounted for 84 of the passengers who were flown on two Royal Australian Airforce C-130 Hercules from the capital Noumea to the Australian east coast city of Brisbane late Tuesday, Pacific Minister Pat Conroy said.\n\nConroy did not say what nationalities were among the remaining 31 passengers. But he said Australia had reciprocal arrangements with Canada and Japan to help their citizens in crises.\n\nMore than 200 other Australians were registered with Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to leave the South Pacific territory, where a 12-day state of emergency has been declared.\n\n\"We've prioritized the elderly, the pregnant and the most vulnerable,\" Conroy told Nine Network television.\n\n\"We'll continue to work with the French government to make sure we get every Australian out of New Caledonia who does want to leave,\" Conroy added.\n\nConroy said he had been advised France was planning more flights to Brisbane on Wednesday.\n\n\"The French have indicated they intend to continue repatriating foreign nationals, particularly tourists so the primary plan is more French flights but ... we do have contingency plans and we do have planes on standby should there be an issue with that course of action,\" Conroy later told Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\n\"A French plane is expected to leave for Brisbane this afternoon or this evening and we expect around 100 Australians to be on it,\" Conroy added.\n\nA New Zealand Defense Force C-130 Hercules flew 48 passengers \"with the most pressing needs\" from Noumea to the New Zealand city of Auckland on Tuesday night, the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement.\n\nA French-operated flight would bring stranded New Zealanders home via Brisbane later Wednesday, the statement said. The New Zealand military would fly the Brisbane-Auckland leg. Around 265 New Zealanders wanted to leave New Caledonia.\n\nAustralian tourist Malisa Plesa said she had hoped to be evacuated by the Australian air force on Tuesday but remained in a Noumeau hotel on Wednesday.\n\n\"We didn't actually receive any notification that we wouldn't be on those flights. We were basically told to standby all day because we could be provided with 20 minutes notice to get on one of these flights,\" Plesa told Nine.\n\n\"However at about 9 p.m. last night we received communications saying that the French authorities will now be coordinating the evacuation of all tourists that still remain within New Caledonia so for us I think that means that we don't know when we'll be able to get home,\" she added.\n\nAustralian tourist Fadi Chemali had been aboard the first Australian military flight to Brisbane.\n\n\"Everyone clapped once we landed, we were all just so happy,\" he said at Brisbane Airport.\n\nChemali had been on vacation with his wife and young daughter for a week before the riots broke out and spent eight days scrambling to find a way home.\n\n\"I didn't see any of the violence up close but we heard a lot, including gunshots from where we were. It has been fairly intense,\" Chamali said.\n\nThe road to New Caledonia's international airport remained closed on Wednesday. - AP", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title":

The visit aims to initiate reconstruction and dialogue among local leaders. Australia and New Zealand are evacuating tourists as violence disrupts daily life and essential supplies.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron will travel to the Pacific island of New Caledonia on Tuesday, a government spokesperson said, just over a week after riots erupted in the French overseas territory, killing six.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand were evacuating tourists from the island as the violence left a trail of destruction with looted shops, torched cars and road barricades restricting access to medicine and food. Some 108 Australians and other tourists landed in Brisbane on two government flights, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on X. A defence force plane landed in Auckland with some 50 people on board, the New Zealand Herald reported.\n\nMore flights were expected in coming days to evacuate some 500 French and foreign tourists in total, France's High Commission in New Caledonia said. The airport, shut since the start of the riots, remained closed for commercial flights.\n\nThe protests were sparked by anger among indigenous Kanak people over constitutional reform approved in Paris that would change who is allowed to take part in elections. Local leaders fear the change will dilute the Kanak vote. Macron will meet elected officials and local representatives on Thursday for a day of talks focused on politics and on the reconstruction of the island, aides said.\n\nMacron \"will discuss with all the forces in New Caledonia\", French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said. \"The objective is to ... prepare and anticipate reconstruction.\" \"The president is also going there to re-establish dialogue,\" Attal said.\n\nDIALOGUE Initial reaction showed renewing dialogue will not be an easy task, all the more so as pro-independence leaders blame the riots on Macron pushing through the electoral reform despite local opposition.\n\n\"Here comes the fireman after he set the fire!\" Jimmy Naouna, from the Front de Liberation Nationale Kanak et Socialiste (FLNKS) of New Caledonia, wrote on X about news of Macron's visit. France annexed New Caledonia in 1853 and gave the colony the status of overseas territory in 1946. New Caledonia is the world's No. 3 nickel miner but the sector is in crisis and one in five residents live under the poverty threshold.\n\nThe island lies some 20,000 km (12,430 miles) away from mainland France, and some 1,500 km (930 miles) east of Australia. The opposition in Paris, former French prime ministers, and leaders of other Pacific islands have also said Macron should not go ahead with the electoral reform, which parliament in Paris adopted last Tuesday.\n\nVanuatu Foreign Minister Matai Seremaiah urged France to \"do the right thing, to resolve all outstanding decolonisation issues\" and seriously engage with Kanak leaders. EVACUATIONS Around 3,200 people were waiting to leave or enter New Caledonia after commercial flights were cancelled last week due to the unrest, the local government has said.\n\nAustralian officials said passengers were being prioritised based on need. Those left behind were frustrated, said Australian Benen Huntley, honeymooning with wife Emily. \"My wife is quite upset, we just want to get home,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We opened our hotel door this morning and you could just see an enormous billow of smoke coming off a building in the distance.\" Queueing to buy bread, the Adelaide couple had seen dozens of gendarmes guarding a petrol station.\n\nOver 1,000 gendarmes and police from France were on patrol and another 600 would be added, France's High Commission said. Three of the six people killed in the unrest were young Kanaks shot by armed civilians, and there have been confrontations between Kanak protesters and armed self-defence groups or civilian militias formed to protect themselves.\n\n\"The French Government doesn't know how to control people here,\" said Viro Xulue, part of a community group providing social assistance to other Kanaks. He said it felt like a return to the civil war of the 1980s and people were scared. The situation on the ground was improving but much more needed to be done, French government spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot said.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Instead, he will be flying to the archipelago 10 time zones away from Paris, east of Australia, that has been gripped by deadly armed clashes, looting and arson with six people killed, including two gendarmes, in the past week.\n\nParis last Wednesday declared a 12-day minimum state of emergency on the island where indigenous people have long sought independence from France, and rushed in 1,000 reinforcements to bolster security forces that lost control of some parts of the capital, Noumea.\n\n\"Faced with the outbreak of violence, the priority is the return of order to allow dialogue to resume in New Caledonia,\" Ms Thevenot said.\n\n\"The return to calm is starting to arrive.

The changes would give French residents the right to vote in provincial elections if they have lived there for 10 years.\n\nHowever, the Kanak population group in particular - New Caledonia's Indigenous inhabitants - have long hoped for their own state. The national council of the Kanaks accused Paris of pushing ahead with the controversial reform without taking into account the resistance of the vast majority of the Indigenous population.\n\nThe former French colony had already gained extensive autonomy through the Noum\u00e9a Agreement of 1998.

The unrest has raised new questions about Mr Macron's handling of France's colonial legacy.\n\nAustralian Pacific minister Pat Conroy said 84 of the passengers who were flown on two Royal Australian Airforce C-130 Hercules late on Tuesday from the capital Noum\u00e9a to the Australian east coast city of Brisbane were Australian citizens.\n\nMr Conroy did not say what nationalities were among the remaining 31 passengers. But he said Australia had reciprocal arrangements with Canada and Japan to help their citizens in crises.\n\nMore than 200 other Australians were registered with Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs to leave the South Pacific territory, where a 12-day state of emergency has been declared.\n\n\"We've prioritised the elderly, the pregnant and the most vulnerable,\" Mr Conroy told Nine Network television.\n\n\"We'll continue to work with the French government to make sure we get every Australian out of New Caledonia who does want to leave,\" Mr Conroy added.\n\nMr Conroy said he had been advised France was planning more flights to Brisbane on Wednesday.\n\n\"The French have indicated they intend to continue repatriating foreign nationals, particularly tourists, so the primary plan is more French flights, but ... we do have contingency plans, and we do have planes on standby should there be an issue with that course of action,\" Mr Conroy later told the ABC.\n\n\"A French plane is expected to leave for Brisbane this afternoon or this evening, and we expect around 100 Australians to be on it,\" Mr Conroy added.\n\nA New Zealand Defence Force C-130 Hercules flew 48 passengers \"with the most pressing needs\" from Noum\u00e9a to the New Zealand city of Auckland on Tuesday night, the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement.\n\nA French-operated flight would bring stranded New Zealanders home via Brisbane later on Wednesday, the statement said. The New Zealand military would fly the Brisbane-Auckland leg. Around 265 New Zealanders wanted to leave New Caledonia.\n\nThe road to New Caledonia's international airport remained closed on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news",

Three referendums have now been held, with the anti-independence side winning out each time.\n\nStill, pro-independence leaders have called for another vote, arguing that the third referendum should have been delayed.\n\nMany Kanaks were prohibited from voting in the 2021 vote by mourning customs, following a coronavirus outbreak that devastated communities there.\n\nWhy is it important to France?\n\nThe calculus in France has changed in recent years, as the south-pacific region takes up a more consequential space on the world stage.\n\nAs jostling between the US and China for influence in the region intensifies, French officials fear that China could gain sway in an independent New Caledonia - just as it has sought to do in the Solomon Islands.\n\nNew Caledonia is also one of the world's biggest nickel producers, holding between 20-30% of the world's reserves.\n\nPresident Macron visited the islands last July to emphasise his vision for the French-Pacific outpost.\n\n\"New Caledonia is French because it has chosen to remain French,\" Mr Macron told the crowd. \"No going back. No stuttering.\"\n\nWhat has sparked the recent violence?\n\nThe latest period of unrest erupted on May 13, when French lawmakers in Paris debated making changes to New Caledonian voting lists.\n\nThe French National Assembly approved a bill that would, among other changes, allow residents who have lived in New Caledonia for 10 years or more to cast ballots in provincial elections.\n\nOpponents say the measure will benefit pro-France politicians, and further marginalise the Kanaks by diluting their political influence.\n\nUnder prior accords, voting in provincial elections was restricted to those who had resided in New Caledonia since before 1998, and their descendants.\n\nThe measure was aimed at giving greater representation to the Kanaks who had, at that point, become a minority group on the islands.\n\nOn Wednesday, Paris declared a 12-day minimum state of emergency on the islands, and rushed in over 1,000 reinforcements to bolster security forces that had lost control of parts of the capital, Noumea.\n\nAt least six people have been killed, including two police officers.\n\nParts of the city have become no-go zones, with buildings torched, shops pillages, and makeshift barricades set up.\n\n\"The protests reveal the determination of our young people to no longer let France rule them,\" said Daniel Goa, the president of the pro-independence Caledonian Union party, although he called for a stop to the violence.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nWith police given emergency powers and a 6pm to 6am curfew in effect, French authorities say security forces are starting to contain the unrest.\n\nA priority for French authorities has been clearing the highway to the international airport, in order to allow stranded tourists to leave.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand sent planes to New Caledonia on Tuesday to begin bringing citizens home. Some 300 Australians and 50 New Zealanders are currently stranded\n\nPresident Macron's visit will aim to subdue tensions. He will travel to the islands on Tuesday evening, but no details have been given regarding the length of his stay.\n\n\"Faced with the outbreak of violence, the priority is the return of order to allow dialogue to resume,\" said a French government spokesperson.\n\n\"We are clear: much remains to be done before the return to normal. The government is fully mobilised.\"\n\nLocal authorities have also called for calm, with the High Commissioner of the Republic, Louis Le Franc, warning the territory is \"heading straight for a civil war\".\n\nFrench Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said re-establishing order was necessary for further dialogue to begin.\n\nBut pro-independence parties say they want the French government to withdraw the reforms before they restart talks.\n\nMr Macron said he was open to reaching a negotiated settlement, but that a new agreement must be reached by June, or else he would sign it into law regardless.", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

calm, the regulars already know us on the barricades,\" he said.\n\nIndigenous Kanaks, who make up about 40% of the population, say the latest voting regulations would dilute their vote.\n\nBut more recent arrivals to the islands say they are being deprived of their right to take part in local elections.\n\nThe new law would extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least ten years.\n\nThe New Caledonian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reported \"catastrophic\" economic damage from the unrest, with 150 businesses \"looted and set on fire\".\n\nFrance is considering extending a 12-day state of emergency, which has led to a night-time curfew, house arrests of suspected ringleaders, and bans on TikTok, the sale of alcohol, carrying weapons and

The unrest has killed at least six people, and has left a trail of burned cars and looted shops, with road barricades restricting access to medicine and food.\n\nThe violence is the latest outburst of political tensions that have simmered for years and pitted the island's largely pro-independence indigenous Kanak communities - who have long chafed against rule by Paris - against French inhabitants opposed to breaking ties with their motherland.\n\nMacron's visit comes as Australia and New Zealand deploy government planes to evacuate their nationals from New Caledonia and as hundreds more French security personnel have been deployed to assist in the unrest.\n\nFrance's High Commission of New Caledonia said Tuesday the airport remains closed for commercial flights until May 25.\n\nThevenot said Tuesday that 1,000 more members of French security forces have arrived in New Caledonia to support the 1,700 personnel already on the island. Darmanin also told the French legislature the number of police and gendarmes in New Caledonia would soon reach 3,000.\n\nAlso speaking to France's National Assembly, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said Tuesday \"the situation is starting to improve.\"\n\nProtests began May 13 involving mostly young people, in response to the tabling of a vote in the French parliament proposing changes to New Caledonia's constitution that would give greater voting rights to French residents living on the islands. On Tuesday, legislators voted overwhelmingly in favor of the change.\n\nThe proposed changes to the constitution add thousands of extra voters to New Caledonia's electoral rolls, which have not been updated since the late 1990s. Pro-independence groups say the changes are an attempt by France to consolidate its rule over the archipelago. Supporters of the change say voter rolls will better reflect the current population.\n\nLying in the South Pacific with Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu for neighbors, New Caledonia is a semiautonomous French territory -- one of a dozen scattered throughout the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Ocean.\n\nColonial France took control of New Caledonia in 1853. White settlement followed and the indigenous Kanak people were longtime victims of harsh segregation policies. Many indigenous inhabitants continue to live with high rates of poverty and high unemployment to this day.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

relieved Australians have arrived home after escaping the anguish and turmoil of more than a week of deadly rioting in New Caledonia.\n\nRoyal Australian Air Force planes were sent to the French territory on Tuesday after the federal government was given clearance for two flights to bring back citizens.\n\nFadi Chemali, who was on the first plane to reach Australia, said those on board were filled with relief after days of failing to find a way off the island.\n\n\"Everyone clapped once we landed, we were all just so happy,\" he told AAP shortly after landing in Brisbane on Tuesday night.\n\nMr Chemali had been holidaying with his wife and young daughter for a week before the riots broke out and spent eight days scrambling to find a way home.\n\n\"I didn't see any of the violence up close but we heard a lot, including gunshots from where we were, it has been fairly intense.\"\n\nMr Chemali said he first believed French authorities would help tourists off the island before it became clear Australia needed to step in.\n\nAt least six people have died in the territory and hundreds have been injured since violence broke out last Monday.\n\nFrench troops are trying to stem further unrest, with buildings razed, shops looted and roads barricaded.\n\nAbout 300 Australians in New Caledonia are registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs.\n\nA Hercules military plane reached Noumea earlier on Tuesday after leaving RAAF Base Amberley near Ipswich, according to public flight data.\n\nIt can carry 124 passengers, according to the Defence Department.\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong said the government will continue to work with other countries on securing more flights.\n\n\"French authorities have advised they will conduct flights to enable the safe departure of foreign tourists from New Caledonia, commencing tomorrow,\" she wrote on social media platform X, adding Australia was ready to help.\n\nAustralia's Consul-General in New Caledonia, Annelise Young, posted on X her team had been working round the clock with teams in Canberra and Paris and closely with the French authorities to ensure safe passage for Australian tourists.\n\nSenator Wong spoke with her New Zealand and French counterparts on Monday to request access to the territory.\n\nNew rules changing who is allowed to participate in the nation's elections have been slammed by the Indigenous Kanak people, who fear their vote will be diluted by thousands of French nationals who have moved to the island.\n\nAbout 270 rioters have been arrested and a 12-hour curfew imposed from 6pm to 6am.\n\nFrance has sent more than 1000 security personnel, with hundreds more to join, in a bid to quell the unrest.\n\nThe reopening of the international airport for commercial flights will be reassessed on Thursday.\n\nAustralia has urged people to reconsider travel to New Caledonia.\n\nThose in the territory have been advised to limit their movement.", "source": {"uri": "aap.com.au",

We continue to work on further flights,\" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on social media, announcing two initial flights.\n\nThe first transport with evacuees landed in Brisbane in eastern Australia around 7:00 pm (0900 GMT) Tuesday.\n\nA second C-130 was slated to land in Auckland, New Zealand around 1000 GMT, with Foreign Minister Winston Peters saying it would bring \"50 passengers with the most pressing needs\" and promising \"subsequent flights in coming days\".\n\nAustralian tourist Maxwell Winchester said he and his wife Tiffany were \"ecstatic\" to hear evacuation flights had begun after being stuck in a barricaded resort for a week.\n\nCharles Roger, director of New Caledonia's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) which operates Noumea's larger La Tontouta international airport, told AFP there would be no commercial flights there until Saturday morning.\n\n- Catapults -\n\nThe Pacific territory of 270,000 people has been in turmoil since May 13, when violence erupted over French plans to impose new voting rules that would give tens of thousands of non-indigenous residents voting rights.\n\nThe unrest has left six people dead, including two police, and hundreds injured.\n\nLocal prosecutors said Tuesday that around 400 shops and businesses had been damaged, many of them by fire, while the CCI on Monday tallied 150 businesses \"looted and set on fire\".\n\nThe French authorities in New Caledonia said police had so far arrested nearly 270 \"rioters\".\n\nTwenty-one supermarkets have been able to reopen and gradually restock, the French high commission said Tuesday.\n\nFrench forces were slowly restoring calm across the territory, clearing burned-out vehicles from roads, and deploying troops to protect public buildings, authorities said.\n\nFrench officials said at the weekend that security forces had destroyed 76 roadblocks along the critical 60-kilometre (40-mile) road from Noumea to La Tontouta airport.\n\nBut AFP journalists said many had quickly been rebuilt by Kanak militants.\n\nKanaks with scarfs over their faces, some armed with homemade catapults, were still manning a roadblock Tuesday on the road to the international airport.\n\n- Anger over vote reform -\n\nOne of several militants on the roadblock, a masked 25-year-old with sunglasses who gave only his first name, Stanley, said the proposed voting reform \"means the elimination of the Kanak people\".\n\n\"That's what they don't understand over there -- we are already in the minority in our own home,\" he told AFP.\n\nIndigenous Kanaks, who make up about 40 percent of the population, say the latest voting regulations would dilute their vote.\n\nBut more recent arrivals to the islands say they are being deprived of their right to take part in local elections.\n\nThe new law would extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least 10 years.\n\nProminent French figures including former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who followed the New Caledonia file closely while in office, have called for delay to the constitutional change.\n\n\"You can't make progress on the Caledonia file by issuing ultimatums,\" Valls said Sunday.\n\nBut anti-independence representatives want it pushed through.\n\nWithdrawing \"would prove the wreckers, the looters and the rioters right,\" said Nicolas Metzdorf, a New Caledonia MP for Macron's Renaissance party.\n\n\"Violence cannot replace the ballot box in a democracy,\" he added.\n\n- 'Madness' -\n\nIn the Noumea beachside suburb of Magenta, AFP journalists saw abandoned roadblocks and locals clearing up the streets.\n\n\"I am so happy to see this and for the madness to end,\" said one tearful resident who gave only her first name, Sylvie.\n\nFrance is considering extending a 12-day state of emergency, which has led to a night-time curfew, house arrests of suspected ringleaders, as well as a ban on TikTok, the sale of alcohol, carrying weapons and

Macron \"will leave as soon as this evening,\" government spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot said, hoping to soothe tempers over his government's voting reform plans rejected by indigenous Kanak.\n\nEarlier Tuesday an Australian Air Force transport aircraft evacuated trapped tourists from a small domestic airport in New Caledonia's capital Noum\u00e9a, as separatist roadblocks still hinder access to the international hub.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand sent an initial batch of planes to Noum\u00e9a Magenta airport, where Agence France-Presse (AFP) correspondents saw the first Australian C-130 Hercules aircraft land and several coaches waiting.\n\n\"Passengers are being prioritized based on need. We continue to work on further flights,\" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on social media, announcing two initial flights. The first transport with evacuees landed in Brisbane in eastern Australia around 7:00 pm (0900 GMT) Tuesday.\n\nA second C-130 was slated to land in Auckland, New Zealand around 1000 GMT, with Foreign Minister Winston Peters saying it would bring \"50 passengers with the most pressing needs\" and promising \"subsequent flights in coming days.\"\n\nCharles Roger, director of New Caledonia's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) which operates Noum\u00e9a's larger La Tontouta international airport, said there would be no commercial flights there until Saturday morning.\n\nThe Pacific territory of 270,000 people has been in turmoil since May 13, when violence erupted over French plans to impose new voting rules that would give tens of thousands of non-indigenous residents voting rights. The unrest has left six people dead, including two police, and hundreds injured.\n\nLocal prosecutors said on Tuesday that around 400 shops and businesses had been damaged, many of them by fire, while the CCI on Monday tallied 150 businesses \"looted and set on fire\". The French authorities in New Caledonia said police had so far arrested nearly 270 \"rioters.\"\n\nTwenty-one supermarkets have been able to reopen and gradually restock, the French high commission said Tuesday. French forces were slowly restoring calm across the territory, clearing burned-out vehicles from roads, and deploying troops to protect public buildings, authorities said.\n\nFrench officials said at the weekend that security forces had destroyed 76 roadblocks along the critical 60-kilometer road from Noum\u00e9a to La Tontouta airport. But many had quickly been rebuilt by Kanak militants.\n\nKanak with scarves over their faces, some armed with homemade catapults, were still manning a roadblock Tuesday on the road to the international airport.\n\nIndigenous Kanak, who make up about 40% of the population, say the latest voting regulations would dilute their vote. But more recent arrivals to the islands say they are being deprived of their right to take part in local elections. The new law would extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least 10 years.\n\nProminent French figures including former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who followed the New Caledonia file closely while in office, have called for delay to the constitutional change. \"You can't make progress on the Caledonia file by issuing ultimatums,\" Valls said on Sunday. But anti-independence representatives want it pushed through.\n\nWithdrawing \"would prove the wreckers, the looters and the rioters right,\" said Nicolas Metzdorf, a New Caledonia MP for Macron's Renaissance party. \"Violence cannot replace the ballot box in a democracy,\" he added.\n\nFrance is considering extending a 12-day state of emergency, which has led to a night-time curfew, house arrests of suspected ringleaders, as well as a ban on TikTok, the sale of alcohol, carrying weapons and gatherings.\n\nNew Caledonia has been a French territory since the mid-1800s. But almost two centuries on, opinion is split roughly along ethnic lines over whether the islands should be part of France, autonomous or independent.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType":

Those left behind were frustrated, said Australian Benen Huntley, who has been stranded in New Caledonia while on honeymoon with wife his Emily.\n\n\"My wife is quite upset, we just want to get home,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We opened our hotel door this morning and you could just see an enormous billow of smoke coming off a building in the distance.\"\n\nMore than 1,000 gendarmes and police from France were on patrol and another 600 would be added, France's high commission said.\n\nFrance's president, Emmanuel Macron, set off for the Pacific country late on Tuesday, his office said. He will meet elected officials and local representatives on Thursday for a day of talks focused on politics and on the reconstruction of the island, aides said.\n\nThe protests were sparked by anger among indigenous Kanak people over constitutional reform approved in Paris that would change who is allowed to take part in elections. Local leaders fear the change will dilute the Kanak vote.\n\nThree of the six people killed in the unrest were young Kanaks shot by armed civilians, and there have been confrontations between Kanak

of more than a week of deadly rioting in New Caledonia.\n\nRoyal Australian Air Force planes were sent to the French territory on Tuesday after the federal government was given clearance for two flights to bring back citizens.\n\nFadi Chemali, who was on the first plane to reach Australia, said those on board were filled with relief after days of failing to find a way off the island.\n\n\"Everyone clapped once we landed, we were all just so happy,\" he told AAP shortly after landing in Brisbane on Tuesday night.\n\nTheNightly\n\nGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nMr Chemali had been holidaying with his wife and young daughter for a week before the riots broke out and spent eight days scrambling to find a way home.\n\n\"I didn't see any of the violence up close but we heard a lot, including gunshots from where we were, it has been fairly intense.\"\n\nMr Chemali said he first believed French authorities would help tourists off the island before it became clear Australia needed to step in.\n\nAt least six people have died in the territory and hundreds have been injured since violence broke out last Monday.\n\nFrench troops are trying to stem further unrest, with buildings razed, shops looted and roads barricaded.\n\nAbout 300 Australians in New Caledonia are registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs.\n\nA Hercules military plane reached Noumea earlier on Tuesday after leaving RAAF Base Amberley near Ipswich, according to public flight data.\n\nIt can carry 124 passengers, according to the Defence Department.\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong said the government will continue to work with other countries on securing more flights.\n\n\"French authorities have advised they will conduct flights to enable the safe departure of foreign tourists from New Caledonia, commencing tomorrow,\" she wrote on social media platform X, adding Australia was ready to help.\n\nAustralia's Consul-General in New Caledonia, Annelise Young, posted on X her team had been working round the clock with teams in Canberra and Paris and closely with the French authorities to ensure safe passage for Australian tourists.\n\nSenator Wong spoke with her New Zealand and French counterparts on Monday to request access to the territory.\n\nNew rules changing who is allowed to participate in the nation's elections have been slammed by the Indigenous Kanak people, who fear their vote will be diluted by thousands of French nationals who have moved to the island.\n\nAbout 270 rioters have been arrested and a 12-hour curfew imposed from 6pm to 6am.\n\nFrance has sent more than 1000 security personnel, with hundreds more to join, in a bid to quell the unrest.\n\nThe reopening of the international airport for commercial flights will be reassessed on Thursday.\n\nAustralia has urged people to reconsider travel to New Caledonia.\n\nThose in the territory have been advised to limit their movement.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri":

It would be the first in a series of planned flights, Peters said.\n\n\"New Zealanders in New Caledonia have faced a challenging few days - and bringing them home has been an urgent priority for the government,\" Peters stated.\n\nThe evacuations come at a time when New Caledonia's international airport remains closed as protestors continue to block roads refusing to put an end to their demonstrations until their demands are met.\n\nRioting erupted last week before legislators in Paris voted on a plan allowing French people who have resided in New Caledonia for ten years to vote in provincial elections, which some local leaders believe will dilute the Kanak vote.\n\nProtests over the regulations became violent on Monday night, with firearms fired at security personnel, vehicles set ablaze, and shops looted in the worst unrest the French overseas territory has seen since the 1980s.\n\nFrance considered a law that would extend voting eligibility in local elections to French nationals who have resided in New Caledonia for more than ten years, a move critics believe will marginalize Indigenous people. Following prolonged debates, the National Assembly in Paris approved the amendment with 351 votes to 153.", "source": {"uri": "albawaba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Bawaba"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Winston Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Wong", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penny Wong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_France", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(New_Zealand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noum\u00e9a", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overseas France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/default/public/2024-05/AFP__20240521__34TD8TZ__v1__HighRes__FranceOverseasNcaledoniaPacificPoliticsConstitu.jpg?itok=5md8Rmmk", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580739", "eventUri": "eng-9580739", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

We continue to work on further flights,\" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on social media, announcing two initial flights.\n\nThe first transport with evacuees landed in Brisbane in eastern Australia around 7:00 pm (0900 GMT) Tuesday.\n\nA second C-130 was slated to land in Auckland, New Zealand around 1000 GMT, with Foreign Minister Winston Peters saying it would bring \"50 passengers with the most pressing needs\" and promising \"subsequent flights in coming days\".\n\nAustralian tourist Maxwell Winchester said he and his wife Tiffany were \"ecstatic\" to hear evacuation flights had begun after being stuck in a barricaded resort for a week.\n\nCharles Roger, director of New Caledonia's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) which operates Noumea's larger La Tontouta international airport, told AFP there would be no commercial flights there until Saturday morning.\n\n- Catapults -\n\nThe Pacific territory of 270,000 people has been in turmoil since May 13, when violence erupted over French plans to impose new voting rules that would give tens of thousands of non-indigenous residents voting rights.\n\nThe unrest has left six people dead, including two police, and hundreds injured.\n\nLocal prosecutors said Tuesday that around 400 shops and businesses had been damaged, many of them by fire, while the CCI on Monday tallied 150 businesses \"looted and set on fire\".\n\nThe French authorities in New Caledonia said police had so far arrested nearly 270 \"rioters\".\n\nTwenty-one supermarkets have been able to reopen and gradually restock, the French high commission said Tuesday.\n\nFrench forces were slowly restoring calm across the territory, clearing burned-out vehicles from roads, and deploying troops to protect public buildings, authorities said.\n\nFrench officials said at the weekend that security forces had destroyed 76 roadblocks along the critical 60-kilometre (40-mile) road from Noumea to La Tontouta airport.\n\nBut AFP journalists said many had quickly been rebuilt by Kanak militants.\n\nKanaks with scarfs over their faces, some armed with homemade catapults, were still manning a roadblock Tuesday on the road to the international airport.\n\nMore from this section Sean 'Diddy' Combs apologizes after video shows him assaulting partner Forever fad: Rubik says his cube 'reminds us why we have hands' 'Incognito Market' founder arrested in New York - Anger over vote reform -\n\nOne of several militants on the roadblock, a masked 25-year-old with sunglasses who gave only his first name, Stanley, said the proposed voting reform \"means the elimination of the Kanak people\".\n\n\"That's what they don't understand over there -- we are already in the minority in our own home,\" he told AFP.\n\nIndigenous Kanaks, who make up about 40 percent of the population, say the latest voting regulations would dilute their vote.\n\nBut more recent arrivals to the islands say they are being deprived of their right to take part in local elections.\n\nThe new law would extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least 10 years.\n\nProminent French figures including former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who followed the New Caledonia file closely while in office, have called for delay to the constitutional change.\n\n\"You can't make progress on the Caledonia file by issuing ultimatums,\" Valls said Sunday.\n\nBut anti-independence representatives want it pushed through.\n\nWithdrawing \"would prove the wreckers, the looters and the rioters right,\" said Nicolas Metzdorf, a New Caledonia MP for Macron's Renaissance party.\n\n\"Violence cannot replace the ballot box in a democracy,\" he added.\n\n- 'Madness' -\n\nIn the Noumea beachside suburb of Magenta, AFP journalists saw abandoned roadblocks and locals clearing up the streets.\n\n\"I am so happy to see this and for the madness to end,\" said one tearful resident who gave only her first name, Sylvie.\n\nFrance is considering extending a 12-day state of emergency, which has led to a night-time curfew, house arrests of suspected ringleaders, as well as a ban on TikTok, the sale of alcohol, carrying weapons and gatherings.\n\nNew Caledonia has been a French territory since the mid-1800s.\n\nBut almost two centuries on, opinion is split roughly along ethnic lines over whether the islands should be part of France, autonomous or independent.\n\nburs-djw/arb-tgb/as/db", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A defence force plane landed in Auckland with some 50 people on board, the New Zealand Herald reported.\n\nMore flights were expected in coming days to evacuate some 500 French and foreign tourists in total, France's High Commission in New Caledonia said.\n\nThe airport, shut since the start of the riots, remained closed for commercial flights.\n\nThe protests were sparked by anger among indigenous Kanak people over constitutional reform approved in Paris that would change who is allowed to take part in elections. Local leaders fear the change will dilute the Kanak vote.\n\nMacron will meet elected officials and local representatives on Thursday for a day of talks focused on politics and on the reconstruction of the island, aides said.\n\nMacron \"will discuss with all the forces in New Caledonia\", French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said. \"The objective is to ... prepare and anticipate reconstruction.\"\n\n\"The president is also going there to re-establish dialogue,\" Attal said.\n\nDIALOGUE\n\nInitial reaction showed renewing dialogue will not be an easy task, all the more so as pro-independence leaders blame the riots on Macron pushing through the electoral reform despite local opposition.\n\n\"Here comes the fireman after he set the fire!\" Jimmy Naouna, from the Front de Liberation Nationale Kanak et Socialiste (FLNKS) of New Caledonia, wrote on X about news of Macron's visit.\n\nFrance annexed New Caledonia in 1853 and gave the colony the status of overseas territory in 1946. New Caledonia is the world's No. 3 nickel miner but the sector is in crisis and one in five residents live under the poverty threshold.\n\nThe island lies some 20,000 km (12,430 miles) away from mainland France, and some 1,500 km (930 miles) east of Australia.\n\nThe opposition in Paris, former French prime ministers, and leaders of other Pacific islands have also said Macron should not go ahead with the electoral reform, which parliament in Paris adopted last Tuesday.\n\nVanuatu Foreign Minister Matai Seremaiah urged France to \"do the right thing, to resolve all outstanding decolonisation issues\" and seriously engage with Kanak leaders.\n\nEVACUATIONS\n\nAround 3,200 people were waiting to leave or enter New Caledonia after commercial flights were cancelled last week due to the unrest, the local government has said.\n\nAustralian officials said passengers were being prioritised based on need. Those left behind were frustrated, said Australian Benen Huntley, honeymooning with wife Emily.\n\n\"My wife is quite upset, we just want to get home,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We opened our hotel door this morning and you could just see an enormous billow of smoke coming off a building in the distance.\"\n\nQueueing to buy bread, the Adelaide couple had seen dozens of gendarmes guarding a petrol station.\n\nOver 1,000 gendarmes and police from France were on patrol and another 600 would be added, France's High Commission said.\n\nThree of the six people killed in the unrest were young Kanaks shot by armed civilians, and there have been confrontations between Kanak protesters and armed self-defence groups or civilian militias formed to protect themselves.\n\n\"The French Government doesn't know how to control people here,\" said Viro Xulue, part of a community group providing social assistance to other Kanaks. He said it felt like a return to the civil war of the 1980s and people were scared.\n\nThe situation on the ground was improving but much more needed to be done, French government spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot said.\n\n(Reporting by Kirsty Needham, Lucy Craymer and Jill Gralow in Sydney, Tassilo Hummel, Ingrid Melander, Augustin Turpin in Paris; writing by Ingrid Melander and Kirsty Needham;

We continue to work on further flights,\" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on social media, announcing two initial flights.\n\nThe first transport with evacuees landed in Brisbane in eastern Australia around 7:00 pm (0900 GMT) Tuesday.\n\nA second C-130 was slated to land in Auckland, New Zealand around 1000 GMT, with Foreign Minister Winston Peters saying it would bring \"50 passengers with the most pressing needs\" and promising \"subsequent flights in coming days\".\n\nAustralian tourist Maxwell Winchester said he and his wife Tiffany were \"ecstatic\" to hear evacuation flights had begun after being stuck in a barricaded resort for a week.\n\nCharles Roger, director of New Caledonia's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) which operates Noumea's larger La Tontouta international airport, told AFP there would be no commercial flights there until Saturday morning.\n\n- Catapults -\n\nThe Pacific territory of 270,000 people has been in turmoil since May 13, when violence erupted over French plans to impose new voting rules that would give tens of thousands of non-indigenous residents voting rights.\n\nThe unrest has left six people dead, including two police, and hundreds injured.\n\nLocal prosecutors said Tuesday that around 400 shops and businesses had been damaged, many of them by fire, while the CCI on Monday tallied 150 businesses \"looted and set on fire\".\n\nThe French authorities in New Caledonia said police had so far arrested nearly 270 \"rioters\".\n\nTwenty-one supermarkets have been able to reopen and gradually restock, the French high commission said Tuesday.\n\nFrench forces were slowly restoring calm across the territory, clearing burned-out vehicles from roads, and deploying troops to protect public buildings, authorities said.\n\nFrench officials said at the weekend that security forces had destroyed 76 roadblocks along the critical 60-kilometre (40-mile) road from Noumea to La Tontouta airport.\n\nBut AFP journalists said many had quickly been rebuilt by Kanak militants.\n\nKanaks with scarfs over their faces, some armed with homemade catapults, were still manning a roadblock Tuesday on the road to the international airport.\n\n- Anger over vote reform -\n\nOne of several militants on the roadblock, a masked 25-year-old with sunglasses who gave only his first name, Stanley, said the proposed voting reform \"means the elimination of the Kanak people\".\n\n\"That's what they don't understand over there -- we are already in the minority in our own home,\" he told AFP.\n\nIndigenous Kanaks, who make up about 40 percent of the population, say the latest voting regulations would dilute their vote.\n\nBut more recent arrivals to the islands say they are being deprived of their right to take part in local elections.\n\nThe new law would extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least 10 years.\n\nProminent French figures including former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who followed the New Caledonia file closely while in office, have called for delay to the constitutional change.\n\n\"You can't make progress on the Caledonia file by issuing ultimatums,\" Valls said Sunday.\n\nBut anti-independence representatives want it pushed through.\n\nWithdrawing \"would prove the wreckers, the looters and the rioters right,\" said Nicolas Metzdorf, a New Caledonia MP for Macron's Renaissance party.\n\n\"Violence cannot replace the ballot box in a democracy,\" he added.\n\n- 'Madness' -\n\nIn the Noumea beachside suburb of Magenta, AFP journalists saw abandoned roadblocks and locals clearing up the streets.\n\n\"I am so happy to see this and for the madness to end,\" said one tearful resident who gave only her first name, Sylvie.\n\nFrance is considering extending a 12-day state of emergency, which has led to a night-time curfew, house arrests of suspected ringleaders, as well as a ban on TikTok, the sale of alcohol, carrying weapons and gatherings.\n\nNew Caledonia has been a French territory since the mid-1800s.\n\nBut almost two centuries on, opinion is split roughly along ethnic lines over whether the islands should be part of France, autonomous or independent.\n\nburs-djw/arb-tgb/as/db\n\nMore from this section\n\nScottie Scheffler's Louisville court date postponed after arrest during PGA Championship Montana's attorney

The island's business chamber said 150 companies had been looted and burnt.\n\nSpeaking after a cabinet meeting, French government spokesman Prisca Thevenot said Macron would travel to \"set up a mission,\" without saying what it could entail.\n\nSome politicians have called for veteran politicians to be named as mediators, but Thevenot did not say if this was what Macron had in mind.\n\n\"Our priority is the return to calm and order,\" Thevenot said, noting the situation on the ground was improving but more needed to be done.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand have already begun evacuating nationals from New Caledonia.\n\nAround 3,200 people are waiting to leave or enter New Caledonia after commercial flights were cancelled last week due to the unrest, the local government has said.\n\n\"New Zealanders in New Caledonia have faced a challenging few days - and bringing them home has been an urgent priority for the government,\" New Zealand foreign minister Winston Peters said.\n\nThe New Zealand Herald reported that a defence force plane had landed in Auckland with some 50 citizens evacuated from New Caledonia. Further flights were expected in the coming days.\n\nAustralia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said clearance had been received for two Australian government assisted-departure flights on Tuesday for tourists wanting to leave.\n\nFrance's High Commission in New Caledonia said the airport remained closed for commercial flights, and it will deploy the military to protect public buildings.\n\nMORE POLICE\n\nAustralian officials said passengers were being prioritised based on need. Those left behind were frustrated, said Australian Benen Huntley, honeymooning with wife Emily.\n\n\"My wife is quite upset, we just want to get home,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We opened our hotel door this morning and you could just see an enormous billow of smoke coming off a building in the distance.\"\n\nQueueing to buy bread, the Adelaide couple had seen dozens of gendarmes guarding a petrol station.\n\nOver 1,000 gendarmes and police from France were at work, and another 600 personnel would be added, France's High Commission said.\n\nThe commission asked French residents who normally live outside New Caledonia to register their details for support to return home.\n\nProtests erupted last week, sparked by anger among indigenous Kanak people over a constitutional amendment approved in France that would change who is allowed to participate in elections. Local leaders fear the change will dilute the Kanak vote.\n\nViro Xulue, part of a community group providing social assistance to other Kanaks, said it felt like a return to the civil war of the 1980s, and people were scared.\n\n\"We are really scared about the police, the French soldiers, and we are scared about the anti-Kanak militia terrorist group,\" Xulue told Reuters in a video interview.\n\nThree of the six people killed in the unrest were young Kanaks shot by armed civilians, and there have been confrontations between Kanak protesters and armed self-defence groups or civilian militias formed to protect themselves.\n\n\"The French Government doesn't know how to control people here. They send more than 2,000 military to control, but it fails,\" Xulue said.\n\nPro-independence political parties say they want the French government to withdraw the electoral reform before they restart talks, while France said re-establishing order was a precondition to dialogue.\n\n(Reporting by Kirsty Needham, Lucy Craymer and Jill Gralow in Sydney, Tassilo Hummel, Augustin Turpin, Nicolas

Local prosecutors say around 400 shops and businesses have been damaged.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is expected to land tomorrow in New Caledonia, where the unrest has raised new questions about Macron's handling of France's colonial legacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany Kanaks, who make up about 40 percent of the population, oppose the plan to extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least 10 years.\n\nBut anti-independence representatives want it pushed through.\n\nKanak separatists, some masked and wielding homemade catapults, are manning multiple makeshift roadblocks, including on the main route to the international airport.\n\nEvacuations\n\nAustralian Pacific minister Pat Conroy said 84 of the passengers who were flown on two Royal Australian Airforce C-130 Hercules late yesterday from the capital Noumea to the Australian east coast city of Brisbane were Australian citizens.\n\nConroy did not say what nationalities were among the remaining 31 passengers but he said Australia had reciprocal arrangements with Canada and Japan to help their citizens in crises.\n\nMore than 200 other Australians were registered with Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs to leave the South Pacific territory, where a 12-day state of emergency has been declared.\n\n\"We've prioritised the elderly, the pregnant and the most vulnerable,\" Conroy told Nine Network television.\n\nA New Zealand Defence Force C-130 Hercules flew 48 passengers \"with the most pressing needs\" from Noumea to the New Zealand city of Auckland last night, the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement.\n\nA French-operated flight will bring stranded New Zealanders home via Brisbane later today, according to the statement.

rules that would give tens of thousands of non-indigenous residents voting rights.\n\nThe unrest has left six people dead, including two police, and hundreds injured.\n\nThe French authorities in New Caledonia said police had so far arrested nearly 270 \"rioters\".\n\nTwenty-one supermarkets have been able to reopen and gradually restock, the French high commission said Tuesday.\n\nFrench forces were slowly restoring calm across the territory, clearing burned-out vehicles from roads, and deploying troops to protect public buildings, authorities said.\n\nFrench officials said at the weekend that security forces had destroyed 76 roadblocks along the critical 60-kilometre (40-mile) road from the capital Noumea to La Tontouta International Airport.\n\nBut AFP journalists said many had quickly been rebuilt by Kanak militants.\n\nKanaks with scarfs over their faces, some armed with homemade catapults, were still manning a roadblock Tuesday on the road to the international airport, which is closed to commercial flights until at least Thursday.\n\n- Anger over vote reform - More from this section Schauffele makes the putt of his life for first major win DWP says bank account

masked 25-year-old with sunglasses who gave only his first name Stanley, said the proposed voting reform \"means the elimination of the Kanak people\".\n\n\"That's what they don't understand over there -- we are already in the minority in our own home,\" he told AFP.\n\nAnother masked man, a 34-year-old who also divulged only his first name, Simon, said they were letting drivers pass through the roadblock, and some people were giving them bread and water.\n\n\"It's calm, the regulars already know us on the barricades,\" he said.\n\nIndigenous Kanaks, who make up about 40 percent of the population, say the latest voting regulations would dilute their vote.\n\nBut more recent arrivals to the islands say they are being deprived of their right to take part in local elections.\n\nThe new law would extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least 10 years.\n\n- 'Madness' -\n\nIn the Noumea beachside suburb of Magenta, AFP journalists saw abandoned roadblocks and locals clearing up the streets.\n\n\"I am so happy to see this and for the madness to end,\" said one tearful resident who gave only her first name Sylvie.\n\nThe New Caledonian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reported \"catastrophic\" economic damage from the unrest, with 150 businesses \"looted and set on fire\".\n\nFrance is considering extending a 12-day state of emergency, which has led to a night-time curfew, house arrests of suspected ringleaders, and bans on TikTok, the sale of alcohol, carrying weapons and gatherings.\n\nNew Caledonia has been a French territory since the mid-1800s.\n\nBut almost two centuries on, opinion is split roughly along ethnic lines over whether the islands should be part of France, autonomous or independent.\n\nburs-djw/arb/cwl",

Peters acknowledged that New Zealanders in New Caledonia \"have faced a challenging few days\" and that bringing them home \"has been an urgent priority\" for Wellington.\n\nAt least six people have been killed and hundreds more wounded since violence broke out last Monday over a bill under debate in the French parliament that would allow French-born residents who have lived in New Caledonia for 10 years to vote in local elections.\n\nLeaders of the island's pro-independence movement say the measure would dilute the voting power of the indigenous Kanak people, who have suffered under decades of discrimination.\n\nFrance's National Assembly approved the measure last week by a vote of 351-153. The bill still must be approved in a special session of both houses of parliament next month.\n\nScores of homes and businesses have been looted and burned in Noumea, prompting authorities to impose a dusk-to-dawn curfew and a ban on public gatherings. The violence has also prompted the closure of schools and businesses, as well as the island's airport. France has deployed more than 1,000 security personnel to help end the unrest, with hundreds more due to arrive Tuesday.\n\nAt least 270 people have been arrested.\n\nFrance agreed in 1998 to grant New Caledonia more political power and autonomy and to hold three referendums over the island's status.

least 300 Australian travellers have been stuck in or near the capital of Noumea since violent protests erupted last Monday, with some saying they have been unable to access essential medications or food.\n\nAfter several days of pressing the French government, the Federal Government received permission to send two military transport planes to pick up the first of the evacuees.\n\nThe father and son live on the Gold Coast and have worked in the nickel mining industry in New Caledonia for 20 years.\n\nGary Salmon told the ABC he hasn't seen anything like the current unrest.\n\n\"It's very unfortunate what's happening there at the moment, it's such a beautiful country,\" he said.\n\n\"I'd hate to estimate the damage over there, it won't be millions, it'll be billions.\"\n\nChris said he and his father were grateful the Australian government responded so quickly.\n\n\"Everyone was just so relieved to have that Australian support ... when Canberra kicked into gear with DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) and they got their comms going they really did a good job as well, so really happy,\" he said.\n\nMary Hatten and her family were trying to have a holiday when the riots erupted.\n\nShe said the Australian government should have done more to warn travelers of the potential unrest.\n\n\"By Tuesday morning quite frankly the place was just in a mess, which was very sad for the locals, for the tourist industry, and I suppose to some extent for our own personal enjoyment, we were pretty much confined to the hotel,\" Ms Hatten said.\n\n\"We had a lot of discussions with local business operators and also a couple of people that we met who were expats, working there ... for four or five years and they sort of said 'it's been on the cards, things have been brewing'.\n\n\"I'm sort of thinking to myself, well, maybe the travel warning should be a lot greater.\"\n\nA similar flight carrying about 50 New Zealand citizens landed in Auckland on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have contacted Australians in New Caledonia saying that French authorities will conduct further evacuation flights from the country on Wednesday local time.\n\n\"Pending further updates from French authorities, we will contact you with more details on their flight arrangements,\" the communication said.\n\nDFAT said flights could come at short notice and people needed to be preapred to leave.\n\n\"The Australian Government also stands ready to assist with further flights should French authorities grant approval.\"\n\nDFAT has also told Australians outside the capital that safe passage back to Noumea would be facilitated by French authoritie in coming days.\n\nIt said it was seeking further guidance on the arrangements.\n\nThose still waiting for a way out were frustrated.\n\nAustralian Benen Huntley had been honeymooning with his wife Emily.\n\n\"My wife is quite upset, we just want to get home,\" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.\n\nQueueing to buy bread, the Adelaide couple had seen dozens of gendarmes guarding a petrol station.\n\nLocal authorities said nearly 300 people had been arrested since the violence began last week.\n\nAs some Australians began arriving home, French President Emmanuel Macron was preparing to depart for New Caledonia.\n\nGovernment spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot said on Tuesday that Mr Macron \"will leave as soon as this evening\".\n\nThe announcement came after a Cabinet meeting in which Mr Macron announced he had decided to travel there himself.\n\nMs Thevenot said Mr Macron was travelling to New Caledonia to \"set up a mission\".\n\nSome politicians have called for veteran politicians to be named as mediators between opposing sides but Ms Thevenot did not say if that is what the French president had in mind.\n\nShe gave no details about how long Mr Macron will stay or who he will meet.\n\n\"Faced with the outbreak of violence, the priority is the return of order to allow dialogue to resume in New Caledonia,\" Ms Thevenot said.\n\nMr Macron had previously been scheduled to be in Normandy in northern France on Wednesday.\n\nHis surprise visit comes after violent riots left six people dead and hundreds of others injured.\n\nNew Caledonia, with a population of about 270,000, has been rocked by unrest sparked by French plans to impose new rules that would give tens of thousands of non-Indigenous residents voting rights.\n\nPro-independence groups say any such move would dilute the indigenous Kanak vote.\n\nFrance has sent 1,000 armed police, troops, and national security reinforcements to its overseas territory.\n\nA state of emergency, overnight curfew and a ban on TikTok has done little to quell the unrest.", "source": {"uri":

Those who support it point out that New Caledonia has now rejected independence three times in successive referendums, the latest in 2021, and that 20 per cent of the population are unable to vote despite paying taxes and contributing to the local economy.\n\nMr Macron has pledged to validate the contested electoral reform \"before the end of June\" by senators and deputies during a special congress but \"the executive is continuing ... to build a political solution for the territory\", said a spokesman.\n\nProminent French figures including former prime minister Manuel Valls, who followed the New Caledonia dossier closely while in office, have called for delay to the constitutional change.\n\n\"You can't make progress on the Caledonia file by issuing ultimatums,\" Mr Valls said on Sunday.\n\nBut anti-independence representatives want it pushed through. Withdrawing \"would prove the wreckers, the looters and the rioters right,\" said Nicolas Metzdorf, a New Caledonia MP for Macron's Renaissance party.\n\n\"Violence cannot replace the ballot box in a democracy,\" he added.\n\nNew Caledonia has been a French territory since the mid-1800s. But almost two centuries on, opinion is split roughly along ethnic lines over whether the islands should be part of France, autonomous or independent.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

The island's business chamber said 150 companies had been looted and burnt.\n\nSpeaking after a cabinet meeting, French government spokesman Prisca Thevenot said Macron would travel to \"set up a mission,\" without saying what it could entail.\n\nSome politicians have called for veteran politicians to be named as mediators, but Thevenot did not say if this was what Macron had in mind.\n\n\"Our priority is the return to calm and order,\" Thevenot said, noting the situation on the ground was improving but more needed to be done.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand have already begun evacuating nationals from New Caledonia.\n\nAround 3,200 people are waiting to leave or enter New Caledonia after commercial flights were cancelled last week due to the unrest, the local government has said.\n\n\"New Zealanders in New Caledonia have faced a challenging few days - and bringing them home has been an urgent priority for the government,\" New Zealand foreign minister Winston Peters said.\n\nThe New Zealand Herald reported that a defence force plane had landed in Auckland with some 50 citizens evacuated from New Caledonia. Further flights were expected in the coming days.\n\nAustralia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said clearance had been received for two Australian government assisted-departure flights on Tuesday for tourists wanting to leave.\n\nFrance's High Commission in New Caledonia said the airport remained closed for commercial flights, and it will deploy the military to protect public buildings.\n\nMORE POLICE\n\nAustralian officials said passengers were being prioritised based on need. Those left behind were frustrated, said Australian Benen Huntley, honeymooning with wife Emily.\n\n\"My wife is quite upset, we just want to get home,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We opened our hotel door this morning and you could just see an enormous billow of smoke coming off a building in the distance.\"\n\nQueueing to buy bread, the Adelaide couple had seen dozens of gendarmes guarding a petrol station.\n\nOver 1,000 gendarmes and police from France were at work, and another 600 personnel would be added, France's High Commission said.\n\nThe commission asked French residents who normally live outside New Caledonia to register their details for support to return home.\n\nProtests erupted last week, sparked by anger among indigenous Kanak people over a constitutional amendment approved in France that would change who is allowed to participate in elections. Local leaders fear the change will dilute the Kanak vote.\n\nViro Xulue, part of a community group providing social assistance to other Kanaks, said it felt like a return to the civil war of the 1980s, and people were scared.\n\n\"We are really scared about the police, the French soldiers, and we are scared about the anti-Kanak militia terrorist group,\" Xulue told Reuters in a video interview.\n\nThree of the six people killed in the unrest were young Kanaks shot by armed civilians, and there have been confrontations between Kanak protesters and armed self-defence groups or civilian militias formed to protect themselves.\n\n\"The French Government doesn't know how to control people here. They send more than 2,000 military to control, but it fails,\" Xulue said.\n\nPro-independence political parties say they want the French government to withdraw the electoral reform before they restart talks, while France said re-establishing order was a precondition to dialogue.\n\n(Reporting by Kirsty Needham, Lucy Craymer and Jill Gralow in Sydney, Tassilo Hummel, Augustin Turpin, Nicolas Delame, Ingrid Melander in Paris; Editing by Michael Perry and Christina Fincher)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

We continue to work on further flights,\" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on social media, announcing two initial flights.\n\nNew Zealand is sending one military plane to repatriate \"50 passengers with the most pressing needs\" to Auckland, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.\n\n\"In cooperation with France and Australia we are working on subsequent flights in coming days,\" he said, describing the situation in New Caledonia as \"dynamic\".\n\nAustralian tourist Maxwell Winchester said he and his wife Tiffany were \"ecstatic\" to hear evacuation flights had begun after being stuck in a barricaded resort for a week.\n\n- Catapults -\n\nThe Pacific territory of 270,000 people has been in turmoil since May 13, when violence erupted over French plans to impose new voting rules that would give tens of thousands of non-indigenous residents voting rights.\n\nThe unrest has left six people dead, including two police, and hundreds injured.\n\nThe French authorities in New Caledonia said police had so far arrested nearly 270 \"rioters\".\n\nTwenty-one supermarkets have been able to reopen and gradually restock, the French high commission said Tuesday.\n\nFrench forces were slowly restoring calm across the territory, clearing burned-out vehicles from roads, and deploying troops to protect public buildings, authorities said.\n\nFrench officials said at the weekend that security forces had destroyed 76 roadblocks along the critical 60-kilometre (40-mile) road from the capital Noumea to La Tontouta International Airport.\n\nBut AFP journalists said many had quickly been rebuilt by Kanak militants.\n\nKanaks with scarfs over their faces, some armed with homemade catapults, were still manning a roadblock Tuesday on the road to the international airport, which is closed to commercial flights until at least Thursday.\n\n- Anger over vote reform -\n\nOne of several militants on the roadblock, a masked 25-year-old with sunglasses who gave only his first name Stanley, said the proposed voting reform \"means the elimination of the Kanak people\".\n\n\"That's what they don't understand over there -- we are already in the minority in our own home,\" he told AFP.\n\nAnother masked man, a 34-year-old who also divulged only his first name, Simon, said they were letting drivers pass through the roadblock, and some people were giving them bread and water.\n\n\"It's calm, the regulars already know us on the barricades,\" he said.\n\nIndigenous Kanaks, who make up about 40 percent of the population, say the latest voting regulations would dilute their vote.\n\nBut more recent arrivals to the islands say they are being deprived of their right to take part in local elections.\n\nThe new law would extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least 10 years.\n\n- 'Madness' -\n\nIn the Noumea beachside suburb of Magenta, AFP journalists saw abandoned roadblocks and locals clearing up the streets.\n\n\"I am so happy to see this and for the madness to end,\" said one tearful resident who gave only her first name Sylvie.\n\nThe New Caledonian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reported \"catastrophic\" economic damage from the unrest, with 150 businesses \"looted and set on fire\".\n\nFrance is considering extending a 12-day state of emergency, which has led to a night-time curfew, house arrests of suspected ringleaders, and bans on TikTok, the sale of alcohol, carrying weapons and gatherings.\n\nNew Caledonia has been a French territory since the mid-1800s.\n\nBut almost two centuries on, opinion is

Gendarmes had dismantled 76 roadblocks.\n\nBut pro-independence forces on Monday vowed to maintain roadblocks that have paralysed parts of the territory.\n\nThe airport, with routes to Australia, Singapore, New Zealand and other destinations, closed on Tuesday as protests against voting reforms opposed by pro-independence supporters degenerated into widespread violence, leaving a vast trail of destruction. Six people have been killed and hundreds injured.\n\nA reopening of the Noum\u00e9a-La Tontouta airport could allow stranded tourists to escape from the island where armed clashes, arson and looting has prompted France to impose a state of emergency.\n\nRoughly 3,000 tourists are thought to be marooned in New Caledonia, according to AFP, including more than 300 Australians and nearly 250 New Zealanders.\n\nAustralia's prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the situation in New Caledonia was \"deeply concerning\".\n\nAfter a night when there was fire and looting, Albanese told ABC radio on Monday that Australia had been seeking approval from French authorities for two days to send an evacuation flight to New Caledonia to pick up tourists stranded in hotels.\n\n\"We continue to pursue approvals because the Australian defence force is ready to fly when it's permitted to do so,\" Albanese said.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Australia and New Zealand said they were seeking French permission to fly out their nationals.\n\n\"French authorities advise the situation on the ground is preventing flights.

Shops have been looted and burnt out.\"\n\nAustralian Tonia Scholes spoke to the Project program on Sunday, and said Noumea \"was like a war zone\".\n\n\"There's burnt cars, there's barricades, there's remnants of fires, there's people standing on street corners drinking hard liquor and having what almost seems like a party,\" she said.\n\nShe said local residents in the neighbourhood where she was staying with friends had taken security into their own hands.\n\n\"They have all banded together to protect what is theirs and they have 24-hour watches, they walk the streets with big torches. That's actually our neighbours protecting us, which is just amazing that they've embraced us in their neighbourhood, a bunch of Australian girls here for a week and they're just like 'don't worry we've got your back'.\"\n\nBut Scholes said getting solid information from the Australian government about evacuation options had been difficult.\n\n\"We're just hoping and waiting for a phone call to say we've got some way of getting you out.\"\n\nBrisbane woman Sophie Jones Bradshaw flew to New Caledonia - to where she had travelled for more than 20 years - for work on 11 May, just before the outbreak of rioting. She was now separated from her family, with no idea when they would be reunited.\n\n\"It's getting really hard to see my son every day on the camera,\" Jones Bradshaw told AAP.\n\n\"I'm crying because he wants me to go home - I'm telling him 'oh just one more sleep, one more sleep', but I don't know.\"\n\nJones Bradshaw said the Caledonian capital was \"desolation, it's chaos - it's frightening\". \"It feels like a no man's land.\"\n\nShe said half of Noumea has been burnt, with homes and businesses razed across the city.\n\n\"You have to go further and further out to find a shop that hasn't been burned or is not closed.\n\n\"In the middle of all that, you can still hear explosions every now and then.

territory", "body": "Emmanuel Macron is heading to the Pacific overseas territory after riots claimed the lives of six people and forced hundred to evacuate\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is heading to the Pacific islands of New Caledonia after days of riots have left six dead, hundreds injured and forced tourists to evacuate.\n\nUnrest began in New Caledonia, a French overseas territory, last week after electoral changes were voted through by the French government in Paris.\n\nFrance declared a 12-day minimum state of emergency last Wednesday and sent more than 1,000 gendarmes and police to the area, another 600 personnel are on their way to deal with the violence.\n\nNow military aircraft from Australia and New Zealand have flown to the capital Noumea to airlift stranded foreign nationals and tourists on the islands.\n\nThe streets are littered with burnt out vehicles and businesses, while shops have been looted and the main airport closed to commercial flights as demonstrators have set up blockades on the roads.\n\nNew Caledonia is a group of islands between Australia and New Zealand in the Pacific ocean, west of Fiji and south of Vanuatu, with a population of around 270,000.\n\nIt is made up of the main island, known as Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands and the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines and a few remote islets.\n\nBritish explorer James Cook was the first European to discover the islands in 1774, naming it New Caledonia because the north-east of the main island reminded him of Scotland.\n\nIn 1853, Napolean III took possession of the islands and it became a French penal colony.\n\nThen in 1946 it was declared a French overseas territory, and French citizenship was granted to all New Caledonians, regardless of ethnicity, from 1953.\n\nBetween 1976 and 1988, there was a period of unrest known as \"the Events\" as the French government clashed with the indigenous Kanak people's independence movement.\n\nStability was resumed with the Matignon Agreements in 1988, and the Noumea Accord in 1998 lay the foundations for a 20-year transition transferring more power to the local government.\n\nThe latest uprising, which began on 13 May, was sparked by anger among the Kanak people over a constitutional amendment approved in France, which would change who is allowed to participate in elections.\n\nLocal leaders fear the changes will dilute the Kanak vote as the new amendment allows those who have lived in New Caledonia for at least 10 years to get a vote.\n\nPreviously, European arrivals from France post-1998 were excluded from the vote.\n\nOpponents claim the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia and further marginalise Kanaks, who once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination.\n\nViro Xulue, part of a community group providing social assistance to other Kanaks, said it felt like a return to the civil war of the 1980s, and people were scared.\n\n\"We are really scared about the police, the French soldiers, and we are scared about the anti-Kanak militia terrorist group,\" he said.\n\nPro-independence political parties say they want the French government to withdraw the electoral reform before they restart talks.\n\n\"We need strong actions [from the government] to calm the situation ... this is a political, not a security issue,\" said Dominique Fochi, secretary general of the pro-independence Caledonian Union.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said re-establishing order was a precondition to dialogue.\n\nWhile French government spokesman Prisca Thevenot said Mr Macron was travelling to the islands to \"set up a mission\" and the \"priority is the return to calm and order\".", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sally_guyoncourt@inews.co.uk", "name": "Sally Guyoncourt", "type":

stuck in a barricaded resort for a week.\n\n- Catapults -\n\nThe Pacific territory of 270,000 people has been in turmoil since May 13, when violence erupted over French plans to impose new voting rules that would give tens of thousands of non-indigenous residents voting rights.\n\nThe unrest has left six people dead, including two police, and hundreds injured.\n\nThe French authorities in New Caledonia said police had so far arrested nearly 270 \"rioters\".\n\nTwenty-one supermarkets have been able to reopen and gradually restock, the French high commission said Tuesday.\n\nFrench forces were slowly restoring calm across the territory, clearing burned-out vehicles from roads, and deploying troops to protect public buildings, authorities said.\n\nFrench officials said at the weekend that security forces had destroyed 76 roadblocks along the critical 60-kilometre (40-mile) road from the capital Noumea to La Tontouta International Airport.\n\nBut AFP journalists said many had quickly been rebuilt by Kanak militants.\n\nKanaks with scarfs over their faces, some armed with homemade catapults, were still manning a roadblock Tuesday on the road to the international airport, which is closed to commercial flights until at least Thursday.\n\n- Anger over vote reform -\n\nOne of several militants on the roadblock, a masked 25-year-old with sunglasses who gave only his first name Stanley, said the proposed voting reform \"means the elimination of the Kanak people\".\n\n\"That's what they don't understand over there -- we are already in the minority in our own home,\" he told AFP.\n\nAnother masked man, a 34-year-old who also divulged only his first name, Simon, said they were letting drivers pass through the roadblock, and some people were giving them bread and water.\n\n\"It's calm, the regulars already know us on the barricades,\" he said.\n\nIndigenous Kanaks, who make up about 40 percent of the population, say the latest voting regulations would dilute their vote.\n\nBut more recent arrivals to the islands say they are being deprived of their right to take part in local elections.\n\nThe new law would extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least 10 years.\n\n- 'Madness' -\n\nIn the Noumea beachside suburb of Magenta, AFP journalists saw abandoned roadblocks and locals clearing up the streets.\n\n\"I am so happy to see this and for the madness to end,\" said one tearful resident who gave only her first name Sylvie.\n\nThe New Caledonian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reported \"catastrophic\" economic damage from the unrest, with 150 businesses \"looted and set on fire\".\n\nFrance is considering extending a 12-day state of emergency, which has led to a night-time curfew, house arrests of suspected ringleaders, and bans on TikTok, the sale of alcohol, carrying weapons and gatherings.\n\nNew Caledonia has been a French territory since the mid-1800s.\n\nBut almost two centuries on, opinion is

stuck in a barricaded resort for a week.\n\n- Catapults -\n\nThe Pacific territory of 270,000 people has been in turmoil since May 13, when violence erupted over French plans to impose new voting rules that would give tens of thousands of non-indigenous residents voting rights.\n\nThe unrest has left six people dead, including two police, and hundreds injured.\n\nThe French authorities in New Caledonia said police had so far arrested nearly 270 \"rioters\".\n\nTwenty-one supermarkets have been able to reopen and gradually restock, the French high commission said Tuesday.\n\nFrench forces were slowly restoring calm across the territory, clearing burned-out vehicles from roads, and deploying troops to protect public buildings, authorities said.\n\nFrench officials said at the weekend that security forces had destroyed 76 roadblocks along the critical 60-kilometre (40-mile) road from the capital Noumea to La Tontouta International Airport.\n\nBut AFP journalists said many had quickly been rebuilt by Kanak militants.\n\nKanaks with scarfs over their faces, some armed with homemade catapults, were still manning a roadblock Tuesday on the road to the international airport, which is closed to commercial flights until at least Thursday.\n\n- Anger over vote reform -\n\nOne of several militants on the roadblock, a masked 25-year-old with sunglasses who gave only his first name Stanley, said the proposed voting reform \"means the elimination of the Kanak people\".\n\n\"That's what they don't understand over there -- we are already in the minority in our own home,\" he told AFP.\n\nAnother masked man, a 34-year-old who also divulged only his first name, Simon, said they were letting drivers pass through the roadblock, and some people were giving them bread and water.\n\n\"It's calm, the regulars already know us on the barricades,\" he said.\n\nIndigenous Kanaks, who make up about 40 percent of the population, say the latest voting regulations would dilute their vote.\n\nBut more recent arrivals to the islands say they are being deprived of their right to take part in local elections.\n\nThe new law would extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least 10 years.\n\n- 'Madness' -\n\nIn the Noumea beachside suburb of Magenta, AFP journalists saw abandoned roadblocks and locals clearing up the streets.\n\n\"I am so happy to see this and for the madness to end,\" said one tearful resident who gave only her first name Sylvie.\n\nThe New Caledonian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reported \"catastrophic\" economic damage from the unrest, with 150 businesses \"looted and set on fire\".\n\nFrance is considering extending a 12-day state of emergency, which has led to a night-time curfew, house arrests of suspected ringleaders, and bans on TikTok, the sale of alcohol, carrying weapons and gatherings.\n\nNew Caledonia has been a French territory since the mid-1800s.\n\nBut almost two centuries on, opinion is split roughly along ethnic lines over whether the islands should be part of France, autonomous or independent.\n\nburs-djw/arb/cwl\n\nFOX41 Yakima\u00a9FOX11 TriCities\u00a9", "source": {"uri":

The high commission said efforts were under way to clear the remaining barriers and remove the burned-out vehicles and other debris.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand, meanwhile, sent their first military planes to New Caledonia to evacuate their nationals.\n\nAn Australian C-130 Hercules aircraft landed at Noumea's Magenta airport, which usually handles domestic traffic, on Tuesday afternoon, the AFP news agency reported.\n\n\"Passengers are being prioritised based on need. We continue to work on further flights,\" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on social media, announcing two initial flights.\n\nNew Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters, meanwhile, said the first military aircraft would repatriate \"50 passengers with the most pressing needs\" to Auckland. He said more flights were scheduled for the coming days.\n\nThe civil disturbances are the worst in the territory of some 270,000 people since the 1980s and reflect concerns among the Indigenous Kanak community, who make up about 40 percent of the population, that changes to the electoral system will dilute their vote and political influence.\n\nThe voting system for provincial elections was established in the 1998 Noumea Accord, a result of the previous unrest, and excluded later European arrivals from France. Under the new constitutional amendment, those who have lived in New Caledonia for at least 10 years will get a vote.\n\nViro Xulue, part of a community group providing social assistance to other Kanak amid the crisis, said it felt like a return to the civil war of the 1980s, and people were scared.\n\n\"We are really scared about the police, the French soldiers, and we are scared about the anti-Kanak militia terrorist group,\" Xulue told the Reuters news agency in a video interview.\n\nThree of the six people killed in the unrest were young Kanak and were shot by armed civilians. There have also been confrontations between Kanak protesters and armed self-defence groups or civilian militias formed to protect themselves, France's High Commission said previously.\n\nFrench officials said at the weekend that security forces had dismantled 76 barricades set up along the 60km (40-mile) road from Noumea to the international airport, but AFP reported some had been rebuilt.\n\nOne was being manned by a group of masked Kanak people, some of whom were carrying home-made catapults.\n\nA masked 25-year-old with sunglasses who gave only his first name Stanley told AFP that the proposed voting reform meant \"the elimination of the Kanak people\".\n\n\"That's what they don't understand over there - we are already in the minority in our own home,\" he said.",

Over 1,000 security reinforcements have been deployed, with barricades being cleared and arrests made. Pro-independence groups seek electoral reform, fearing dilution of indigenous Kanak votes.\n\nProtesters and a thousand French police reinforcements were playing a \"game of cat and mouse\" in New Caledonia, ahead of the arrival of France's President Emmanuel Macron after the worst riots in 40 years in the French territory, pro-independence groups said on Wednesday.\n\nFrance's High Commission said Macron would be accompanied by ministers for defence and interior for Thursday's talks, and some 100 members of the GIGN or elite tactical response group were deployed in New Caledonia. More than 1,000 security reinforcements from France were on the ground, some 90 barricades had been cleared from roads, and the night had been calmer despite two fires in Noumea, the high commission said on Wednesday. Some 20 arrests were made yesterday, with 280 rioters arrested in the past week.\n\nJimmy Naouna, from the Front de Liberation Nationale Kanak et Socialiste (FLNKS) of New Caledonia, said the pro-independence political party had called for protesters to remove road blocks, which are restricting movement and supply of food in the capital Noumea, yet they continue to appear overnight. \"The police forces go around clearing these barricades but the youth right after that, they put them up again, so its almost a cat and mouse game. We will see what happens when Macron gets here,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n\nFLNKS, the party of the New Caledonia government's president Louis Mapou, want Paris to scrap an electoral reform that sparked riots a week ago that have killed six. Some leaders fear the change will dilute the vote of indigenous Kanak, who make up 40% of the population. \"We are expecting if he travels to Kanaky he will make some strong announcement that he is withdrawing this electoral bill, but if he is just coming here as a provocation that might just turn bad,\" Naouna said, using the island's indigenous name.\n\nMacron will meet elected officials and local representatives on Thursday for a day of talks focused on politics and on the reconstruction of the island, his aides said. The island is more than 16,000 km (10,000 miles) from mainland France, and some 1,500 km (930 miles) east of Australia.\n\nOver a hundred foreign tourists were evacuated on Australian and New Zealand government chartered flights on Tuesday, as New Caledonia's airport remains closed to commercial flights. The U.S. State Department said one U.S. citizen was among those evacuated to Brisbane. Australia's Minister for the Pacific Pat Conroy said 84 Australians were evacuated, and 200 more Australians who are seeking to leave remain in New Caledonia.\n\nThe French government is organising Wednesday's evacuation flights to Australia, he said. Australian diplomats are \"working very hard to make sure as many Australians as possible are on those flights\", he added. France annexed New Caledonia in 1853 and gave the colony the status of overseas territory in 1946. New Caledonia is the world's No. 3 nickel miner but the sector is in crisis and one-in-five residents live below the poverty threshold.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

The high commission said efforts were under way to clear the remaining barriers and remove the burned-out vehicles and other debris.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand, meanwhile, sent their first military planes to New Caledonia to evacuate their nationals.\n\nAn Australian C-130 Hercules aircraft landed at Noumea's Magenta airport, which usually handles domestic traffic, on Tuesday afternoon, the AFP news agency reported.\n\n\"Passengers are being prioritised based on need. We continue to work on further flights,\" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on social media, announcing two initial flights.\n\nNew Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters, meanwhile, said the first military aircraft would repatriate \"50 passengers with the most pressing needs\" to Auckland. He said more flights were scheduled for the coming days.\n\nThe civil disturbances are the worst in the territory of some 270,000 people since the 1980s and reflect concerns among the Indigenous Kanak community, who make up about 40 percent of the population, that changes to the electoral system will dilute their vote and political influence.\n\nThe voting system for provincial elections was established in the 1998 Noumea Accord, a result of the previous unrest, and excluded later European arrivals from France. Under the new constitutional amendment, those who have lived in New Caledonia for at least 10 years will get a vote.\n\nViro Xulue, part of a community group providing social assistance to other Kanak amid the crisis, said it felt like a return to the civil war of the 1980s, and people were scared.\n\n\"We are really scared about the police, the French soldiers, and we are scared about the anti-Kanak militia terrorist group,\" Xulue told the Reuters news agency in a video interview.\n\nThree of the six people killed in the unrest were young Kanak and were shot by armed civilians. There have also been confrontations between Kanak protesters and armed self-defence groups or civilian militias formed to protect themselves, France's High Commission said previously.\n\nFrench officials said at the weekend that security forces had dismantled 76 barricades set up along the 60km (40-mile) road from Noumea to the international airport, but AFP reported some had been rebuilt.\n\nOne was being manned by a group of masked Kanak people, some of whom were carrying home-made catapults.\n\nA masked 25-year-old with sunglasses who gave only his first name Stanley told AFP that the proposed voting reform meant \"the elimination of the Kanak people\".\n\n\"That's what they don't understand over there -

We continue to work on further flights,\" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on social media, announcing two initial flights.\n\nThe first transport with evacuees landed in Brisbane in eastern Australia around 7:00 pm (0900 GMT) Tuesday.\n\nNew Zealand is sending one military plane to repatriate \"50 passengers with the most pressing needs\" to Auckland, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.\n\n\"In cooperation with France and Australia we are working on subsequent flights in coming days,\" he said, describing the situation in New Caledonia as \"dynamic\".\n\nAustralian tourist Maxwell Winchester said he and his wife Tiffany were \"ecstatic\" to hear evacuation flights had begun after being stuck in a barricaded resort for a week.\n\nCharles Roger, director of New Caledonia's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) which operates the airport, told AFP there would be no commercial flights there until Saturday morning.\n\n- Catapults -\n\nThe Pacific territory of 270,000 people has been in turmoil since May 13, when violence erupted over French plans to impose new voting rules that would give tens of thousands of non-indigenous residents voting rights.\n\nThe unrest has left six people dead, including two police, and hundreds injured.\n\nLocal prosecutors said Tuesday that around 400 shops and businesses had been damaged, many of them by fire.\n\nThe CCI on Monday reported \"catastrophic\" economic damage from the unrest, with 150 businesses \"looted and set on fire\".\n\nThe French authorities in New Caledonia said police had so far arrested nearly 270 \"rioters\".\n\nTwenty-one supermarkets have been able to reopen and gradually restock, the French high commission said Tuesday.\n\nFrench forces were slowly restoring calm across the territory, clearing burned-out vehicles from roads, and deploying troops to protect public buildings, authorities said.\n\nFrench officials said at the weekend that security forces had destroyed 76 roadblocks along the critical 60-kilometre (40-mile) road from the capital Noumea to La Tontouta International Airport.\n\nBut AFP journalists said many had quickly been rebuilt by Kanak militants.\n\nKanaks with scarfs over their faces, some armed with homemade catapults, were still manning a roadblock Tuesday on the road to the international airport.\n\n- Anger over vote reform -\n\nOne of several militants on the roadblock, a masked 25-year-old with sunglasses who gave only his first name, Stanley, said the proposed voting reform \"means the elimination of the Kanak people\".\n\n\"That's what they don't understand over there -- we are already in the minority in our own home,\" he told AFP.\n\nAnother masked man, a 34-year-old who also divulged only his first name, Simon, said they were letting drivers pass through the roadblock, and some people were giving them bread and water.\n\n\"It's calm, the regulars already know us on the barricades,\" he said.\n\nIndigenous Kanaks, who make up about 40 percent of the population, say the latest voting regulations would dilute their vote.\n\nBut more recent arrivals to the islands say they are being deprived of their right to take part in local elections.\n\nThe new law would extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least 10 years.\n\n- 'Madness' -\n\nIn the Noumea beachside suburb of Magenta, AFP journalists saw abandoned roadblocks and locals clearing up the streets.\n\n\"I am so happy to see this and for the madness to end,\" said one tearful resident who gave only her first name, Sylvie.\n\nFrance is considering extending a 12-day state of emergency, which has led to a night-time curfew, house arrests of suspected ringleaders, and bans of TikTok, the sale of alcohol, carrying weapons and gatherings.\n\nNew Caledonia has been a French territory since the mid-1800s.\n\nBut almost two centuries on, opinion is split roughly along ethnic lines over whether the islands should be part of France, autonomous or independent.\n\nburs-djw/arb-tgb/as/yad\n\nMore from this section\n\nTugboats escort ship that caused deadly Baltimore bridge collapse back to port Scientology Network's

We continue to work on further flights,\" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on social media, announcing two initial flights.\n\nThe first transport with evacuees landed in Brisbane in eastern Australia around 7:00 pm (0900 GMT) Tuesday.\n\nNew Zealand is sending one military plane to repatriate \"50 passengers with the most pressing needs\" to Auckland, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.\n\n\"In cooperation with France and Australia we are working on subsequent flights in coming days,\" he said, describing the situation in New Caledonia as \"dynamic\".\n\nAustralian tourist Maxwell Winchester said he and his wife Tiffany were \"ecstatic\" to hear evacuation flights had begun after being stuck in a barricaded resort for a week.\n\nCharles Roger, director of New Caledonia's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) which operates the airport, told AFP there would be no commercial flights there until Saturday morning.\n\n- Catapults -\n\nThe Pacific territory of 270,000 people has been in turmoil since May 13, when violence erupted over French plans to impose new voting rules that would give tens of thousands of non-indigenous residents voting rights.\n\nThe unrest has left six people dead, including two police, and hundreds injured.\n\nLocal prosecutors said Tuesday that around 400 shops and businesses had been damaged, many of them by fire.\n\nThe CCI on Monday reported \"catastrophic\" economic damage from the unrest, with 150 businesses \"looted and set on fire\".\n\nThe French authorities in New Caledonia said police had so far arrested nearly 270 \"rioters\".\n\nTwenty-one supermarkets have been able to reopen and gradually restock, the French high commission said Tuesday.\n\nFrench forces were slowly restoring calm across the territory, clearing burned-out vehicles from roads, and deploying troops to protect public buildings, authorities said.\n\nFrench officials said at the weekend that security forces had destroyed 76 roadblocks along the critical 60-kilometre (40-mile) road from the capital Noumea to La Tontouta International Airport.\n\nMore from this section Slideshow: Highlights from the PGA Championship final round in Louisville Klopp hails 'superpower' fans in emotional Liverpool farewell 22 Kids and Counting's Radford family celebrate surprise baby news: 'Can't wait to meet you'\n\nBut AFP journalists said many had quickly been rebuilt by Kanak militants.\n\nKanaks with scarfs over their faces, some armed with homemade catapults, were still manning a roadblock Tuesday on the road to the international airport.\n\n- Anger over vote reform -\n\nOne of several militants on the roadblock, a masked 25-year-old with sunglasses who gave only his first name, Stanley, said the proposed voting reform \"means the elimination of the Kanak people\".\n\n\"That's what they don't understand over there -- we are already in the minority in our own home,\" he told AFP.\n\nAnother masked man, a 34-year-old who also divulged only his first name, Simon, said they were letting drivers pass through the roadblock, and some people were giving them bread and water.\n\n\"It's calm, the regulars already know us on the barricades,\" he said.\n\nIndigenous Kanaks, who make up about 40 percent of the population, say the latest voting regulations would dilute their vote.\n\nBut more recent arrivals to the islands say they are being deprived of their right to take part in local elections.\n\nThe new law would extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least 10 years.\n\n- 'Madness' -\n\nIn the Noumea beachside suburb of Magenta, AFP journalists saw abandoned roadblocks and locals clearing up the streets.\n\n\"I am so happy to see this and for the madness to end,\" said one tearful resident who gave only her first name, Sylvie.\n\nFrance is considering extending a 12-day state of emergency, which has led to a night-time curfew, house arrests of suspected ringleaders, and bans of TikTok, the sale of alcohol, carrying weapons and gatherings.\n\nNew Caledonia has been a French territory since the mid-1800s.\n\nBut almost two centuries on, opinion is split roughly along ethnic lines over whether the islands should be part of France, autonomous or independent.\n\nburs-djw/arb-tgb/as/yad", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"},

We continue to work on further flights,\" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on social media, announcing two initial flights.\n\nNew Zealand is sending one military plane to repatriate \"50 passengers with the most pressing needs\" to Auckland, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.\n\n\"In cooperation with France and Australia we are working on subsequent flights in coming days,\" he said, describing the situation in New Caledonia as \"dynamic\".\n\nAustralian tourist Maxwell Winchester said he and his wife Tiffany were \"ecstatic\" to hear evacuation flights had begun after being stuck in a barricaded resort for a week.\n\nThe Pacific territory of 270,000 people has been in turmoil since May 13, when violence erupted over French plans to impose new voting rules that would give tens of thousands of non-indigenous residents voting rights.\n\nTwenty-one supermarkets have been able to reopen and gradually restock, the French high commission said Tuesday.\n\nFrench forces were slowly restoring calm across the territory, clearing burned-out vehicles from roads, and deploying troops to protect public buildings, authorities said.\n\nFrench officials said at the weekend that security forces had destroyed 76 roadblocks along the critical 60-kilometre (40-mile) road from the capital Noumea to La Tontouta International Airport.\n\nBut AFP journalists said many had quickly been rebuilt by Kanak militants.\n\nKanaks with scarfs over their faces, some armed with homemade catapults, were still manning a roadblock Tuesday on the road to the international airport, which is closed to commercial flights until at least Thursday.\n\nOne of several militants on the roadblock, a masked 25-year-old with sunglasses who gave only his first name Stanley, said the proposed voting reform \"means the elimination of the Kanak people\".\n\n\"That's what they don't understand over there -- we are already in the minority in our own home,\" he told AFP.\n\nAnother masked man, a 34-year-old who also divulged only his first name, Simon, said they were letting drivers pass through the roadblock, and some people were giving them bread and water.\n\n\"It's calm, the regulars already know us on the barricades,\" he said.\n\nIndigenous Kanaks, who make up about 40 percent of the population, say the latest voting regulations would dilute their vote.\n\nBut more recent arrivals to the islands say they are being deprived of their right to take part in local elections.\n\nThe new law would extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least 10 years.\n\nIn the Noumea beachside suburb of Magenta, AFP journalists saw abandoned roadblocks and locals clearing up the streets.\n\n\"I am so happy to see this and for the madness to end,\" said one tearful resident who gave only her first name Sylvie.\n\nThe New Caledonian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reported \"catastrophic\" economic damage from the unrest, with 150 businesses \"looted and set on fire\".\n\nFrance is considering extending a 12-day state of emergency, which has led to a night-time curfew, house arrests of suspected ringleaders, and bans on TikTok, the sale of alcohol, carrying weapons and gatherings.\n\nNew Caledonia has been a French territory since the mid-1800s.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors":

Wong added that passengers are being prioritized according to need, and that the government will \"continue to work on further flights.\"\n\nNew Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said the government there is sending a plane to the island's capital, Noumea, to evacuate 50 of its nationals. Peters acknowledged that New Zealanders in New Caledonia \"have faced a challenging few days\" and that bringing them home \"has been an urgent priority\" for Wellington.\n\nAt least six people have been killed and hundreds more wounded since violence broke out last Monday over a bill under debate in the French parliament that would allow French-born residents who have lived in New Caledonia for 10 years to vote in local elections.\n\nLeaders of the island's pro-independence movement say the measure would dilute the voting power of the indigenous Kanak people, who have suffered under decades of discrimination.\n\nFrance's National Assembly approved the measure last week by a vote of 351-153. The bill still must be approved in a special session of both houses of parliament next month.\n\nScores of homes and businesses have been looted and burned in Noumea, prompting authorities to impose a dusk-to-dawn curfew and a ban on public gatherings. The violence has also prompted the closure of schools and businesses, as well as the island's airport, which left thousands of tourists unable to leave.\n\nGroups of Kanak protesters have set up roadblocks leading in and out of Noumea which has prevented deliveries of food and medicine to citizens and tourists trapped in their homes and resorts.\n\nFrance has deployed more than 1,000 security personnel to help end the unrest, with hundreds more due to arrive Tuesday.\n\nAt least 270 people have been arrested.\n\nFrance agreed in 1998 to grant New Caledonia more political power and autonomy and to hold three referendums over the island's status. Voters have rejected independence in all three referendums.\n\nCredit : Voice of America (VOA), Photo Credit : Associated Press (AP)", "source": {"uri": "newdelhitimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Concerns about disruption to nickel supplies sent prices of the mineral, a crucial element in batteries and steelmaking, surging last week.\n\nSix people, including two police officers, have died in the riots that have led to the closure of schools, businesses and the main airport in the archipelago, which is home to a pro-independence movement led by members of the indigenous Kanak population.\n\nFrance declared a state of emergency in New Caledonia on May 15 and dispatched hundreds of extra police to the territory after the state's highest official there, Louis Le Franc, warned it was \"headed to civil war\".\n\nWhile the unrest has begun to calm, Australia evacuated more than 100 of its citizens from New Caledonia on Tuesday and New Zealand said it would fly home 50 people. France is planning further evacuation flights although the airport remains closed to commercial traffic.\n\n\"The president is going to New Caledonia in the spirit of responsibility that is his as the head of state\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009on this topic of high importance,\" Thevenot said at a press conference.\n\nThe unrest began when the government pushed ahead with electoral reform after several years of failed negotiations for an overall accord to reconcile New Caledonia's pro- and anti-independence camps.\n\nFrance has proposed expanding the right to vote in New Caledonian provincial elections to all citizens who have lived there for more than a decade. The change is opposed by much of the Kanak population who fear it would dilute their political influence in favour of the non-indigenous population that began to arrive during the colonial period.\n\nIf finalised, the French constitutional amendment would override the Noum\u00e9a Accord of 1998, which brought political stability to New Caledonia in part by restricting the voting franchise to Kanaks and citizens who lived in the territory before the agreement.\n\nMacron signalled last week that he could abandon the reform if local leaders made their own broader deal, but he has not officially withdrawn a plan to hold a congress in June to finalise the constitutional change.\n\nThe Kanaks have become a minority in the territory, accounting for about 40 per cent of the population. They suffer from higher unemployment and relatively low median salaries.\n\nAs part of a so-called de-colonialisation process, three referendums have been held since 2018 in which residents voted against independence from France, although the most recent one in 2021 was boycotted by pro-independence parties.\n\nThose votes preserved the status quo that gives New Caledonia significant autonomy and self-governing powers, and prompted Macron to declare the question of independence resolved.\n\nThe unrest is a setback for Macron, who on a trip to New Caledonia last year highlighted the strategic importance to France of the presence the territory gives its navy in the Pacific and its valuable nickel reserves. France sees its overseas territories in the Pacific and Indian Oceans as key to its efforts to counter China's economic and military influence.\n\nNew Caledonia's nickel sector has been plunged into crisis because of competition from lower-cost producers such as Indonesia. Several mining companies, including Glencore, have said they will pull out, in a blow to the French finance ministry's efforts to put together a bailout package.\n\nMacron's approach of pushing electoral reform as a tactic to try to catalyse agreement among supporters and opponents of independence had backfired, said Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9pied, an anthropologist who specialises in New Caledonia.\n\n\"Touching the issue of the voting base without an overall accord and broad compromise amounts to picking up a hatchet,\" he told television channel France Info, suggesting it was a provocation to the Kanak population. \"Everyone has said and repeated that for years.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

make up about 40 percent of the population.\n\nMany of them oppose the plan to extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least 10 years.\n\nBut anti-independence

I don\u2019t see an end to this latest crisis.\u201d\n\nAmid the China\u2013United States rivalry that has also been playing out in the Pacific as Western nations seek to \u201cwin back\u201d island nations growing closer to China and other countries, foreign states such as Azerbaijan have also been dragged into the fiasco.\n\nLast week, French Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin accused Azerbaijan of stirring tensions in New Caledonia after the emergence of Azerbaijani flags alongside Kanak symbols in the protests. Azerbaijan, nearly 14,000km away from New Caledonia, denied allegations of foreign interference.\n\nAt the same time, Paris shut down TikTok on the island amid a state of emergency and curfews, raising questions about the suppression of freedom of speech. It did not offer a reason for the block.\n\nAll of these, however, were unnecessary \u201cnoise\u201d to drown out the legitimate concerns of Kanaks in their dealings with Paris, Kaiku said.\n\n\u201cEvoking the spectre of foreign interests and influence in the New Caledonia riots is a convenient ploy to sidestep the simmering tensions that have been building up since the 1998 Noum\u00e9a Accord and the demands for an electoral roll that is representative of the voters in the New Caledonian electorate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe latest voting changes proposed by Paris had gone against the Noum\u00e9a Accord, which allowed equal recognition of the interests of indigenous Kanaks and descendants of French settlers.\n\nThey also added insult to injury over a rushed third referendum for independence under the accord in 2021 when many indigenous New Caledonians were unable to vote because of the pandemic.\n\nOn Monday, an alliance of non-governmental organisations in the Pacific region called on the United Nations to send a neutral mission to \u201coversee and mediate dialogue between all parties to the Noum\u00e9a Accord\u201d.\n\nThe UN has continued to list New Caledonia as a non-self-governing territory yet to exercise its right to self-determination.\n\nThe alliance also sought UN support for the \u201cfailures of the French government as a neutral administrator of the territory\u2019s decolonisation process\u201d.\n\nClaiming that \u201cforeign interference\u201d was behind the turmoil in New Caledonia not only attempted to deflect responsibility from France for the crisis but was also an insult to the Kanak people\u2019s long struggle for independence, former University of Canberra New Caledonia researcher Alaine Chanter said in an analysis on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt is enabled by a Western narrative that sees the Pacific as a kind of political \u2018terra nullius\u2019 vulnerable to malign \u2018foreign actors\u2019 like China, Russia and now Azerbaijan,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe US, Australia and, yes, France, argue that their aim is to counter these threats, to keep the Pacific \u2018family\u2019 democratic and intact. This discourse of political absence is infantilising, patronising, and deeply racist.\u201d\n\nThe riots ultimately stemmed from inequalities felt by the indigenous Kanak people under colonial rule, and it was time to question its legitimacy if inequalities were allowed to persist, said Nicole George, a Peace and Conflict Studies academic from the University of Queensland.\n\nIn an analysis for The Conversation on Monday, George said surrounding nations in the Pacific such as Australia should step up to address the injustice.\n\n\u201cThe scale of the rioting and devastation in Noum\u00e9a demonstrate, yet again, the failures of France to properly address the feelings of discontent among the Kanak population and the profound inequalities that exist in New Caledonia,\u201d said George, who was among the Australians stranded in New Caledonia.\n\nAnd yet, Canberra\u2019s latest cooperation with Paris in the \u201cAustralia-France Roadmap\u201d to support academic and professional engagement on security and defence in relation to policymaking in the Indo-Pacific was about China rather than French colonialism, Nic Maclellan, a veteran Pacific researcher, said in a Development Policy Centre analysis last week.\n\n\u201cRepeated lectures about \u2018democracy\u2019 from French politicians carry little sway in a colonial context, which is \u2013 by its very nature \u2013 anti-democratic,\u201d he said.\n\nA new \u201cAustralia-France Centre of Excellence for the Indo-Pacific\u201d under that same road map was \u201clooking increasingly difficult for Australia to justify\u201d, La Trobe University international relations researcher Kate Clayton said on X.\n\nAs for whether the crisis could make way for new diplomatic relations between China and New Caledonia, Kaiku said it was unlikely as the territory was not a sovereign state for now.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Photos released by the RAAF show armed military personnel helping holiday-attired visitors in the island's capital Noumea board a Lockheed Martin C-130J cargo aircraft with tail number A97-450.\n\nFlight tracking data shows a C-130 bearing that registration arrived in Noumea at 15:14 local time on 21 May. Less than 2h later, at 16:48, the same craft departed Noumea Magenta airport for Brisbane.\n\nThe overseas French territory erupted into violence and unrest on 13 May over a law passed in Paris that would expand voting rights for non-indigenous residents of the South Pacific island.\n\nAt least six people have since been reported dead, with more than 1,000 French gendarmes deployed to restore order.\n\nLocal authorities say commercial flight cancellations have stranded an estimated 3,200 people in New Caledonia, although some of those were from flights attempting to enter the territory.\n\nABC reports that more than 300 Australian visitors have been stranded in the capital Noumea since rioting began. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) launched two evacuation flights as part of Canberra's assisted departure response, the department says.\n\n\"Defence conducted a number of ADF flights to assist with the repatriation of Australian nationals, permanent visa holders and approved foreign nationals wishing to return to Australia from New Caledonia,\" the ADF says, noting the flights were requested by Australia's diplomatic service.\n\nFrench authorities are reportedly coordinating additional flights, including for individuals located outside the Noumea region. Canberra says it \"stands ready\" to send additional evacuation aircraft if Paris grants approval.\n\nThe office of President Emmanuel Macron said on 21 May that the French leader will visit the island in the coming days in an attempt to defuse the situation.\n\nIn addition to tourism, New Caledonia is a major mining hub and is one the world's top producers of nickel.", "source": {"uri":

in New Caledonia desperate to get home", "body": "Stranded Australian tourists in riot-stricken New Caledonia are still unsure when they will be evacuated, despite French authorities offering seats on departure flights to some travellers.\n\nThe Australian government evacuated 84 Australians and 24 foreign nationals from New Caledonia's capital Noumea yesterday on military transport planes.\n\nA French government assisted flight is expected to carry around 100 Australians to Brisbane later today.\n\nSome Australians the ABC spoke to said they had been notified of French government flights, but it was not clear what time they would depart.\n\nTylah Carre, an Australian tourist in Noumea, said he received a text from French authorities saying they would \"conduct flights for [their] safe departure\".\n\n\"But we don't know if we have six hours or just an hour, like yesterday when people were told there's a bus downstairs,\" Mr Carre said.\n\n\"Many are staying in their rooms in case they get the call.\"\n\nJanine Banks, another Australian tourist, said she was frustrated with the communication from the Australian government.\n\nShe said she hadn't received any information from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade until about 9pm last night and relied on WhatsApp for updates from other tourists.\n\n\"We were told Monday night to be ready for evacuation on Tuesday, so we packed and waited by the phone all day.\"\n\nShe then heard no updates during the day.\n\nMs Banks had initially booked a trip to Vanuatu but her flight plans changed when Air Vanuatu went bust.\n\nQueensland academic Nicole George was teaching in Noumea when rioting erupted last week.\n\nShe was hoping to be one of the more than 100 Australian residents who were repatriated on the two ADF flights overnight.\n\nPacific Minister Pat Conroy said the French government was \"currently planning flights to Brisbane today, using their resources\".\n\n\"So the primary plan is more French flights,\" he said.\n\n\"But we do have contingency plans and we do have planes on stand-by should there be an issue with that course of action.\"\n\nHe added a French plane was due to leave for Brisbane this afternoon or evening and evacuate about 100 Australians.\n\n\"So bringing it to around 184 Australians roughly, brought home over the last day or two.\"\n\nVictorian doctor Max Winchester and wife Tiffany are also stranded and said their first attempt at a kid-free holiday had gone terribly wrong.\n\nThe pair, from Woodend, had been holidaying when the political unrest began and were unable to get seats on the first evacuation flights.\n\n\"We're being told we're going to be evacuated by the French and we just don't feel comfortable with that,\" Dr Winchester said.\n\n\"It was my attempt at our first child-free romantic holiday.\"\n\nDr Winchester said he and his wife had run out of their medication and were unable to go to the nearest town because of fires, looting and vandalism.\n\nYesterday's defence force flights departed from new Caledonia's domestic airport, but Australian tourists told the ABC they were unsure if barricades still blocked the road to New Caledonia's international airport further north.\n\nFrom his hotel window, Mr Carre couldn't see any fires but heard local news of a factory ablaze in Noumea's industrial zone.\n\n\"It feels like it has de-escalated, but it's uneasy,\" he said.\n\nSome shops had stock, but most shelves were still empty.\n\nNew Caledonia's business chamber reported 150 companies had been looted and burned.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is on his way to New Caledonia in a move which could also complicate further evacuation flights.\n\nAides to Mr Macron said he would meet with officials and local representatives on Thursday for a day of talks focused on politics and on the reconstruction of the island.\n\nThe unrest in New Caledonia, with a population of about 270,000, was sparked by French plans to impose new rules that would give tens of thousands of non-Indigenous residents voting rights.\n\nPro-independence groups say any such move would dilute the Indigenous Kanak vote.\n\nMs George said she was worried Mr Macron's visit would further inflame tensions and make it difficult to continue evacuations.\n\n\"We don't think a group of tourists from Australia are really high priority at the moment.\n\n\"We are concerned if the violence kicks off [again] in the next couple of days.\"\n\nShe said there was a lot of uncertainty among the remaining Australians.\n\n\"We are trying to band together, we have a WhatsApp group here, we're trying to support each other.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"},

No, it's us,\" he told AFP.\n\nThe voice of local Kanaks \"is not being listened to, not being heard\", he said.\n\n- Barricades -\n\nFrench security forces have removed more than 90 roadblocks, authorities said.\n\nBut Kanak separatists, some masked and wielding homemade catapults, are still manning makeshift roadblocks including on the main route to the international airport, AFP correspondents said.\n\nArmed locals, of French and other origins, have set up their own neighbourhood barricades.\n\nLocal prosecutors say around 400 shops and businesses have been damaged.\n\nKanaks make up about 40 percent of the population.\n\nMany of them oppose the plan to extend voting rights to those who have lived in the territory for at least 10 years.\n\nBut anti-independence representatives want it pushed through.\n\nWithdrawing \"would prove the wreckers, the looters and the rioters right,\" said Nicolas Metzdorf, a New Caledonia MP for Macron's Renaissance party.\n\nParis has for now held off extending a 12-day state of emergency, which has led to a night-time curfew, house arrests of suspected ringleaders, and bans on TikTok, alcohol sales, carrying weapons and gatherings.\n\nNew Caledonia has been a French territory since the mid-1800s.\n\nBut almost two centuries on, opinion is split roughly along ethnic lines over whether the islands should be part of France, autonomous or independent.\n\nburs-djw/cwl", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mathurin_derel@reformer.com",

It was annexed by France in 1853 and used as a penal colony until shortly before the turn of the 20th century.\n\nNew Caledonia, one of five island territories spanning the Indo-Pacific held by France, is central to Emmanuel Macron's plan to increase French influence in the Pacific.\n\nThe world's No. 3 nickel producer, New Caledonia lies at the heart of a geopolitically complex maritime region, where China and the United States are jostling for power and influence in security and trade. Without naming China, Macron has previously said France's drive to expand its influence in the Pacific was to ensure a \"rules-based development\".\n\nAfter France's colonisation in the 19th century, New Caledonia officially became a French overseas territory in 1946. Starting in the 1970s, in the wake of a nickel boom that drew outsiders, tensions rose on the island, with various conflicts between Paris and Kanak independence movements.\n\nA 1998 Noumea Accord helped end the conflict by outlining a path to gradual autonomy and restricting voting to the indigenous Kanak and migrants living in New Caledonia before 1998. The accord allowed for three referendums to determine the future of the country. In all three, independence was rejected.\n\n\"Tonight, France is more beautiful because New Caledonia has decided to stay part of it,\" Macron said after the result of the most recent vote in 2021.

The infrastructure was amazing as far as the roads, the libraries, the schools ... and also a very peaceful place.\n\n\"It's small, people are kind to each other ... say hi to everyone ... It was a very courteous place, and, and we really enjoyed that.\"\n\nAnd so, it became home to Decramer, his wife, Maeva Zebrowski, who was born in New Caledonia, and their three young children. Their children enrolled in schools and the family found community in Noum\u00e9a.\n\nBut the turmoil that has erupted into violence this month has ended their New Caledonian homecoming. After less than a year, the family will, in coming days, pack their boat with the supplies that can be sourced and sail for Brisbane, Australia - 770 nautical miles, or about six days of sailing.\n\n\"It's clearly with a heavy heart that we're going to be leaving this place,\" Decramer says.\n\n\"Bearing in mind my wife was born here, we wanted to settle here. It's difficult. We're really torn between the need to put our family in safety ... and the feeling that we are leaving people behind here - people who cannot leave.\"\n\nWith Noum\u00e9a's international airport closed for commercial flights, leaving isn't an option for many people. Some governments have launched repatriation flights to take their nationals out of New Caledonia.\n\nDecramer says the decision to depart has been hardest on their three children, \"who've made friends in school, who will not be able to go back ... to say goodbye to the friends they are going to leave\".\n\nRelated: New Caledonia unrest: Australia and New Zealand sending evacuation flights for stranded tourists\n\nThe latest unrest in New Caledonia, the French Pacific territory of 270,000 people, erupted over French plans to unfreeze electoral rolls for provincial elections - changes that would give tens of thousands of non-Indigenous residents voting rights.\n\nUnder the terms of the Noum\u00e9a accord, voting in provincial elections was restricted to people who had resided in New Caledonia before 1998 and their children. The measure was aimed at giving greater representation to the Indigenous Kanak population.\n\nThe Kanak people make up about 40% of New Caledonia's population and Kanak groups argue the new voting rules would dilute their vote.\n\nMore than a week of rioting, looting and arson has left six people dead, including two gendarmes, and hundreds injured. France has sent more than 1,000 security forces to its overseas territory and the president, Emmanuel Macron, told a meeting of his defence and security council there was \"clear progress in re-establishing order\".\n\nBut pro-independence, largely Kanak activists vowed they would not retreat from their protests and reports from Noum\u00e9a say some roadblocks taken down by security forces were being rebuilt by pro-independence forces.\n\nDecramer says the political disquiet was always present, made visible in protests and occasional unrest.\n\n\"The demonstrations that were happening in the past few months - yes, they were big, but they were peaceful and they were a part of normal life for people living here for a long time. They tell you, 'Well, it's been ups and downs for 40 years: you're new, you don't understand, it's OK.'\n\n\"Sadly, we've seen even the locals have been surprised by the speed and the severity of the uprising.\"\n\nBut despite the political fractures erupting into violence this month, \"there's been great solidarity between the different people\".\n\n\"There is a local news radio, NC La Premi\u00e8re, which is doing a fantastic job. They have ... an open-air show with everybody calling in for information or questions ... The people are helping each other.\n\n\"You have the people giving codes so that some people who are far in the islands can recharge their phones. You have people going out to get medicine for elderly people who are stuck in their apartments, live information on which roads are safe or not, which stores open or not.\"\n\nRelated: A week of unrest in New Caledonia - in pictures\n\nAt the height of the violence, Decramer and his family left Noum\u00e9a for a nearby island in the lagoon off the capital.\n\n\"We were 12 nautical miles out and we could still hear some of the detonations from ... the city at night. You could still smell the burnt plastic from whatever was burning at the time. Even far into the lagoon ... you could still feel the turmoil there.\"\n\nDecramer says the deaths during the violence have been a tragedy for New Caledonia. But neighbourhood patrols have been \"a blessing\", he says. His youngest child's school has been patrolled by class parents at night to keep it from being attacked.\n\nAnd Decramer remains positive about New Caledonia's future, which he hopes will recognise Kanak Indigenity, as well as the archipelago's multiculturalism.\n\n\"I hope that their path towards independence will be a peaceful one, not like the one today.\n\n\"As far as the future of New Caledonia is concerned, I think a greater autonomy or actual independence is the long-term future of this place. But for it to be a peaceful movement ... it has to be inclusive.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_doherty@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Ben Doherty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sailing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noum\u00e9a", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanak_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kanak people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_mile", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nautical mile"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Repatriation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territories", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Overseas Territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous Australians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gendarmerie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiculturalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lagoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archipelago"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/a397f30d474c49316db1c91e4d547721", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580739", "eventUri": "eng-9580739", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

New Zealand and Australia are preparing for deployment to repatriate tourists operating from Noum\u00e9a Magenta Aircess. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nMilitary aircraft from Australia, France, and New Zealand have been busy repatriating stranded tourists in New Caledonia home after widespread riots broke out across Noum\u00e9a following political tension. Violence broke out in the nation's capital following a debate from Paris that proposed constitutional changes that favored France's continued governance of the South Pacific territory.\n\nNoum\u00e9a International Airport, La Tontouta (NOU), was barricaded for protection and to limit access. At the same time, the nearly hour-long journey between Noum\u00e9a and the airport was littered with barricades, burnt-out vehicles, and rioters, which led to the airport being closed by French authorities and tourists stranded.\n\nIn recent days, the Royal New Zealand Defence Force and Royal Australian Defence Force have prepared for deployment to New Caledonia while awaiting authority from the French government to operate to Noum\u00e9a to repatriate stranded tourists home. Due to the limited access to La Tontouta, approval was given to operate from Noum\u00e9a Magenta Airport (GEA), a domestic airport two miles from the city center.\n\nDiscover more aviation news for Australia and Oceania here.\n\nReturning travelers home\n\nNew Zealand's Royal Defence Force operated its first repatriation flight on Tuesday evening, bringing 50 stranded travelers home onboard its Hercules C-130H. The New Zealand Government is now working with French authorities to transport the remaining 200 affected homes in one go, a request that would require a more significant international airport, La Tontouta, to open and permit the operation of larger commercial aircraft. The Australian government has also operated a Hercules to New Caledonia, transporting affected Australians to Brisbane, the closest international port.\n\nFrench authorities are set to reassess the opening of La Tontouta on Thursday. However, it remains unclear if this would see commercial services resume. Aircalin, the flag carrier of New Caledonia, has suspended its international operations, with its offices remaining closed. According to the carrier's website, the airline has been permitted to operate one repatriation flight from Nadi (NAN), Fiji, to New Caledonia on May 22nd to repatriate stranded residents home. However, data from Flightradar24 shows this flight was canceled.\n\nGet the latest aviation news straight to your inbox: Sign up for our newsletters today.\n\nMore flights expected\n\nFrance's High Commission in New Caledonia has advised that it expects many more repatriation flights to take place in the coming days to transport 500 stranded French and other foreign tourists. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is expected to touch down in the Pacific tomorrow in a bid to cool tensions between the indigenous Kanak and French people.\n\nRelated Violent Protests Lead To 2

The government pointed to the involvement of \"Azerbaijani actors\" in the campaign.\n\n- Barricades and burning tyres -\n\nThe violence is the worst seen in New Caledonia since unrest involving independence radicals rocked the French overseas territory in the 1980s.\n\nNew Caledonia has on three occasions rejected independence in referendums, but the cause retains strong support among the Kanak people, whose ancestors have lived on the islands for thousands of years.\n\nColonised by France from the second half of the 19th century, it has special status with some local powers transferred from Paris.\n\nFrench lawmakers this week pushed forward plans to allow people who moved to New Caledonia at least 10 years ago to vote in the territory's elections.\n\nPro-independence forces say that would dilute the vote of Kanaks, who make up about 40 percent of the population.\n\nGroups of Kanaks have set up roadblocks around the main island, waving the territory's flag, burning tyres and blocking or slowing traffic.\n\nOther mostly non-indigenous residents, some armed, piled up garden chairs, crates and other belongings in neighbourhood barricades.\n\n- TikTok challenge -\n\nA local business group estimated the damage, concentrated around Noumea, at 200 million euros ($217 million).\n\nFrench Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti has called on prosecutors to \"take the strongest possible action against the perpetrators of the violence\" and also indicated he was considering transferring the \"criminals\" to mainland France.\n\nThe Noumea public prosecutor's office opened an investigation targeting \"the instigators\" of the riots.\n\nParis has accused a group known as CCAT, which gathers the most radical separatists, of being behind the riots.\n\nOn Friday CCAT issued a statement calling for \"a time of calm to break the spiral of violence\".\n\nParis has closed the airport to commercial flights, shuttered schools, imposed a night-time curfew and banned gatherings, carrying weapons and the sale of alcohol.\n\nThe government has also blocked social network TikTok, saying it was being used by protesters.", "source": {"uri": "spacedaily.com",

The French authorities have sent hundreds of police officers into New Caledonia, enforced a curfew and banned TikTok, but they have struggled to restore calm in the territory.\n\nSome local leaders expressed doubts that Mr. Macron, who is scheduled to arrive on Thursday, could defuse the tensions. \"Here comes the fireman after he set the fire!\" Jimmy Naouna, a spokesman for FLNKS, an alliance of pro-independence parties, wrote on social media.\n\nMany in the Kanak community have accused Mr. Macron and France of reneging on an agreement that had put New Caledonia on a possible path to independence.

French-controlled South Pacific territory have touched down on home soil after being rescued by the Defence Force.\n\nForeign Affairs minister Penny Wong confirmed on Tuesday morning clearance had been granted for two Australian government assisted-departure flights to leave New Caledonia bound for Brisbane.\n\nAt least one repatriation flight safely landed shortly after 7pm on Tuesday at Brisbane International Airport.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nThe second flight is expected to depart Noumea at 7.22pm and is due to arrive into Brisbane by 11pm.\n\nThe flights would be carrying \"Australians and other tourists\" departing New Caledonia in the wake of the violent riots, which were sparked as plans to change voting rules are underway.\n\nThe government's evacuation plan was the result of the island country's international airport being closed and roads being blockaded by authorities as the riots continue.\n\nAt least six people have been killed during the protests and many others injured.\n\n\"(Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) is contacting registered Australians,\" Ms Wong said on X, formally known as Twitter.\n\n\"Passengers are being prioritised based on need.\n\n\"We continue to work on further flights.\"\n\nThere are 300 Australians currently registered with the DFAT who want to leave the island, located about 1200km off Australia's east coast.\n\nIt's understood Qantas will provide connections to returning citizens not based in Brisbane.\n\nAny Australians in New Caledonia who wish to be evacuated and haven't already registered should contact DFAT's crisis centre.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the flights were an

From the get-go, she told AFP, it was clear all was not well.\n\nOn the drive to the city \"it looked very sketchy\" she said. Scores of Indigenous Kanak protestors \"lined the road, waving flags, burning tyres. It felt very uncomfortable\".\n\nA Royal Australian Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft evacuating people at Noumea-Magenta Airport in New Caledonia\n\nShe spent the week watching the smoke rise over Noumea as successive commercial flights home were cancelled and police began staying at the hotel.\n\n\"It's a holiday that we didn't expect,\" she said. \"We just decided that, you know, if we could get a repatriation flight with the Royal Australian Air Force, we would take it.\"\n\nFinally, she got a call from Australian consular staff early Tuesday morning and was told to pack her bags and be ready to leave on 30 minutes' notice.\n\nA group of would-be travellers assembled in the hotel lobby before being loaded into half a dozen coaches and taken under police and military escort to the city's Magenta airport, which usually serves domestic routes.\n\nOn the route out she saw the same plumes of \"thick black smoke\" coming from burning tyres.\n\nPassengers waited in an airport hangar and were fed before taking themselves, their beach bags and their families onto the military transporter.\n\n- 'Most pressing needs' -\n\nBurnt vehicles in the Magenta district of Noumea in France's Pacific territory of New Caledonia, on May 21, 2024\n\nFor days, the Australian and New Zealand militaries have been on standby waiting for French authorities to give the all-clear for relief flights to begin.\n\nFrench troops said they had cleared dozens of make-shift separatist roadblocks from the international airport to the city, but militants and protestors remain lined along some of the route.\n\nFinally on Tuesday two Australian military planes and one from New Zealand dashed across the Coral and Tasman Seas to collect passengers from Noumea's more domestic accessible airport.\n\nMore than 3,000 travellers are estimated to have been stranded by the unrest.\n\nIt is not known how many of those are tourists on holiday in New Caledonia and how many are Caledonians stuck overseas.\n\n(L-R) Erko Isanovic, Nichole Hatten, Wei Liak, Phil Hatten, and Mary Hatten are seen after disembarking a flight arriving from Noumea at Brisbane International Airport in Brisbane on May 21, 2024\n\nAustralian authorities say about 300 citizens have registered for possible evacuation. It was not immediately clear how many would be on Tuesday's flights in total.\n\nThe New Zealand Defence Force plane was expected to carry about \"50 passengers with the most pressing needs\", according to Foreign Minister Winston Peters.\n\n\"In cooperation with France and Australia, we are working on subsequent flights in coming days,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

Screenshot from YouTube video of Al Jazeera English, fair use.\n\nProtests turned into riots in New Caledonia as pro-independence youth activists clashed with the police in response to a proposed constitutional reform in the French National Assembly which would allow residents who have lived there for 10 years to vote in local elections. Activists say the move further dilutes Indigenous peoples' power on the island and will ensure New Caledonia remains an \"overseas territory\" of France.\n\nNew Caledonia is a South Pacific territory that was colonized by France in 1853. Despite longstanding independence demands by local Indigenous groups, it remains a French territory. It has been on the United Nations' list for decolonization since 1986. The landmark Noumea Peace Accord in 1998 instituted a three-part independence referendum to determine the political future of New Caledonia.\n\nThe first referendum took place in November 2018 while the second vote was held in October 2020. Both results delivered only a small margin in favor of France which reflected a solid constituency pushing for the self-determination of the Indigenous Kanak population. The third referendum in December 2021 was controversial because the Paris government decided to continue with it despite appeals from the Kanak community to postpone the voting during the pandemic. As expected, it delivered an overwhelming victory for France because pro-independence groups boycotted the referendum. The voter turnout was also less than 50 percent.\n\nInstead of addressing the concern of Pacific groups about the credibility of the third referendum, France pushed forward with a constitutional bill that would \"unfreeze\" New Caledonia's electoral roll. This means residents who arrived or settled in the territory over the past decade will be eligible to vote. This would further dilute the voting representation of the Kanak people who make up 42 percent of the 270,000 population.\n\nViolence erupted in New Caledonia while France's National Assembly was deliberating the amendment bill on May 13. Almost 5,000 people were involved in the riots that also led to looting and burning of properties. A state of emergency was declared in the territory and France deployed troops to restore order. Some apps like TikTok were banned which raised concern about the suppression of free speech. As violence continued for several days, Pacific groups called for peace as they expressed solidarity with the Kanak community.\n\nCharlot Salwai Tabimasmas, chairman of the Melanesian Spearhead Group and Prime Minister of Vanuatu, attributed the crisis to the indifference of French leaders.\n\nThese events could have been avoided if the French Government had listened and not proceeded to bulldoze the Constitutional Bill aimed at unfreezing the electoral roll, modifying the citizen's electorate, and changing the distribution of seats in Congress.\n\nBut he also warned that \"the indiscriminate destruction of property will affect New Caledonia's economy in a very big way and that will have a debilitating cascading effect on the welfare and lives of all New Caledonians, including the Kanaks.\"\n\nHe is proposing the establishment of a \"dialogue and mediation mission to be led by a mutually agreed high-personality\" to resolve the crisis. This is also the recommendation of the Pacific Islands Forum which stated that it \"stands ready to facilitate and provide a supported and neutral space for all parties to come together in the spirit of the Pacific Way.\"\n\nReverend James Shri Bhagwan, General Secretary of the Pacific Conference of Churches, reminded French leaders about the supposed \"impartial role\" of the French state in the decolonization process. He also underscored the historic roots of the crisis.\n\nIt cannot be ignored that eruption of violence is the manifestation of the pain, trauma and frustration of a community who have consistently had their indigenous and political rights undermined, by a French government whose rhetoric of being a \"Pacific nation\" is exposed by its actions.\n\nPastor Var Kaemo, president of the Protestant Church in Kanaky New Caledonia, lamented the violent turn of events. \"We must not be accomplices to these volcanic eruptions that spread disaster and misery in the land of our ancestors. The island closest to paradise has become the island closest to hell.\"\n\nNew Caledonia is the world's third-largest producer of nickel -- a crucial component in the EV energy transition -- and jobs in the nickel-mining industry make up 25 percent of employment opportunities. The price of nickel has spiked since the unrest began last week.\n\nNicole George, associate professor in Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Queensland, interviewed women leaders who pointed out the active role of frustrated young people who were protesting wealth disparities and lack of meaningful opportunities in the territory. \"These fuel resentment and the profound racial inequalities that deprive Kanak youths of opportunity and contribute to their alienation,\" she wrote.\n\nThis is the same analysis made by Victor Gogny, president of the S\u00e9nat coutumier, the Kanak Customary Senate, an advisory body to Congress and government made up of 16 Indigenous chiefs.\n\nThe statement issued by the Pacific Regional Non-Governmental Organisations on April 30, two weeks before the debate in the French assembly which triggered the unrest, reflected the sentiments of the Indigenous Kanak community.\n\nThe evil of colonialism can continue unchecked in this manner, and in this 21st Century is not only an insult to the Pacific Region but to the international system.\n\nThe Pacific is not distracted by French false narratives. The Kanak, as people, are the rightful inhabitants of what is present day New Caledonia still under enduring French colonial rule.\n\nThe Kanak people and New Caledonias destiny should not be decided in Europe, they are Pacific people who are rightfully asking for their freedom.\n\nAs of Tuesday, May 21, French President Emmanuel Macron plans to make a surprise visit to the island state to attempt to quell the protest.", "source": {"uri": "globalvoices.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global Voices"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanak_people", "type":

Reports have said that both hotels housing foreigners and locals were running out of food, and all commercial flights in and out have been stopped.\n\nWhile the six deaths announced by authorities are directly attributable to the violence, there are fears that it may be even higher due to people being unable to access medical help due to the deteriorating situation, worsened by roadblocks in the city, or too afraid to venture outside to find it.\n\nThierry de Greslan, a representative from the hospital in Noum\u00e9a, estimated that three or four people \"may have died due to lack of access to medical care.\"\n\nHe added that around 50 dialysis patients had been unable to receive their treatments.

Brisbane.\n\nAt least one repatriation flight safely landed shortly after 7pm on Tuesday at Brisbane International Airport.\n\nThe second flight is expected to depart Noumea at 7.22pm and is due to arrive into Brisbane by 11pm.\n\nThe flights would be carrying \"Australians and other tourists\" departing New Caledonia in the wake of the violent riots, which were sparked as plans to change voting rules are underway.\n\nThe government's evacuation plan was the result of the island country's international airport being closed and roads being blockaded by authorities as the riots continue.\n\nAt least six people have been killed during the protests and many others injured.\n\n\"(Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) is contacting registered Australians,\" Ms Wong said on X, formally known as Twitter.\n\nThere are 300 Australians currently registered with the DFAT who want to leave the island, located about 1200km off Australia's east coast.\n\nIt's understood Qantas will provide connections to returning citizens not based in Brisbane.\n\nAny Australians in New Caledonia who wish to be evacuated and haven't already registered should contact DFAT's crisis centre.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the flights were an important step and ensuring Australians were safe amid the violent riots.\n\n\"The wellbeing of Australians in New Caledonia is a priority,\" Mr Albanese said on X.\n\nThe uncertainty on the island was sparked after pro-independence groups rebelled against potential reform which would allow people who've lived on the island for more than 10 years to vote in local elections.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aisling_brennan@news.com.au", "name": "Aisling Brennan", "type":

The indigenous Kanak people, and pro-independence groups are protesting the electoral reform, with concerns it will dilute their vote.\n\nAussies stranded on the French-ruled territory say they are rationing food as they wait for a way out of the troubled island, with no flights currently being allowed in or out. They are among 3200 people who are stuck waiting to leave or enter.\n\nTonia Scholes described the neighbourhood in which her Airbnb is located, approximately 5 kilometres from the capital Noumea, as \"like a war zone\".\n\n\"There's burnt cars, there's barricades, there's remnants of fires, there's people standing on street corners drinking hard liquor and having what almost seems like a party,\" she said on The Project on Sunday night.\n\n\"Buildings that we used as landmarks to find out Airbnb have been burnt to the ground,\" she added.\n\nScholes said she has no idea when she and her travel companions will be able to return back to Australia, with the group being told very little by the federal government.\n\n\"It's absolutely terrifying. You think that we're a little bit protected in Australia -- that the government's got our backs,\" she said. \"But there has been a lack of communication with information getting through to Australia as to how bad it is here.\n\n\"Friends of mine are just like 'Oh just get on to Smart Traveller' or 'just get onto the embassy'. The embassy's been closed here since we got here...We called the consulate, they sounded surprised that we were calling them. We don't call Canberra at three in the morning for fun.\n\n\"We found that they had our email address wrong. We found that there had been virtually no contact. We found that they had somebody else's surname wrong. This stuff matters, this is our lives and we want to come home. We don't know what's happening, we've got bags packed with our essentials. we're just hoping and waiting for a phone call.\"\n\nWhile Scholes praised those around her for helping to keep her and her friends out of harm's way, she admitted that she feared for her safety. \"So we are under curfew from 6pm to 6am every night and the night is peppered with gunshots and pops and bangs and helicopters and we've seen fighter jets and this is just surreal,\" she said.\n\n\"It's definitely not what I thought I was coming for.\"\n\nAnother Aussie stranded, Joanne Elias, said she was told to fill up a bathtub with water in case it ran dry. \"The kids are definitely hungry because we don't really have much option of what we can feed them,\" Joanne Elias said on Saturday from a resort in the capital Noumea, where her family has been holed up.\n\n\"You can tell they are running out of food,\" she told Reuters, referring to the resort where they are staying. Elias, who arrived in the country on May 10 with her husband and four children, said she had been told to fill a bathtub in case water ran out, as food stocks dwindled.\n\n\"We don't know how long we're going to be here for,\" she said.\n\nOn Sunday, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the government was working with French authorities to give assistance to Australians stranded in the South Pacific islands. Commercial flights are currently not operating from Noum\u00e9a's La Tontouta International Airport, and a state of emergency has been declared. A nationwide curfew between 6pm and 6am is also in place.\n\n\"We are working to support Australians in New Caledonia,\" Wong said on X.\n\n\"The Australian Defence Force is ready to fly, pending commercial flights resuming. French authorities advise the situation on the ground is preventing flights. We continue to pursue approvals.\"\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said about 300 Australians are currently registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), and said the government was on hand to deliver assistance.\n\n\"The Australian government is closely monitoring events in New Caledonia, and there are reports they're running out of food and commercial flights are stopped, commercial flights stopped a couple of days ago,\" he told reporters on Sunday.\n\n\"We are looking into how we can provide assistance to Australians who are currently in New Caledonia.\"\n\nSmart Traveller has warned Aussies to reconsider travel to New Caledonia over fears protests and political demonstrations \"may turn more violent at short notice\".\n\nTourists have been urged to \"exercise a high degree of caution,\" and are urged to avoid the island's capital of Noum\u00e9a due to political unrest, and the likelihood of travel disruptions and limited essential

France declared a state of emergency there on 15 May.\n\n\"The president is mobilised on the subject, as he has been since 2017,\" Prisca Thevenot told the press after the Council of Ministers met on Tuesday. She did not specify how long Macron would stay in New Caledonia or the nature of the 'mission', which will be unveiled in the coming days.\n\nMacron will be joined by Minister of Interior G\u00e9rald Darmanin, Minister of Defense S\u00e9bastien Lecornu and Minister Delegate for Overseas Affairs, Marie Gu\u00e9venoux.\n\nShe added that Prime Minister Gabriel Attal will \"also have the opportunity to go there, not immediately but in the coming weeks\".\n\nMore than 400 shops and businesses have been 'destroyed or damaged' since the start of the riots in reaction to a constitutional reform decried by the pro-independence movement a week ago, Noumea public prosecutor Yves Dupas said on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the government, the return of 'order and security' is a prerequisite for any resumption of negotiations.\n\nMacron's visit 'is an opportunity for dialogue that must be seized', non-independence MP Philippe Dunoyer, a member of Macron's Renaissance party, told AFP. The second Renaissance MP for New Caledonia, Nicolas Metzdorf, said he opposed any postponement or withdrawal of the constitutional reform that had sparked off the violence.\n\nMore than 2,700 gendarmes, police officers, and military personnel are deployed in New Caledonia, and additional numbers are expected. Four civilians - including at least three indigenous Kanak residents - have been killed in riots along with two police officers. Dozens more have been injured and more than 200 people arrested so far.\n\nUnder the planned reform, all citizens who have been resident in the archipelago for ten years would be included in the New Caledonia electorate, which should result in a loss of electoral weight for the Kanaks.\n\nAccording to Macron, the reform should be validated 'before the end of June' by a Congress of senators and deputies, but the opponents are calling for the text to be postponed.\n\nOn Sunday (19 May), the presidents of R\u00e9union island, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and French Guiana - all French overseas regions - called for the 'immediate withdrawal' of the reform to prevent \"civil war\".", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

stranded by a week of unrest that has shuttered the Pacific archipelago's main international airport.\n\nMany of them are Australian and New Zealand tourists stuck in resorts and hotels with dwindling supplies of food.\n\nAustralian tourist Maxwell Winchester and his wife Tiffany have been barricaded at a resort between Noumea and the airport for more than a week.\n\nHe told AFP on Tuesday that they were \"ecstatic\" at the prospect of impending rescue.\n\n\"We realise we probably won't get on these flights, because those who have higher needs will get on them, but we at least know we have a way out in the next few days,\" he said.\n\nTourists have told AFP of food shortages, gunfire, and reports of arson and looting near resorts, leaving them fearful for their safety.", "source": {"uri":

Macron's spokesperson Prisca Th\u00e9venot said a \"return to order\" was a preliminary condition for any talks.\n\nThe French Pacific territory has entered a second week of unrest despite the imposition of an emergency decree by Macron last Wednesday. Rioting, largely by indigenous Kanak youth, has devastated the island's capital, Noum\u00e9a. By Friday five people, three young Kanaks and two gendarmes, had been killed.\n\nThe rioting erupted as the French National Assembly pushed through a constitutional amendment to allow French residents who have lived in New Caledonia for 10 years since 1998 the right to vote in provincial elections and for the 54-member Congress. The move is opposed by pro-independence leaders who claim it will dilute the vote of indigenous Kanaks, who make up over 40 percent of the population.\n\nThe protests, involving thousands of Kanaks, have been met with fierce repression from the French state and been confronted with armed pro-France vigilante groups. So far 230 people have been arrested. The 12-day state of emergency gives authorities extensive powers to ban gatherings, impose travel bans, and conduct house arrests and searches.\n\nA contingent of 1,000 French police and army reinforcements arrived on Friday, bringing armed security personnel to 2,700, including riot and crowd control squads.\n\nOver the weekend, the media reported an \"uneasy calm\" had settled over Noum\u00e9a's suburbs, where scenes of violence, arson and confrontation had continued throughout Friday. Despite the military-police crackdown, however, enforcement agencies still had not regained control of the capital's central districts, with fires and other damage occurring overnight Saturday.\n\nFrance's High Commissioner Louis Le Franc claimed: \"With massive reinforcement, we will soon be able to regain control of these areas.\" But Noum\u00e9a's mayor, Sonia Lagarde, said while overnight violence had eased due to a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, \"we are far from a return to normal.\" \"The situation is not improving -- quite the contrary -- despite all the appeals for calm,\" she said, adding that Noum\u00e9a was \"under siege.\"\n\nThe unrest has spread to rural areas. On Saturday, a sixth death was reported after a man was killed near the town of Kaala-Gomen, about 355 kms north of the capital, in an exchange of gunfire at one of many barricades blocking roads on the island. Le Franc said security forces would stage \"harassment\" raids to reclaim other parts of the territory held by pro-independence groups.\n\nA major armed police operation was mounted Sunday to regain control of the main roads in and around Noum\u00e9a. Le Franc warned: \"Republican order will be re-established whatever the cost.\" More than 600 gendarmes used tanks to clear protesters and roadblocks from the road connecting Noum\u00e9a with Tontouta International Airport, which remains closed for commercial flights until further notice.\n\nOn Monday Macron claimed that there was \"clear progress in the restoration of order,\" while authorizing the military deployed to bolster police protecting public buildings in Noum\u00e9a. Islands Business correspondent Nic Maclellan reported scattered attacks were still occurring around the capital, including on shops and businesses. Roadblocks were also maintained by pro-independence forces into the Northern Province.\n\nAustralian and New Zealand governments yesterday began dispatching military aircraft to evacuate their citizens after French authorities authorised the flights to land at the domestic airport. According to Maclellan, the foreign ministers of Australia and NZ had earlier contacted their French counterpart to \"press action\" over delays.\n\nFrance remains determined to tighten its grip on the colony. As the US and its allies prepare for war against China, French imperialism is seeking to play a role in the militarisation of the Pacific. New Caledonia hosts a major French military base and holds nearly a quarter of the world's reserves of nickel, essential in the manufacture of stainless steel and in the arms industry.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has been chairing daily meetings of an \"inter-ministerial crisis cell\" involving Overseas Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin, his deputy Marie Gu\u00e9venoux, Army Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu and Justice Minister Eric Dupont-Moretti. On Friday, Attal met leaders of the parliamentary parties to discuss whether to extend the state of emergency beyond 12 days, which would require the approval of both the lower house National Assembly and the Senate.\n\nTwo pro-France parties, Les Loyalistes and Rassemblement, told a press conference on Tuesday that to withdraw the constitutional amendment would amount to \"condoning the rioters and looters' actions.\" \"Terrorism, violence must not win (...) We're asking the French State to restore law and order,\" local pro-France politician Virginie Ruffenach declared.\n\nPro-independence figures led by the Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale Kanak et Socialiste (FLNKS) have been calling for the measure to be scrapped and that a French \"dialogue mission\" -- similar to the delegations sent by Paris before the signing of the 1998 Noum\u00e9a Accord -- headed by a \"high, recognised and independent official\" should come and negotiate a compromise.\n\nThe alliance of five pro-independence parties that make up the FLNKS represent an indigenous elite that has a vested interest in maintaining the existing voting arrangements, while posing no real alternative to the imperialist-dominated establishment.\n\nNew Caledonia's President Louis Mapou -- a Kanak politician from the National Union for Independence, part of the FLNKS -- bluntly condemned the actions of the rioters, saying \"anger cannot justify harming or destroying public property, production tools, all of which this country has taken decades to build.\"\n\nThe explosive rioting has exposed the vast class chasm between Kanak workers and youth in particular and the colony's wealthy layers. Maclellan posted on X/Twitter that the young people \"burned symbols of wealth and targeted large shopping centres and businesses. They live in urban areas and face daily difficulties. With their families, they are in poverty. They don't have a job.\"\n\nAndre Qaeze from Noumea's Radio Djiido similarly told RNZ Pacific that Kanak youth \"don't have any training, they go out from school with no job... The rich become richer and the poor become poorer, and they say no, we have to change this economic model of sharing. I think this is the main problem.\"\n\nAmid an escalating economic crisis, with the vital nickel industry in turmoil and people reeling from escalating living costs, the official parties representing both pro-independence and rival anti-independence forces stand on the side of the business elite, opposing any meaningful measures to end poverty and social inequality.\n\nAcross the region, meanwhile, there is growing outrage over France's repression. The Melanesian Spearhead Group, formed in 1986 by Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands to back decolonisation, blamed France for the riots and demanded it drop the electoral reform.\n\nAn alliance of over two dozen Pacific non-government organisations also condemned France for what they say is a \"betrayal\" of New Caledonia's Kanak population. The Pacific Regional Non-Government Organisations (PRNGOs) condemned \"the Macron government for its poorly hidden agenda of prolonging colonial control over the territory.\"\n\nThe outgoing chair of the 18-member Pacific Islands Forum and Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown said \"greater autonomy\" for the indigenous Kanak population is needed. Noting that many Forum members are former colonies, Brown said Pacific peoples value \"sovereignty\" and the protests were in response to that.\n\nThe reality is that none of the impoverished Pacific Island countries are fully independent: all of them rely heavily on aid from the imperialist powers and their governments are subject to routine interference from Australia, New Zealand, the US and France. Some analysts are concerned, however, that France's police repression could undermine the propaganda about an alliance of \"democracies\" seeking to push back against \"autocratic\" Chinese influence in the region.\n\nReuters reported that one commentator for the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, Oliver Nobetau, declared that the \"heavy-handed\" response to the protests by France would backfire in the region, where decolonisation was \"expected.\" \"France is trying to re-emerge as a Pacific partner and this will evidently not help that image,\" he warned.\n\nRead moreMacron declares state of

Macron's spokesperson Prisca Th\u00e9venot said a \"return to order\" was a preliminary condition for any talks.\n\nThe French Pacific territory has entered a second week of unrest despite the imposition of an emergency decree by Macron last Wednesday. Rioting, largely by indigenous Kanak youth, has devastated the island's capital, Noum\u00e9a. By Friday five people, three young Kanaks and two gendarmes, had been killed.\n\nThe rioting erupted as the French National Assembly pushed through a constitutional amendment to allow French residents who have lived in New Caledonia for 10 years since 1998 the right to vote in provincial elections and for the 54-member Congress. The move is opposed by pro-independence leaders who claim it will dilute the vote of indigenous Kanaks, who make up over 40 percent of the population.\n\nThe protests, involving thousands of Kanaks, have been met with fierce repression from the French state and been confronted with armed pro-France vigilante groups. So far 230 people have been arrested. The 12-day state of emergency gives authorities extensive powers to ban gatherings, impose travel bans, and conduct house arrests and searches.\n\nA contingent of 1,000 French police and army reinforcements arrived on Friday, bringing armed security personnel to 2,700, including riot and crowd control squads.\n\nOver the weekend, the media reported an \"uneasy calm\" had settled over Noum\u00e9a's suburbs, where scenes of violence, arson and confrontation had continued throughout Friday. Despite the military-police crackdown, however, enforcement agencies still had not regained control of the capital's central districts, with fires and other damage occurring overnight Saturday.\n\nFrance's High Commissioner Louis Le Franc claimed: \"With massive reinforcement, we will soon be able to regain control of these areas.\" But Noum\u00e9a's mayor, Sonia Lagarde, said while overnight violence had eased due to a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, \"we are far from a return to normal.\" \"The situation is not improving -- quite the contrary -- despite all the appeals for calm,\" she said, adding that Noum\u00e9a was \"under siege.\"", "source": {"uri": "pacific.scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanak_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanak people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples of the Americas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gendarmerie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional amendment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noum\u00e9a", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Activism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1509/scoop_placeholder.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580739", "eventUri": "eng-9580739", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

The infrastructure was amazing as far as the roads, the libraries, the schools ... and also a very peaceful place.\n\n\"It's small, people are kind to each other ... say hi to everyone ... It was a very courteous place, and, and we really enjoyed that.\"\n\nAnd so, it became home to Decramer, his wife, Maeva Zebrowski, who was born in New Caledonia, and their three young children. Their children enrolled in schools and the family found community in Noum\u00e9a.\n\nBut the turmoil that has erupted into violence this month has ended their New Caledonian homecoming. After less than a year, the family will, in coming days, pack their boat with the supplies that can be sourced and sail for Brisbane, Australia - 770 nautical miles, or about six days sailing.\n\n\"It's clearly with a heavy heart that we're going to be leaving this place,\" Decramer says.\n\n\"Bearing in mind, my wife was born here, we wanted to settle here. It's difficult. We're really torn between the need to put our family in safety ... and the feeling that we are leaving people behind here, people who cannot leave.\"\n\nWith Noum\u00e9a's international airport closed for commercial flights, leaving isn't an option for many people. Some governments have launched repatriation flights to take their nationals out of New Caledonia.\n\nDecramer says the decision to depart has been hardest on their three children, \"who've made friends in school, who will not be able to go back ... to say goodbye to the friends they are going to leave\".\n\nThe latest unrest in New Caledonia, the French Pacific territory of 270,000 people, erupted over French plans to unfreeze electoral rolls for provincial elections - changes that would give tens of thousands of non-indigenous residents voting rights.\n\nUnder the terms of the Noum\u00e9a Accord, voting in provincial elections was restricted to people who had resided in New Caledonia prior to 1998 and their children. The measure was aimed at giving greater representation to the indigenous Kanak population.\n\nThe Kanak people make up about 40% of New Caledonia's population and Kanak groups argue the new voting regulations would dilute their vote.\n\nMore than a week of rioting, looting and arson has left six people dead, including two gendarmes, and hundreds injured. France has sent more than 1,000 security forces to its overseas territory and the president, Emmanuel Macron, told a meeting of his defence and security council there was \"clear progress in re-establishing order\".\n\nBut pro-independence, largely Kanak activists vowed they would not retreat from their protests and reports from Noum\u00e9a say some roadblocks taken down by security forces were being rebuilt by pro-independence forces.\n\nDecramer says the political disquiet was always present, made visible in protests and occasional unrest.\n\n\"The demonstrations that were happening in the past few months, yes, they were big, but they were peaceful and they were a part of normal life for people living here for a long time. They tell you, 'well, it's been ups and downs for 40 years: you're new, you don't understand, it's OK'.\n\n\"Sadly, we've seen even the locals have been surprised by the speed and the severity of the uprising.\"\n\nBut despite the political fractures erupting into violence this month, \"there's been great solidarity between the different people\".\n\n\"There is a local news radio, NC La Premi\u00e8re, which is doing a fantastic job. They have ... an open-air show with everybody calling in for information or questions ... The people are helping each other.\n\n\"You have the people giving codes so that some people who are far in the islands can recharge their phones. You have people going out to get medicine for elderly people who are stuck in their apartments, live information on which roads are safe or not, which stores open or not.\"\n\nAt the height of the violence, Decramer and his family left Noum\u00e9a for a nearby island in the lagoon off the capital.\n\n\"We were 12 nautical miles out and we could still hear some of the detonations from ... the city at night. You could still smell the burnt plastic from whatever was burning at the time. Even far into the lagoon ... you could still feel the turmoil there.\"\n\nDecramer says the deaths during the violence have been a tragedy for New Caledonia. But neighbourhood patrols have been \"a blessing\", he says.

immediately after receiving long-delayed landing permission from French authorities.\n\nNew Caledonia's main Tontouta International Airport usually brings in a steady stream of tourists looking for a relaxing break in paradise.\n\nIt would, he said, be the \"first in a series of proposed flights to begin bringing New Zealanders home\".\n\nShortly after the announcement, his counterpart Penny Wong said Australia had received permission to send two planes.\n\nMore than 3,000 people are estimated to have been stranded by a week of unrest that has shuttered the Pacific archipelago's main international airport.\n\nMany of them are Australian and New Zealand tourists stuck in resorts and hotels with dwindling supplies of food.\n\nAustralian tourist Maxwell Winchester and his wife Tiffany have been barricaded at a resort between Noumea and the airport for more than a week.\n\nHe told AFP on Tuesday that they were \"ecstatic\" at the prospect of impending rescue.\n\n\"We realise we probably won't get on these flights, because those who have higher needs will get on them, but we at least know we have a way out in the next few days,\" he said.\n\nTourists have told AFP of food shortages, gunfire, and reports of arson and looting near resorts, leaving them fearful for their safety.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [],

The next morning there were several plumes of smoke and the air quality was not very good and the first indication we had was our hostess from the Airbnb messaged me and was like 'Are you OK'?\"\n\nTonia said she responded to her hostess confirming that she was okay, oblivious to the unfolding danger, to which the hostess informed her that she could not leave.\n\n\"That was the end of the holiday as such and when it became more like a lockdown. So we are under curfew from 6pm to 6am every night and the night is peppered with gunshots and pops and bangs and helicopters and we've seen fighter jets and this is just surreal.\n\n\"It's definitely not what I thought I was coming for.\"\n\nProject host Sarah Harris said: \"It sounds absolutely terrifying\".\n\nTo which Tonia responded by telling her about her horrifying experience of going to the grocery shop.\n\n\"It was like a war zone,\" she said. \"There's burnt cars, there's barricades, there's remnants of fires, there's people standing on street corners drinking hard liquor and having what almost seems like a party ...\n\n\"Buildings that we used as ladmarks to find out Airbnb have been burnt to the ground.\"\n\nWhen asked by Project co-host Hamish Macdonald if she fears for her safety, Tonia said \"a little bit\".\n\nHowever, she also praised those around her for helping to keep the tourists safe.\n\n\"People from home are saying you know 'I hope you're safe' and it's like we hope we are, we are actually in a French neighbour and they are amazing.\n\n\"They have all banded together to protect what is theirs and they have 24 hour watches, they walk the streets with big torches, that's actually our neighbours protecting us which is just amazing that they've embraced us in their neighbourhood, a bunch of Australian girls here for a week and they're just like 'don't worry we've got your back'.\"\n\nTonia said it has been difficult to find help to organise evactuation of the island.\n\n\"It is absolutely terrifying. You think we're a little bit protected in Australia and the governement's got our backs and what we've found is that's not really the case. There has been a lack of communication with information getting through to Australia as to how bad it is here.\"\n\nShe said the embassy is closed in New Caledonia and can't help them, the consulate \"sounded surprised\" that they were calling them and they had their email address wrong and claimed there had been no contact.\n\n\"We don't call Canberra at 3am for fun .... This stuff matters, this is our lives. We want to come home and we just don't know what's happening, we've got little go bags packed with our essentials and we're just hoping and waiting for a phone call to say we've got somehow of getting you out.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the government was working with French authorities to give assistance to Australians stranded in the South Pacific islands.\n\nCommercial flights are currently not operating from Noum\u00e9a's La Tontouta International Airport, and a state of emergency has been declared.\n\n\"We are working to support Australians in New Caledonia,\" Ms Wong said in a post made on X.\n\n\"The Australian Defence Force is ready to fly, pending commercial flights resuming.\n\n\"French authorities advise the situation on the ground is preventing flights. We continue to pursue approvals.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said about 300 Australians are currently registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), and the government was ready to deliver assistance.\n\n\"The Australian government is closely monitoring events in New Caledonia, and there are reports they're running out of food and commercial flights are stopped, commercial flights stopped a couple of days ago,\" he said on Sunday.\n\n\"We are looking into how we can provide assistance to Australians who are currently in New Caledonia.\"\n\nAustralians have been urged by Smart Traveller to reconsider travel to New Caledonia over fears protests and political demonstrations \"may turn more violent at short notice\".",

They have had very limited information or assistance from officials.\n\n\"We literally stay by the phone and WIFI to see what is going on,\" Soutar told AFP. \"We feel very isolated, we are not in a resort, it's just us.\"\n\n\"It's been nine days since the conflict started and we are no closer to getting home,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@digitaljournal.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noum\u00e9a", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caledonians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-130_Hercules", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed C-130 Hercules"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consul_(representative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consul (representative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Australian Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archipelago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Defence_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Defence Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winston Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Email_Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Email Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.digitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/c0a15c16cde471cc8c4e2f7edbca3fe2214749ec.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580739", "eventUri": "eng-9580739", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

Macron's spokesperson Prisca Th\u00e9venot said a \"return to order\" was a preliminary condition for any talks.\n\nThe French Pacific territory has entered a second week of unrest despite the imposition of an emergency decree by Macron last Wednesday. Rioting, largely by indigenous Kanak youth, has devastated the island's capital, Noum\u00e9a. By Friday five people, three young Kanaks and two gendarmes, had been killed.\n\nThe rioting erupted as the French National Assembly pushed through a constitutional amendment to allow French residents who have lived in New Caledonia for 10 years since 1998 the right to vote in provincial elections and for the 54-member Congress. The move is opposed by pro-independence leaders who claim it will dilute the vote of indigenous Kanaks, who make up over 40 percent of the population.\n\nThe protests, involving thousands of Kanaks, have been met with fierce repression from the French state and been confronted with armed pro-France vigilante groups. So far 230 people have been arrested. The 12-day state of emergency gives authorities extensive powers to ban gatherings, impose travel bans, and conduct house arrests and searches.\n\nA contingent of 1,000 French police and army reinforcements arrived on Friday, bringing armed security personnel to 2,700, including riot and crowd control squads.\n\nOver the weekend, the media reported an \"uneasy calm\" had settled over Noum\u00e9a's suburbs, where scenes of violence, arson and confrontation had continued throughout Friday. Despite the military-police crackdown, however, enforcement agencies still had not regained control of the capital's central districts, with fires and other damage occurring overnight Saturday.\n\nFrance's High Commissioner Louis Le Franc claimed: \"With massive reinforcement, we will soon be able to regain control of these areas.\" But Noum\u00e9a's mayor, Sonia Lagarde, said while overnight violence had eased due to a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, \"we are far from a return to normal.\" \"The situation is not improving -- quite the contrary -- despite all the appeals for calm,\" she said, adding that Noum\u00e9a was \"under siege.\"", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanak_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanak people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples of the Americas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gendarmerie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional amendment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noum\u00e9a", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Siege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580739", "eventUri": "eng-9580739", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

The violence has renewed discussions about France's colonial past, which have largely focused on Africa until now.\n\nBackground: Riots began after France's parliament approved constitutional changes to give local voting rights to French citizens who had lived in the archipelago for at least 10 years. This would dilute the voting rights of the Indigenous population, which has voted three times for independence from France in recent years.\n\nMacron is facing a lose-lose situation. If he postpones the constitutional change - it's set to be ratified at the end of May - he will look like he is caving to violence. If he does nothing, he risks the insurrection continuing to dominate the French news cycle, rather than France's recent economic upturn, ahead of the upcoming European Parliamentary elections. But with Macron's party 15 points behind Marie Le Pen's, he was already expected to face a humiliating defeat when voters head to the polls on June 9.\n\nAs Macron makes the two-day journey in hopes of finding a \"comprehensive security agreement,\" troops are working to rein in the violence ahead of his arrival.

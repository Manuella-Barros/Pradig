She shook the hands of players and coaches alike, addressed the team and took a group photo where Curry stood beside her.\n\nCurry and Harris had an extended talk to the side after smiling for the cameras.\n\n\"It was a great reminder of the fact that we're playing for our country and Vice President Harris was great,\" Kerr said. \"She told the guys how much she admired them and how they really embodied excellence, and the fact that we are going over there to try to win a gold medal for our country.\n\n\"She said that it's a demonstration of our patriotic feeling of being part of something special for our country. I think the guys really listened to every word. It was great.\"\n\nAs a lifelong, die-hard Warriors fan, Tuesday wasn't the first time Harris and Kerr have had the chance to connect. Kerr joked it's a shame Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, is a Los Angeles Lakers fan while reveling in Harris' basketball knowledge and love for her hometown team.\n\nThe only other Warriors representative on Team USA for the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics is Curry, who also has grown a strong relationship with Harris. Kerr and Curry of course had the chance to get to know President Joe Biden and Harris better when the Warriors visited the White House in January 2023.\n\n\"I've met her many times, given that she's from Oakland, and we've been fortunate enough to visit the White House when she was there, but also a few trips to California,\" Kerr said. \"I've met her several times. She's a Warriors fan and she love our team, she loves basketball.\n\n\"The First Gentleman is a Lakers fan, unfortunately, but we'll live with that.\"\n\nKevin Durant during his three years with the Warriors won back-to-back championships in 2017 and 2018. He also never visited the White House.\n\nThe Warriors did not make the trip of what always was an annual honor before former President Donald Trump held office. The team skipped the customary photo op after Durant's first title as a Warrior, and opted to instead spend time with former President Barack Obama in January 2019 before Golden State's only road game against the Washington Wizards.\n\n\"It was cool,\" Durant said of meeting Harris. \"We know we got her support. She's been out here working a lot, she's so busy, but she wanted to come out here and check us out. It's an honor. I'm glad she was able to come through.\"\n\nHarris is in Las Vegas at an event that \"will highlight the stakes of the election for Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities,\" according to a statement by the Biden-Harris campaign. She landed around 12:50 p.m. PT and soon after went to Team USA practice.\n\nMiami Heat star big man and member of Team USA Bam Adebayo is a three-time NBA All-Star who has been selected to the All-Defensive Team five times in his seven-year career. But he still is waiting for his first White House visit, and knows Tuesday's surprise is a moment he won't forget.\n\n\"Being able to have her there and speak to us is a dope moment,\" Adebayo said.

You are, as you are every day on and off the court, ambassadors for who we are as a country. You represent leaders in every walk of life. And for you to go to Paris and bring back that gold is just another example of your excellence, your teamwork, your compassion and your commitment.\"\n\nU.S. assistant coach Erik Spoelstra said he didn't know the vice president was coming to practice.\n\n\"It was a pretty special moment for the entire group,\" Spoelstra said. \"She just mentioned that we represent our country and everybody's going to be watching and rooting for us and it's a big responsibility. But she knows that we all are putting in the work to represent everybody here and do it with class.\"\n\nHarris is planning to meet with voters in both Las Vegas and Dallas this week. She's facing extra attention among Democrats considering her prospects as a possible replacement for President Joe Biden, who is resisting calls to step aside.\n\nThe U.S. men's team plays its first of five pre-Olympic exhibition games Wednesday against Canada in Las Vegas. Even though that game won't have any bearing on the Olympics -- the first U.S. game in France is against Serbia on July 28 -- Harris encouraged the team to go ahead and start winning now.\n\n\"Our nation is cheering you on and we are so proud of you,\" Harris said. \"Beat Canada and bring back that gold.\"\n\nWhat is DirecTV Stream?\n\nDirecTV Stream is a comprehensive internet TV service that offers your favorite entertainment, news and sports channels, as well as local TV stations and regional sports networks.

You are, as you are every day on and off the court, ambassadors for who we are as a country. You represent leaders in every walk of life. And for you to go to Paris and bring back that gold is just another example of your excellence, your teamwork, your compassion and your commitment.\"\n\nU.S. assistant coach Erik Spoelstra said he didn't know the vice president was coming to practice.\n\n\"It was a pretty special moment for the entire group,\" Spoelstra said. \"She just mentioned that we represent our country and everybody's going to be watching and rooting for us and it's a big responsibility.

She spoke in front of more than 200 people at the event off the Las Vegas strip.\n\nHarris called the November election against former President Donald Trump the most \"consequential, important election of our lifetime.\"\n\n\"Now, we always knew this election would be tough,\" she said. \"And the past few days have been a reminder that running for president of the United States is never easy, but the one thing we know about our president, Joe Biden, is that he is a fighter. And he is the first to say when you get knocked down you get back up.\"\n\nTuesday wasn't Harris' first involvement in the world of basketball. Harris, a former senator from California, hosted the Warriors, who play in the San Francisco Bay Area, at the White House and has been to multiple Golden State games in recent years.\n\nKerr, who coaches the Warriors, said he has \"met her many times given that she's from Oakland.\"\n\n\"It's a great reminder of the fact that we're playing for our country,\" Kerr said. \"She's a Warriors fan. She loves our team and loves basketball.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

players during their fourth and final practice session before their series of friendly matches.\n\n\"All of you represent the best of the best,\" Harris said, later closing with a deeply patriotic

\"another example of your excellence, teamwork, compassion, and commitment.\"\n\nFollowing the brief vicepresidential visit, Kerr commented that such occasions \"are a great reminder that we are playing for our country.\" Team USA, who has met with Harris on various occasions due to her fondness for the squad, revealed that \"she told the guys how much she admired them, how they truly embody excellence, and that we're going there to try to win a gold medal for our country.\"\n\nHarris finally shook hands with the players, had a brief conversation with forward LeBron James, who has been very active in politics on the Democratic side, and posed for a group photo with the star-studded roster.\n\nThe Californian politician, originally from Oakland, has long said she is a basketball fan,

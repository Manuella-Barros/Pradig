ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz interviewed an IDF spokesperson and questioned him about the number of civilians killed and injured during the operation. \u201cPart of this mission were the air strikes,\u201d Raddatz said. \u201cWe saw buildings destroyed in a civilian area, in broad daylight. There were people on the street during this attack through the air. Did you factor in the loss of so many Palestinians in this operation?\u201d When the rescue operation occurred, it was in the middle of the morning, and many people were out shopping at a market nearby. \u201c[It was] something we never witnessed before, maybe 150 rockets fell in less than 10 minutes, while we were running away more fell on the market,\u201d Nidal Abdo, a local resident who was close to where the attacks occurred, told CNN. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how many casualties were caused in the strike in the release and rescue operation,\u201d Lerner told Raddatz. \u201cAnd I\u2019d be very cautious at accepting any figures and numbers that Hamas are putting out.\u201d But Raddatz pointed out that while Hamas is saying that 274 deaths resulted from the operation, even the IDF has acknowledged deaths occurred, with an estimated count of fewer than 100 Palestinians dead. \u201cThat\u2019s a significant amount of casualties. Did they come from those air strikes in broad daylight?\u201d Raddatz asked Lerner. \u201cEvery civilian life lost in this war is a tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery civilian life lost in this war is a result of how Hamas has operated. Let\u2019s think about, just for a moment, where they were holding the hostages. Within civilian houses. Within people\u2019s apartments \u2014 in the same apartment they were being held where the families that owned the apartments. This exemplifies specifically how Hamas operating.\u201d The hostages were being held in two apartments in civilian buildings approximately 200 meters away from each other. Lerner added that forces trying to rescue the four hostages \u2014 Noa Argamani, Almog Meir, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv \u2014 \u201ccame under extensive attack in an attempt to kill both them and the hostages.\u201d But Raddatz continued to press Lerner on the necessity of the air strikes. \u201cAnd is that the reason for the air strikes? Tell me why those air strikes were necessary, why buildings were destroyed in that attack?\u201d Lerner said that IDF forces \u201ccame under fire from a 360-degree threat: RPGs, AK-47s, explosive devices on the way, mortar rounds\u201d before blaming civilian casualties on \u201chow Hamas is battling us on the battleground.\u201d \u201cWould you carry out a similar rescue mission to get the other 116 hostages, no matter the cost to civilians in Gaza?\u201d Raddatz asked. \u201cThere can be a rescue mission like what happened yesterday. But there could also have been negotiations that create the opportunity,\u201d Lerner replied. \u201cOur role is to create the conditions either way, that Hamas realizes that they should give back the hostages, they should set the hostages free.\u201d According to The Jerusalem Post, Hamas released a message stating that other Israeli hostages were killed by IDF forces during the rescue mission. \u201cIn exchange for them [the four Israeli hostages], your own army killed three of your own captives in the same attack; one of them holds a US citizenship,\u201d Hamas said in a statement. Israel and Hamas are currently engaged in negotiations to reach a ceasefire agreement, but Saturday\u2019s attack could mark a setback in those talks. One Egyptian official with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN that the rescue mission will have a \u201cnegative effect.\u201d \u201c[It] won\u2019t be easy,\u201d the Egyptian official said. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan called the civilian deaths and injuries \u201ctragic\u201d and encouraged Hamas to accept the ceasefire deal that President Joe Biden has put forth. \u201cThe best way to get all of the hostages home and to protect Palestinian civilians is to end this war. And the best way to end this war is for Hamas to say yes to the deal President Biden announced and that Israel has accepted,\u201d Sullivan said on CNN Sunday. That agreement includes a permanent ceasefire, a total withdrawal of Israel\u2019s military from Gaza, and a prisoner exchange, among other conditions. Meanwhile, in Gaza, aid workers have said that military operations make it exceedingly difficult for them to deliver assistance and necessary supplies. \u201cMedical equipment, medications, we haven\u2019t been able to get. It\u2019s been the same issue with fuel,\u201d Karin Huster, a French-American trauma nurse and medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Gaza, tells Rolling Stone. \u201cIt\u2019s been super challenging\u2026 And soon it will be impossible for us to work.\u201d", "summary": "The anchor asked whether the Israeli military considered the killing of \"so many Palestinians\" in their efforts to save hostages", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/idf-spokesman-palestinian-civilian-deaths-hostage-rescue-1235036244/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Untitled.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:42:45", "author": "Peter Wade", "authors": ["Peter Wade"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.379}

The time has come to conclude the ceasefire and hostages and detainees release deal.'\n\nIt says only the 'details of implementation' are left to be concluded after talks that have stretched on for months. The statement comes amid fears of broadening conflicts in the Middle East. 'There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay. It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.'\n\n'There's really no further time to waste or excuses for any party for further delay,' said a senior administration official told reporters. 'We need to get this deal done.' The official said there was 'work to be done,' including the 'sequencing' of the exchange for the release of hostages held in Gaza since the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack inside Israel. 'We're going to need some things from the Israelis. We're going to need some things from the Hamas side,' said the official, who said the 'bulk' of the deal had been completed.\n\nIt comes amid fears Iran could strike Israel in response to the strike that killed a Hamas political leader inside Iran. Still, there is 'no legitimate basis whatsoever for Iran to launch an attack on Israel,' said the official.\n\nLeaders of the United States, Egypt and Qatar on Thursday called on Israel and Hamas to meet for negotiations on Aug. 15 in order to finalize a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. The three countries, which have been trying to mediate a deal, said in a joint statement the talks could take place in either Doha or Cairo.\n\n'A framework agreement is now on the table with only the details of implementation left to conclude,' they said. 'There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay. It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.'\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli negotiators would be there. The aim, he said, was 'to finalize the details and implement the framework agreement.' There was no immediate comment from Hamas. The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nAt least 39,699 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. The letter is signed by Presidnet Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Amir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Hamas did not immediately respond.\n\nThe renewed diplomatic push will be seen as an attempt to stop regional tensions from spiralling out of control, after Hamas' leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated last week.

Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence force said it hit two schools, killing more than 18 people. The Israeli military said it had struck Hamas command centres.\n\nAny proposed talks could be made even more difficult by Hamas' decision to elect Yahya Sinwar as its new leader, replacing Haniyeh.\n\nSinwar, who Israel holds responsible for the planning and execution of the 7 October attacks, is seen as one of the group's most extreme figures.\n\nAmid fears of an attack from Iran or

The time has come to conclude the cease-fire and hostages and detainees release deal,\" reads the statement signed by President Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Amir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.\n\nTogether, the three leaders are calling for Israel and Hamas to resume negotiations next Thursday, Aug. 15, in either Qatar's Doha or Cairo, Egypt, to \"close all remaining gaps and commence implementation\" of the agreement outlined and endorsed by the United Nations Security Council.\n\nThat multi-phase deal calls for an \"immediate, full and complete cease-fire with the release of hostages...the return of the remains of some hostages who have been killed,\" a prisoner exchange, safe passage for Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighborhoods throughout Gaza and safe distribution of humanitarian aid throughout the Gaza Strip. That would be followed by a \"permanent end to hostilities,\" the release of all hostages still in Gaza after the initial release phase and a full withdrawl of Israeli forces from Gaza; then a multi-year reconstruction plan and the repatriation of any hostage remains still in Gaza to their families.\n\nThroughout the week, Biden has been on calls with leaders in Jordan, Qatar and Egypt to gague the temperature of the situation and hash out mediation details between their respective allies, leading to this joint statement, a White House official told reporters on Thursday. Together, the three countries have mediated negotiations between Israel and Hamas -- the U.S. working with Israel, Egypt and Qatar working with Hamas -- are ready to present a \"final bridging proposal\" to help the two warring sides strike a deal and end the conflict.\n\n\"Obviously a statement from three leaders is unusual, but it's, we think, significant,\" said Brett McGurk, National Security Council coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa. \"These three leaders have been involved in this hostage negotiation, cease-fire agreement negotiation now for some months, and as the statement says, there's a framework agreement that is on the table with really the details of implementation that are left to conclude.\"\n\nFor the most part, the deal has been agreed to in principle, as Biden has said previously. Where the two sides still stand apart is in implementation. A senior White House official said that remaining details have to do with implementation: the sequence of events and exchanges that both Israel and Hamas need to agree upon.\n\nBut for the talks to be successful, buy-in has to come from both sides, the official said. \"At the end of the day, this is a hostage negotiation. They're holding hostages, and we're going to need some things from the Israelis, we're going to need some things from the Hamas side...to try to bring this to a resolution,\" they added.\n\nMeanwhile, as negotiations continue, the White House and the U.S. military are keeping up a defensive posture to protect Israel in case of any strikes that might come from Iran or Hezbollah. The senior official said that the U.S. sees \"absolutely no legitimate basis whatsoever\" for Iran to launch an attack against Israel, and has moved in an \"awful lot of military force\" into the region to defend against attacks.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement confirming that it will send negotiators to resume talks with Hamas next week in response to the joint proposal. Hamas, the AP said, has not yet responded to the offer.\n\nThe White House expects preparatory talks for next week's negotiations to begin in short order, McGurk said, which is precisely what the mediators of the U.S., Qatar and Egypt are hoping for.\n\n\"There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,\" the joint statement concluded. \"It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.\"", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hamas wants a ceasefire agreement to end the war, while Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the conflict will stop only once Hamas is defeated.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_07_32_0301512.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802851", "eventUri": "eng-9802851", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 108, "textEnd": 115, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 1186, "textEnd": 1192}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

into the war, all attempts at mediation have failed and the war, which according to Hamas has left almost 40,000 dead in the small besieged Palestinian territory, has exacerbated tensions in the

Movement was needed on both sides of the table, the person said.\n\nThe US official said the statement was not designed to influence Iran but that any escalation would jeopardise hope of getting an Israel-Hamas deal done.\n\nIran's mission to the United Nations said earlier on Thursday that it was pursuing two priorities simultaneously.\n\n\"First, establishing a durable ceasefire in Gaza and the withdrawal of the occupiers from this territory,\" it said, as well as \"punishing the aggressor\" for the Jul 31 assassination of former Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Iran.\n\nThe war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas' Oct 7 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nAt least 39,699 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians.

They insisted that the negotiators meet in Cairo or Doha, Qatar, next Thursday.\n\n\"There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,\" the three leaders said in the statement. \"It is time to release the hostages, begin the cease-fire and implement this agreement. As mediators, if necessary, we are prepared to present a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties.\"\n\nCease-fire talks have been on hold after a meeting last weekend in Cairo produced no breakthrough, and the process has been complicated by the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who had been leading the negotiations through intermediaries. Biden has expressed frustration at Israel's decision to carry out the operation that killed Haniyeh in Iran at a time when the president had hoped the cease-fire talks were close to success.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel indicated minutes after the joint statement by Biden and the other leaders that he would agree to the meeting. \"In the wake of the offer by the United States and the mediators, Israel will send the negotiating delegation on Aug. 15 to whichever place is decided upon, so as to agree upon the details for the implementation of the framework deal,\" his office said in a statement.\n\nBut it is not clear how willing Netanyahu is to reach a deal. His own security officials have privately complained that the prime minister is holding up talks by, among other things, reintroducing a demand that had been softened by his negotiators. The prime minister has, in turn, accused his security officials of being bad negotiators.\n\nNor is it clear that Hamas is ready or able to make an agreement. The group did not immediately respond to the joint statement by Biden and the others, and it remained uncertain who would show up for negotiations now that Haniyeh is dead even if the group does return to the table.\n\nHamas named Yahya Sinwar, one of the architects of the deadly Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, to replace Haniyeh, but he is believed to be hiding in Gaza and not easily or quickly reached by intermediaries. Even while Haniyeh was alive, Sinwar was said to be the one calling the shots from his sanctuary, and no one expects him to emerge publicly.\n\nA senior Biden administration official said that the joint statement arose out of discussions this week among the president, el-Sissi and Al Thani. The official did not describe what a \"final bridging proposal\" would look like but said that the framework agreement already on the table could be finalized, with some concessions on details, like the sequencing of releases of hostages and prisoners.\n\nThe official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, said there were four or five issues that needed to be resolved to complete the cease-fire agreement and added that they could be managed if there were sufficient will on both sides. But he cautioned that the meeting next Thursday, should it happen, would only resume the negotiating process and warned against expecting the agreement to be wrapped up that day.\n\nIn a statement of its own, an Israeli body representing the families of many of those abducted by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attacks welcomed the call by Biden and the other leaders. Around 115 hostages remain in Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.\n\n\"This recent statement reaffirms what we've long known: A deal is the only path to bring all hostages home,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said. \"Time is running out. The hostages have no more time to spare. A deal must be signed now!\"\n\nThe U.S.-led push to renew talks comes at a moment of high tension in the region because of the assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran and a senior Hezbollah figure in Lebanon. Both Hezbollah and Iran have vowed to retaliate against Israel, and the United States has ordered more warships and aircraft to deploy to the region to help defend its ally against any such attacks.\n\nBiden met in the Oval Office on Thursday with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other officials to review military preparations, and his team repeated the U.S. determination to stand by Israel. At the same time, Biden and his advisers have urged Israel to think twice about an expansive counter-retaliation that could escalate into a regional war.\n\nU.S. officials in recent days have expressed tentative optimism that any action taken by either side may yet be relatively measured, allowing various players to save face without triggering a more explosive conflict. But if that does not bear out, then it could make any return to the bargaining table next week problematic, at least.\n\nGaza health ministry: 15 dead after Israeli strikes on two schools\n\nAt least 15 people were killed and dozens more injured in Israeli attacks on Thursday on two schools in Gaza City, the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza said.\n\nThe Israeli army confirmed the attacks on the schools, saying they were aimed at terrorists from Hamas, who operated command centers in the area of the two schools.\n\nIt said it had taken \"numerous steps\" to \"mitigate the risk of harming civilians,\" including using precise weapons, surveillance and other intelligence, the army said.\n\nThe information could not be independently verified.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Gaza war on Oct. 7, school operations in the sealed-off coastal area were suspended. Most schools now serve as emergency shelters for war-displaced people.\n\nAround 85% of the population of the Gaza Strip has been forced to flee as a result of the war. Hamas, on the other hand, often uses schools and hospitals to set up command centers and store weapons.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors":

After a round of release exchanges in November, Israel says 111 hostages remain in Gaza, including 39 bodies.\n\nIts campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,600 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,700 others. More than 1.9 million of Gaza's pre-war population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, fleeing repeatedly across the territory to escape offensives.\n\nMost are now crowded into ramshackle tent camps in an area measuring about 19 square miles on the Gaza coast.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Israel on July 06, 2024.\n\nThe families of Israeli hostages on Friday urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to \"show leadership\" in the upcoming hostage exchange negotiations scheduled for next week.\n\nIn a statement, the families expressed their gratitude to US President Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani for their commitment to securing the release of the hostages.\n\nThe families urged the Israeli government and Netanyahu to also \"show strong leadership\" by finalizing the remaining details of Netanyahu's plan to ensure the return of all hostages.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the office of Israeli prime minister announced that Israel will send its negotiation team on Aug. 15 to finalize the details of a hostage exchange agreement with Palestinian resistance factions in the Gaza Strip.\n\nOn Thursday evening, leaders from Egypt, Qatar, and the US called on Israel and Hamas to resume negotiations in Doha or Cairo on Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nThis call follows the assassination of Hamas' political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which has negatively impacted the resumption of negotiations between the two sides.\n\nFor months, Egypt, Qatar, and the US have been leading indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, but no agreement has been reached due to Israel's refusal to meet Hamas' demands to end the war, withdraw troops from Gaza, and allow displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza.\n\nIsrael has continued a devastating military offensive in the Gaza Strip since an Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire.\n\nNearly 40,000 Palestinians have since been killed, mostly women and children, and over 91,700 injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nOver 10 months into the Israeli war, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water, and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which ordered it to immediately halt its military operation in the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war

Since then, each side has accused the other of adding untenable conditions.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted on maintaining a security presence along two key Gaza corridors to ensure Hamas's remaining forces stay contained in the Rafah area. He has refused to agree to end the war once the hostages are free, including the return of dead hostages, instead saying that Israel must act to ensure Hamas that cannot retain power in Gaza.\n\nHamas has not agreed to even name the hostages they will release or guarantee that most of the hostages they release will even be alive.\n\nEgypt has been repeatedly embarrassed with the exposure of massive Hamas smuggling and terror tunnels leading from their Sinai territory into Gaza, implying a level of complicity in October 7th, and certainly indicating that border security can not be left exclusively in their hands. Egypt has also forbidden Gazans to escape the war zone across their shared border in Rafiah, unless the individual Gazans trying to cross pay exorbitant exit fees in the thousands of dollars.\n\nThe US has an election coming up, and the Democrats believe that getting a ceasefire deal in place, no matter how bad it is for Israel, will help them in the elections.\n\nThe Biden administration has accused Hamas multiple times of failing to move forward on the proposal. A senior Biden administration official said weeks ago that a deal was closer than it has been in months and that a framework had been agreed upon, with some details of the actual implementation of the phased deal still up in the air.\n\n\"We do think there's a way forward here. And I would just emphasize, it's incumbent upon not just the Israeli side, but also the Hamas side,\" the senior official said. \"At the end of the day, this is a hostage negotiation. They're holding hostages, and we're going to need some things from the Israelis. We're going to need some things from the Hamas side, through the Qataris and the Egyptians, to try to bring this to a resolution.\"\n\nThe official said some four or five issues still must be hammered out but did not go into specifics. Both sides \"have very firm positions\" that \"might be unbridgeable\" as a whole, but need to be looked at individually, the official said.\n\n\"You treat each issue one by one, and with each one, there's some trade space, and you can kind of find a way forward,\" the senior official said, adding that \"we're fairly confident -- and I base this on our consultations, not only with the Israelis but also Egyptians and Qataris -- that there's a way forward here, but also, more importantly, there needs to be a way forward here. We have lives on the line, particularly the hostages.\"\n\nThe senior official did not mention the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which the White House has constantly emphasized when discussing the need for a ceasefire.\n\nThe joint statement includes an offer by the mediators, \"if necessary,\" to present \"a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties.\"\n\nThe senior official told reporters this type of offer has previously been made on specific issues.\n\n\"I think what's left here are really the implementation issues of the deal. It has to do with the sequencing of the exchange and some other issues that are complicated, but we believe there's enough trade space,\" the official said. \"Having a proposal that's unified between the three mediators can be quite powerful.\"\n\nAsked whether the joint statement was a roundabout way of giving Iran an off-ramp from its threatened attack of Israel in order to give a ceasefire in Gaza a chance, the senior official denied any connection.\n\nBut the official said that a major Iranian attack would put a ceasefire on the backburner -- something that goes against the interests of Hamas, Iran's proxy.\n\nThe official also disputed the view that Iran has a right to retaliate for last week's assassination of Hamas political head Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel is widely thought to be responsible, though it has neither taken credit nor denied involvement.\n\n\"There's been a kind of a sense out there that somehow Iran now has the right to attack Israel militarily. We completely reject that logic,\" the senior official said. \"I think the consequences of such a direct attack could be quite significant, including for Iran and Iran's economy.\"", "source": {"uri":

announcement of the talks came after Hamas named Yahya Sinwar -- the alleged mastermind of the October 7 attack -- as its new leader, sparking fears the torturous negotiations have become even more difficult.\n\nMeanwhile, hostilities continue in war-torn Gaza with the strip's Hamas-controlled civil defence agency saying that the latest Israeli bombardment killed more than 18 people in strikes on two schools on Thursday, as Iran accused Israel of wanting to spread war in the Middle East.\n\nThe agency said Israeli strikes hit Al-Zahra and Abdel Fattah Hamoud schools in Gaza City, killing more than 18 people.\n\nSenior agency official Mohammad al-Mughayyir said 60 people were wounded and more than 40 still missing.\n\n\"This is a clear targeting of schools and safe civilian facilities in the Gaza Strip,\" he said.\n\nThe Israeli military said the schools housed Hamas command centres.\n\nAt least 13 people were killed elsewhere in Gaza, rescuers and medics reported, as the Israeli military issued its latest evacuation order, for parts of the main southern city of Khan Yunis.", "source": {"uri": "india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India News, Breaking News, Entertainment

The Israeli military said it had struck Hamas command centres.\n\nAny proposed talks could be made even more difficult by Hamas' decision to elect Yahya Sinwar as its new leader, replacing Haniyeh.\n\nSinwar, who Israel holds responsible for the planning and execution of the 7 October attacks, is seen as one of the group's most extreme figures.\n\nAmid fears of an attack from Iran or its allies, Israel's security cabinet met in an underground bunker on Thursday, instead of its usual meeting place, Israel's Channel 13 reported.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamim_bin_Hamad_Al_Thani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Egypt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Egypt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdel_Fattah_el-Sisi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abdel Fattah el-Sisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4e43/live/a4448150-55d6-11ef-81f2-d36891a35222.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802851", "eventUri": "eng-9802851", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 364, "textEnd": 373}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-31", "textStart": 916, "textEnd": 922}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 1748, "textEnd": 1757}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

famine.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced overnight Friday that Tel Aviv has agreed to resume Gaza ceasefire discussions on August 15 at the request of Egypt, Qatar, and the US.\n\nThe statement also arrives against the backdrop of an increasingly turbulent regional climate.\n\nIsrael and the US are on high alert for imminent retaliatory actions from Iran against

It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.\"\n\nIsrael and Hamas should meet in Cairo, Egypt, or Doha, Qatar, on 15 August to finalize the agreement, the statement said.

We're going to need some things from the Hamas side.\"\n\nIn the past six months, Hamas and Israel have each raised objections over the proposed ceasefire. But US officials appear to have concluded that they need to put more pressure on Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the ceasefire deal, which involves the release of Israeli hostages captured by Hamas on 7 October.\n\nNetanyahu has so far refused to publicly endorse the proposed ceasefire deal even after being personally lobbied by Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris when he visited Washington on 22-26 August.\n\nDeadly attacks exchanged between Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Israel since then, as well as the assassination of Palestinian group Hamas' chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on 31 July, have raised fear of an escalation of the Gaza conflict.\n\nIsrael has not explicitly acknowledged its involvement in Haniyeh's death. But Iranian officials have little doubt that Israel was behind the hit, vowing to retaliate.\n\nBiden said that killing Haniyeh \"has not helped\" the ceasefire efforts.\n\nThe US in the past week has taken the rare step of reaching out directly to Iran to urge against an escalation. The senior US official today referenced a statement by Iran's UN mission to the UN in New York, which suggested that Tehran would consider the prospective ceasefire in Gaza a mitigating factor in determining how to respond to Haniyeh's death.\n\n\"If [Iran launches] a major war in the Middle East with some massive attack on Israel, which they're threatening in coordination with other groups, that's obviously going to significantly jeopardize any hope of getting a ceasefire in Gaza,\" the US official said. \"But we will be prepared for any contingency, and we have moved an awful lot of

After a round of release exchanges in November, Israel says 111 hostages remain in Gaza, including 39 bodies.\n\nIts campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,600 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,700 others. More than 1.9 million of Gaza's pre-war population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, fleeing repeatedly across the territory to escape offensives.\n\nMost are now crowded into ramshackle tent camps in an area measuring about 19 square miles on the Gaza coast.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.shropshirestar.com/resizer/v2/NB3YMUDL4FFKDMFFSKE7IDEG24.jpg?auth=c97b94ef6d038df83fa8318749f43c97085cf2ad8350ad1d9c2b0587d15951ad&width=1200&height=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802851", "eventUri": "eng-9802851", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 888, "textEnd": 897, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1448, "textEnd": 1455}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 1605, "textEnd": 1614}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

It said troops were searching for Hamas tunnels and other infrastructure while engaging in combat \"above and below ground.\"\n\nAfter 10 months of war in Gaza, the mediators\u00b4 push aims to resume indirect negotiations for a cease-fire that have been on hold since Sinwar's predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in a presumed Israeli blast in Tehran on July 31.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u00b4s office confirmed Thursday that it would send negotiators to talks that mediators have called for on Aug. 15, to be held in either Qatar\u00b4s capital of Doha or Egypt\u00b4s capital of Cairo.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Hamas, which announced Tuesday that Sinwar, the group's leader in Gaza, would replace Haniyeh as the group's top leader. Haniyeh previously served as the key interlocutor in the negotiations.\n\nHaniyeh\u00b4s killing and that of a top Hezbollah commander in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut brought vows of retaliation from Hezbollah and Iran. International diplomats have been scrambling to prevent an escalation and to seal a deal to stop the fighting in Gaza and release the hostages still captive in the enclave.\n\nIn a joint statement, the United States, Egypt and Qatar called for the new round of talks, to be held either in Doha or Cairo, and pressed both sides to move ahead.\n\n\"There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,\" they said, adding that the negotiators have already finalized a framework for the deal.\n\nThey said mediators were prepared to present a final compromise \"that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties.\" It did not elaborate on what that would look like.\n\nA key question hanging over the talks is the impact of Sinwar's elevation to Hamas\u00b4 top leadership post. Seen as a hard-liner within the group, Sinwar has been in deep hiding in Gaza throughout the war as Israel vows to kill him.\n\nSinwar has already been closely involved in negotiations from behind the scenes. Hamas officials and mediators have said Hamas negotiators regularly sought his approval on the group\u00b4s positions as it pressed for guarantees that a deal would bring a complete end to the war and withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza, in return for the release of all hostages.\n\nIsrael has vowed to destroy Hamas after the Oct. 7 attack, in which militants from Gaza stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 250 others. After a round of release exchanges in November, Israel says 111 hostages remain in Gaza, including 39 bodies.\n\nIts campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,600 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,700 others. More than 1.9 million of Gaza\u00b4s pre-war population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, fleeing repeatedly across the territory to escape offensives. Most are now crowded into ramshackle tent camps in an area about 50 square kilometers (19 square miles) on the Gaza coast.\n\nWith sanitation systems collapsed, diseases have run rampant, health officials say, and humanitarian groups are trying to feed the population. The United Nations says a half-million Palestinians facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity.\n\nIsrael's military said Friday that its forces were still battling Hamas fighters in Gaza\u00b4s southernmost city, Rafah, in an assault there that has lasted three months. Its new assault in Khan Younis, where it has waged multiple offensives this year, drove more people into the camps and neighboring areas.\n\nGhazi Abu Daka, one of the evacuees, told the AP that he and his family have had to flee eastern Khan Younis four times now.\n\n\"Every day there is war. Every day there are rockets. There is no safe place in the eastern area. Now, we are displaced in the streets and don\u00b4t know where to go,\" he said as he carried his son, a piece of cloth on his head to protect him from the heat.\n\nYasser Abu Alyan, another evacuee, said he was displaced around six times from the Beni Seheila area east of the city. He said he took nothing with him except his two little girls: \"Everything is gone.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

Please try again later.\n\nThe leaders of the United States, Qatar and Egypt issued a joint statement Thursday evening calling on Israel and Hamas to return to the negotiating table on April 15 to finalize a cease-fire and hostage release agreement, saying \"there is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay.\"\n\n\"The three of us and our teams have worked tirelessly over many months to forge a framework agreement that is now on the table with only the details of implementation left to conclude,\" said the statement, signed by President Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Qatari Emire Shekh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.\n\n\"It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement,\" the statement said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement it would send a delegation to the resumed negotiations, to be held in Cairo or Doha, Qatar, \"to finalize the details for implementing the framework agreement.\" Hamas made no immediate response.\n\nThe new initiative came as Iran has threatened a massive retaliation in response to an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last week that killed a senior leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah, quickly followed by the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, reportedly by an Israeli bomb smuggled into a guest house where he was staying. Haniyeh was the main Hamas negotiator in the cease-fire talks.\n\nSince then, the United States has reiterated its pledge to defend Israel and substantially reinforced its air and naval assets in the region, including the Middle East deployment early Thursday of Air Force F-22 Raptors.\n\nA senior administration official who briefed reporters on the new cease-fire initiative said it was \"not tied to the larger picture\" of the Iranian threat. \"This is about 'we need to get this deal done.'\"\n\nBut \"if it influences them,\" the official said of Iran, \"that's fine. I would say, if they launch a major war in the Middle East, with some massive attack on Israel -- which they're threatening -- that's obviously going to significantly jeopardize any hope of getting a cease-fire in Gaza.\"\n\nThe last round of indirect talks mediated by the three governments ended nearly two weeks ago in Rome, when Israel presented new demands to the \"framework\" that Biden made public on May 31. Administration officials from Biden on down were reportedly furious at Netanyahu's last-minute ultimatum, as were senior Israeli military and political leaders.\n\nThe three-leader statement expressed the same sense of urgency, in nearly the same words, that the administration has used over the past few months as hopes rose and fell that a cease-fire agreement was near. Both the statement and the official briefing implied that it was an ultimatum.\n\n\"As mediators, if necessary, we are prepared to present a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties,\" the statement said. The senior official provided no details about how a \"final\" proposal by the mediators would be enforced.\n\nDescribing the genesis of the statement, the senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House, said that it began with a call last Monday between Biden and King Abdullah of Jordan that included Vice President Harris and U.S. military leaders regarding the defense of Israel in the event of a potential attack on Israel \"from Iran or Hezbollah or anyone else.\"\n\n\"And then on Tuesday, the president had ... in-depth discussions\" with Al Thani and Sisi that \"really delved into the hostage process. And out of that came the very constructive proposal to issue a joint statement.\" Israel was \"receptive,\" the official said and \"both Qatar and Egypt believe this would be very useful as they're working on the Hamas side.\"\n\nBiden met with his national security team again in the Oval Office Thursday to \"review our military deployments, which are ongoing and quite significant and substantial,\" the official said.\n\nAt the same time, \"we've been in fairly in-depth discussions with the Israelis ... and we do think there's a way forward here,\" the official said. \"I would just emphasize it's incumbent upon not just the Israeli side, but also the Hamas side.\"\n\nThe official said \"we think the bulk of the work has been done and the deal is really there. And with some force of will, and sitting down to hash it out,\" it is possible to reach an agreement.\n\n\"Both sides have positions on about four or five issues ... and if you just look at them, they might be unbridgeable,\" the official added.\n\nBut \"there needs to be a way forward here.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Friday that Israel will send its negotiation team on Aug. 15 to finalize the details of a hostage exchange agreement with Palestinian resistance factions in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"Pursuant to the proposal by the US and the mediators, Israel will - on 15 August - send the negotiations team to a place to be determined in order to finalize the details of the implementation of the framework agreement,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Palestinian group Hamas on the statement.\n\nOn Thursday evening, leaders from Egypt, Qatar, and the US called on Israel and Hamas to resume negotiations in Doha or Cairo on Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nThis call follows the assassination of Hamas' political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which has negatively impacted the resumption of negotiations between the two sides.\n\nLast Saturday, the Israeli negotiation team left Cairo shortly after arriving, according to the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.\n\nThe team returned to Tel Aviv due to disagreements with Netanyahu, although the nature of these disagreements was not specified.\n\nFor months, Egypt, Qatar, and the US have been leading indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, but no agreement has been reached due to Israel's refusal to meet Hamas' demands to end the war, withdraw troops from Gaza, and allow displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza.\n\nIsrael has continued a devastating military offensive in the Gaza Strip since an Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire.\n\nNearly 39,700 Palestinians have since been killed, mostly women and children, and over 91,700 injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nOver 10 months into the Israeli war, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water, and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which ordered it to immediately halt its military operation in the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before

There was no immediate comment from Hamas.\n\nThe US doesn't expect an agreement will be ready to be signed immediately on Aug. 15 as there's still a significant amount of work to do, with both sides holding to firm positions, a senior Biden administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters on a call on Thursday.\n\nStill, the mediators believe that it's possible to bridge the remaining gaps after a framework was agreed to in an initial, multiphase cease-fire proposal that Biden outlined in May, the official said.\n\nFor months, the talks have stalled, partly over Hamas's insistence that a permanent halt to the hostilities be agreed to at the outset, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long insisted that after a pause Israeli forces must be allowed to continue the war until it destroys Hamas entirely.\n\nHowever, US officials now say a deal is closer than ever, even as the targeted killing of senior officials and commanders of the Iran-backed proxy groups Hamas and Hezbollah led to Iran's vow to strike Israel.\n\nIt's not clear who would represent Hamas in talks. After the group's political leader was assassinated in Tehran, he was replaced in that role by Yahya Sinwar, a hard-line Hamas leader who is in hiding in Gaza, where he spearheads the group's fight against Israel.\n\nThe threat from Iran -- similar to an Iranian retaliatory attack on Israel in April -- has prompted the US to move additional military assets into the region in order to deter Tehran, and help shoot down missiles, drones and rockets aimed at Israeli targets.\n\nThe three nations have been pressuring the two sides for months, urging both Israel and Hamas militants to halt fighting in the Gaza Strip that has killed roughly 40,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the coastal strip. Hamas, which attacked Israel on Oct. 7, is designated a terrorist group by the US and European Union.\n\nEarlier: F-22 Jets Arrive in Mideast in Show of Support for Israel\n\n--With assistance from Kenneth Hughes.\n\n(Updates with details from US official in fifth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Gaza's second-largest city, Khan Younis suffered widespread destruction during air and ground operations earlier this year.\n\nIsraeli forces have repeatedly returned to heavily destroyed areas of Gaza where they had fought earlier battles against Hamas and other militants since the start of the 10-month-old war.\n\nGaza faces a severe humanitarian crisis with Israeli restrictions on aid and ongoing fighting limiting access to crucial medical, food and other supplies. The Health Ministry in Gaza says the death toll in the territory is nearing 40,000.\n\nAn excerpt from Soumyabrata Choudhury's Thoughts of Gaza Far from Gaza: Deafening silence\n\nRegional tensions have soared since Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed July 31 in Iran by a presumed Israeli strike. Retaliation has been expected.\n\nCease-fire talks\n\nWorld leaders have been pushing for a cease-fire in Gaza. On Thursday (August 8,2024), the foreign powers involved in brokering a possible deal -- the U.S., Egypt and Qatar -- issued a joint statement calling on Israel and Hamas to resume stalled cease-fire talks on Aug. 15.\n\nIsrael has confirmed it will send negotiators to resume indirect cease-fire talks with Hamas next week in response to a proposal by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.\n\nIsrael's new strikes in Gaza City threaten truce talks: Hamas\n\nThe office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Thursday (August 8,2024) that the government would heed the call by foreign mediators to revive negotiations aimed at halting the fighting in Gaza after 10 months of devastating war and bringing home Israeli hostages still captive in the enclave.\n\nThe statement said that on August 15, at a place to be determined, the parties would hash out the implementation of a \"framework agreement\" that has already been finalized. The mediators said the talks would take place either in Qatar's capital of Doha or Egypt's capital of Cairo.\n\nThere was no immediate response to the offer by Hamas. Last week's killing of its top political leader in Tehran raised tensions across the region, an escalation widely seen as a blow to cease-fire talks.\n\nThe foreign powers involved in brokering a possible cease-fire aimed at halting the fighting in Gaza and releasing Israeli hostages have jointly appealed to Israel and Hamas to return to the negotiating table next week.\n\nThe statement issued Thursday (August 8,2024) by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, the three mediators in the monthslong Israel-Hamas war, called on the parties to resume stalled cease-fire talks on Aug. 15 in either Qatar's capital of Doha or Egypt's capital of Cairo.\n\n\"There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,\" it said, adding that the negotiators have already finalized a \"framework\" for the deal. All that's left to hammer out, it said, are the details of implementation.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/4vhsnu/article68504735.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_PALESTINIAN-ISRAEL-C_2_1_ATD63BU4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802851", "eventUri": "eng-9802851", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 921, "textEnd": 928}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 1088, "textEnd": 1096, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 1284, "textEnd": 1291, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Thursday's joint statement came hours after the White House said Israel-Hamas cease-fire talks are \"close\" and amid fears of a widening Middle East war following high-profile assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.\n\nThe framework agreement on the table is based on the principles outlined by President Biden on May 31 and endorsed by U.N. Security Council Resolution 2735, the statement said.\n\nIsrael launched a rare airstrike on Lebanon's capital of Beirut on July 30, killing Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, a close advisor to Hezbollah's secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah. A day later, the longtime chairman of Hamas' political bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated at his guesthouse in Tehran -- Iran blames Israel -- hours after attending the inauguration of incoming Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nIf cease-fire talks go ahead according to the proposed timeline, CIA Director William Burns is expected to travel and take part for the U.S.\n\nHaniyeh was Hamas' lead negotiator in cease-fire negotiations with Israel, the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. His negotiation role seems to have fallen to Yahya Sinwar, who is now the leader of Hamas' political wing and allegedly masterminded Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. Sinwar is believed to be in hiding in Gaza's underground tunnels.\n\nIn a call with reporters on Thursday, a National Security Council official noted that if the Aug. 15 talks do happen, an agreement likely wouldn't be reached immediately.\n\n\"It's not like the agreement is going to be ready to be signed on Thursday, there's still a significant amount of work to do. But we do believe that what's left here really can be bridged,\" the official said.\n\n\"We're fairly confident, and I base this on our consultations not only with the Israelis, but also the Egyptians and the Qataris, that there's a way forward here,\" the official added. \"But also, more importantly, there needs to be a way forward here.\"\n\n\"We are as close as we think we have ever been,\" National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday, referencing the cease-fire talks. \"The gaps are narrow enough that they can be closed. What we're talking about here is recognizing the fact that we've come an awful long way.\"\n\nHowever, longtime former Israeli negotiator Gershon Baskin told CBS News in Jerusalem, \"I have no idea where it's coming from.\"\n\n\"Seems detached from reality but maybe they know something that we don't,\" he said.\n\nOn whether the White House's comment could be an attempt at applying public pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a deal, Baskin said, \"could be, behind the scenes the Americans are pushing hard,\" but added, \"I don't think Netanyahu cares. He's against Biden.\"\n\nU.S.-Israel ties have frayed this year with Israel's continued military campaign in Gaza. Nearly 40,000 people have been killed in the enclave since Oct. 7, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.\n\nOn Tuesday, Netanyahu again spoke unwaveringly of military action, while visiting a military base for drafting soldiers.\n\n\"We are moving forward to victory,\" he told recruits. \"We are prepared for both defense and attack, we strike at our enemies and are also determined to defend ourselves.\"\n\nDays earlier, Netanyahu said Israel is already in a \"multi-front war.\"\n\n\"There is likely not to be much progress (on a cease-fire) unless Netanyahu changes his course,\" said Baskin \"or unless, of course, they find and kill Sinwar.\"\n\nIsrael considers Sinwar public enemy No. 1. Understood to be in his early 60s, he has had a long history of fighting Israel. In the late 1980s he became known as the \"Butcher of Khan Younis\" after killing a dozen people believed to be collaborating with Israel. He was sentenced to four life sentences and organized strikes in prison for better living conditions. In 2011, Netanyahu released him as part of a prisoner swap for a hostage Israeli solider.

The aim, he said, was \"to finalise the details and implement the framework agreement\". Netanyahu's administration has been accused of repeatedly sabotaging ceasefire talks.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Hamas. The announcement of the talks came after Hamas named Yahya Sinwar - the alleged mastermind of the 7 October attack - as its new leader, sparking fears that negotiations have become even more difficult. Sinwar was appointed after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran last month.\n\nThere was an increase in Israeli bombings on the Gaza Strip on Thursday, including strikes on a street in Bureij and Nuseirat camps as well as Gaza City and the southern city of Khan Younis, killing 60 people, medics said.\n\nAt least 15 people were killed in strikes on two schools functioning as shelters for people displaced from their homes in Gaza City, health officials in the Hamas-run territory said. The Israeli army said Hamas militants were using the schools as bases.\n\nThe Israeli military also renewed evacuation orders to Palestinian residents in several districts in eastern Khan Younis, saying it would act forcefully against militants who had unleashed rockets from those areas.\n\nThe army posted the evacuation order on X, and residents of the southern Gaza city said they had received text and audio messages.\n\nResidents said dozens of families had begun to leave their homes and head west towards al-Mawasi, a humanitarian-designated area but one that is overcrowded by displaced families from around the enclave.\n\nAlthough Israel has designated al-Mawasi as a humanitarian zone, it has continued to bomb targets there.\n\nGaza's second largest city, Khan Younis, suffered widespread destruction during air and ground operations earlier this year.\n\nRegional tensions have soared since Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed on 31 July in Iran, in an attack Tehran blames on Israel. Retaliation has been expected, raising fears of a possible broader conflict in the region.\n\nA senior US official said the joint statement from US, Qatari and Egyptian leaders was not designed to influence Iran, but that any escalation would jeopardise hope of getting an Israel-Hamas deal done.\n\nThe official said there was no expectation that the ceasefire agreement would be signed by next week given serious issues that include the sequencing of the exchanges between Hamas and Israel.

The statement emphasized the necessity of closing these gaps to expedite the commencement of the agreement's provisions.\n\nUpcoming Negotiation Talks\n\nIsrael has confirmed that it will send representatives to the proposed negotiation talks, scheduled for August 15 in either Doha or Cairo. As of now, Hamas has not provided a response regarding their participation.\n\nThis diplomatic initiative is perceived as a vital step to mitigate escalating tensions in the region, particularly following the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh last week. The event has prompted Iran to vow a retaliation against Israel, although Israel has not commented on these allegations.\n\nDetails of the Joint Statement\n\nThe collaborative statement from the United States, Egypt, and Qatar included an invitation for both parties to engage in talks to finalize the remaining aspects of the agreement swiftly. It stated, \"As mediators, if necessary, we are prepared to present a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties.\"\n\nThis statement was endorsed by prominent leaders: US President Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of Qatar.\n\nSticking Points in Negotiations\n\nThe framework agreement outlined objectives previously set by President Biden, aiming for an initial ceasefire and the subsequent release of hostages, with the endorsement of the UN Security Council. Despite several negotiation rounds, achieving a conclusive ceasefire and hostage release agreement has proven challenging.\n\nWhile Hamas advocates for a ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asserted that any cessation of hostilities hinges on the complete defeat of Hamas.\n\nContinued Violence and Leadership Changes\n\nAs negotiations remain uncertain, Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip have continued. Reports indicate that strikes have resulted in casualties, including over 18 deaths linked to attacks on schools, with the Israeli military asserting that these actions are targeted at Hamas command centers.\n\nCompounding the situation is Hamas's recent election of Yahya Sinwar as its new leader, succeeding Haniyeh.

Benjamin Netanyahu is considered a hardliner. He's gone into these negotiations previously with several non-negotiables and has added to that list.\"\n\nStill, in Thursday's statement, Qatar, Egypt and the US said it is \"time to bring immediate relief both to the long-suffering people of Gaza as well as the long-suffering hostages and their families\".\n\n\"There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,\" the countries said.\n\nThe statement was undersigned by US President Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Qatar's Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.\n\nMarwan Bishara, Al Jazeera's senior political analyst, said the statement shows the mediating nations are running out of patience.\n\n\"The US is being pushed to exert greater pressure due to the threat of a wider regional war,\" Bishara explained.\n\n\"I think the idea here is that they're going to go back to the table, come August 15, and both Hamas and Israel would be looking at hammering the details,\" he said.\n\nBishara said many details are still unclear, including which Palestinian prisoners and captives held in Gaza would be released in the first phase of the deal - and how many.\n\nBut said the mediating nations believe they \"have a good framework agreement now for a three-stage ceasefire agreement\".\n\n\"I think this is more or less a call for action, a call for urgency - to act quicker than before.\"\n\nAriel Gold, executive director of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a US-based non-violence group, said Thursday's statement is not yet cause for celebration.\n\n\"We have in many ways been here before,\" Gold told Al Jazeera, noting that President Biden's administration has \"many times [said] that we are at the final stretch\" of negotiations.\n\nGold said Biden, who has provided staunch military and diplomatic support to Israel amid the war, should make it clear to Netanyahu that there will be \"a real, definitive consequence for refusing this ceasefire deal\".\n\nFor months, Palestinian rights advocates in the US have urged Biden to stop sending weapons to Israel as the war drags on.\n\nRami Khouri, a professor at the American University of Beirut, said the timing of the statement is likely a reflection of the pressures Biden is facing.\n\n\"Why the 15th?\" Khouri asked, referencing the date in the joint statement to restart negotiations. \"I think it's because the two most desperate people in the world now for a ceasefire, other than the Palestinians, are Kamala Harris and Genocide Joe Biden, as he is well known in the US.\"\n\nKhouri pointed out that August 15 comes mere days before the Democrats are set to hold their national convention in Chicago, Illinois. The ongoing fighting in Gaza could spark discord and protest at the convention, which is designed as a platform for Harris's presidential campaign.\n\n\"They're desperate to have this ceasefire happen,\" Khouri said, adding that \"the timing is unbelievably significant\".", "source": {"uri": "247ureports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The 247 Ureports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Following a week-long ceasefire in November last year, mediators have endeavoured to secure a second truce in the 10-month-old war.\n\nIn a joint statement, the US, Qatar, and Egypt invited the warring parties (Israel and Hamas) to resume talks on August 15 in Doha or Cairo \"to close all remaining gaps and commence implementation of the deal without further delay.\"\n\nAlso read | After resisting for months, Israeli PM Netanyahu finally 'sorry' for Oct 7 Hamas attack\n\nA framework agreement was \"now on the table, with only the details of implementation\" left to conclude, and the mediators were \"prepared to present a final bridging proposal\" to resolve remaining issues, the statement added.\n\nOn Thursday, Netanyahu's office said that Israel would be sending a negotiating team on August 15 to conclude the details of implementing a ceasefire deal. A report by the news agency AFP said that a prospective cessation of hostilities also involving the release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip and scaled-up aid deliveries has centred around a phased deal beginning with an initial truce.\n\nRecent discussions have focused on a framework outlined by US President Joe Biden in late May which he said had been proposed by Israel. \"It's not like the agreement's going to be ready to sign on Thursday. There's still a significant amount of work to do,\" a senior Biden administration official said of the talks.\n\nThis official said that Israel had been very receptive to the idea of the talks, rejecting suggestions that Netanyahu was stalling on a deal.\n\nAlso last week, Netanyahu apologised for the October 7 attack by Hamas happening on his watch and warned that Israel now faced a full-fledged Iranian axis. Speaking to Time magazine, the Israeli prime minister said, \" ...I am sorry, deeply, that something like this happened. And you always look back and you say, 'Could we have done things that would have prevented it?\"\n\n\"We're facing not merely Hamas. We're facing a full-fledged Iranian axis, and we understand that we have to organize ourselves for broader defence,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/2024/08/09/448385-untitled-design.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802851", "eventUri": "eng-9802851", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 69, "textEnd": 74}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 145, "textEnd": 154, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 656, "textEnd": 661, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

It said troops were searching for Hamas tunnels and other infrastructure while engaging in combat \"above and below ground.\"\n\nAfter 10 months of war in Gaza, the mediators' push aims to resume indirect negotiations for a cease-fire that have been on hold since Sinwar's predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in a presumed Israeli blast in Tehran on July 31.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed Thursday that it would send negotiators to talks that mediators have called for on Aug. 15, to be held in either Qatar's capital of Doha or Egypt's capital of Cairo.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Hamas, which announced Tuesday that Sinwar, the group's leader in Gaza, would replace Haniyeh as the group's top leader. Haniyeh previously served as the key interlocutor in the negotiations.\n\nHaniyeh's killing and that of a top Hezbollah commander in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut brought vows of retaliation from Hezbollah and Iran. International diplomats have been scrambling to prevent an escalation and to seal a deal to stop the fighting in Gaza and release the hostages still captive in the enclave.\n\nIn a joint statement, the United States, Egypt and Qatar called for the new round of talks, to be held either in Doha or Cairo, and pressed both sides to move ahead.\n\n\"There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,\" they said, adding that the negotiators have already finalized a framework for the deal.\n\nThey said mediators were prepared to present a final compromise \"that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties.\" It did not elaborate on what that would look like.\n\nA key question hanging over the talks is the impact of Sinwar's elevation to Hamas' top leadership post. Seen as a hard-liner within the group, Sinwar has been in deep hiding in Gaza throughout the war as Israel vows to kill him.\n\nSinwar has already been closely involved in negotiations from behind the scenes. Hamas officials and mediators have said Hamas negotiators regularly sought his approval on the group's positions as it pressed for guarantees that a deal would bring a complete end to the war and withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza, in return for the release of all hostages.\n\nIsrael has vowed to destroy Hamas after the Oct. 7 attack, in which militants from Gaza stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 250 others. After a round of release exchanges in November, Israel says 111 hostages remain in Gaza, including 39 bodies.\n\nIts campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,600 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,700 others. More than 1.9 million of Gaza's pre-war population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, fleeing repeatedly across the territory to escape offensives. Most are now crowded into ramshackle tent camps in an area about 50 square kilometers (19 square miles) on the Gaza coast.\n\nWith sanitation systems collapsed, diseases have run rampant, health officials say, and humanitarian groups are trying to feed the population. The United Nations says a half-million Palestinians facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity.\n\nIsrael's military said Friday that its forces were still battling Hamas fighters in Gaza's southernmost city, Rafah, in an assault there that has lasted three months. Its new assault in Khan Younis, where it has waged multiple offensives this year, drove more people into the camps and neighboring areas.\n\nGhazi Abu Daka, one of the evacuees, told the AP that he and his family have had to flee eastern Khan Younis four times now.\n\n\"Every day there is war. Every day there are rockets. There is no safe place in the eastern area. Now, we are displaced in the streets and don't know where to go,\" he said as he carried his son, a piece of cloth on his head to protect him from the heat.\n\nYasser Abu Alyan, another evacuee, said he was displaced around six times from the Beni Seheila area east of the city. He said he took nothing with him except his two little girls: \"Everything is gone.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It said troops were searching for Hamas tunnels and other infrastructure while engaging in combat \"above and below ground.\"\n\nAfter 10 months of war in Gaza, the mediators' push aims to resume indirect negotiations for a cease-fire that have been on hold since Sinwar's predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in a presumed Israeli blast in Tehran on July 31.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed Thursday that it would send negotiators to talks that mediators have called for on Aug. 15, to be held in either Qatar's capital of Doha or Egypt's capital of Cairo.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Hamas, which announced Tuesday that Sinwar, the group's leader in Gaza, would replace Haniyeh as the group's top leader. Haniyeh previously served as the key interlocutor in the negotiations.\n\nHaniyeh's killing and that of a top Hezbollah commander in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut brought vows of retaliation from Hezbollah and Iran. International diplomats have been scrambling to prevent an escalation and to seal a deal to stop the fighting in Gaza and release the hostages still captive in the enclave.\n\nIn a joint statement, the United States, Egypt and Qatar called for the new round of talks, to be held either in Doha or Cairo, and pressed both sides to move ahead.\n\n\"There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,\" they said, adding that the negotiators have already finalized a framework for the deal.\n\nThey said mediators were prepared to present a final compromise \"that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties.\" It did not elaborate on what that would look like.\n\nA key question hanging over the talks is the impact of Sinwar's elevation to Hamas' top leadership post. Seen as a hard-liner within the group, Sinwar has been in deep hiding in Gaza throughout the war as Israel vows to kill him.\n\nSinwar has already been closely involved in negotiations from behind the scenes. Hamas officials and mediators have said Hamas negotiators regularly sought his approval on the group's positions as it pressed for guarantees that a deal would bring a complete end to the war and withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza, in return for the release of all hostages.\n\nIsrael has vowed to destroy Hamas after the Oct. 7 attack, in which militants from Gaza stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 250 others. After a round of release exchanges in November, Israel says 111 hostages remain in Gaza, including 39 bodies.\n\nIts campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,600 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,700 others. More than 1.9 million of Gaza's pre-war population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, fleeing repeatedly across the territory to escape offensives. Most are now crowded into ramshackle tent camps in an area about 50 square kilometers (19 square miles) on the Gaza coast.\n\nWith sanitation systems collapsed, diseases have run rampant, health officials say, and humanitarian groups are trying to feed the population. The United Nations says a half-million Palestinians facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity.\n\nIsrael's military said Friday that its forces were still battling Hamas fighters in Gaza's southernmost city, Rafah, in an assault there that has lasted three months. Its new assault in Khan Younis, where it has waged multiple offensives this year, drove more people into the camps and neighboring areas.\n\nGhazi Abu Daka, one of the evacuees, told the AP that he and his family have had to flee eastern Khan Younis four times now.\n\n\"Every day there is war. Every day there are rockets. There is no safe place in the eastern area. Now, we are displaced in the streets and don't know where to go,\" he said as he carried his son, a piece of cloth on his head to protect him from the heat.\n\nYasser Abu Alyan, another evacuee, said he was displaced around six times from the Beni Seheila area east of the city. He said he took nothing with him except his two little girls: \"Everything is gone.\"\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

They insisted that the negotiators meet in Cairo or Doha, Qatar, next Thursday.\n\n\"There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,\" the three leaders said in the statement. \"It is time to release the hostages, begin the cease-fire and implement this agreement. As mediators, if necessary, we are prepared to present a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties.\"\n\nCease-fire talks have been on hold after a meeting last weekend in Cairo produced no breakthrough, and the process has been complicated by the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who had been leading the negotiations through intermediaries. Mr. Biden has expressed frustration at Israel's decision to carry out the operation that killed Mr. Haniyeh in Iran at a time when the president had hoped the cease-fire talks were close to success.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel indicated minutes after the joint statement by Mr. Biden and the other leaders that he would agree to the meeting. \"In the wake of the offer by the United States and the mediators, Israel will send the negotiating delegation on Aug. 15 to whichever place is decided upon, so as to agree upon the details for the implementation of the framework deal,\" his office said in a statement.\n\nBut it is not clear how willing Mr. Netanyahu is to reach a deal. His own security officials have privately complained that the prime minister is holding up talks by, among other things, reintroducing a demand that had been softened by his negotiators. The prime minister has, in turn, accused his security officials of being bad negotiators.\n\nNor is it clear that Hamas is ready or able to make an agreement. The group did not immediately respond to the joint statement by Mr. Biden and the others, and it remained uncertain who would show up for negotiations now that Mr. Haniyeh is dead even if the group does return to the table.\n\nHamas named Yahya Sinwar, one of the architects of the deadly Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, to replace Mr. Haniyeh, but he is believed to be hiding in Gaza and not easily or quickly reached by intermediaries. Even while Mr. Haniyeh was alive, Mr. Sinwar was said to be the one calling the shots from his sanctuary, and no one expects him to emerge publicly.\n\nA senior Biden administration official said that the joint statement arose out of discussions this week among the president, Mr. el-Sisi and Mr. al-Thani. The official did not describe what a \"final bridging proposal\" would look like, but said that the framework agreement already on the table could be finalized, with some concessions on details, like the sequencing of releases of hostages and prisoners.\n\nThe official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, said there were four or five issues that needed to be resolved to complete the cease-fire agreement, and added that they could be managed if there were sufficient will on both sides. But he cautioned that the meeting next Thursday, should it happen, would only resume the negotiating process and warned against expecting the agreement to be wrapped up that day.\n\nIn a statement of its own, an Israeli body representing the families of many of those abducted by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attacks welcomed the call by Mr. Biden and the other leaders. Around 115 hostages remain in Gaza, according to the Israeli authorities.\n\n\"This recent statement reaffirms what we've long known: A deal is the only path to bring all hostages home,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said. \"Time is running out. The hostages have no more time to spare. A deal must be signed now!\"\n\nThe U.S.-led push to renew talks comes at a moment of high tension in the region because of the assassination of Mr. Haniyeh in Tehran and a senior Hezbollah figure in Lebanon. Both Hezbollah and Iran have vowed to retaliate against Israel, and the United States has ordered more warships and aircraft to deploy to the region to help defend its ally against any such attacks.\n\nMr. Biden met in the Oval Office on Thursday with Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and other officials to review military preparations, and his team repeated the U.S. determination to stand by Israel. At the same time, Mr. Biden and his advisers have urged Israel to think twice about an expansive counter-retaliation that could escalate into a regional war.\n\nMr. Austin said that he had called Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister, on Thursday to \"reinforce my ironclad support\" against any attack. \"The U.S. F-22 Raptors that arrived in the region today represent one of many efforts to deter aggression, defend Israel and protect U.S. forces in the region,\" Mr. Austin wrote on social media. \"I also stressed the importance of concluding a cease-fire deal in Gaza that releases the hostages.\"\n\nU.S. officials in recent days have expressed tentative optimism that any action taken by either side may yet be relatively measured, allowing various players to save face without triggering a more explosive conflict. But if that does not bear out, then it could make any return to the bargaining table next week problematic, at least.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors":

Israel's offensive in Gaza since then has killed nearly 40,000 people.\n\nThere was no immediate response to the offer by Hamas. Last week's killing of its top political leader in Tehran raised tensions across the region, an escalation widely seen as a blow to cease-fire talks. The killing was widely ascribed to Israel, although Israel has not commented.\n\nU.S. officials have said they believe Hamas can resume negotiations despite the July 31 assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, who had been presiding over the talks for Hamas.\n\nHamas military chief Yahya Sinwar, who is believed to be sheltering from Israeli attack in underground bunkers beneath Gaza, took over as the group's political leader. Hamas had other representatives besides Haniyeh attending the talks who can step in for the slain official, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.\n\nUpdated at 9:58 p.m.\n\n0 Comments",

It is a decisive point,\" said Blinken, adding that Israel and Hamas need to avoid any further aggressive actions that would prevent a deal and continue to focus on negotiations \"without delays and without excuses. It is time to focus on getting to yes.\"\n\nBlinken said that all sides need to take steps to not increase tensions further while asking the Iranians and the Israelis to de-escalate hostilities.\n\nThe same day, President Joe Biden spoke with the leaders of Egypt and Qatar and asked them to help end the escalating conflict as quickly as possible, the White House said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_s_jung@pjmedia.com", "name": "Bryan S.

It said troops were searching for Hamas tunnels and other infrastructure while engaging in combat \"above and below ground.\"\n\nAfter 10 months of war in Gaza, the mediators' push aims to resume indirect negotiations for a cease-fire that have been on hold since Sinwar's predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in a presumed Israeli blast in Tehran on July 31.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed Thursday that it would send negotiators to talks that mediators have called for on Aug. 15, to be held in either Qatar's capital of Doha or Egypt's capital of Cairo.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Hamas, which announced Tuesday that Sinwar, the group's leader in Gaza, would replace Haniyeh as the group's top leader. Haniyeh previously served as the key interlocutor in the negotiations.\n\nHaniyeh's killing and that of a top Hezbollah commander in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut brought vows of retaliation from Hezbollah and Iran. International diplomats have been scrambling to prevent an escalation and to seal a deal to stop the fighting in Gaza and release the hostages still captive in the enclave.\n\nIn a joint statement, the United States, Egypt and Qatar called for the new round of talks, to be held either in Doha or Cairo, and pressed both sides to move ahead.\n\n\"There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,\" they said, adding that the negotiators have already finalized a framework for the deal.\n\nThey said mediators were prepared to present a final compromise \"that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties.\" It did not elaborate on what that would look like.\n\nA key question hanging over the talks is the impact of Sinwar's elevation to Hamas' top leadership post. Seen as a hard-liner within the group, Sinwar has been in deep hiding in Gaza throughout the war as Israel vows to kill him.\n\nSinwar has already been closely involved in negotiations from behind the scenes. Hamas officials and mediators have said Hamas negotiators regularly sought his approval on the group's positions as it pressed for guarantees that a deal would bring a complete end to the war and withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza, in return for the release of all hostages.\n\nIsrael has vowed to destroy Hamas after the Oct. 7 attack, in which militants from Gaza stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 250 others. After a round of release exchanges in November, Israel says 111 hostages remain in Gaza, including 39 bodies.\n\nIts campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,600 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,700 others. More than 1.9 million of Gaza's pre-war population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, fleeing repeatedly across the territory to escape offensives. Most are now crowded into ramshackle tent camps in an area about 50 square kilometers (19 square miles) on the Gaza coast.\n\nWith sanitation systems collapsed, diseases have run rampant, health officials say, and humanitarian groups are trying to feed the population. The United Nations says a half-million Palestinians facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity.\n\nIsrael's military said Friday that its forces were still battling Hamas fighters in Gaza's southernmost city, Rafah, in an assault there that has lasted three months. Its new assault in Khan Younis, where it has waged multiple offensives this year, drove more people into the camps and neighboring areas.\n\nGhazi Abu Daka, one of the evacuees, told the AP that he and his family have had to flee eastern Khan Younis four times now.\n\n\"Every day there is war. Every day there are rockets. There is no safe place in the eastern area. Now, we are displaced in the streets and don't know where to go,\" he said as he carried his son, a piece of cloth on his head to protect him from the heat.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com",

It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.\"\n\nThe leaders announced that they expect all parties to meet next Thursday in either Doha or Cairo and that they \"are prepared to present a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties.\"\n\nWhile the leaders emphasized the importance of getting a deal done, a senior U.S. official noted that they do not expect an agreement to come out of Thursday's meeting.\n\n\"We're not anticipating the deal being ready to close on Thursday,\" the official said. \"There's still some, a lot of work here to be done. But we think getting this moving later next week will be unhelpful and constructive.\"\n\n\"It's not like on Thursday, we're gonna sit in a room and sign the deal,\" the official added. \"There's work to be done. And both sides have positions on about four or five issues. And I say both sides have very firm positions. And if you just look at them, they might be unbridgeable. But you treat each issue one by one.\"\n\nThe U.S., Egypt, and Qatari negotiators have desperately sought for several months to get this deal over the finish line but with little to show for it this year. Israel and Hamas agreed to a weeklong ceasefire deal in late November, during which about a hundred Israeli hostages were released. No deal has been agreed upon since then.\n\nIt's not clear who will lead Hamas's negotiations following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the former head of Hamas's political bureau and the lead negotiator. Haniyeh was killed last week while visiting Tehran for the Iranian president's inauguration.\n\nHamas's top leader in Gaza is Yahya Sinwar, and he was just chosen to replace Haniyeh. Sinwar is believed to be hiding in Hamas's extensive tunnel system underneath Gaza, continuing to evade Israeli forces hunting him.\n\n\"With regard to Mr. Sinwar, he has been and remains the primary decider when it comes to concluding the ceasefire,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week. \"It is really on him to decide whether to move forward with a ceasefire ... and that, besides changing everything for people in Gaza -- bringing the hostages home, giving us an opportunity to build a more enduring peace for Gaza -- also opens up other possibilities, other prospects, more broadly, in terms of de-escalating tensions and bringing real security and stability.\"\n\nLooming over this meeting is Iran's expected retaliatory attack against Israel for Haniyeh's assassination, even though Israel has not publicly taken credit for it. It's unclear when Iran could attack Israel, or what such an assault will look like.\n\nIran has a number of proxy forces it supports in the Middle East, including Hamas, some of which could also be involved in their response. While Hamas has been severely weakened during the war that has devastated Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon continues to attack Israel's northern community.\n\nWhile Israeli forces have operated within Gaza, Israel and Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon, have continuously attacked each other in rocket and missile fires over their shared border. These attacks have gone on since right after Hamas's Oct. 7 attack. Tens of thousands of civilians have been and remain evacuated from their homes due to the fires.\n\nHezbollah's arsenal is much more sophisticated than Hamas's, and they have the ability to hit targets anywhere within Israel with precision-guided missiles if they choose to escalate the current conflict.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nIran also supports the Houthis in Yemen, which have fired about 200 drones and missiles toward Israel since the war began, according to the Israeli military. A Houthi drone recently evaded Israeli air defenses and killed one civilian in Tel Aviv. They have primarily, since Oct. 7, targeted commercial vessels in the Red Sea forcing global shipping companies to reroute their vessels to avoid the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nThere are also militias in Iraq and Syria that Iran supports. They have primarily fired missiles, drones, and rockets toward U.S. bases in the region in time time since Oct. 7. Earlier this week, they fired three rockets at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq, two of which hit it. Five U.S. personnel were injured in the attack, three of whom had to be evacuated to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. Two others, not included in the five, had \"very minor injuries and returned to duty right away,\" the deputy Pentagon press secretary said on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com",

Some 105 hostages were freed in a brief November truce.\n\nThe cease-fire and hostage release deal recently hit a snag with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has sent in more demands that appear to be complicating the talks.\n\nNetanyahu has been accused of prolonging the war in Gaza for his own political survival as he faces questions at home about security failures on Oct. 7, along with domestic troubles. Still, he has faced mounting pressure from Israeli citizens and the families of the hostages to reach a deal.\n\nThe negotiations are reaching a critical phase as tensions soar in the Middle East following the death of a top Hezbollah commander in Lebanon last week from an Israeli strike. Iran has also blamed Israel for killing top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nBoth Iran and its proxy Hezbollah have vowed to respond to Israel, which is bracing for an attack any day. The U.S. has moved additional assets to the Middle East in anticipation, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, which will relieve the USS Theodore Roosevelt. The Pentagon has also moved to the region a squadron of F-22 Raptor fighter jets.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri":

tandem, Egypt has been leading efforts to deliver aid to 2.4 million civilians in Gaza who are facing near-starvation conditions due to a deadly Israeli blockade on the strip.\n\nIn recent days, tensions between Hezbollah and Israel, who have traded attacks across the Lebanon-Israel border since 7 October, rose to new levels after Israel assassinated the group's top military commander Fouad Shukur in a strike in south Beirut on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael's assignation of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week, a day after the strike in Beirut, exacerbated tensions between the two countries to new levels with the Iranian regime vowing to retaliate against Israel in a major way.\n\nThis prompted the US and other Tel Aviv allies to mobilize to defend Israel.\n\nMoreover,

A lot of work remains to be done,\" a senior Biden administration official said, however, referring to the U.S. president's talks with the leaders of Egypt and Qatar.\n\nIsrael seemed \"very receptive\" to the idea of resuming talks, the official said on condition of anonymity, rejecting criticism that Netanyahu was stalling, or delaying things.\n\nThe development was recorded after Hamas named as its new leader Yahya Shinwar, who is accused by Israeli authorities of being among the brains behind the October 7 raid by the military arm of the Palestinian Islamist movement on the southern part of Israeli territory, the trigger for the war. His elevation to the leadership of the Politburo after the death of his predecessor, Ismail Haniyah, in Tehran - Iran and Hamas blamed Israel for his assassination and vowed revenge - is thought to have made indirect negotiations even more difficult. The Israeli army, moreover, has vowed to \"eliminate\" Mr Shinar.\n\nSince November, all mediation efforts have failed and the war, which Hamas's health ministry says has claimed the lives of some 40,000 people in the small besieged enclave, has raised the thermometer even higher in the Middle East, where the war threatens to spread between Iran and armed organisations it supports on the one hand and Israel and its own allies, the main one being the US.\n\nDiplomatic efforts continue to prevent regional flare-ups following the killings of Haniya and Sukr.\n\nHowever, Iranian caretaker Foreign Minister Ali Bayeri stressed yesterday in an interview with the AFP in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, that Israel had made a \"strategic mistake\" that would \"cost it dearly.\"\n\nMr Bayeri accused Mr Netanyahu's government - which has yet to make any official comment on the death of Ismail Haniyah - of wanting to \"spread the war\".\n\nOn the other hand, a US official has suggested that Iran will suffer \"significant\" consequences if it decides to attack Israel.\n\nThe US armed forces announced that F-22 fighter jets arrived in the Middle East yesterday. They had announced last week that they would increase their military presence in the region.\n\nIn Lebanon, where there have been repeated low-altitude overflights of Israeli military aircraft, the situation remains on a knife-edge. The exchanges of fire between the Israeli army and the Lebanese Hezbollah, practically daily since the day after the outbreak of the war in the Gaza Strip, continue.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Galad warned yesterday (Thursday) that Israel would fight Hezbollah \"with all its might\" if it continued its attacks, in a message translated into Arabic and addressed to the Lebanese population, released yesterday by his services. \"Remember how much (Hezbollah leader Hassan) Nasrallah regretted the dangerous and reckless adventure of August 2006, learn lessons from the past to avoid a dangerous scenario repeating itself in August 2024,\" he continued, referring to the 34-day war of 2006.\n\nIn the Gaza Strip, Israeli operations have not stopped against Hamas, in power in the enclave since 2007, a movement designated a terrorist organization by Israel, the EU and the US.\n\nIn Gaza City, Israeli shelling of two schools killed \"more than 18 civilians\" yesterday, according to civil defense spokesman Mohammad al-Mughayir, who added that 60 other people were wounded and more than 40 were missing.\n\nFor its part, the Israeli army said the schools were \"used by terrorists and Hamas commanders\" and that attacks were \"planned\" there and \"launched\" from there.\n\nStill yesterday, the Israeli armed forces ordered, once again, civilians to be hurriedly evacuated from sectors of Khan Younis, a large city in the southern part of the enclave that has already suffered huge damage in months of fighting.\n\nThe order covers neighborhoods from which \"rockets were fired,\" according to the Israeli army.\n\nThe Civil Defense said five bodies were recovered from a house shelled in Khan Younis.\n\nThe Hamas offensive in southern Israel on October 7 killed 1,198 people, most of them civilians, according to a French News Agency count based on official Israeli data. Of the 251 people kidnapped that day, 111 are still being held hostage in Gaza, but 39 are believed to be dead, according to the Israeli military.\n\nIsraeli military retaliatory operations have since caused a humanitarian disaster in the Gaza Strip - forcing the vast majority of the 2.4 million population to be displaced and putting it at risk of famine, according to the UN.", "source": {"uri":

As mediators, if necessary, we are prepared to present a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties.\"\n\nCease-fire talks have been on hold after a meeting last weekend in Cairo produced no breakthrough, and the process has been complicated by the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who had been leading the negotiations through intermediaries. Mr. Biden has expressed frustration at Israel's decision to carry out the operation that killed Mr. Haniyeh in Iran at a time when the president had hoped the cease-fire talks were close to success.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel indicated minutes after the joint statement by Mr. Biden and the other leaders that he would agree to the meeting. \"In the wake of the offer by the United States and the mediators, Israel will send the negotiating delegation on Aug. 15 to whichever place is decided upon, so as to agree upon the details for the implementation of the framework deal,\" his office said in a statement.\n\nBut it is not clear how willing Mr. Netanyahu is to reach a deal.

The prime minister has, in turn, accused his security officials of being bad negotiators.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamim_bin_Hamad_Al_Thani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdel_Fattah_el-Sisi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abdel Fattah el-Sisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802851", "eventUri": "eng-9802851", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 1767, "textEnd": 1774}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

joint statement issued by US President Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.\"\n\nThe minister praised the efforts of the three leaders and their respective countries in establishing a \"framework agreement.\"\n\n\"The Lebanese government values the importance of concluding a cease-fire agreement and the release of hostages based on the principles set forth by President Biden and the UN Security Council Resolution 2735,\" said Habib.\n\nOn Thursday evening, leaders from Egypt, Qatar, and the US called on Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas to resume negotiations in Doha or Cairo on Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nThis call follows the assassination of Hamas' political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which has negatively impacted the resumption of negotiations between the two sides.\n\nFor months, Egypt, Qatar, and the US have been leading indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, but no agreement has been reached due to Israel's refusal to meet Hamas' demands to end the war, withdraw troops from Gaza, and allow displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza.\n\nIsrael has continued a devastating military offensive in the Gaza Strip since an Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire.\n\nNearly 39,700 Palestinians have since been killed, mostly women and children, and over 91,700 injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nOver 10 months into the Israeli war, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water, and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which ordered it to immediately halt its military operation in the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors":

Yet many of Hamas's fighters are also eager for a respite from the Israeli military's attacks, Middle East experts say.\n\nNetanyahu might be calculating that the U.S. presidential election could lead to a Republican administration that is more supportive of his policy goals. Yet the Israeli military has also been stressed by the months of fighting in Gaza and faces new security challenges on its northern frontier with Lebanon's Hezbollah, where tensions have been escalating.\n\n\"Netanyahu and Sinwar both have reasons to think that holding out on a deal will better support their political objectives,\" said Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior U.S. intelligence officer who is at the Atlantic Council think tank. \"But they also are facing pressure from domestic constituencies, which combined with U.S. and Arab state pressure, could finally be enough to reach at least a temporary cease-fire.\"\n\nA senior Biden administration official cautioned that a significant amount of work remains to overcome complicated issues between Israel and Hamas on how the agreement would be implemented.\n\n\"We believe there is enough trade space,\" said the official. \"Having a proposal that's unified between the three mediators can be quite powerful.\"", "source":

Israel said it did not deliberately target the aid workers in the attack.\n\nIsrael has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the October 7 terror attack that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages.

It said troops were searching for Hamas tunnels and other infrastructure while engaging in combat \"above and below ground.\"\n\nAfter 10 months of war in Gaza, the mediators' push aims to resume indirect negotiations for a cease-fire that have been on hold since Sinwar's predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in a presumed Israeli blast in Tehran on July 31.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed Thursday that it would send negotiators to talks that mediators have called for on Aug. 15, to be held in either Qatar's capital of Doha or Egypt's capital of Cairo.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Hamas, which announced Tuesday that Sinwar, the group's leader in Gaza, would replace Haniyeh as the group's top leader. Haniyeh previously served as the key interlocutor in the negotiations.\n\nHaniyeh's killing and that of a top Hezbollah commander in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut brought vows of retaliation from Hezbollah and Iran. International diplomats have been scrambling to prevent an escalation and to seal a deal to stop the fighting in Gaza and release the hostages still captive in the enclave.\n\nIn a joint statement, the United States, Egypt and Qatar called for the new round of talks, to be held either in Doha or Cairo, and pressed both sides to move ahead.\n\n\"There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,\" they said, adding that the negotiators have already finalized a framework for the deal.\n\nThey said mediators were prepared to present a final compromise \"that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties.\" It did not elaborate on what that would look like.\n\nA key question hanging over the talks is the impact of Sinwar's elevation to Hamas' top leadership post. Seen as a hard-liner within the group, Sinwar has been in deep hiding in Gaza throughout the war as Israel vows to kill him.\n\nSinwar has already been closely involved in negotiations from behind the scenes. Hamas officials and mediators have said Hamas negotiators regularly sought his approval on the group's positions as it pressed for guarantees that a deal would bring a complete end to the war and withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza, in return for the release of all hostages.\n\nIsrael has vowed to destroy Hamas after the Oct. 7 attack, in which militants from Gaza stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 250 others. After a round of release exchanges in November, Israel says 111 hostages remain in Gaza, including 39 bodies.\n\nIts campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,600 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,700 others. More than 1.9 million of Gaza's pre-war population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, fleeing repeatedly across the territory to escape offensives. Most are now crowded into ramshackle tent camps in an area about 50 square kilometers (19 square miles) on the Gaza coast.\n\nWith sanitation systems collapsed, diseases have run rampant, health officials say, and humanitarian groups are trying to feed the population. The United Nations says a half-million Palestinians facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity.\n\nIsrael's military said Friday that its forces were still battling Hamas fighters in Gaza's southernmost city, Rafah, in an assault there that has lasted three months. Its new assault in Khan Younis, where it has waged multiple offensives this year, drove more people into the camps and neighboring areas.\n\nGhazi Abu Daka, one of the evacuees, told the AP that he and his family have had to flee eastern Khan Younis four times now.\n\n\"Every day there is war. Every day there are rockets. There is no safe place in the eastern area. Now, we are displaced in the streets and don't know where to go,\" he said as he carried his son, a piece of cloth on his head to protect him from the heat.\n\nYasser Abu Alyan, another evacuee, said he was displaced around six times from the Beni Seheila area east of the city. He said he took nothing with him except his two little girls: \"Everything is gone.\"\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"},

We want both sides to hash them out and get this deal in place.\"\n\nDuring a June call with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, which has mediated Israel-Hamas negotiations, Biden \"affirmed that Hamas is now the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire\" and \"confirmed Israel's readiness to move forward\" with the three-phase road map outlined by the U.S. leader a week earlier.\n\nBiden's explanation of the agreement was initially received positively by Hamas. However, the group went on to complain that the text of the deal received at the negotiating table differed vastly from what Biden had described.\n\nThe deal, as described by Biden and approved by a United Nations Security Council Resolution, calls for a temporary ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas of the Gaza Strip and a limited prisoner swap in the first phase to be followed by negotiations toward a permanent cessation of hostilities, release of all remaining Hamas-held hostages and the total withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from Gaza.\n\nFinally, a plan to rebuild Gaza would commence along with the return of the bodies of hostages killed while in Hamas captivity.\n\nDespite the agreement calling for a ceasefire, Israeli officials maintained that the deal would allow them to carry out their goal of defeating Hamas. Meanwhile, U.S. officials repeatedly referred to the agreement as one that was fully aligned with Israeli demands.\n\nWhen questioned about whether the U.S. now views Netanyahu as having withdrawn support for an agreement he had previously endorsed, Kirby said he would simply refer back to his previous response regarding the need for both parties to bridge the gap.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Israeli Foreign Ministry and a Hamas spokesperson for comment.\n\nNew uncertainties also surround the talks since the killing of Hamas Political Bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh last week in the Iranian capital of Tehran. The IDF has declined to comment on whether or not it was behind the assassination, after which Hamas' Gaza chief, Yahya Sinwar, was announced on Tuesday as the group's new leader.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_o_connor@newsweek.com", "name": "Tom O'Connor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamim_bin_Hamad_Al_Thani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2445218/joe-biden-benjamin-netanyahu-dc.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=dd4987c859a8461f9f5a9eb27e5667f4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802851", "eventUri": "eng-9802851", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Hundreds of people gathered to pay their respects to the movement's late leader and his bodyguard.\n\nThe scene was more than a memorial service - it signalled the end of an era and the beginning of a new, more extreme phase.\n\nThis was not the first time I had witnessed Hamas's top officials gather to choose a new leader after an unexpected funeral. Back in 2004 I witnessed them meet after Israel assassinated the group's founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin - the meeting taking place in his house in Gaza. Less than a month later, Israel killed his successor Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi.\n\nBut this time the backstage discussions reflected the extent of the crisis and challenges they are facing.\n\nHamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back into Gaza. Since then, Israel's military retaliation has killed more than 39,600 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and wounded tens of thousands more. More than half the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed and almost the entire population has been displaced. Dissent against Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, has been growing. The group itself has taken severe losses.\n\nOn top of this, the killing of Ismail Haniyeh on 31 July in Tehran - a place he had always felt to be a safe haven - was a real shock for the organisation.\n\nHamas is convinced that Haniyeh was killed by an anti-personnel missile while he was browsing on his phone. Iran's Revolutionary Guards have said a projectile with a 7kg warhead was used. Some Western media reports say he was killed by a bomb planted in the room beforehand.\n\nBack at Haniyeh's mourning ceremony in Doha, one man in his mid-60s with white hair and a short beard stood in a corner away from the spotlight.\n\n\"Pay close attention to him,\" a Hamas media officer told me. Who was he? \"He is the shadowy man, Abu Omar Hassan,\" he said.\n\nAbu Omar Hassan, or Mohamed Hassan Darwish, is the head of the Supreme Shura Council, the top consultative body in Hamas. According to Hamas's constitution, he was in prime position to be the organisation's interim head until elections which had been scheduled for next March.\n\n\"He is the man of the big missions,\" I was told.\n\nAs the mourning ceremony ended, these leaders' real work began. For two days, the movement's veteran faces and shadowy figures held meetings in Doha, which has hosted Hamas's political bureau since 2012, to elect a new leader.\n\nThey chose Yahya Sinwar, already the group's leader inside Gaza since 2017. The choice may come as a surprise to many, but anyone following his career since Israel released him in the 2011 exchange deal for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit knew he was always likely to lead Hamas one day.\n\nNo political leader in Hamas has ever been closer to the group's armed wing. His brother Mohammed leads the largest Hamas military battalion, while Mohammed Deif - the elusive Hamas veteran who led its armed wing for two decades until Israel said it killed him last month - was his neighbour, friend, and classmate. The pair grew up together in Gaza's sprawling Khan Younis refugee camp.\n\nDespite all this, many may see appointing him to the most important position in Hamas as madness. Israel's security agencies believe Sinwar planned and executed the attack on southern Israel, and he is top of their wanted list.\n\n\"Not all of the people inside Hamas leadership were in favour of the decision,\" a senior Hamas official told me. \"Some leaders raised their concerns, others pushed for a more moderate person. But in the end he got the majority of the votes.\"\n\nAnother Hamas official who attended the meetings said the movement felt unable to choose the powerful shadow operator Abu Omar Hassan because he had little public profile and was unknown outside the movement, whereas the 7 October attack had given Yahya Sinwar global notoriety.\n\n\"Sinwar has become a trademark after 7 October and he has great popularity in the Arab and Islamic worlds,\" the official said. \"He enjoys close relations with the axis of resistance supported by Iran, and his appointment in the midst of the war sends a message of defiance to Israel.\"\n\nThe \"axis of resistance\" is a network of armed groups backed by Iran. Other members such as Lebanon-based Hezbollah also present threats to Israel.\n\nMany Arab and some Western officials urged Hamas against naming Sinwar as leader because of his connection to the 7 October attacks. He and the organisation he now leads are proscribed as terrorists by many governments in the West.\n\n\"One of the reasons why we voted for him is because we want to honour him for masterminding the attacks\" the official said. \"October 7th belongs to him so he deserves to lead the movement.\"\n\nTen months on from that attack, all attempts to agree a ceasefire have so far failed. The BBC understands that the two main mediators - Qatar and Egypt - are working on a new ceasefire proposal.\n\nLeaks suggest the plan is based on convincing Iran not to respond militarily to the assassination of Haniyeh in its territory, in exchange for Israel ending its war in Gaza and withdrawing troops from the Philadelphi corridor.\n\nThe Philadelphi Corridor is a buffer zone, only about 100m (330ft) wide in parts, which runs along the Gaza side of the 13km (8-mile) border with Egypt. Gaza's only other land border is with Israel itself.\n\nA Palestinian official familiar with the ceasefire negotiations told me in Doha: \"Egyptian intelligence has already sent a team to Doha and there are meetings to formulate an action plan based on sparing the region a possible Iranian response... in exchange for a ceasefire.\"\n\nFor now, the drumbeat of conflict is only getting louder, with Sinwar, the most extremist figure in Hamas, set to lead the group for the next five years - if he survives the war.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

The Palestinian Ministry of Health, which does not differentiate between civilian and Hamas fighter, states nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed and another nearly 92,000 have been wounded in the war.\n\nThe first phase of the deal includes an initial six-week cease-fire to permit the release of some of the hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\n\nDuring the six-week pause, negotiations would commence on securing a permanent end to hostilities, which would be enforced during the second phase of the plan that would also see the release of more hostages. The third phase includes the release of all dead hostages held and a major reconstruction plan for Gaza would commence.\n\nKirby told reporters Wednesday that neither Israel nor Hamas have signed off on the deal but that \"we believe that gaps are narrow enough that they can be closed.\"\n\n\"There's some implementation details that need to be hashed out. We want both sides to hash them out and get this deal in place,\" he said. \"We have a sense of urgency about this, and we believe all parties ought to have the same sense of urgency.\"\n\nA day earlier, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that negotiations have reached \"a final stage.\"\n\n\"Concluding that agreement and avoiding any action that could somehow disrupt it is the only path to ending the conflict in Gaza and bringing calm to the region,\" he said.\n\nPotential disruptions include a potential retaliatory attack on Israel for the assassinations of commander Fuad Shukr of Hezbollah on July 30 in Lebanon and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran the following day.\n\nThe United States and other democratic nations have been plying diplomatic pressure to prevent such an attack, while moving military infrastructure into position in case those efforts fail.\n\nBlinken on Tuesday warned that further attacks would perpetuate conflict and instability while raising the risk of \"dangerous outcomes that no one can predict and on one can fully control.\"\n\n\"It's urgent that everyone in the region take stock of the situation, understand the risk of miscalculation, and make decisions that will calm tensions, not exacerbate them,\" he said.\n\nIran's permanent mission to the United Nations in New York City issued a statement Wednesday night in response to the question would Iran continue with a retaliatory strike if Hamas secured a cease-fire, stating yes, it would.\n\n\"We have pursued two priorities simultaneously: first, establishing a durable ceasefire in Gaza and the withdrawal of the occupiers from this territory; second, punishing the aggressor for assassinating Haniyeh, preventing the recurrence of the Israeli regime's terrorist aggression, and making the Zionists regret embarking on such a trajectory,\" it said, according to the state-controlled Islamic Republic News Agency.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com",

This stance marks a change from previous statements by Biden and other top U.S. officials, which solely blamed Hamas for the deadlock.\n\n\"The deal hasn't been accepted because neither side has signed up to it,\" Kirby said. \"We believe that both sides need to do the final bit of work here to come to a conclusion on this thing.\"\n\nWhen asked if the Biden administration now sees Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as contributing to the stalemate, Kirby reiterated the call for both parties to finalize the agreement, describing it as a \"good proposal.\"\n\n\"We believe the gaps are narrow enough that they can be closed,\" Kirby said.\n\nEarlier, during a June call with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a mediator in Israel-Hamas negotiations, Biden said Hamas was the only obstacle to a cease-fire and that Israel was ready to proceed with the U.S.-proposed three-phase road map.\n\nInitially, Hamas reacted positively to Biden's explanation of the deal in May but later claimed that the terms presented at the negotiating table were significantly different from Biden's initial description.\n\nThe proposed deal, as outlined by Biden and endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution, includes a temporary cease-fire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas of the Gaza Strip, and a limited prisoner swap in the first phase.\n\nThis would be followed by negotiations for a permanent end to hostilities, the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas, and the complete withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from Gaza. Finally, the plan calls for Gaza's reconstruction and the return of the bodies of hostages killed in captivity.\n\nDespite the cease-fire component, Israeli officials maintained that the agreement would allow them to continue their objective of defeating Hamas.\n\nNew complications have arisen in the talks following the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh last week in Tehran. The IDF has not said whether it was involved in the assassination, after which Hamas named Yahya Sinwar, the Gaza chief, as the group's new leader.\n\nIran has vowed to avenge Haniyeh's killing.\n\nMeanwhile, its ally Hezbollah has promised retaliation following the death of its top military official in an Israeli strike in Beirut, amid escalating clashes along the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\n\"Only increasing the military pressure on Hamas will lead to achieving all of the objectives of the war, including the return home of all of our hostages, the living and the deceased,\" Netanyahu said during a Sunday ceremony.\n\nJim Thomas \u2709\n\nJim Thomas is a writer based in Indiana.

As mediators, if necessary, we are prepared to present a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties.\"\n\nCease-fire talks have been on hold after a meeting last weekend in Cairo produced no breakthrough, and the process has been complicated by the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who had been leading the negotiations through intermediaries. Mr. Biden has expressed frustration at Israel's decision to carry out the operation that killed Mr. Haniyeh in Iran at a time when the president had hoped the cease-fire talks were close to success.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel indicated minutes after the joint statement by Mr. Biden and the other leaders that he would agree to the meeting. \"In the wake of the offer by the United States and the mediators, Israel will send the negotiating delegation on Aug. 15 to whichever place is decided upon, so as to agree upon the details for the implementation of the framework deal,\" his office said in a statement.\n\nBut it is not clear how willing Mr. Netanyahu is to reach a deal. His own security officials have privately complained that the prime minister is holding up talks by, among other things, reintroducing a demand that had been softened by his negotiators. The prime minister has, in turn, accused his security officials of being bad negotiators.\n\nNor is it clear that Hamas is ready or able to make an agreement. The group did not immediately respond to the joint statement by Mr. Biden and the others, and it remained uncertain who would show up for negotiations now that Mr. Haniyeh is dead even if the group does return to the table.\n\nHamas named Yahya Sinwar, one of the architects of the deadly Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, to replace Mr. Haniyeh, but he is believed to be hiding in Gaza and not easily or quickly reached by intermediaries. Even while Mr. Haniyeh was alive, Mr. Sinwar was said to be the one calling the shots from his sanctuary, and no one expects him to emerge publicly.\n\nA senior Biden administration official said that the joint statement arose out of discussions this week among the president, Mr. el-Sisi and Mr. al-Thani. The official did not describe what a \"final bridging proposal\" would look like, but said that the framework agreement already on the table could be finalized, with some concessions on details, like the sequencing of releases of hostages and prisoners.\n\nThe official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, said there were four or five issues that needed to be resolved to complete the cease-fire agreement, and added that they could be managed if there were sufficient will on both sides. But he cautioned that the meeting next Thursday, should it happen, would only resume the negotiating process and warned against expecting the agreement to be wrapped up that day.\n\nIn a statement of its own, an Israeli body representing the families of many of those abducted by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attacks welcomed the call by Mr. Biden and the other leaders. Around 115 hostages remain in Gaza, according to the Israeli authorities.\n\n\"This recent statement reaffirms what we've long known: A deal is the only path to bring all hostages home,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said. \"Time is running out. The hostages have no more time to spare. A deal must be signed now!\"\n\nThe U.S.-led push to renew talks comes at a moment of high tension in the region because of the assassination of Mr. Haniyeh in Tehran and a senior Hezbollah figure in Lebanon. Both Hezbollah and Iran have vowed to retaliate against Israel, and the United States has ordered more warships and aircraft to deploy to the region to help defend its ally against any such attacks.\n\nMr. Biden met in the Oval Office on Thursday with Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and other officials to review military preparations, and his team repeated the U.S. determination to stand by Israel. At the same time, Mr. Biden and his advisers have urged Israel to think twice about an expansive counter-retaliation that could escalate into a regional war.\n\nMr. Austin said that he had called Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister, on Thursday to \"reinforce my ironclad support\" against any attack. \"The U.S. F-22 Raptors that arrived in the region today represent one of many efforts to deter aggression, defend Israel and protect U.S. forces in the region,\" Mr. Austin wrote on social media. \"I also stressed the importance of concluding a cease-fire deal in Gaza that releases the hostages.\"\n\nU.S. officials in recent days have expressed tentative optimism that any action taken by either side may yet be relatively measured, allowing various players to save face without triggering a more explosive conflict. But if that does not bear out, then it could make any return to the bargaining table next week problematic, at least.\n\nAaron Boxerman and Adam Rasgon contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Austin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lloyd Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/08/multimedia/08mideast-crisis-promo-930pmEST-zkcp/08mideast-crisis-promo-930pmEST-zkcp-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802851", "eventUri": "eng-9802851", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 1141, "textEnd": 1148}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 1994, "textEnd": 2000, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

many months to forge a framework agreement that is now on the table with only the details of implementation left to conclude,\" Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi and Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said in a joint statement.\n\n\"There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,\" the world leaders added. \"It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.\"\n\nThe trio noted that they are \"prepared to present a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties.\"\n\nThe situation, however, is tenuous.\n\n\"If they launch a major war in the Middle East with some massive attack on Israel, which they're threatening in coordination with other groups, well, that's obviously going to significantly jeopardize any hope of getting a ceasefire in Gaza,\" a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the state of the ceasefire negotiations said Thursday.\n\nIran has threatened to attack Israel directly for the assassination of Hamas' top leader in Tehran, Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nIranian-backed terror group Hezbollah is also reportedly expected to hit Israel in the coming days independent of possible strike from Iran.\n\nThe Lebanon-based terrorist group is seeking to avenge the death of Hezbollah senior commander Fuad Shukr, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike last week, and the group is unlikely to wait for a response from its backers in Tehran, sources told CNN.\n\nThe joint letter made no mention of Iran's looming threat.\n\nThe senior administration official said that a deal isn't expected to be signed by next Thursday, noting that there is \"still a significant amount of work to do.\"\n\nThe official said that the Israelis appear to be \"very receptive\" to the framework deal and that Iran's ambassador to the United Nations also believes a ceasefire deal is close to getting done.\n\nThe US \"will be prepared for any contingency\" should Iran launch an attack on Israel, the senior administration official asserted.\n\n\"We have moved an awful lot of military force into the region, including F-22s that arrived today,\" the official said, highlighting the \"significant and substantial military deployments\" to the Middle East to counter Iranian threats.", "source":

They said Netanyahu is the main obstacle to an agreement.\n\nOne of the Arab officials said the US is the only party with enough leverage to get Netanyahu to agree to a deal since the US is Israel's main weapons supplier. The official said the US could apply pressure by blaming Netanyahu publicly, but US officials have refused to do so even as it's become clear the Israeli leader has been sabotaging the chances of a deal.\n\nAfter President Biden unveiled a ceasefire proposal that was on the table at the end of May, the US said Hamas was the only obstacle to an agreement being reached even as Netanyahu publicly rejected a permanent ceasefire, which was part of the second phase of the deal.\n\nNetanyahu's comments made Hamas ask for a commitment to a permanent ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal up front. After Hamas conceded and agreed to vague enough language that wouldn't commit Israel to a permanent ceasefire, Netanyahu added new demands, including indefinite Israeli control of the Gaza-Egypt border and a screening mechanism for Palestinians returning to north Gaza.\n\nIsraeli officials, including Mossad Director David Barnea, who has been leading negotiations, said Netanyahu's demands would thwart a deal. But US officials still refuse to name Netanyahu as an obstacle to talks even after he assassinated Hamas's political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, which has put the negotiations on hold.\n\nWhite House National Security Advisor John Kirby said Wednesday that it was up to Yahya Sinwar, Hamas's leader in Gaza, who was named as Haniyeh's replacement, to agree to a deal. \"And as the chief decision-maker, [Sinwar] needs to decide now to take this deal, to get a ceasefire in place, to get some of those hostages home, and to get us all an opportunity to get more humanitarian assistance in. He needs to accept the deal,\" Kirby said.\n\nWhen asked if Netanyahu was refusing to sign a deal, Kirby dodged the question. \"I'll say it again: There's a proposal that is on the table. It's a good proposal. It'll get us a six-week ceasefire, or get us the most at -- the most vulnerable hostages out,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this week, Israeli media reported that the US is willing to give Israel a guarantee that it could restart the genocidal war in Gaza after the first phase of any hostage deal.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Times of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mossad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802851", "eventUri": "eng-9802851", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Sinwar is reported to be more extreme than his predecessor and is widely understood to be the architect of the October 7 attacks in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 hostages taken to Gaza.\n\nHis appointment, alongside Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's continued regional provocations, deals another blow to chances of a ceasefire and the long-awaited return of the hostages.\n\nSinwar was born in 1962 in the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. He is viewed as one of the most extreme figures in Hamas. Sinwar has been jailed in Israel on several occasions and helped to establish the group's armed wing, the Qassam Brigades.\n\nIn 1988, after his third arrest, he was handed four life sentences for his involvement in the killing of two Israeli soldiers and four alleged Palestinian collaborators.\n\nHowever, Sinwar was released in 2011 as part of a prisoner exchange that saw an Israeli soldier called Gilad Shalit freed in return for more than 1,000 Palestinians. As I have written previously, he is now personally dedicated to ensuring the release of all Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.\n\nAny suggestion that Hamas may look to pursue more pragmatic avenues to achieve Palestinian liberation under Sinwar seems unlikely. In a post on X on August 7, Israeli columnist Gershon Baskin noted that Sinwar has objected to any discussion of laying down arms and aspires for Hamas to become for Gaza what Hezbollah is for Lebanon.\n\nAs well as yielding significant influence in Lebanon, Hezbollah is a regional power. It acts as a proxy for Iran, has a sophisticated arsenal, and has participated in other conflicts across the Middle East.\n\nThe promotion of Sinwar, who has served as Hamas's leader inside the Gaza Strip since 2017, brings the political and military wings of Hamas together and places Gaza at the centre of Hamas. It sends a clear message to Israel that killing the group's leaders will not weaken Hamas but will instead strengthen its resolve to hold on to Gaza and continue engaging in a violent struggle.\n\nAl Jazeera argues that Sinwar's presence on the front lines \"with resistance fighters and between the children of his people\" reasserts the message that the goals Israel is seeking by killing the group's leaders have failed.\n\nCeasefire negotiations up in the air\n\nThere is disagreement among commentators over what effect the change in leadership will have on the negotiations for a ceasefire and the release of the hostages.\n\nZve Bar'el, a reporter from the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, does not believe that Sinwar's appointment will alter the direction of the negotiations. He argues that Sinwar, not Haniyeh, had always been the true decision maker in the talks.\n\nAlistair Bunkel from Sky News, on the other hand, argues that reaching a deal will be harder than ever under Sinwar, who is said to have closer ties to Iran and is less pragmatic than other Hamas leaders.\n\nThis is a claim that has been backed up by Javed Ali, a former official with the US National Security Council. On August 6, he told the BBC that Sinwar is \"much more inflexible and much more difficult to negotiate with\" than Haniyeh.\n\nAnalyses of the negotiations must also take into account the Israeli position, and specifically that of Netanyahu. Throughout the war in Gaza, Netanyahu has been criticised domestically for not putting the release of the hostages at the top of his agenda.\n\nCritics believe Netanyahu has prolonged the assault on Gaza, in which Israeli forces have killed nearly 39,700 people, in order to ensure his own political survival.\n\nIsrael has not publicly acknowledged responsibility for Haniyeh's assassination. But, according to many, it was yet another example of Netanyahu acting to derail the negotiations.\n\nJust weeks before Haniyeh's death, in early July 2024, signs of a breakthrough had been reported both by a source in Israel's negotiating team and a senior US official - though, admittedly, the chances of reaching a ceasefire deal were still limited.\n\nCynics may also argue that by sanctioning the assassination on Iranian soil, Netanyahu is purposefully attempting to provoke Iran. Research conducted by myself and my colleague, Amnon Aran, concluded that Netanyahu's \"approach to peace is militaristic to its core\". He sees Islamic fundamentalists as a permanent, existential threat to Israel that must continually be abated.\n\nAfter Sinwar was named as the new leader of Hamas, Israel's army chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, vowed to find and kill him. His appointment will probably be used by Netanyahu to justify a further onslaught on the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe promotion of Sinwar, coupled with the position of Netanyahu, ultimately means a ceasefire is unlikely to be reached anytime soon. The destruction of the Gaza Strip and its inhabitants is likely to continue.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants a guarantee that he'll be able to restart military operations after the first phase, which is when negotiations will be held on implementing the next two phases.\n\nThe US has not yet provided a written agreement that it would allow Israel to restart operations but has expressed its approval of the idea.

But it's unclear if Hamas would agree to a deal where Israel gets an explicit guarantee from the US that it could restart military operations.\n\nIn the weeks and months leading up to Haniyeh's assassination, Netanyahu had been working to sabotage the chances of a deal. After Hamas made the concession that it wouldn't seek a guarantee for a permanent ceasefire upfront, Netanyahu began making new public demands that Mossad Director David Barnea, the Israeli official in charge of the talks, said would thwart an agreement.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Times of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yedioth_Ahronoth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yedioth Ahronoth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mossad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabotage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802851", "eventUri": "eng-9802851", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Hundreds of people gathered to pay their respects to the movement's late leader and his bodyguard.\n\nThe scene was more than a memorial service - it signalled the end of an era and the beginning of a new, more extreme phase.\n\nThis was not the first time I had witnessed Hamas's top officials gather to choose a new leader after an unexpected funeral. Back in 2004 I witnessed them meet after Israel assassinated the group's founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin - the meeting taking place in his house in Gaza. Less than a month later, Israel killed his successor Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi.\n\nBut this time the backstage discussions reflected the extent of the crisis and challenges they are facing.\n\nReutersHundreds of people turned up to mourn Haniyeh in Doha\n\nHamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back into Gaza. Since then, Israel's military retaliation has killed more than 39,600 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and wounded tens of thousands more. More than half the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed and almost the entire population has been displaced. Dissent against Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, has been growing. The group itself has taken severe losses.\n\nOn top of this, the killing of Ismail Haniyeh on 31 July in Tehran - a place he had always felt to be a safe haven - was a real shock for the organisation.\n\nHamas is convinced that Haniyeh was killed by an anti-personnel missile while he was browsing on his phone. Iran's Revolutionary Guards have said a projectile with a 7kg warhead was used. Some Western media reports say he was killed by a bomb planted in the room beforehand.\n\nBack at Haniyeh's mourning ceremony in Doha, one man in his mid-60s with white hair and a short beard stood in a corner away from the spotlight.\n\n\"Pay close attention to him,\" a Hamas media officer told me. Who was he? \"He is the shadowy man, Abu Omar Hassan,\" he said.\n\nAbu Omar Hassan, or Mohamed Hassan Darwish, is the head of the Supreme Shura Council, the top consultative body in Hamas. According to Hamas's constitution, he was in prime position to be the organisation's interim head until elections which had been scheduled for next March.\n\n\"He is the man of the big missions,\" I was told.\n\nAs the mourning ceremony ended, these leaders' real work began. For two days, the movement's veteran faces and shadowy figures held meetings in Doha, which has hosted Hamas's political bureau since 2012, to elect a new leader.\n\nGetty ImagesIsrael's military onslaught has left much of Gaza in ruins\n\nThey chose Yahya Sinwar, already the group's leader inside Gaza since 2017. The choice may come as a surprise to many, but anyone following his career since Israel released him in the 2011 exchange deal for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit knew he was always likely to lead Hamas one day.\n\nNo political leader in Hamas has ever been closer to the group's armed wing. His brother Mohammed leads the largest Hamas military battalion, while Mohammed Deif - the elusive Hamas veteran who led its armed wing for two decades until Israel said it killed him last month - was his neighbour, friend, and classmate. The pair grew up together in Gaza's sprawling Khan Younis refugee camp.\n\nDespite all this, many may see appointing him to the most important position in Hamas as madness. Israel's security agencies believe Sinwar planned and executed the attack on southern Israel, and he is top of their wanted list.\n\n\"Not all of the people inside Hamas leadership were in favour of the decision,\" a senior Hamas official told me. \"Some leaders raised their concerns, others pushed for a more moderate person. But in the end he got the majority of the votes.\"\n\nAnother Hamas official who attended the meetings said the movement felt unable to choose the powerful shadow operator Abu Omar Hassan because he had little public profile and was unknown outside the movement, whereas the 7 October attack had given Yahya Sinwar global notoriety.\n\n\"Sinwar has become a trademark after 7 October and he has great popularity in the Arab and Islamic worlds,\" the official said. \"He enjoys close relations with the axis of resistance supported by Iran, and his appointment in the midst of the war sends a message of defiance to Israel.\"\n\nThe \"axis of resistance\" is a network of armed groups backed by Iran.

Sinwar is reported to be more extreme than his predecessor and is widely understood to be the architect of the October 7 attacks in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 hostages taken to Gaza.\n\nHis appointment, alongside Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's continued regional provocations, deals another blow to chances of a ceasefire and the long-awaited return of the hostages.\n\nSinwar was born in 1962 in the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. He is viewed as one of the most extreme figures in Hamas. Sinwar has been jailed in Israel on several occasions and helped to establish the group's armed wing, the Qassam Brigades.\n\nIn 1988, after his third arrest, he was handed four life sentences for his involvement in the killing of two Israeli soldiers and four alleged Palestinian collaborators.\n\nHowever, Sinwar was released in 2011 as part of a prisoner exchange that saw an Israeli soldier called Gilad Shalit freed in return for more than 1,000 Palestinians. As I have written previously, he is now personally dedicated to ensuring the release of all Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.\n\nAny suggestion that Hamas may look to pursue more pragmatic avenues to achieve Palestinian liberation under Sinwar seems unlikely. In a post on X on August 7, Israeli columnist Gershon Baskin noted that Sinwar has objected to any discussion of laying down arms and aspires for Hamas to become for Gaza what Hezbollah is for Lebanon.\n\nAs well as yielding significant influence in Lebanon, Hezbollah is a regional power. It acts as a proxy for Iran, has a sophisticated arsenal, and has participated in other conflicts across the Middle East.\n\nThe promotion of Sinwar, who has served as Hamas's leader inside the Gaza Strip since 2017, brings the political and military wings of Hamas together and places Gaza at the centre of Hamas. It sends a clear message to Israel that killing the group's leaders will not weaken Hamas but will instead strengthen its resolve to hold on to Gaza and continue engaging in a violent struggle.\n\nAl Jazeera argues that Sinwar's presence on the front lines \"with resistance fighters and between the children of his people\" reasserts the message that the goals Israel is seeking by killing the group's leaders have failed.\n\nCeasefire negotiations up in the air\n\nThere is disagreement among commentators over what effect the change in leadership will have on the negotiations for a ceasefire and the release of the hostages.\n\nZve Bar'el, a reporter from the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, does not believe that Sinwar's appointment will alter the direction of the negotiations. He argues that Sinwar, not Haniyeh, had always been the true decision maker in the talks.\n\nAlistair Bunkel from Sky News, on the other hand, argues that reaching a deal will be harder than ever under Sinwar, who is said to have closer ties to Iran and is less pragmatic than other Hamas leaders.\n\nThis is a claim that has been backed up by Javed Ali, a former official with the US National Security Council. On August 6, he told the BBC that Sinwar is \"much more inflexible and much more difficult to negotiate with\" than Haniyeh.\n\nAnalyses of the negotiations must also take into account the Israeli position, and specifically that of Netanyahu. Throughout the war in Gaza, Netanyahu has been criticised domestically for not putting the release of the hostages at the top of his agenda.\n\nCritics believe Netanyahu has prolonged the assault on Gaza, in which Israeli forces have killed nearly 39,700 people, in order to ensure his own political survival.\n\nIsrael has not publicly acknowledged responsibility for Haniyeh's assassination. But, according to many, it was yet another example of Netanyahu acting to derail the negotiations.\n\nJust weeks before Haniyeh's death, in early July 2024, signs of a breakthrough had been reported both by a source in Israel's negotiating team and a senior US official - though, admittedly, the chances of reaching a ceasefire deal were still limited.\n\nCynics may also argue that by sanctioning the assassination on Iranian soil, Netanyahu is purposefully attempting to provoke Iran. Research conducted by myself and my colleague, Amnon Aran, concluded that Netanyahu's \"approach to peace is militaristic to its core\". He sees Islamic fundamentalists as a permanent, existential threat to Israel that must continually be abated.\n\nAfter Sinwar was named as the new leader of Hamas, Israel's army chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, vowed to find and kill him. His appointment will probably be used by Netanyahu to justify a further onslaught on the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe promotion of Sinwar, coupled with the position of Netanyahu, ultimately means a ceasefire is unlikely to be reached anytime soon. The destruction of the Gaza Strip and its inhabitants is likely to continue.\n\nLeonie Fleischmann does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that

Days later, Israel announced that Deif had been killed in Gaza in July. Hamas has not confirmed Deif's death, but in a show of defiance, the group has announced Sinwar, the last survivor, as its new political leader.\n\nSinwar is seen as the mastermind of the 7 October attacks and one of the militant group's \"most influential leaders\", said The New York Times, \"wielding outsize power while remaining mostly hidden in tunnels beneath Gaza\".\n\nHe was born in a Gaza refugee camp in 1962, and has spent at least 22 years of his adult life in Israeli prisons, learning Hebrew and studying Israeli culture. He founded the Hamas security service known as al-Majd, with which he hunted down Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel - leading to the nickname \"the Butcher of Khan Yunis\". He has since built up the group's military strength, helping to establish the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades.\n\nIn 1989, he was sentenced to life in prison for killing two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians. But he was released in 2011, along with more than 1,000 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners, in a highly controversial exchange for one captive Israeli soldier. Sinwar was designated a \"global terrorist\" by the US in 2015, and two years later appointed head of Hamas's political bureau in Gaza.\n\nSinwar, 61, is one of several Hamas leaders whose arrest warrant has been issued by the International Criminal Court over allegations of war crimes. A top target of Israel, he has managed to evade assassination by rarely appearing in public.\n\nDespite his importance, \"few would have expected Sinwar to be the group's next leader\", said Hugh Lovatt at the European Council on Foreign Relations. But the death of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, has \"tipped the group into a more hardline direction\", he told The Associated Press.\n\nHamas's selection of this \"secretive figure close to Iran\" is \"likely to provoke Israel\". It comes at a \"volatile moment\" with Iran vowing revenge for the rocket strike on its soil, and for the Israeli assassination of a Hezbollah commander in Lebanon hours earlier. Iran and Hezbollah have both praised Sinwar's appointment.\n\nIt also signals that Hamas leadership in Gaza has \"taken over\" from overseas leadership, which the group has traditionally used to navigate relations with foreign allies. Sinwar's appointment \"puts Gaza front and centre\", Nour Odeh, a Palestinian political analyst, told Al Jazeera. \"And it really sends a signal, as far as negotiations of a ceasefire is concerned, that Gaza calls the shots.\"\n\nHis selection, \"seen as a victory for hardliners\", will \"further complicate\" the war, said Sky News. His appointment will \"likely go down badly with Qatar\", where some exiled Hamas officials are based - and which is mediating the ceasefire negotiations.\n\nSinwar \"has been and remains the primary decider when it comes to concluding the ceasefire\", said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nBut the difference now is that there is no longer the \"comparatively pragmatic voice\" of Haniyeh to \"balance Sinwar's uncompromising maximalist views\", said CNBC. On a practical level, reaching Sinwar in Gaza has sometimes taken days. He often \"stalls or cuts off communications during the talks\". It is unclear how he will take on Haniyeh's diplomatic duties abroad.\n\nThe merging of the military and political wings of Hamas also complicates plans for a \"day after\" in Gaza, or a future Palestinian government.\n\nBut Israeli and US intelligence officers believe that Sinwar's strategy is to \"keep the war in Gaza going for as long as it takes to shred Israel's international reputation\", said The New York Times. Sinwar is \"seen as less ready to concede ground to the Israeli negotiators\". He knows he is \"likely to be killed whether or not the war ends\".", "source": {"uri": "theweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Week"}, "authors": [{"uri": "week_uk@theweek.com", "name":

The Palestinian health ministry has yet to release the daily death toll.\n\nThe Israeli military issued displacement orders for residents of eastern Khan Younis ahead of the offensive, forcing thousands of families to flee their homes once again.\n\nThis marks the third ground offensive launched by the Israeli military in Khan Younis since the war began on October 7.\n\nThe first offensive lasted four months, from January to April, while the second offensive was waged over a week in July.\n\nThe months-long invasion and bombing of Gaza have devastated most homes, hospitals and civilian infrastructure in Khan Younis.\n\nIsrael's new offensive was announced shortly after its government confirmed it would send a delegation to the summit proposed by the US, Qatar and Egypt.\n\nThe three countries, suggesting that the summit could take place in Doha or Cairo, said the time has come to finalise the framework agreement on the table.\n\n\"It is time to bring immediate relief both to the long-suffering people of Gaza as well as the long-suffering hostages and their families. The time has come to conclude the ceasefire and hostages and detainees release deal,\" the three countries said in the joint statement.\n\n\"No more time should be wasted, and there should be no excuses by any party for further postponement.\"\n\nIsraeli reaction\n\nThe office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will send a negotiation team to the talks to \"finalise the details for implementing the framework agreement\".\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Hamas.\n\nAccording to Axios, a source familiar with the negotiations described the summit as a \"Hail Mary\" effort by the Biden administration to prevent a regional war after the assassination of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut last week.\n\nIsrael has been bracing for possible retaliation from Iran and Hezbollah in response to the killings, raising fears of all-out war.\n\nA US official told reporters that mediators do not expect a deal to be struck in the planned summit, marking it as the beginning of the end, according to Axios.\n\nCeasefire talks have stalled in recent months due to changing demands by Netanyahu, according to Israeli media.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh has also cooled talks further.\n\nIsraeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich described the call for a summit next week as a \"dangerous trap\" and urged Netanyahu not to shift his position.\n\nSmotrich, who leads the far-right Religious Zionist Party in Netantyhu's government, had previously threatened to quit the coalition and cause it to collapse if a deal is struck with Hamas to end the war.", "source": {"uri": "middleeasteye.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Middle East Eye"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There'll be future hostage taking, there'll be a future October 7, and actually worse things that could happen.\"\n\nHamas has tried to use the fate of the Israeli hostages as leverage to force Israel to end the war for months, but Netanyahu has refused. His reiteration of that position, however, will be a blow to the hostages' families, many of whom believe he has not tried hard enough to free their loved ones, and could portend another dispute between President Joe Biden and Netanyahu, even if U.S. and regional mediators succeed in brokering a more limited agreement.\n\n\"The way that I'm seeking to achieve [in] this deal is a way that will maximize the number of hostages that are released in the first phase -- living hostages that are released in the first phase -- but also that would make sure that Hamas cannot take over Gaza after the deal,\" Netanyahu said in the interview when asked if he would end the war in exchange for \"all of the hostages.\"\n\nThat conversation, given Sunday but published Thursday, occurred against a backdrop of international anxiety about a potential Iranian strike in retaliation for the assassination of a top Hamas official in Tehran last week. Iranian officials have pledged to \"instill deep regret\" in Israel, but Tehran signaled its interest in a \"durable ceasefire\" just hours after Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested that a ceasefire deal could provide the two governments an off-ramp from the crisis over the assassination.\n\n\"We have pursued two priorities simultaneously: first, establishing a durable cease-fire in Gaza and the withdrawal of the [Israeli military] occupiers from this territory; second, punishing the aggressor for the assassination of Martyr Haniyeh,\" Iran's diplomatic mission at the United Nations said Wednesday evening, according to Al-Monitor.\n\nBlinken argued in a Wednesday evening press conference that \"avoiding any action that could disrupt\" the ceasefire talks would be key to \"bringing calm\" to the Middle East.\n\n\"So in and of itself, escalation would be a bad thing, but it also has the potential to upend bringing the ceasefire over the line and bringing it to conclusion,\" he said Wednesday.\n\nBlinken regards the ceasefire as a first agreement as an initial step to \"break the cycle\" of violence between Israel and Iran.\n\n\"It's also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a ceasefire in Gaza,\" he said earlier this week. \"That in turn will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself but in other areas where the conflict could spread.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nNetanyahu, for his part, has signaled his opposition to a short-term deal that evolves into a permanent end to the fighting, if that means that Hamas remains in place.\n\n\"That is something that would run against everything that we were talking about,\" he told Time. \"I think it's important to achieve it, not only because we eliminate that front so close to the center of our country ...but also to send a message to the other elements of the Iran terror axis,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_gehrke@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Joel Gehrke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al-Monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/netanyahu-1.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802851", "eventUri": "eng-9802851", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 431, "textEnd": 440}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

He was elected this week by the 50-member Shura Council, an advisory body elected by Hamas members in four chapters: Gaza, West Bank, diaspora and security prisoners in Israeli jails. His rise to the top of Hamas' political bureau to replace assassinated leader Ismail Haniyeh has thrown the region into turmoil as it waited for the guns to fall silent.\n\nAfter spending 23 years in Israeli prisons and being released in 2011 in exchange for imprisoned Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, trusted sources in the region told Frontline that Israeli spy agencies had proposed eliminating him several times.\n\nIn the 2021 Israeli-Palestinian crisis, dubbed the Intifada of Unity by the Palestinians and Operation Guardians of the Walls by the Israelis, the Israeli domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet had specifically requested permission for his elimination. It was during this war that Sinwar successfully propelled himself into a leadership role with an iconic picture of him sitting on a dusty couch in the heart of the ruins of Gaza.\n\nThe head of the Shin Bet, Nadav Argaman, had argued that Sinwar posed a strategic challenge to Israel. Within 10 years of his release, he quickly took control of the Gaza Strip, united the organisation's military and political wings under his leadership and also expelled the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) from the region.\n\nBut Benjamin Netanyahu, who had just concluded the Abraham Accords with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and was counting on bringing Saudi Arabia on board, had other plans. Sources report that he spoke out against the assassination proposal.\n\nMany in Tel Aviv believe that this was not out of love for Sinwar, but out of Netanyahu's usual political intention to weaken the Mahmoud Abbas-led Palestinian Authority and the secular PLO by giving its arch-rival, the Islamist Hamas in Gaza, leverage so that Arab leaders do not insist on including the Palestinians in any round of negotiations.\n\nAlso Read | Assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh derails peace talks, escalates tensions\n\nAccording to analysts in West Asia, the Israeli prime minister has now turned back the clock again by allegedly ordering the assassination of moderate Hamas representative Haniyeh in Tehran amid US-backed ceasefire talks mediated by Egypt and Qatar.\n\nExperts believe that there are many unwritten rules of warfare and conflict management. The most important of these is not to eliminate any party or person who has the authority to end the violence and achieve a ceasefire. Israel has violated this rule by eliminating the moderate face of Hamas and effectively leaving the organisation to the hardliners, who are expected to prioritise armed struggle as the only strategic option.\n\nSpeaking to Frontline, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said that while new chief Sinwar has instructed his team to continue his predecessor Haniyeh's policy on ceasefire talks, the process stands stalled.\n\n\"We are still ready to look favourably on any proposal for a ceasefire, but there has been no progress in the talks since Haniyeh's assassination,\" he said. He emphasised that the problem with the negotiations was not the change of leadership in Hamas, but Israel and the failure of the US to force an agreement.\n\nHiding in tunnels\n\nHowever, mediators in Cairo and Doha are worried as they do not know how to deal with the new Hamas leader, who is hiding somewhere in tunnels and waging war in Gaza from the front, unlike Haniyeh and Khalid Mashal, who used to frequent world capitals. Mashal was expected to take the lead as he was involved in diplomatic relations and assisted Haniyeh in the negotiations.\n\nAnalysts believe Sinwar's election is not just a routine leadership change, but a statement of intent reflecting a hardening of positions towards Netanyahu. His election indicates a tough stance towards Israel, with a clear message of defiance and resistance.\n\nAlso Read | Israel's diversionary attack on Iran has set off a new security crisis in West Asia\n\nBorn in 1962 in the Khan Yunis refugee camp, Sinwar's life has been characterised by struggle from the start. His early experiences in the camp's narrow alleyways and makeshift shelters shaped a resilience that would define his future.\n\nHis academic prowess was overshadowed by his growing commitment to the Palestinian cause, which eventually led to his arrest and conviction by the Israeli authorities for his role in the kidnapping and murder of two Israeli soldiers.\n\nSinwar's strategic acumen was displayed on October, 7, 2023, when he orchestrated arguably the most significant deception operation in Israel's history. While Mohammed Deif and Marwan Issa led the attack on Israel, Sinwar is believed to have meticulously planned and executed the operation.\n\nInternationally, Sinwar is a figure of contention. Designated a terrorist by major powers such as the US and the European Union, he is seen by his supporters as a freedom fighter, embodying the Palestinian quest for self-determination against overwhelming odds. His policies and actions have kept him at the heart of geopolitical discussions, influencing regional politics and international diplomatic relations.\n\nAs negotiations for peace and ceasefire remain elusive, Sinwar's role is pivotal. With each move, he shapes the possibilities of peace or prolongs the prospects of perpetual conflict. His leadership is a beacon for some and a bane for others, encapsulating the complex interplay of heroism and vilification that characterises the Israeli-Palestinian saga.\n\nWhether vilified or valorised, his impact on the course of West Asian politics is indelible, painting a portrait of a man at the epicentre of one of the world's most enduring conflicts.\n\nIftikhar Gilani is an Indian

Agence France-Presse\n\nJERUSALEM -- Since Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, Yahya Sinwar has been at the top of Israel's most wanted list, but the newly appointed chief of the Palestinian group has remained elusive as ever.\n\nIsraeli commanders believe Sinwar, 61, is hiding in a labyrinthine maze of tunnels that Hamas has built under the Gaza Strip over the years.\n\nIn December, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the army had surrounded Sinwar's house, but since then there has been little to no information on his whereabouts.\n\nREAD: Yahya Sinwar: new Hamas leader and 'dead man walking'\n\n\"There are many unanswered questions,\" said Michael Milstein, an Israeli analyst and former adviser to the defense ministry.\n\n\"I am quite sure that there are lots of places that he can hide in, and he has a lot of men around him that are really loyal to him and support him,\" he added.\n\nImages of Sinwar were rare even before the October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nREAD: Israel FM calls to 'swiftly eliminate' new Hamas chief Sinwar\n\nDuring the attack, Hamas militants seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still captive in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign has since killed at least 39,699 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details of civilian and militant deaths.\n\nSinwar has not been seen in public since the attack.\n\nBut in February, the Israeli military released grainy footage of a man it said was Sinwar walking through a tunnel on October 10, three days after the deadly attack on Israel.\n\nThe black and white CCTV footage was found during a military operation. AFP was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the video.\n\n'Hideout to hideout '\n\nThe video was the \"result of our hunt\", Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing at the time.\n\n\"The hunt will not stop until he is captured, dead or alive. We are determined to capture him.\"\n\nIt was not the video that was important, Hagari said, but the intelligence the military could glean from it that would help find other top militants.\n\nDays later, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant claimed that Sinwar was \"on the run\" and moving from \"hideout to hideout\".\n\nEarlier this month, the military announced that in July it had killed Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas's armed wing and, along with Sinwar, one of the alleged planners of the October 7 attack.\n\nIn recent days, there have been rumors that Sinwar has been meeting with hostages still being held in Gaza.\n\nWhen a week-long ceasefire was concluded at the end of November, and dozens of hostages were freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, one of the released captives claimed to have seen Sinwar.\n\nBut after questioning Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, the security services concluded that it was not Sinwar she had seen, her son told Israeli television Channel 13.\n\n\"Using complex means, he communicates with all the leadership of the movement both inside (Gaza) and outside, and also with the (Ezzedine) al-Qassam Brigades,\" a senior Hamas leader told AFP, referring to the group's armed wing.\n\n\"He follows complex security procedures for his personal protection, but this does not prevent him from continuing his duties and making decisions,\" the official said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the issue.\n\nSinwar will speak soon about his appointment as Hamas chief, he added.\n\nSpeculation\n\nMeanwhile, his absence is fuelling ample speculation over his location.\n\nSome claim to have seen him walking the streets of Gaza to celebrate his new appointment or meeting with Palestinian families displaced by the war, but there has been no confirmation.\n\nThe Israeli media have also reported anecdotes and aspects of his personality from many who spent time with him in Israeli jails, where he was imprisoned for 23 years.\n\nDiplomats, journalists and commentators often speculate on how the Hamas supremo might be communicating with other officials of the movement outside of Gaza, given that he is involved in indirect negotiations with Israel for a ceasefire and that his responses take several days to reach them.\n\n\"I won't be surprised if he is surrounded by hostages as a shield,\" Milstein said.\n\n\"He does understand that if he is protected by hostages, it will be more difficult for Israel to attack him.\"\n\nMilstein said Sinwar has many people who respect him, while others fear him.\n\n\"He must be receiving help from Gazans who either fear him or adhere to Hamas's ideology.\"\n\nWhile some claim he has left Gaza, most experts on Hamas reject that idea.\n\n\"He is not afraid to die...

Yet Israel did not want a wider and high-intensity war. Iran-backed Hezbollah does not appear to have wanted a wider and high-intensity war. And Iran, too, appeared not to have wanted a wider and high-intensity war. Only Iran-backed Hamas wanted a full-blown regional war. It may well get its way.\n\nIn defending itself against the Iranian-built \"ring of fire\" - Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthis in Yemen, and militias in Syria and Iraq - intended to wear it down and cause its collapse, Israel advances American interests in regional stability and in fortifying an international order that favors freedom and democracy. American support for Israel, in the military arena as well as in the court of international public opinion, has been and will remain crucial.\n\nCommitted by its charter to Israel's destruction, Hamas launched a savage attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, targeting mostly civilians and killing more than 1200, at least 32 of whom were Americans, and kidnapping more than 250, at least 10 of whom were Americans. Igniting a multi-front war belonged to \"the contours of Hamas's broader plan,\" according to a November 2023 Washington Post assessment. Hamas' aim was \"not just to kill and capture Israelis, but to spark a conflagration that would sweep the region and lead to a wider conflict.\" In a meeting convened by the New York Times with Hamas representatives in Qatar that also took place in November, Taher El-Nounou, a Hamas media adviser, said, \"I hope that the state of war with Israel will become permanent on all the borders, and that the Arab world will stand with us.\"\n\nYahya Sinwar, recently named head of Hamas' political bureau to replace Ismael Haniyeh who was killed in Tehran last week, recognized that Gaza Palestinians would pay a high price for Hamas' success. In June 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that the mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks affirmed in emails to Hamas negotiators that the thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza involved \"necessary sacrifices\" for the sake of Israel's annihilation.\n\nWriting to Hamas officials negotiating a cease-fire agreement, Sinwar also stated, \"We have the Israelis right where we want them.\"\n\nThat meant bogged down fighting Hamas militants dressed as civilians in and under Gaza's cities. Sinwar also meant that the international media was playing its anticipated role by portraying Israel as responsible for the humanitarian disaster in Gaza. Civilian suffering in Gaza on a mass scale was a foreseeable - and intended - consequence of Hamas' slaughter of Israeli civilians on Oct. 7 and of the jihadists' determination, decades in the making, to unlawfully and inhumanely embed Hamas military forces in Gaza's civilian areas, not least homes, schools, hospitals, and mosques. Sinwar may not have anticipated the resource, tenacity, and valor with which Israel would exercise its right to destroy Hamas' capacity to wage war and govern, and to secure the hostages.\n\nOver the last month, Israel has inflicted several major blows on Iran's \"ring of fire.\" On July 13, the Israel Defense Forces killed Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, who had been hiding in in Khan Younis in a compound located in a designated humanitarian zone. On July 20 - following months of Iran-backed Houthi efforts to strike Israel from Yemen and in direct response to a Houthi drone that hit a Tel Aviv building killing a man - IDF aircraft flew more than a thousand miles to destroy fuel-storage facilities at the Houthi-controlled Hodeida port in western Yemen. On July 30, in retaliation for the Hezbollah rocket that killed 12 children playing soccer in the Golan Heights and wounded dozens more, an IDF airstrike killed top Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in an apartment building in southern Beirut. And on July 31, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed at a state-run guesthouse in Tehran - on one account by a remotely activated bomb and on another by a short-range projectile. Although widely believed to have executed the mission, Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's death.\n\nMarvels of intelligence gathering and analysis, patient planning, and pinpoint execution, these acts of self-defense against enemies devoted to its destruction came at a high cost to Israel. In particular, the killing of Hezbollah's Shukr in Beirut and of Hamas' Haniyeh in Tehran humiliated their hosts and made likely retaliatory strikes from Hezbollah and Iran that could plunge the region into a full-blown war.\n\nIn \"Israel's Next War,\" which appeared in late July online at Foreign Affairs, Amos Harel explains the foremost danger. The defense analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Harel focuses on Hezbollah, which represents a substantially more formidable foe than Hamas and a closer and more menacing threat than Iran.\n\n\"Although Israeli air defense systems have been extremely successful thus far against missile attacks from Gaza, Lebanon, Iran, and Yemen, a total war with Hezbollah would be a whole different ballgame,\" Harel writes. \"According to Israeli intelligence estimates, Hezbollah's weapons stockpile is more than seven times as large as Hamas's and includes far more lethal weapons.\" The arsenal contains \"hundreds of attack drones, it includes some 130,000-150,000 rockets and missiles, including hundreds of ballistic missiles that could reach targets in Tel Aviv and even farther south - indeed, every point in the country.\"\n\nDespite the many and varied wars its neighbors have compelled it to fight since its birth in 1948, Israel has never faced a remotely similar threat. \"Israel's home-front command estimates that if a full-scale conflict broke out now, Hezbollah would launch some 3,000 rockets and missiles every day of the war, threatening to overwhelm Israel's missile defenses,\" according to Harel. \"Israel would have to concentrate on defending crucial infrastructure and military bases, tell the civilian population to stay in bomb shelters, and hope for the best.\"\n\nHad Hezbollah also not been taken by surprise on Oct. 7, and had it not hesitated, its fighters could well have overrun northern Israel while the nation was still reeling from Hamas' rampage through southern border communities. However, the IDF quickly moved tens of thousands of soldiers to the northern front, which stymied any Hezbollah ground assault.\n\nAt the same time, daily Hezbollah drone and rocket attacks since Oct. 8 and the lingering peril of cross-border incursions compelled Israel to evacuate tens of thousands of civilians from a three-mile swath of territory on the nation's border with Lebanon. More than ten months later, those civilians remain displaced persons within their own country while Hezbollah's persistent aerial assaults on the north have inflicted severe damage on Israeli infrastructure and ignited numerous forest fires.\n\nWhile caught off guard by Hamas on Oct. 7, \"Israel has long been preparing for a war with Hezbollah,\" Harel reports. Nevertheless, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a plan swiftly put forward by military leaders for \"a major operation against Hezbollah that apparently would include the assassination of senior Hezbollah leaders.\" Netanyahu had good reasons for exercising restraint. The Biden administration was opposed. Also, \"he doubted whether the army was up to the task of fighting vicious wars on multiple fronts, just days after Hamas's massacre of Israelis,\" argues Harel.\n\nNot that Israel declined to fight back. Since Oct. 8, the IDF has, in addition to the recent elimination of Shukr, killed a senior Hamas leader in Beirut, several senior Hezbollah commanders, and at least 370 Hezbollah fighters. It has also regularly destroyed weapons convoys and depots, and rocket launchers.\n\nU.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein has little prospect of securing a negotiated settlement. Israel insists that Hezbollah forces remain north of the Litani River in southern Lebanon - about seven to 20 miles from the border as the waterway wends from east to west - in accordance with the August 2006 cease-fire agreement formalized in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701. Hezbollah wants to return to the illegal positions it occupied before Oct. 7 south of the Litani and close to the border.\n\nConsequently, the Israeli military establishment generally believes that a showdown with Hezbollah is inevitable. Israel's preparations must consider the circumstances and the timing. Two major factors are the strains from 10 months of fighting Hamas and Hezbollah on IDF troops - regular and reserve - and the shortages of equipment, including key munitions. In the event of a major war, the IDF will probably rely on intensive airstrikes along with a ground incursion to the Litani. The airstrikes \"could bring massive destruction to all state-owned civilian infrastructure in Lebanon within a few days,\" states Harel.\n\nAt the same time, Hezbollah - perhaps also Iran and the Houthis - will rain down unprecedented waves of rockets and missiles on Israeli cities. Since Hezbollah, in blatant disregard of the international laws of war, places arsenals and launchers among civilian populations, Israeli operations to destroy those legitimate military targets will likely, though not intentionally, cause the deaths of thousands of Lebanese. Harel warns that Israel will be portrayed by \"many Western countries and in the international media\" not as Ukraine fighting in self-defense but \"as another Russia, almost a pariah state.\"\n\nIn the event of the full-blown regional war that Hamas sought to ignite on Oct. 7, Israel's effective exercise of its right of self-defense would depend in part on U.S. intelligence sharing, supplies, and anti-missile operations. The Biden administration will also need to explain to a generally hostile and poorly informed world - not least many Western countries and the international media - that Israel's determined exercise of its right to self-defense advances America's interest in a stable Middle East that favors freedom and democracy.", "source": {"uri": "realclearpolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Real

How will negotiations take place?\"\n\nHamas's Lebanon-based ally Hizbollah has also pledged to avenge the deaths of Haniyeh and its own military commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli strike in Beirut.\n\nIn a televised address to mark one week since Shukr's death, Hizbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Tuesday his group would retaliate \"alone or in the context of a unified response from all the axis\" of Iran-backed groups in the region.\n\nThe United States, which has sent extra warships and jets to the region, has urged both Iran and Israel to avoid an escalation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden this week spoke with regional leaders, while Blinken told reporters the message of restraint had also been communicated \"directly\" to both Israel and Iran.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told Netanyahu on Wednesday to \"avoid a cycle of reprisals\", after earlier delivering the same message to his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian, the French presidency said.\n\nPezeshkian told Macron in a separate telephone call that the West \"should immediately stop selling arms and supporting\" Israel if it wanted to prevent war, his office said.\n\nIsrael has not commented on Haniyeh's killing in Iran, but it has confirmed it carried out the strike on Shukr in Beirut.\n\nHizbollah has traded near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli troops throughout the Gaza war.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Lebanese security source said that a Hezbollah fighter and a civilian were killed in an Israeli strike near Jouaiyya close to the border. The Israeli military said it had eliminated a Hamas commander in the area.\n\nThe Israeli military later said its jets had destroyed a launcher on Wednesday night that had been used by Hezbollah to send drones towards the Golan Heights earlier in the evening.\n\nNumerous airlines have suspended flights to Lebanon or limited them to daylight hours due to security fears, while Egypt said Iran had warned civilian airlines to steer clear of its airspace as it will be conducting military exercises overnight.\n\nThe United Nations said it was \"temporarily\" reducing the presence of UN staff family members in Lebanon, although it was not moving its staff.\n\nIsrael's military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,677 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.\n\nThe war has created a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with almost all of its 2.4 million people displaced and suffering from food shortages.\n\nIsrael's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich drew sharp condemnation from some allies on Wednesday for suggesting that \"it might be justified\" to starve the besieged territory.\n\n\"No one in the world will allow us to starve two million people, even though it might be justified and moral in order to free the hostages,\" he said at a conference earlier this week.\n\nThe EU said Smotrich's remarks showed \"contempt for international law and for basic principles of humanity\".\n\nFrance expressed its \"deep dismay\" at the comments, while UK Foreign Minister David Lammy called on \"the wider Israeli government to retract and condemn them\".", "source": {"uri": "jordantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jordan Times"}, "authors": [],

There is a good proposal before both sides, and they need to both accept that proposal so we can get this in place.\"\n\nAsked whether a deal is being impeded by Hamas or by Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Kirby said that both sides must compromise.\n\n\"The deal hasn't been accepted, because neither side has signed up to it,\" Kirby said. \"We believe that both sides need to do the final bit of work here, to come to a conclusion on this thing.\"\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said in June that \"Hamas is now the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire,\" a sentiment that other U.S. officials subsequently echoed. The change in the U.S. description of negotiations -- attributing a need for compromise on both sides -- led to widespread speculation that Israel changed the terms of the proposal, or that Israeli military actions in Gaza and the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran may be hindering a deal.\n\nNetanyahu's office stated on Wednesday that Hamas hasn't responded to Israel's latest proposal. \"Israel has already given a clear offer, and sent the negotiating delegation to Cairo last Saturday,\" it said. \"Until this moment, no response was received from Hamas.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said on Tuesday that \"the negotiations have now reached a final stage.\"\n\nSources reportedly close to the negotiations told Israeli media that they were surprised by Washington's apparent optimism on a timeline.\n\nIntense diplomacy\n\nWashington is engaged in \"intense diplomacy\" to prevent an Iranian retaliatory strike on Israel after the killing of Haniyeh, Kirby said. He reiterated the Biden administration's commitment to defending Israel.\n\n\"We don't want to see an escalation,\" he said. \"If there is one, my goodness, we're going to be ready to defend Israel and defend ourselves as appropriate.\"\n\nIranian proxy forces like Hezbollah and the Houthis had only limited involvement in Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel in April, with Iran firing much of the ordinance from its own territory.\n\nKirby added that the United States is prepared for a renewed strike from Iran to include a wider array of proxy forces.\n\n\"It would be foolhardy for us to assume that they wouldn't be,\" he said. \"We've got to prepare for all contingencies, and we are.\"\n\nAsked if Iran may have changed its calculus about retaliation in recent days, Kirby declined to comment on U.S. intelligence assessments.\n\n\"I'm sure as hell not capable of getting inside the supreme leader's thinking,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

and joint efforts by Qatar, Egypt and the US to bring a cease-fire in Gaza, Swedish foreign minister said on Friday.\n\n\"Sweden gives full support to the efforts of bringing the ongoing negotiations of a ceasefire and the release of hostages held in Gaza to a rapid and successful conclusion,\" Tobias Billstrom stated on X.\n\n\"We endorse and support Qatar, Egypt and the US in their joint efforts to accomplish a deal,\" he added.\n\nIndirect talks between Israel and Hamas mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt have so far failed to agree on a permanent cease-fire that allows a prisoner swap between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThe efforts have been hampered by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rejection of Hamas's call to halt hostilities.\n\nIsrael, flouting a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire, has faced international condemnation amid its continued brutal offensive on Gaza since Oct. 7 last year following a cross-border attack by the Palestinian group Hamas.\n\nNearly 40,000 Palestinians have since been killed, mostly women and children, and over 91,700 injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nOver 10 months into the Israeli war, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which ordered it to immediately halt its military operation in the southern city of Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.", "source":

AFP was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the video.\n\n'Hideout to hideout '\n\nThe video was the \"result of our hunt\", Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing at the time.\n\n\"The hunt will not stop until he is captured, dead or alive. We are determined to capture him.\"\n\nIt was not the video that was important, Hagari said, but the intelligence the military could glean from it that would help find other top militants.\n\nDays later, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant claimed that Sinwar was \"on the run\" and moving from \"hideout to hideout\".\n\nEarlier this month, the military announced that in July it had killed Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas's armed wing and, along with Sinwar, one of the alleged planners of the October 7 attack.\n\nIn recent days, there have been rumours that Sinwar has been meeting with hostages still being held in Gaza.\n\nWhen a week-long ceasefire was concluded at the end of November, and dozens of hostages were freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, one of the released captives claimed to have seen Sinwar.\n\nBut after questioning Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, the security services concluded that it was not Sinwar she had seen, her son told Israeli television Channel 13.\n\n\"Using complex means, he communicates with all the leadership of the movement both inside (Gaza) and outside, and also with the (Ezzedine) al-Qassam Brigades,\" a senior Hamas leader told AFP, referring to the group's armed wing.\n\n\"He follows complex security procedures for his personal protection, but this does not prevent him from continuing his duties and making decisions,\" the official said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the issue.\n\nSinwar will speak soon about his appointment as Hamas chief, he added.\n\nSpeculation\n\nMeanwhile, his absence is fuelling ample speculation over his location.\n\nSome claim to have seen him walking the streets of Gaza to celebrate his new appointment or meeting with Palestinian families displaced by the war, but there has been no confirmation.\n\nThe Israeli media have also reported anecdotes and aspects of his personality from many who spent time with him in Israeli jails, where he was imprisoned for 23 years.\n\nDiplomats, journalists and commentators often speculate on how the Hamas supremo might be communicating with other officials of the movement outside of Gaza, given that he is involved in indirect negotiations with Israel for a ceasefire and that his responses take several days to reach them.\n\n\"I won't be surprised if he is surrounded by hostages as a shield,\" Milstein said.\n\n\"He does understand that if he is protected by hostages, it will be more difficult for Israel to attack him.\"\n\nMilstein said Sinwar has many people who respect him, while others fear him.\n\n\"He must be receiving help from Gazans who either fear him or adhere to Hamas's ideology.\"\n\nWhile some claim he has left Gaza, most experts on Hamas reject that idea.\n\n\"He is not afraid to die...

A spokesperson for PRCS told ABC News that the organization's medical teams were stopped by Israeli troops from reaching the wounded.\n\nABC News has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment.\n\n-ABC News' Nasser Atta and Camilla Alcini\n\nPalestinians in West Bank being blocked from medical care: New report\n\nPalestinians in the West Bank are being restricted access to medical care, including for physical injuries and mental trauma, according to a new report from Doctors Without Borders.\n\n\"Access to medical care for Palestinians in Hebron is rapidly deteriorating because of restrictions imposed by Israeli forces and violence perpetrated by Israeli soldiers and settlers,\" Doctors Without Borders said.\n\nMinistry of Health clinics across Hebron, in the West Bank, have been forced to close, pharmacies have run short of medications and ambulances transporting the sick and wounded have been obstructed and attacked. Faced with restrictions on their movements and the threat of violence, many sick people delay seeing a doctor or have no choice but to stop medical treatments altogether, according to data collected by Doctors Without Borders between June 2023 and April 2024.\n\n\"The movement restrictions, and harassment and violence by Israeli forces and settlers, is inflicting immense and unnecessary suffering on Palestinians in Hebron,\" said Frederieke van Dongen, the group's humanitarian affairs manager.\n\nIsraeli prisons are 'network of torture' for Palestinians: Human rights group\n\nB'tselem, a major Israeli human rights group, published a report alleging that the Israeli prison system has become a \"network of torture camps\" for Palestinians arrested since Oct. 7.\n\nThe group reported abuse including \"frequent acts of severe, arbitrary violence; sexual assault; humiliation; deliberate starvation and sleep deprivation.\"\n\nThe number of Palestinians in Israeli jails and detention centers stands at 9,623, the rights group said, including, 4,781 held without charge. An estimated 60 Palestinians have died in Israeli custody.\n\nThe Israeli army and government have denied allegations of systematic abuse, and the prisons service said it is are not aware of the claims in the report.\n\nBut, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right minister for national security who is in charge of the prisons service, has long championed the deteriorating conditions in prisons for Palestinian prisoners, who he said are \"terrorists,\" as a matter of policy.\n\n\"Since I assumed the position of Minister of National Security, one of the highest goals I have set for myself is to worsen the conditions of the terrorists in the prisons, and to reduce their rights to the minimum required by law,\" he said in July. \"Everything published about the abominable conditions of these vile murderers in prison was true.\"\n\nIn response to claims of overcrowding, Ben-Gvir has advocated the death penalty as a response.\n\nIsrael, Hezbollah exchange fire, killing at least five in Lebanon and injuring two in Israel\n\nHezbollah fired a barrage of rockets and drones toward northern Israel on Tuesday morning and afternoon, injuring at least two people, after an earlier Israeli airstrike killed at least five people in southern Lebanon, according to authorities on both sides.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group said in separate statements that Tuesday's attacks against Israel -- at least four so far -- were carried out both in support of the Palestinian people in the war-torn Gaza Strip and in response to recent Israeli airstrikes on southern Lebanon.\n\nOne of those drones was intercepted by Israeli air defense and the falling shrapnel injured \"several civilians\" south of Nahariya, the northernmost coastal city of Israel, according to the IDF.\n\nIsrael's Magen David Adam rescue service said its first responders were deployed to the scene and treated a 30-year-old man in serious condition and a 30-year-old woman in mild-to-moderate condition with shrapnel injuries to the lower limbs. Both patients were transported to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya.\n\n\"We saw the male unconscious in the car with a severe head injury from shrapnel. A female who was fully conscious with shrapnel injuries to her lower limbs was in a parking lot nearby,\" paramedic Roi Vishna and senior EMT Noam Levi said in a joint statement released by MDA.\" We treated the male including ventilating him and providing medications, and evacuated him by MICU in very serious condition to hospital. The female casualty was evacuated in mild to moderate condition.\"\n\nHezbollah launched the counterattacks after an Israeli airstrike on the town of Mifdoun in southern Lebanon killed at least five people on Tuesday morning, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health. It was not immediately clear whether civilians were among the casualties.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have exchanged near-daily strikes for the past 10 months amid the ongoing war in Gaza. But regional tensions have soared following last week's assassinations of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran's capital and Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukur in Lebanon's capital.\n\nIsrael kills another Hezbollah commander\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces confirmed on Monday they had killed another Hezbollah commander in a strike on Lebanon. Ali Jamal Aldin Jawad, a commander in Hezbollah's Radwan Force, was killed in the strike.\n\nThe death was also confirmed by Hezbollah.\n\n\"His elimination significantly degrades the capabilities of the Hezbollah terrorist organization to promote and carry out terror activities from southern Lebanon against northern Israel,\" the IDF said.\n\nIsrael's killing of a Hezbollah official in Beirut, Fuad Shukr, and a Hamas official in Iran, Ismail Haniyeh, has pushed the Middle East to the brink of further war.\n\nRemains of about 80 deceased Palestinians returned after being taken by IDF\n\nThe deceased remains of an estimated 80 Palestinians -- which Israeli forces took from Gazan cemeteries to identify whether hostages had been buried there -- were returned by the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nThe bodies were decomposed beyond recognition, with Gazan officials saying between three and four bodies were in each bag. They will be reburied in a mass grave in Khan Younis.\n\nA Gazan civil defense official on the ground said there is no data as to who these individuals were.\n\n\"I wished I could find him, to be at peace,\" Suwa Abu Rajilah, a mother who traveled to the site to see if her son, killed in the war, was there. \"To say I buried him, but I couldn't find him.\"\n\n-ABC News' Dia Ostaz\n\n9 UN employees fired after investigation into ties to Oct. 7 attack\n\nThe U.N. has fired nine employees following a lengthy investigation into ties to the Oct. 7 attacks, the organization said.\n\nThe U.N.'s Office of Internal Oversight Services investigated 19 staff members with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East as part of the probe.\n\nFor nine of the staffers, evidence was found that they \"may have been involved in the armed attacks,\" the U.N. said.\n\n\"The employment of these individuals will be terminated in the interests of the Agency,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\nThere was no evidence or insufficient evidence that the other investigated staffers had been involved, they added.\n\nAt least 7 Hezbollah attacks Monday\n\nIn another active day on the northern Israeli border, Hezbollah launched at least seven attacks on Monday.\n\nThe IDF said they \"successfully intercepted\" the projectiles, and no injuries were reported.\n\nHezbollah claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying in a statement they had launched them \"in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in support of their valiant and honorable resistance.\"\n\nThe IDF also said Monday that they had \"identified a terrorist cell operating a drone in the area of Meiss El Jabal in southern Lebanon.\"\n\n\"Shortly following the identification, the IAF struck and eliminated the terrorists,\" they said.\n\nIsraeli officer and soldier injured in aerial attack from Lebanon: IDF\n\nAn Israel Defense Forces (IDF) officer and a soldier were injured after an aerial attack in northern Israel's upper Galilee region near Ayelet HaShahar early Monday morning local time, the IDF said in a statement.\n\nThe aerial targets crossed from Lebanon, the IDF said.\n\n\"Israel Fire Services are currently operating to extinguish a fire that was ignited in the area as a result of the attack,\" the IDF said.\n\nNetanyahu says Israel will strike wherever necessary\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel is prepared to stand against attacks from Iran and its proxies.\n\n\"Iran and its detractors seek to surround us with a choke ring of terrorism on seven fronts. Their open aggression is insatiable,\" Netanyahu said during a state memorial service commemorating the death of Revisionist Zionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky in 1940.\n\nNetanyahu added, \"We are determined to stand against them on every front, in every arena, far and near. \"\n\nNetanyahu's comments came just days after the assassination in Iran of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. He was killed in an explosion on Wednesday at a guest house in Tehran that he was staying in while attending the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's death.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called for \"revenge\" against Israel.\n\nHaniyeh's assassination followed the death of Mohammed Deif, commander of Hamas' military wing, in a \"precise, targeted strike\" in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis on July 13. Deif was allegedly one of the masterminds of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\n\nIDF officials also announced that they killed top Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in a precision missile strike Tuesday in Beirut, Lebanon. Officials claim he had been orchestrating drone and rocket attacks on northern Israel, including one on July 27 in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights that killed 12 children and teenagers playing soccer.\n\n\"Anyone who murders our citizens, anyone who harms our country, will not be cleared of responsibility,\" Netanyahu said Sunday. \"He will pay a very heavy price. Our long hand strikes in the Gaza Strip, in Yemen, in Beirut, wherever necessary.\"\n\nNetanyahu said Israel's goals are to \"secure our future\" and the ensure that hostages taken by Hamas terrorists during the Oct. 7 attack in Israel are returned home.\n\n\"We will continue to press the pedal,\" Netanyahu said. \"We did not let up from the pressure in all combat areas. We will take an offensive, creative, persistent initiative -- until victory comes.\"", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The warning was conveyed to Tehran straight and thru intermediaries, the newspaper quoted a US official as saying.\n\n\"The USA has clearly communicated to Iran that the chance of a serious escalation within the occasion of a major retaliatory assault in opposition to Israel could be very excessive,\" he stated, with out giving particulars. Israel's safety cupboard met in Tel Aviv on Thursday night time to debate the tense state of affairs. \"There's completely no reliable foundation for Iran to launch a navy assault in opposition to Israel, which it continues to threaten,\" stated a senior US authorities official in Washington. The USA is ready for any eventuality.\n\nUS Protection Secretary Lloyd Austin assured his Israeli counterpart Joav Galant of US assist on the telephone and referred to the deployment of extra navy forces to the area, together with F-22 Raptor fighter jets. They're one in all many measures to stop, shield Israel and shield American forces within the area, Austin wrote on a closed Platform that led to the discharge of the hostages, Austin stated.\n\nThe assertion made by the mediators was indirectly associated to Iran and its threats, the US official stated. But when Iran assaults, there is no such thing as a probability of a ceasefire in Gaza as a result of then they'd be busy with different issues. It's not true that the settlement will probably be able to be signed subsequent Thursday. \"There's nonetheless quite a lot of work to be carried out. However we imagine that what's left right here can actually be bridged and we have now no time to waste,\" stated the federal government official.", "source": {"uri": "newsdirectory3.com", "dataType":

They will be reburied in a mass grave in Khan Younis.\n\nA Gazan civil defense official on the ground said there is no data as to who these individuals were.\n\n\"I wished I could find him, to be at peace,\" Suwa Abu Rajilah, a mother who traveled to the site to see if her son, killed in the war, was there. \"To say I buried him, but I couldn't find him.\"\n\n-ABC News' Dia Ostaz\n\n9 UN employees fired after investigation into ties to Oct. 7 attack\n\nThe U.N. has fired nine employees following a lengthy investigation into ties to the Oct. 7 attacks, the organization said.\n\nThe U.N.'s Office of Internal Oversight Services investigated 19 staff members with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East as part of the probe.\n\nFor nine of the staffers, evidence was found that they \"may have been involved in the armed attacks,\" the U.N. said.\n\n\"The employment of these individuals will be terminated in the interests of the Agency,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\nThere was no evidence or insufficient evidence that the other investigated staffers had been involved, they added.\n\nAt least 7 Hezbollah attacks Monday\n\nIn another active day on the northern Israeli border, Hezbollah launched at least seven attacks on Monday.\n\nThe IDF said they \"successfully intercepted\" the projectiles, and no injuries were reported.\n\nHezbollah claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying in a statement they had launched them \"in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in support of their valiant and honorable resistance.\"\n\nThe IDF also said Monday that they had \"identified a terrorist cell operating a drone in the area of Meiss El Jabal in southern Lebanon.\"\n\n\"Shortly following the identification, the IAF struck and eliminated the terrorists,\" they said.\n\nIsraeli officer and soldier injured in aerial attack from Lebanon: IDF\n\nAn Israel Defense Forces (IDF) officer and a soldier were injured after an aerial attack in northern Israel's upper Galilee region near Ayelet HaShahar early Monday morning local time, the IDF said in a statement.\n\nThe aerial targets crossed from Lebanon, the IDF said.\n\n\"Israel Fire Services are currently operating to extinguish a fire that was ignited in the area as a result of the attack,\" the IDF said.\n\nNetanyahu says Israel will strike wherever necessary\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel is prepared to stand against attacks from Iran and its proxies.\n\n\"Iran and its detractors seek to surround us with a choke ring of terrorism on seven fronts. Their open aggression is insatiable,\" Netanyahu said during a state memorial service commemorating the death of Revisionist Zionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky in 1940.\n\nNetanyahu added, \"We are determined to stand against them on every front, in every arena, far and near. \"\n\nNetanyahu's comments came just days after the assassination in Iran of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. He was killed in an explosion on Wednesday at a guest house in Tehran that he was staying in while attending the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's death.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called for \"revenge\" against Israel.\n\nHaniyeh's assassination followed the death of Mohammed Deif, commander of Hamas' military wing, in a \"precise, targeted strike\" in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis on July 13. Deif was allegedly one of the masterminds of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\n\nIDF officials also announced that they killed top Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in a precision missile strike Tuesday in Beirut, Lebanon. Officials claim he had been orchestrating drone and rocket attacks on northern Israel, including one on July 27 in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights that killed 12 children and teenagers playing soccer.\n\n\"Anyone who murders our citizens, anyone who harms our country, will not be cleared of responsibility,\" Netanyahu said Sunday. \"He will pay a very heavy price. Our long hand strikes in the Gaza Strip, in Yemen, in Beirut, wherever necessary.\"\n\nNetanyahu said Israel's goals are to \"secure our future\" and the ensure that hostages taken by Hamas terrorists during the Oct. 7 attack in Israel are returned home.\n\n\"We will continue to press the pedal,\" Netanyahu said. \"We did not let up from the pressure in all combat areas. We will take an offensive, creative, persistent initiative -- until victory comes.\"", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Thanks so much for joining today's call. As a reminder, this call is on background, attributable to a senior administration official.\n\nOn the call today, for your awareness, not for reporting, we have [senior administration official]. He'll have a few words at the top, and then we'll take a few of your questions.\n\nWith that, [senior administration official], we'll turn it over to you.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Hi, everybody. Thanks for joining. I want to briefly just give some background on the statement that we just released with President Biden, together with his counterparts in Egypt, President el-Sisi, and in Qatar, with the Amir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim.\n\nJust to go through a bit of the tick-tock from the week:\n\nObviously, on Monday, the President spoke with King Abdullah of Jordan and then had a very in-depth discussion, the President and the Vice President, with the national security team and our military team, with Lloyd Austin and General Kurilla calling in from the region, to just review the military deployments to the region in preparation for the potential defense of Israel given a potential attack from Iran or Hezbollah or anyone else.\n\nAnd then on Tuesday, the President had discussions -- and again, in-depth discussions -- with Tamim and with President Sisi. And both of those discussions really delved into the hostage process, because we are the three mediators in this process.\n\nAnd out of that -- out of those calls came that very constructive proposal to issue a joint statement from the leaders. And both Qatar and Egypt believed this would be very useful, as they're working on the Hamas side, and the Israelis were also very receptive to this. And, in fact, I think the Prime Minister's office has already put out a statement welcoming this initiative from the Israel side.\n\nToday, we met with the President in the Oval Office, together with Secretary Austin, again, to just review our military deployments, which are ongoing and quite significant and substantial. And we released a statement here about an hour or so ago, which you've probably seen.\n\nI think, obviously, a statement from three leaders is unusual but it's, we think, significant. These three leaders have been involved in this hostage negotiation, ceasefire agreement negotiation now for some months. And as the statement says, there's a framework agreement that is on the table with, really, the details of implementation that are left to conclude. I think you're all very well familiar with the scope of this agreement, which we've discussed before.\n\nThe statement emphasizes the urgency that there's really no further time to waste or excuses from any party for further delay. And the statement also, I think, significantly says: As mediators, if it's necessary, we're prepared to present, between the three of us, a final bridging proposal to really resolve the remaining implementation issues in the manner that we think would meet the expectations of all the parties and help bring this to a conclusion.\n\nSo, the statement calls on both sides to resume these discussions on Thursday of next week, either in Doha or Cairo, as we work through the week. And I think we'll likely begin preparatory talks to really kind of build up to that probably here fairly soon.\n\nOf course, in the background we are dealing with the broader situation in the region -- as I mentioned, the preparation for defense should an attack come. I think we are -- we've done an awful lot over the last week, which you're probably familiar with, and I know my Pentagon colleagues have been doing briefings on this throughout the week.\n\nSo with that, I'm happy to take any questions. But again, I appreciate taking the time to provide some background on the statement we just issued -- President Biden and together with his counterparts from Egypt and Qatar.\n\nSo, over for questions.\n\nMODERATOR: Thanks, [senior administration official]. Our first question will go to the line of Michael Gordon.\n\nQ Thank you. Have these three parties ever previously presented a bridging proposal, in whole or in part, to advance negotiations? How unusual a step would that be? Has such a proposal already been drafted in anticipation of the difficulties (inaudible)? And at what point will it be presented, given the urgency of moving forward with an Iran attack hovering over all of this?\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, Michael. Good question. I think over the course of this negotiation, on specific issues from time to time we have come up with bridging arrangements, bridging proposals. I think what's left here are really the implementation issues of the deal. It has to do with the sequencing of the exchange and some other issues that are complicated. But we believe there's enough trade space that with a proposal, and I think having a proposal that's unified between the three mediators, can be quite powerful.\n\nSo the statement says, you know, should that be necessary. And we're going to see how the week goes and the days building up to the meeting next week go.\n\nAnd again, I just want to create expectations here. It's not like the agreement is going to be ready to be signed on Thursday. There's still a significant amount of work to do, but we do believe that what's left here really can be bridged, and there's really just no time to lose. And so, that was the initiative from the leaders, and we're going to do all we can to build on it.\n\nMODERATOR: Next up, we'll go to Felicia Schwartz.\n\nQ Thanks. Two from me. Have you heard anything new from Israel in the past few days to suggest that they are willing to be more flexible or actually bring this over the finish line?\n\nAnd then, just secondly, I'm wondering what the gist of the messages you've passed to Iran to avoid a massive retaliation is, and whether you see this statement as giving them some sort of off-ramp.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We've been in fairly in-depth discussions with the Israelis, I think throughout the past week, from the President's call on Thursday to, actually, I just got off the phone with a number of my Israeli counterparts.\n\nAnd again, we do think there's a way forward here. And I would just emphasize it's incumbent upon not just the Israeli side but also the Hamas side. At the end of the day, this is a hostage negotiation. They're holding hostages.\n\nAnd we're going to need some things from the Israelis. We're going to need some things from the Hamas side, through the Qataris and the Egyptians -- it's how this works -- to try to bring this to resolution.\n\nBut we think, you know, the bulk of the work has been done, and the deal is really there. And with some force of will and sitting down to hash it out, we think it is both possible, urgent, necessary, essential -- whatever word you want to use.\n\nSo we are determined to do all that we possibly can, recognizing that lives are on the line. And, you know, this is about getting hostages out. It's also about a ceasefire in Gaza and significant relief to Gazans, everything else that we've talked about throughout these many weeks here.\n\nOn the Iranians, I am not going to talk about our messaging to the Iranians. I'll just say we see there's absolutely no legitimate basis whatsoever for Iran to launch a military attack against Israel, which it continues to threaten. But, you know, we will be prepared for any contingency, and I think we're just continuing to work through that.\n\nBut we have moved an awful lot of military force into the region, including F-22s that arrived today. So, you know, we're going to be ready for all contingencies.\n\nBut I just -- there's been, kind of, a sense out there that somehow, well, Iran now has the right to attack Israel militarily. And we completely reject that logic. I think the consequences of such a direct attack could be quite significant, including for Iran and Iran's economy and everything else, which I know they have a new government they're concerned about.\n\nSo we're doing all we can to deter such an attack, to defeat an attack if it comes, and also to demonstrate to Iran there's a better path forward here than a military attack. So, we'll see. I think they're having their own deliberations. I can't speak for them.\n\nMODERATOR: Next up, we'll go to Barak Ravid.\n\nQ Hi. Thank you. Thank you for doing this. So, you said that the gaps are bridgeable, but at least from everything I know, the gaps are big. I would even say very big. What makes you think that by pushing both sides with this deadline and pushing them into this you can get a deal and not get an explosion?\n\nAnd the second question -- and a second question: What makes you think that Prime Minister Netanyahu -- that just in recent days said again that he will not give up on his new conditions; that he (inaudible) up his previous conditions -- will be ready to make this deal? Thank you.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So, I think -- again, the statement says very clearly: It calls on both sides to resume urgent discussions beginning next week, on Thursday.\n\nAnd as I think I mentioned in the beginning, there will be preparatory work leading to that. But also, it's not like on Thursday we're going to sit in a room and sign the deal. There's work to be done. And both sides have positions on about four or five issues. And actually, both sides have very firm positions. And if you just look at them, they might be unbridgeable, but you treat each issue one by one. And with each one, there's some trade space so you can kind of find a way forward.\n\nWe're fairly confident -- and I base this on our consultations not only with the Israelis, but also the Egyptians and the Qataris -- that there's a way forward here. But also, more importantly, there needs to be a way forward here. We have lives on the line, particularly the hostages, and we have to get these hostages out. And it's time to close this. That is the President's very firm view. He's made that very clear, both to Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, but also to his counterparts in Cairo and Doha, who are either mediators or guarantors on the Hamas side.\n\nSo you're asking a fair question, Barak, but I think we -- you know, we see the importance and the urgency and the possibility. And to get this process back on track was the desire and intent of the leaders in Qatar and Egypt, and it's shared by the President. And so, following up those calls and consultations with the Israelis, we thought this was the time for this initiative, and we look forward to the meetings next week.\n\nMODERATOR: And we're tight on time, so we have time for one more question. And we'll go to the line of Trevor Hunnicutt.\n\nQ Hey. Thanks for doing this. So just to put a finer point on the Iran stuff, has there been any communication from Iran suggesting that it would hold off on retaliating against Israel if this deal is agreed?\n\nAnd is part of the hope here to get Israel to agree to this deal by getting those assurances from Iran? Is that an element of this?\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, this is not -- this statement is not tied to the larger picture and the situation. This is about: We need to get this deal done for all the reasons I've stated. And the call the President had with Sisi and Sheikh Tamim, I think that was the consensus.\n\nIran has stated publicly -- I think their ambassador up in New York has said if there's a ceasefire in Gaza, you know, so that -- if it influences them, that's fine. I would say one thing: If they launch a major war in the Middle East with some massive attack on Israel, which they're threatening in coordination with other groups, well, that's obviously going to significantly jeopardize any hope of getting a ceasefire in Gaza, because we'll very much be focused on other things.\n\nBut, no, this statement that came out tonight came out of the President's consultations with his counterparts. And, you know, we thought the time was right, and we'll be doing a lot of work here between now and Thursday.\n\nAnd then, just to reemphasize the point I made with Barak's question: Thursday is resuming a process with some urgency and with the full input of the mediators from the leader level on down. We're not anticipating the deal being ready to close on Thursday. There's still some -- a lot of work here to be done, but we think getting this moving later next week will be helpful and constructive, and we're going to do all we can as a mediator and a guarantor to try to get this done, just given the urgency and with lives on the line.\n\nMODERATOR: Sorry we couldn't get to everyone's questions, but that's all the time we have. If you have anything further, feel free to reach out to us, and we'll get back to you.\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining. And as a reminder, this call was on background to a senior administration official.

But They Aren't Cost Free", "body": "Last week's assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Hamas Political Bureau, was about as masterful as you can get. While Israel hasn't formally claimed responsibility, the entire operation was in keeping with its modus operandi. The Israelis not only have the capability to execute this kind of strike -- the Mossad is one of the most impressive foreign intelligence services in the world and has a long history of eliminating Israel's enemies regardless of where they reside -- but also the motive. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant have both been vocal since Oct. 7 about taking Hamas' entire leadership off the board. There is \"no difference between a terrorist with a Kalashnikov and a terrorist in a three-piece suit,\" Gallant said back in November.\n\nWhether a bomb was smuggled into Haniyeh's sleeping quarters or a short-range missile killed him is irrelevant. Either way, the top Hamas political official, a man who was under Iran's care and was a dignitary at Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian's inauguration hours earlier, was a calamity for the Iranian security services and just the latest in what has been a long string of Israeli-sponsored assassinations on Iranian soil. More than two dozen senior Iranian intelligence officers and military officials were reportedly arrested after Haniyeh's death, a sign that Tehran's security apparatus is desperate to sniff out potential moles.\n\nBut these types of targeted killing operations must also be looked at strategically. Killing Haniyeh was obviously the priority. But if the killing, however justified on a moral level, leads to unintended consequences or makes accomplishing other goals more difficult, then it's fair game to question whether the operation should have gone ahead. Tactical successes can lead to strategic failures.\n\nThis is not to accuse Netanyahu and his military advisers for making a hasty decision. Faulting Israel for killing Ismail Haniyeh is like faulting the United States for killing Osama Bin Laden or Ayman al-Zawahiri; all of these men are responsible for the deaths of many innocent people. Nobody outside jihadist circles is going to shed a tear for their demise.\n\nBut we shouldn't pretend there aren't costs attached to these precision operations. In Haniyeh's case, those costs could ironically lengthen a war that Netanyahu claims he wants to end.\n\nThe most immediate problem is that removing Haniyeh from the equation further complicates ongoing ceasefire and hostage release talks between Israel and Hamas, which has experienced multiple breakdowns in the months since both sides agreed to a week-long cessation of hostilities in November to exchange hostages and prisoners (the truce eventually fell apart after Israel and Hamas blamed each other for violating the terms). Those talks, which Secretary of State Antony Blinken continues to insist are in their \"final stage,\" are in reality stalled yet again due to the conflicting series of demands that Israel and Hamas have been unable to rectify. According to senior Israeli military and intelligence officials, Netanyahu has added more conditions at the last minute, causing a blowup between Netanyahu's office and the officials actually negotiating on Israel's behalf. Two of those new conditions, per reports, include keeping an Israeli presence along the Egypt-Gaza border to prevent arms smuggling and screening displaced Palestinians who want to return to Gaza's north. Hamas has rejected both requests.\n\nHaniyeh's death, though, adds to the problems. While Haniyeh wasn't calling the shots -- Hamas's leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, holds the power and will determine if Hamas signs a deal or not -- he was a key part of the process, keeping Sinwar in the loop and at times clashing with him about negotiating strategy. Needless to say, killing a top member of the other side's negotiating team isn't exactly a sign of good-faith. That's certainly how Qatar, a key mediator, feels. The Biden administration may not be as strong with its words but there's no question the assassination in Tehran hit the pause button on the diplomatic effort. Asked about it, President Joe Biden said the killing \"doesn't help\" matters. White House officials were angry about Haniyeh's demise, not because he was a good person but because it threw a wrench into things at a highly sensitive moment. The Americans know what they're talking about -- they took a similar gamble during the war in Afghanistan, killing Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour as he was traveling to Pakistan to weaken the insurgency. The result was an operational success with diplomatic consequences, coming about a year after the Afghan government first began meeting discretely with former Taliban officials.\n\nThe next problem is about internal leadership dynamics. With Haniyeh out, Sinwar, a hardliner that makes his predecessors in the movement look soft in comparison, has now consolidated power within the organization. Israel deliberately destroyed a rival power center to Sinwar, a man whose brutality knows no bounds. He got his start tracking down and killing Palestinians suspected of funneling information to Israel. He spent years in the Israeli prison system, where he tried to orchestrate his own release by planning a hostage operation against Israelis. Sinwar was a maximalist in prison exchange negotiations with Israel, asking for too much in exchange for very little. Now, that very same figure is the indisputable head of the organization.\n\nNo policy choice is cost-free. Not even when the benefits are clear.\n\nDaniel R.

For two days, the movement's veteran faces and shadowy figures held meetings in Doha, which has hosted Hamas's political bureau since 2012, to elect a new leader.\n\nThey chose Yahya Sinwar, already the group's leader inside Gaza since 2017. The choice may come as a surprise to many, but anyone following his career since Israel released him in the 2011 exchange deal for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit knew he was always likely to lead Hamas one day.\n\nNo political leader in Hamas has ever been closer to the group's armed wing. His brother Mohammed leads the largest Hamas military battalion, while Mohammed Deif - the elusive Hamas veteran who led its armed wing for two decades until Israel said it killed him last month - was his neighbour, friend, and classmate. The pair grew up together in Gaza's sprawling Khan Younis refugee camp.\n\nDespite all this, many may see appointing him to the most important position in Hamas as madness. Israel's security agencies believe Sinwar planned and executed the attack on southern Israel, and he is top of their wanted list.\n\n\"Not all of the people inside Hamas leadership were in favour of the decision,\" a senior Hamas official told me. \"Some leaders raised their concerns, others pushed for a more moderate person. But in the end he got the majority of the votes.\"\n\nAnother Hamas official who attended the meetings said the movement felt unable to choose the powerful shadow operator Abu Omar Hassan because he had little public profile and was unknown outside the movement, whereas the 7 October attack had given Yahya Sinwar global notoriety.\n\n\"Sinwar has become a trademark after 7 October and he has great popularity in the Arab and Islamic worlds,\" the official said. \"He enjoys close relations with the axis of resistance supported by Iran, and his appointment in the midst of the war sends a message of defiance to Israel.\"\n\nThe \"axis of resistance\" is a network of armed groups backed by Iran.

She also writes at globaltab.net and tweets @AneelaShahzad\n\nGame Theory is widely applied in analysis in geopolitics though it is not the only viable approach. Yet, it has an intriguing call for trying to make sense of strategic interactions between 'rational' decision-makers, their plans, the outcomes, and the possible state of equilibrium.\n\nThe theory, like all theories, aims to simplify the understanding around an event, but like in the case of Hamas and Israel, there is difficulty in recognising each of the elements of the theory. If 'rational' means a player who makes consistent decisions in same set of options, aims to maximise utility, takes only calculated risks and sticks to an optimal equilibrium - perhaps Hamas and Israel are not those type of rational entities, and in the face of repeated games, both do not seek utility nor a compromised equilibrium.\n\nAnalysing the Oct 7 attack by Hamas, we fail to see consistency with past Hamas attacks i.e. killing around 1,140 people and taking 240 captives compared to previous attacks that had barely ever taken Israeli lives. Being completely unprecedented deems the event to be out of the bound of any observable natural law underpinning the rationality of the two actors. In previous events of such nature, for every Israeli life lost the people of Gaza would have repaid with hundreds and thousands, so if Hamas was thinking of maximising utility, it would surely bow down to a compromised status quo.\n\nLooking at 'what' actually happened at the location of the present event, one finds contradicting reports. On the one side, the pro-Israeli media tends to picture an intelligence failure based on Israeli belief that Hamas is no serious threat, and its relying on the rational that Hamas would be a 'rational' player. On the other side, there is an alternative media that is emphasising Israel's complete knowledge of Hamas' preparation and even its plan to attack. Rather The New York Times had reported that Israeli intelligence has obtained Hamas attack plans more than a year ago and named it the 'Jericho Wall'. This year, July, Haaretz revealed how, in 'crazy hysteria', the IDF ordered Hannibal Directive on Oct 7. The concealed directive allows the IDF to even kill soldiers in order to prevent Hamas taking them captive. Photographic evidence reveals extensive bombing in the Kfar-Aza area by the IDF, on Oct 7. Does that mean Israel, knowing way back of Hamas' preparations and training for this event, had preplanned a counter offensive that would increase the number of Israeli casualties and allow Israel to turn a real-event into a false-flag aimed at the complete ethnic cleansing of Gaza?\n\nIf that was Israel's big-game, then what was Hamas' big-game? Surely, Hamas would not have ignited a possibly years-long Israeli intervention inside Gaza that has already taken around 40,000 lives, wounded around 90,000 and brought down its complete infrastructure, just for the sake of it. Or just for the sake of satisfying its unachievable lust of erasing Israel from the regional map.\n\nThis takes us from 'what' to 'why', and forces us to bring more players into the game - Iran and Iranian-backed militias present in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen; Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt, which were being expected to go on the path of normalisation with Israel; and China, which had been behind the historic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Why is it that the rapprochement happened in April, ambassadors were exchanged in September, and Hamas attacked in October? Why is it that right after the attack the Saudis refused to normalise with Israel and revert to the Two-State-Solution. Why has the Arab League readmitted Syria and removed its terrorist-label from Hezbollah?\n\nAnd was all this not exactly Israel's greatest horror all along, its apprehension that it will be the first and foremost victim of Arab unity. The reason why, by policy, Israel and its allies have ensured a divide within the Arab world and between Arab and Persia, playing upon the Shia-Sunni divide. This explains why there was war and upheavals from Afghanistan to Tunisia post-9/11, but nobody touched Iran. Because Iran was the leader of the Shia World, and it's breaking down would dilute away the divide.\n\nBut post-Arab Spring, when signs started appearing that the Saudis are sitting at the negotiating table in Iraq and looking for repairs in the Middle East, the West opted out of the Iran Nuclear Deal in 2018. Since the Nuclear Deal in 2015, Netanyahu has continually called for attacking Iran. In 2020, he said, Iran \"openly seeks to develop nuclear weapons and annihilate the one and only Jewish state\". In 2022, President Joe Biden said he would \"use force\" as last resort to keep Iran from nuclear weapons. So, the game here was to weaken the Arab World in the Arab Spring scenario, and when that's done, turn to Iran.\n\nNow coming to 'how' Hamas was able to attempt Oct 7. How did Hamas get all the weapons and training amid Israeli restrictions and surveillance? How has Hamas neither been affected by Israel's deterrence nor shown any sign of compellance? How does Israel's complete razing of Gaza infrastructure and repeated displacements of the people not forced them to disown Hamas? And how and wherefrom does Hamas get the energy to remain standing and disallowing Israel to announce a victory? Is it only arsenal and ammo, or are there some other elements at play here, elements that emerge from human nature, elements that are utterly unpredictable and seemingly irrational?\n\nPerhaps a reevaluation of what the game really is, is needed. Perhaps the game is not the genocidal eviction of the people of Gaza. Perhaps it is not about Israel and Palestine. Perhaps Hamas and Israel are playing a bigger game - a game that does not seek equilibrium, but a resetting of the rules of the game! And in that pursuit, Israel's present game seems to be to spill the war all over the Muslim World, and create a WWIII-scenario, whereas Hamas' game may be to constantly return the war towards the Gaza-Israel dip, wherein it deems to sinkhole Israel.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

by the Palestinian resistance group, Hamas.\n\nThe assault has sparked increased regional tensions, with the latest escalation occurring last Wednesday when Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran, one day after an Israeli strike in a suburb of Beirut killed a senior military commander from the Lebanese group, Hezbollah.\n\nReiterating that the US does not want to see the conflict escalate, Kirby said Washington has transferred \"significant capabilities\" to the region and will defend Israel if it is attacked.\n\n\"If Iran moves forward, as they have repeatedly said that 'they're going to', we're going to make sure we're ready to defend Israel on our own interests, and we believe that the force posture adjustments ordered by the president and directed by the secretary of defense (Lloyd Austin) put us in a good position to do that,\" Kirby said.\n\nThe Pentagon announced on Friday that the US will deploy additional military assets to the

In one day, nearly 1200 Israeli civilians and military personnel were brutally murdered by the Hamas terrorists. They burned babies in ovens, raped women and took about 250 hostages, among them were Holocaust survivors. This demanded a response -- a response to free the hostages, to avenge the dead and to eliminate the maniacal ideology which led to this unmatched brutality. Hamas is part of the network of totalitarian organisations like Al Qaeda and ISIS which aim to bring the whole world under the flag of their interpretation of Islam. So let me make it clear at the outset that Israel is fighting a war on behalf of the free and democratic world. The civil movements which support Hamas's right to rule Gaza are in a way negating their own right to live in a pluralistic society. The call \"from the river to the Sea\" in reality aims to annihilate the state of Israel.\n\nIsrael wants peace in the region. We withdrew from Gaza in 2005 in the hope that the Palestinians could contrive a working and responsible state. They however elected Hamas to power, which refuses to recognise the state of Israel or abide by the peace treaties signed by Palestinians in the past. In 2007, Hamas seized power of Gaza in a violent coup. Over the past 17 years, it siphoned off billions of dollars of aid and used it for building hundreds of kilometers of underground tunnels, procure arms and firing rockets indiscriminately against Israel. For years, we allowed thousands of people in Gaza to work in Israel hoping that the economic incentive will work as a deterrent. However, what happened on 7th October 2023 has shattered our belief that you can buy peace with terror.\n\nIt's now been over 300 days since this war began. So where do we stand? Gaza at this point is more or less totally under Israeli control. A large number of Hamas fighters have been eliminated by Israel. Hamas uses civilian infrastructure like schools and hospitals for storing rockets and ammunition. That Hamas, an ostensibly pro-Palestinian force is using civilians in Gaza as human shields is perhaps the most telling example of how terror outfits operate only for their own gains, paying no heed to the suffering of those they claim to be fighting for. Hamas's aforementioned use of civilians as human shields as also its refusal to return the hostages constitutes as grave a violation of international law, human rights and basic human sensibilities as one can imagine.\n\nWhile one is accustomed to apologia for such actions emanating from terror organisations and their benefactors, it's usually assumed that international bodies, especially the UN, would conduct themselves in ways befitting the high offices they occupy. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. If it wasn't enough that the UNRWA facilities themselves were being abused to further the goals of Hamas, one now sees nothing less than the Secretary General's office itself engaging in \"providing context\" to the unequivocally condemnable actions of Oct 7th. The penchant of the UN as also of the ICJ, ICC and other international bodies to repeatedly disregard Hamas's use of human shields and equating the atrocities committed by leaders of terror outfits with the legitimate response to such attacks headed by democratically elected government of a sovereign state only serves to further weaken the credibility that such bodies enjoy.\n\nIsrael has always strived to live in peace with its neighbours. In the past, we have made peace with Egypt and Jordan. In the recent past, Israel established full diplomatic relations with UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and South Sudan. We are working closely with the moderate Arab countries on platforms like I2U2 and IMEC. However, the Oct 7 attacks taught us that regional peace and stability will remain a distant dream unless we end the Hamas rule in Gaza and dismantle the Iranian terror network in the region. Israel is fighting a seven-front war. It doesn't want to escalate the situation but is well prepared to defend its borders and people. Any long-term peace in the region requires decimation of Hamas, demilitarisation of Gaza strip and rebuilding with the help of countries that have friendly relations with Israel and deradicalisation of the people.\n\nIn such tribulating times, it's the outpouring of support from sensible and empathetic people all over the world that has worked as a moral force for Israel to continue its efforts towards ending this ideology of hate and terror and battling the rise of anti-Semitism globally. The unequivocal support from our Indian friends is overwhelming and heartening. India, being a victim of cross border terrorism has shown great understanding of Israel's predicaments. We, the Jewish people, have a long memory and never forget the people and countries which support us during difficult times.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title":

This gathering comes on the heels of nearly a year of intense conflict between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.\n\nDelegates representing various factions arrived from across the Middle East, many still reeling from the recent assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the group's former leader, who was killed in an explosion in Tehran, purportedly orchestrated by Israeli forces.\n\nHaniyeh had been instrumental in navigating the dual pressures of the militant wing's aggressive stance toward Israel and the calls for negotiated peace. His sudden death created an urgent need for a swift replacement.\n\nA memorial service in Doha drew hundreds of attendees who gathered to honor Haniyeh's legacy. The atmosphere was somber, signifying the conclusion of one chapter for Hamas and the potential rise of a more radical direction.\n\nThis event served as a reminder of past leadership transitions within the organization, notably following the assassination of its founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, in 2004. The weight of recent events has underscored the challenges facing Hamas in light of ongoing crises.\n\nAs discussions continued behind the scenes, it became apparent that the leadership was grappling with internal dissent and external pressures. Following the mourning ceremony, meetings commenced to choose a successor.\n\nEventually, Yahya Sinwar was elected as the new overall leader. Having held the leadership role in Gaza since 2017, Sinwar's ascension was both anticipated and contentious. His close ties to the organization's armed wing and the recent notoriety gained from the October 7 attacks in southern Israel played significant roles in his election.\n\nSinwar's family connections add another layer to his leadership. His brother commands a prominent military battalion, while his long-standing relationship with key military figures has positioned him as a significant player within Hamas.\n\nDespite the trepidation among some Hamas leaders regarding Sinwar's elevation due to his controversial image, he prevailed in securing the necessary votes. Concerns about moderation within the leadership were overshadowed by Sinwar's rising profile in the wake of the October attacks, which saw approximately 1,200 fatalities in Israel.\n\nA Hamas official noted, \"We want to honor him for masterminding the attacks; October 7th belongs to him.\" This sentiment highlights the complex interplay between military success and political strategy within the organization.\n\nThe appointment of Sinwar carries significant implications for Hamas, particularly amid ongoing hostilities. Regional mediators are reportedly working on a ceasefire proposal that aims to stabilize the situation in the region following the turmoil of recent months.\n\nHowever, as tensions remain high, the path ahead for Sinwar and Hamas is laden with uncertainty, especially considering the deep scars left by conflict and the mounting pressure from both internal factions and external actors.\n\nIn conclusion, as Yahya Sinwar takes the helm of Hamas, the organization is poised at a critical juncture that may redefine its approach and influence in the Middle East for years to come.", "source": {"uri": "theglobalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Global Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Yassin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ahmed Yassin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802851", "eventUri": "eng-9802851", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 1714, "textEnd": 1723, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

Who doesn't want peace, justice and reconciliation?\n\nPatriarch Theophilos said, \"What is going on is really very dangerous not only for our region and the Holy Land but for the whole world, and it is our moral obligation as spiritual leaders to promote and serve the values of the gospel.\"\n\nThe pastoral solidarity visit takes place against the backdrop of a situation of prolonged war and dire humanitarian need, with an aim to \"amplify calls from the Holy Land to engage in meaningful dialogue aimed at restoring peace and stability\" -- not least in view of the evident risk of war escalating and spreading through the region and beyond.\n\nSo, who is prolonging the war? Who poses the real danger? Israel or Iran? It is certainly not Israel and PM Netanyahu has said that once the hostages are released and Hamas surrenders, peace is indeed possible. Hamas has no intention of doing so. Apparently that word--peace--has not reached the tunnel where the new Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is hiding.\n\nIf the Patriarch wants stability, then Hamas should close the tunnels, use whatever funds they have left and build a new Gaza society based on democracy, equity, and justice...and agree to live peacefully alongside Israel. They have made it abundantly clear that they have no intention of doing that. From the river to the sea does not include any Jews. Really!\n\nThink about it. Since its establishment in 1948, the state of Israel has had Jews living alongside their Arab neighbors, with two million Arabs being full citizens of Israel in Israel proper. But Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank say that Jews will not be permitted to live alongside them. Who, then, really wants peace? Who wants a two-state solution? Not Palestinian leaders. And tragically, according to recent Palestinian polls, neither do the majority of Palestinians.\n\nWCC moderator Bishop Dr Heinrich Bedford-Strohm proclaimed, \"What we want to do is to really listen to what you have to say; we want to be a loudspeaker into the world, of the stories we are hearing.\"\n\nDo those stories, presumably coming from Christians and Muslims under fire from IDF forces trying to dislodge terrorist fighters, also include Jewish fathers, sons, mothers, and daughters held captive underground by Hamas terrorists or is their story only of interest to Jews in Israel and the diaspora?\n\n\"Please know that we are thinking of you, every day, deep in our hearts. And we will try not only to understand what is happening, but to engage in dialogue with others, for peace and justice,\" Bedford-Strohm said.\n\nDialogue, one of the most overused words in the English dictionary, has produced nothing.\n\nWCC general secretary Rev. Prof. Dr Jerry Pillay said, \"We will continue to work for ceasefire and an end to the war. We will continue to look at the humanitarian situation, both in terms of access and aid. And we will continue to look at the question of what happens after the war. We need to put together roadmaps as to how we as churches and other faith communities can work together to build peace long-term,\" Pillay said.\n\nA ceasefire only prolongs the war. Hamas has no interest in a ceasefire unless it benefits them and Gaza. Rocket attacks will heat up again. They have made it abundantly clear they reject a two-state solution. They only want one state - Palestine - with no Jews extant. A ceasefire is a no win for Israel and Netanyahu has made that abundantly clear.\n\nNetanyahu accused Hamas of smearing Israel in the media so that Israel would be \"pressured to end the war before it's won,\" he said to Congress. Speaking to receptive lawmakers, Netanyahu made clear: \"I want to assure you, no matter what pressure is brought to bear, I will never allow that to happen.\"\n\nMessage received. What don't these Christian peacemakers not get? \"Peace, peace where there is no peace,\" cried Jeremiah. A peace they want is the capitulation of Israel to a future that does not include them. Who would bargain their future away for that?\n\nDr. Michel Abs, Middle East Council of Churches general secretary said, \"We should make our voices heard. The sound of bombs is not stronger than the sound of hearts, of love.\"\n\nAnd Hamas is showing so much love that they are using hostages as bargaining chips in a long-term game of chess they hope to win.\n\nHe added: \"We should remind those occupying the land of others, destroying their houses and aggressing and humiliating them on daily basis, to leave room for reconciliation and love in the future.\"\n\nIsrael has always owned the land. They have been there for over 3,000 years, long before Islam even existed! Islam came into existence in 622 when Muhammad migrated to Medina. The Land of Israel, which God told Abraham and Jeremiah he was giving to Abraham's descendants forever (Genesis 17.8; Jer 31.36), was the place where Jewish identity was formed. In 1407 BC Joshua took Israel across the Jordan River. This took place 40 years after the exodus from Egypt.\n\nOf course, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby had to weigh in with a statement declaring that the State of Israel has been \"denying the Palestinian people dignity, freedom and hope\" -- and that ending its occupation of Palestinian territory is \"a legal and moral necessity.\"\n\nThis is sweet music to Palestinian ears especially to the Palestinian Authority and Iran, but it bears no reality to what is going on, on the ground. Israel is now fighting on seven fronts for its very survival: Gaza, Lebanon, West Bank, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Iran. It is not only Hamas, but Hezbollah and the Houthis aided and abetted by Iran, the \"axis of evil\" that is pushing and manipulating everything from behind. Not to mention the other Iran proxies in Iraq, Syria, and the west Bank.\n\nYou can read my earlier piece on Welby and the history of Israel here:

Previous talks between Hamas and Al-Fatah have been about the holding of fresh elections (the last were in 2006, and both the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Hamas, cannot claim that their mandates are particularly recent.)\n\nIt should be noted that this massacre by Israel is something the Netanyahu government seems committed to, even as it embarrasses Israel's supporters the world over. The first thing that the war does is keep Netanyahu in office, and thus helps block his ongoing prosecution for corruption,\n\nThe USA was motivated to sign off on a move meant primarily to save a sleazebag from his just, deserts because Haniyeh was supporting something, the Beijing Declaration, which it wanted, but which it did not want Beijing to deliver. The USA is as concerned as anyone about the shape of apost-invasion Gaza, and it would like it to be governed by the Palestinian Authority which governs the West Bank with the Hamas ousted.\n\nOne requirement would be an agreement among Palestinian groups to work together for that goal. However, China managing that reconciliation means it is doing what the USA could not do. There are two reasons why this is particularly galling for the USA. First, there is its antipathy to China because of their global rivalry. Then there is its intervention in the Middle East, an area in which it has recently begun to take an interest, with a major recent success being its successful mediation between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nChina is interested in the Middle East for the same reason the USA is, oil. However, the USA has made Israel the cornerpiece of its strategy, but China is not committed to it. China is bumping up against the USA of late, one important example being its taking the side of the USSR in its invasion of Ukraine. Its being aligned with the USSR and the Central Asian Republics makes a certain sense because of its One Belt One Road initiative, and the New Silk Road plan.\n\nHowever, central to its vision is a guaranteed source of oil from Saudi Arabia as well as Iran. It does not want to end up like Russia if the Taiwan situation leaves it facing US sanctions. Its access to Middle East oil dovetails with its need to secure the Indian Ocean and China Sea routes which allow it access. That is what makes CPEC so important: then the oil only needs to get to Gwadar before landing onto a secure route to China.\n\nSurprisingly, India is also involved in the matter. It has begun to function as the USA's main catspaw in the region, and particularly against China. At the same time, India is also deeply interested in the Middle East, primarily because of the oil there. It must be remembered that for the first time, a power, perhaps even a superpower, is getting involved in the Middle East which does not have a significant Jewish population. The USSR was generally opposed to Israel because of its own direct ties to the Palestine Liberation Organization and to the Arab states like Egypt and Syria. (Even now, the only naval base of Russia outside its territory is in Syria.)\n\nIndia has a historic link to the Palestinian cause, but the link between the PLO and the Congress Party has been reversed under the BJP. which initiated relations with Israel when Morarji Desai was PM and had Atal Bihari Vajpayee as his Foreign Minister. India and Israel realised that they both had to deal with a large an intractable Muslim minority, and it is to be noticed that they have been following essentially the same policy in dealing with them. India in particular has shown in Indian Occupied Kashmir that it has been an apt pupil of Israel, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\n\nOne of the responses has been the election of Yahya Shinwar as Haniyeh's successor as Chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau. Shinwar is the same age as Haniyeh, and like him is a product of the Gaza refugee camps. Their families became refugees after fleeing from the same town, Ashkelon, in what is now Israel. Both he and Haniyeh took degrees in Arabic literature from the Gaza Islamic University, and both had been jailed by the Israelis, Haniyeh thrice for short periods, Shinwar for v22 years between 1989 and 2011, until he was released in a prisoner exchange. He was presently headed of Hamas in Gaza, and is said to be responsible for the October 7 attacks which have provoked Israel into its 'final solution\n\nShinwar has been described by Israel as a 'dead man walking', and it is possible that Israel will have him assassinated. It has already had Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, the founder of Hamas, assassinated. Sh Yassin was a paraplegic, left paralyzed from neck down after a boyhood wrestling accident. He was from Aske; on originally, like Haniyeh's and Shinwar's families.\n\nThe lessons from the assassinations are that even Tehran is not safe. It may be noted that while Haniyeh was in Qatar, where he had been since 2017, he was safe. Qatar is not just a player in the oil world, but is one of the biggest holders of gas in the world.\n\nTehran should be really concerned. That a hostile agency, presumably Mossad, could put together an operation against someone who was a visitor (Haniyeh was in Tehran only for new President Msoud Pezeshkian), would not encourage visitors to Tehran. Would Netanyahu have gone on his recent Washington sojourn if his tea, had suspected that he could be picked off? More significantly, it would indicate that prominent Iranian figures, including Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Pezeshkian, are at risk. Mossad has a history of targeting Iranian nuclear acientists, and it is possible that when the Iranian nuclear programme reaches a certain stage, Mossad may strike at decision-makers rather than scientists. Haniyeh's killing showed the decision might not be changed, but some delay has been imposed.\n\nIsrael's intentions i Gaza seems murky, perhaps because because Israel might have realized that it hasno clear war aims. Actually, by engaging in an attack itself without clear aims, Hamas imposed this lack of clarity on Israel. Hamas seems to have had a motive rather than an aim, that of making the Palestinian cause once again prominent, from the hijackings of the early 1970s, and the 1872 Munich Olympics massacre, to the 1990s India when Haniyeh and Shinwar cut their teeth.\n\nIsrael no longer appears in control of events. It has faced unprecedented criticism for its tactics, including from the International Court of Justice. It does have the backing of the USA, with the current Administration vying with Congress to prove a greater degree of support for Israel. Haniyeh's assassination may be a further stage in Israel's deline. It certainly didn't bring a victory of any kind any closer.", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "pakistantoday.com.pk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The world is horrified by the devastation of Gaza and its people, condemning Israel's actions. Yet, some Western governments continue to support Israel's actions despite clear violations of international human rights and humanitarian laws. They provide Israel with unwavering support across diplomatic, military, economic, and technological fields, reinforcing the IDF's combat capabilities. Global protests and public outrage in support of the Palestinians have thus far been in vain. However, the tide appears to be turning against Israel's aggressive pursuit of its security and foreign policy objectives, leaving it increasingly isolated on the world stage, despite U.S. efforts to coerce \"errant\" nations into compliance.\n\nDespite this, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu feels no compunction in expanding the scope and zone of conflict. He escalated tensions further with the alleged assassinations of Fuad Shukr, a Hezbollah military leader in Lebanon, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' lead negotiator for peace, who was visiting Tehran. These well-planned operations were calculated to further destabilise the region, prolong the conflict, provoke a military response from Iran and its proxies, and draw the U.S.-led West deeper into the conflict, regardless of the ongoing war in Ukraine and tensions in the South China Sea. The U.S.-led West and the Middle East peace process appear to have been dealt a diabolical fait accompli simultaneously.\n\nThe current conflict began with the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. Israel lost approximately 1,200 lives, with up to 250 taken as hostages by Hamas. What compelled Hamas to act? The primary reason seems to be the gradual but noticeable spread of the U.S.-sponsored Abraham Accords. Several Muslim African and Arab states had already established diplomatic relations with Israel. The Arab world was ominously leaning towards Israel, seemingly ready to abandon the Palestinian cause altogether. (The Masjid Al-Aqsa, Islam's first Qibla, often gets lost in the larger Palestinian struggle). An imminent rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia would have been the final blow to the Palestinian cause. Hamas may have felt compelled to pre-empt this and secure what it perceived to be in Palestine's vital national interest. With this attack, they successfully sabotaged the Abraham Accords, brought the Palestinian issue back into the global spotlight, and inflicted significant losses on Israel, particularly to its sense of security, invincibility, and arrogance.\n\nFrom January to October 2023, protests erupted across Israel against Netanyahu's attempts to legislate sweeping judicial reforms that would give the government decisive control over the Supreme Court. These efforts, coupled with the October 7 Hamas attacks, further dented Netanyahu's popularity. It was one of Israel's worst intelligence and military failures since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Yet, Netanyahu shows no inclination to seek a genuine cessation of hostilities and peace. He has multiple incentives to continue the conflict, having served as Prime Minister for about 16 years and seeking to remain in power. Furthermore, he is on trial for corruption and is safe from prison as long as he remains in office. This security hinges on the support of his extreme right-wing coalition allies, who strongly oppose a ceasefire with Hamas. Therefore, Netanyahu's government is prolonging the negotiations and attempting to escalate the Gaza conflict into a regional or even extra-regional war. He is also under unrelenting pressure from the Israeli public, who are calling for his resignation, early elections, a ceasefire with Hamas, and the prompt return of all hostages.\n\nIran, however, has vowed retribution for Ismail Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran, promising revenge at a time, place, and manner of their choosing. This has placed the Middle East on edge. The shadows of war loom large, and forces are being marshalled, concentrated, assembled, and deployed. Israel and its allies are preparing for all possible scenarios. The U.S. has predictably moved its aircraft carrier group into the eastern Mediterranean, and top U.S. and UK military leaders have visited Israel to coordinate military, logistical, intelligence, and operational support.\n\nThe most critical intelligence at this moment is understanding the real and final intent and plans of the Iranian government, its military (IRGC), and the roles of its proxies, including various Shiite militias in the region. Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions are ongoing around the clock. Aerial, electronic, and human intelligence resources, along with satellites, aerial platforms like aircraft and drones, and sleeper cells within Iran, have all been activated. Friendly intelligence agencies are also contributing their information. All efforts are focused on uncovering the time, place, and method of Iran's response, to either pre-empt or defeat it.\n\nIntelligence and operational activities are thus in full swing across the Middle East in anticipation of war. The question remains: will it be a limited conflict, or will it escalate into a regional or even extra-regional war?\n\nImran Malik\n\nThe writer is a retired brigadier of the Pakistan Army.

The group's emphasis on armed resistance over diplomacy has only exacerbated tensions and suffering, leaving ordinary Gazans caught in the crossfire.\n\nBut at the end of the day, you, again like me, have to admit this: what Israel is doing in Gaza in the name of 'self-defence' is both outrageous and disproportionate. Israel's military response, characterised by relentless bombings and a crippling blockade, inflicts untold suffering on the civilian population. Entire neighbourhoods in Gaza have been reduced to rubble, infrastructure obliterated, and basic human necessities like water, electricity, and medical supplies have become luxuries.

Iran tells Macron Israel must back Gaza truce to ease tensions Sad for Palestinians\n\nA report issued as far back as February by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, known as the Annual Assessment of the US Intelligence Community, expressed doubts about Israel's ability to fully destroy Palestinian resistance.\n\nIn it we read: \"Israel will probably face lingering armed resistance from Hamas for years to come, and the military will struggle to neutralise [Hamas's] underground infrastructure, which will allow insurgents to hide, regain strength and surprise Israeli forces\" -- an assessment that recalls the observation made by French president Emanuel Macron, also early on in the conflict, when he opined at a press conference in December, held on the sidelines of the UN's COP28 climate talks in Dubai, that achieving \"the total destruction of the Palestinian group \" would mean \"the war will last ten years\".\n\nThen on April 22, the New York Times quoted Douglas London, a retired CIA officer who reportedly spent 34 years at the agency, as saying: \"Palestinian resistance to Israel ... is an idea as much as it is a physical, tangible group of people. For as much damage as Israel might have inflicted on Hamas, it still has capability, resilience, funding and a long line of people most likely waiting to sign up and join after all the fighting and all the destruction and all the loss of life\".\n\nAnd finally, on June 20, Israel Defense Forces spokesman, Admiral Daniel Hagari, was quoted by reporters virtually repeating London's observation. \"The business of destroying Hamas, making Hamas disappear, it's simply throwing sand in the eyes of the public\", he said. \"Anyone who thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong\".\n\nHowever what makes this moment sad for Palestinians is that they have today no political leaders worthy of the name who are out there speaking for them on the world stage and, more importantly, helping them survive the strain of going through a traumatic period with no parallel in their modern history, save perhaps for the period when those catastrophic events, known collectively in Palestinian vernacular as the Nakba, took place in 1948.\n\nBut then who said that the struggle for freedom by a disenfranchised people like the Palestinians -- a people with few resources at their command, armed only with their moral claim to being the injured party in the dispute -- is not always akin to pushing a big rock up a steep hill?\n\n-- Fawaz Turki is a noted academic, journalist and author based in Washington DC.

You gain access by sounding like a propagandist.\n\nSimona Foltyn: A show of defiance in the Lebanese city of Sour, after Israel's killing in Tehran of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nRafat Morra, Hamas Official (through interpreter): The resistance remains strong and will continue. This resistance will continue until the removal of this Israeli occupation and the complete defeat of the occupation from the entire Palestinian national territory.\n\nFoltyn: Rallies in support of Hamas have been taking place throughout Southern Lebanon since the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The message is that his demise will not weaken Hamas, nor will it lessen its struggle for Palestinian liberation, a liberation these men and women have awaited for decades....\n\nFolytn committed an ideologically corrupted definition of the word \"refugee,\" one that only seems to apply to Palestinians. She referred to a 22-year-old woman as a refugee, though she was in fact merely a \"descendant of Palestinians expelled in 1948, when Israel was created\" and had \"never set foot in Palestinian land.\" That's not a refugee.\n\nThe woman lauded the assassinated terrorist leader: \"Since our childhood, Haniyeh has influenced us a lot. All our leaders, not just Haniyeh, have taught us that we should hold on to the resistance, no matter what the enemy does.\" It continued:\n\nFoltyn: Hamas' October 7 attack on Southern Israel was denounced as terrorism by the United States and other Western nations. But, here, it sparked a different sentiment, something Palestinians hadn't felt in decades, hope.\n\nShe met up with an anonymized Hamas fighter and used the same \"resistance\" terminology the Hamas terrorists used.\n\nFoltyn: Do you think that, since October 7, there is greater support for armed resistance?\n\nHamas fighter (through interpreter): Yes. Of course there was support before, but not as much as we are seeing now. There was a general mobilization a month after the events of October 7. Pretty much all the youth in this camp signed up to join Hamas.\n\nFoltyn, who worked for the virulently anti-Israel outlet Arab news network Al-Jazeera English from 2019 to 2021 (on the Iraq beat), continued the disgusting moral equivalence, equating the psychotic Jewish killers of Hamas as \"resistance\" to the \"Zionist entity.\"\n\nFoltyn: Rising support for the resistance is visible in plain sight. The camp is run by Fatah, which was co-founded by Yasser Arafat and has led the Palestinian Authority since its creation. But Hamas has been gaining ground here, chipping away at Fatah's status as the guardian of the Palestinian cause....\n\nShe quoted Munir Maqdah, a leader of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a branch of Fatah founded during the second Palestinian \"uprising\" (i.e. Israel-targeted terrorist wave) of the early 2000s.\n\nFoltyn: Words that are finding fertile ground among disenfranchised Palestinian youth. But mobilization inside the camp is a delicate matter. It risks drawing Israeli airstrikes and alienating the Lebanese government, which sees it as a violation of its sovereignty. To get a glimpse into the secretive recruitment process, I visit a mosque in a neighborhood that is a Hamas stronghold. Hassan Shanaa, a local Hamas official, tells me that hundreds of young men have approached him since October ready to take up arms against Israel, what they call the Zionist entity.\n\nFoltyn did make one admission -- Hamas is \"an Islamist movement\" unlike its more secular rivals Fatah -- before concluding:\n\nFoltyn: Hamas is trying to capitalize on the youth's newfound zeal to obtain with force what hasn't been achieved with words...\n\nThis segment giving the Hamas perspective was brought to you in part by Raymond James.\n\nA transcript is available:\n\nPBS News Hour\n\n8/5/24\n\n7:42:40 p.m. (ET)\n\nAmna Nawaz: The killing of a top Hamas leader last week shook a Middle East already scarred by a war that the militant group launched last October 7. The past 10 bloody months have also galvanized Palestinian populations beyond Gaza and the West Bank, especially in Lebanon. Factions of Hamas have also made it home. And special correspondent Simona Foltyn recently gained rare access to its operations there for this report.\n\nSimona Foltyn: A show of defiance in the Lebanese city of Sour after Israel's killing in Tehran of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nRafat Morra, Hamas Official (through interpreter): The resistance remains strong and will continue. This resistance will continue until the removal of this Israeli occupation and the complete defeat of the occupation from the entire Palestinian national territory.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Rallies in support of Hamas have been taking place throughout Southern Lebanon since the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The message is that his demise will not weaken Hamas, nor will it lessen its struggle for Palestinian liberation, a liberation these men and women have awaited for decades.\n\nThey are refugees, descendants of Palestinians expelled in 1948, when Israel was created. Rayyan is 22 years old. She never set foot on Palestinian land, but is no less attached to the cause.\n\nRayyan Hafiyan, Palestinian Refugee (through interpreter): Since our childhood, Haniyeh has influenced us a lot. All our leaders, not just Haniyeh, have taught us that we should hold on to the resistance, no matter what the enemy does.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Hamas' October 7 attack on Southern Israel was denounced as terrorism by the United States and other Western nations. But, here, it sparked a different sentiment, something Palestinians hadn't felt in decades, hope.\n\nRayyan Hafiyan (through interpreter): From when I was little, we have had the hope of returning and living in our homeland. And, God willing, this day will come.\n\nSimona Foltyn: I want to know if this is a broader trend among the Palestinian diaspora in Lebanon and travel to Saida, home to the largest Palestinian refugee camp. Past the checkpoint of the Lebanese army, it feels as if we've crossed into another country.\n\nThe camp is called Ain al-Helweh. Around 120,000 people live here in perpetual exile, crammed into less than half-a-square-mile, a pressure cooker with poor services, few jobs, and no prospects.\n\nNow that frustration has found an outlet. I'm meeting a Hamas fighter who requested anonymity because he spoke outside the chain of command.\n\nDo you think that, since October 7, there is greater support for armed resistance?\n\nHamas fighter (through interpreter): Yes. Of course there was support before, but not as much as we are seeing now. There was a general mobilization a month after the events of October 7. Pretty much all the youth in this camp signed up to join Hamas.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Rising support for the resistance is visible in plain sight. The camp is run by Fatah, which was co-founded by Yasser Arafat and has led the Palestinian Authority since its creation.\n\nBut Hamas has been gaining ground here, chipping away at Fatah's status as the guardian of the Palestinian cause, its green colors gradually usurping Fatah's yellow. The green flag of Hamas and other symbols like these posters of its military spokesperson Abu Obaida, have spread throughout the camp since October 7, signaling growing support for armed resistance, even in areas that were not traditionally dominated by Hamas.\n\nFatah has been losing legitimacy for years now amid accusations of rampant corruption and its failure to achieve Palestinian statehood in the wake of the 1993 Oslo Accords, as part of which it renounced violence in return for recognition and the nominal authority to govern.\n\nBut some within Fatah never laid down arms, like Munir Maqdah, the most senior Fatah military official in the camp.\n\nMunir Maqdah, Fatah Military Commander (through interpreter): We participate in daily military action inside the West Bank in the face of Israeli occupation.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Maqdah is a leader in the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a branch of Fatah founded during the second Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s. He points to Israel's continued occupation and settlement of Palestinian land in the West Bank as evidence that the Oslo Accords have failed.\n\nMunir Maqdah (through interpreter): Negotiations have been tried for 30 years and will not give the Palestinian people anything. The Palestinian people have no choice but to take their rights by force and blood. Today, it's blood for blood until we get rid of this occupation in the land of Palestine.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Words that are finding fertile ground among disenfranchised Palestinian youth. But mobilization inside the camp is a delicate matter. It risks drawing Israeli airstrikes and alienating the Lebanese government, which sees it as a violation of its sovereignty.\n\nTo get a glimpse into the secretive recruitment process, I visit a mosque in a neighborhood that is a Hamas stronghold. Hassan Shanaa, a local Hamas official, tells me that hundreds of young men have approached him since October ready to take up arms against Israel, what they call the Zionist entity.\n\nHassan Shanaa, Hamas Official (through interpreter): There is a large number of young people who want to join the movement to fight, not to enter the movement and go through the recruitment process. No, they wanted us to give them weapons and go to Palestine through Southern Lebanon, so they can fight the Zionist entity.\n\nSimona Foltyn: The selection process can span years, with new recruits vetted at multiple stages. Religious instruction is at the very core of joining Hamas, which, unlike the more secular Fatah, is an Islamist movement.\n\nHassan Shanaa (through interpreter): First of all, he has to be committed and pray and take lessons with us. If his foundations and goals are where they should be, he will go out to the second stage and maybe take a special lesson.\n\nSimona Foltyn: The next stage is military training, which is where it gets more complicated. Hamas doesn't enjoy Fatah's status as the security provider in the camps, and isn't officially allowed to maintain an armed presence inside Lebanon.\n\nBut I met one new joiner who took part in covert training exercises, which take place in coordination with Hamas ally Lebanese paramilitary group Hezbollah.\n\nHamas recruit (through interpreter): They teach us about weapons, how to take them apart and put them together, about bombs, these kinds of things.\n\nSimona Foltyn: And this training is inside the camp or outside?\n\nHamas recruit (through interpreter): No, we go out and come back. I went out two, three times and came back.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Have a lot of your friends joined Hamas?\n\nHamas recruit (through interpreter): There are many, a lot. All were encouraged after October 7.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Hamas is trying to capitalize on the youth's newfound zeal to obtain with force what hasn't been achieved with words. For Hassan Shanaa, the death and destruction in Gaza are a price worth paying.\n\nHassan Shanaa (through interpreter): The Zionist entity and the American administration were betting that adults here would die and children would forget. We say to the whole world, despite the tragedy, the massacres, the killing and the destruction, there's no alternative homeland to Palestine except Palestine.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Haniyeh's assassination has for now dashed hopes for a cease-fire. Many here see armed struggle as the only way forward.

You gain access by sounding like a propagandist.\n\nSimona Foltyn: A show of defiance in the Lebanese city of Sour, after Israel's killing in Tehran of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nRafat Morra, Hamas Official (through interpreter): The resistance remains strong and will continue. This resistance will continue until the removal of this Israeli occupation and the complete defeat of the occupation from the entire Palestinian national territory.\n\nFoltyn: Rallies in support of Hamas have been taking place throughout Southern Lebanon since the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The message is that his demise will not weaken Hamas, nor will it lessen its struggle for Palestinian liberation, a liberation these men and women have awaited for decades....\n\nFolytn committed an ideologically corrupted definition of the word \"refugee,\" one that only seems to apply to Palestinians. She referred to a 22-year-old woman as a refugee, though she was in fact merely a \"descendant of Palestinians expelled in 1948, when Israel was created\" and had \"never set foot in Palestinian land.\" That's not a refugee.\n\nThe woman lauded the assassinated terrorist leader: \"Since our childhood, Haniyeh has influenced us a lot. All our leaders, not just Haniyeh, have taught us that we should hold on to the resistance, no matter what the enemy does.\" It continued:\n\nFoltyn: Hamas' October 7 attack on Southern Israel was denounced as terrorism by the United States and other Western nations. But, here, it sparked a different sentiment, something Palestinians hadn't felt in decades, hope.\n\nShe met up with an anonymized Hamas fighter and used the same \"resistance\" terminology the Hamas terrorists used.\n\nFoltyn: Do you think that, since October 7, there is greater support for armed resistance?\n\nHamas fighter (through interpreter): Yes. Of course there was support before, but not as much as we are seeing now. There was a general mobilization a month after the events of October 7. Pretty much all the youth in this camp signed up to join Hamas.\n\nFoltyn, who worked for the virulently anti-Israel outlet Arab news network Al-Jazeera English from 2019 to 2021 (on the Iraq beat), continued the disgusting moral equivalence, equating the psychotic Jewish killers of Hamas as \"resistance\" to the \"Zionist entity.\"\n\nFoltyn: Rising support for the resistance is visible in plain sight. The camp is run by Fatah, which was co-founded by Yasser Arafat and has led the Palestinian Authority since its creation. But Hamas has been gaining ground here, chipping away at Fatah's status as the guardian of the Palestinian cause....\n\nShe quoted Munir Maqdah, a leader of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a branch of Fatah founded during the second Palestinian \"uprising\" (i.e. Israel-targeted terrorist wave) of the early 2000s.\n\nFoltyn: Words that are finding fertile ground among disenfranchised Palestinian youth. But mobilization inside the camp is a delicate matter. It risks drawing Israeli airstrikes and alienating the Lebanese government, which sees it as a violation of its sovereignty. To get a glimpse into the secretive recruitment process, I visit a mosque in a neighborhood that is a Hamas stronghold. Hassan Shanaa, a local Hamas official, tells me that hundreds of young men have approached him since October ready to take up arms against Israel, what they call the Zionist entity.\n\nFoltyn did make one admission -- Hamas is \"an Islamist movement\" unlike its more secular rivals Fatah -- before concluding:\n\nFoltyn: Hamas is trying to capitalize on the youth's newfound zeal to obtain with force what hasn't been achieved with words...\n\nThis segment giving the Hamas perspective was brought to you in part by Raymond James.\n\nAmna Nawaz: The killing of a top Hamas leader last week shook a Middle East already scarred by a war that the militant group launched last October 7. The past 10 bloody months have also galvanized Palestinian populations beyond Gaza and the West Bank, especially in Lebanon. Factions of Hamas have also made it home. And special correspondent Simona Foltyn recently gained rare access to its operations there for this report.\n\nSimona Foltyn: A show of defiance in the Lebanese city of Sour after Israel's killing in Tehran of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nRafat Morra, Hamas Official (through interpreter): The resistance remains strong and will continue. This resistance will continue until the removal of this Israeli occupation and the complete defeat of the occupation from the entire Palestinian national territory.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Rallies in support of Hamas have been taking place throughout Southern Lebanon since the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The message is that his demise will not weaken Hamas, nor will it lessen its struggle for Palestinian liberation, a liberation these men and women have awaited for decades.\n\nThey are refugees, descendants of Palestinians expelled in 1948, when Israel was created. Rayyan is 22 years old. She never set foot on Palestinian land, but is no less attached to the cause.\n\nRayyan Hafiyan, Palestinian Refugee (through interpreter): Since our childhood, Haniyeh has influenced us a lot. All our leaders, not just Haniyeh, have taught us that we should hold on to the resistance, no matter what the enemy does.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Hamas' October 7 attack on Southern Israel was denounced as terrorism by the United States and other Western nations. But, here, it sparked a different sentiment, something Palestinians hadn't felt in decades, hope.\n\nRayyan Hafiyan (through interpreter): From when I was little, we have had the hope of returning and living in our homeland. And, God willing, this day will come.\n\nSimona Foltyn: I want to know if this is a broader trend among the Palestinian diaspora in Lebanon and travel to Saida, home to the largest Palestinian refugee camp. Past the checkpoint of the Lebanese army, it feels as if we've crossed into another country.\n\nThe camp is called Ain al-Helweh. Around 120,000 people live here in perpetual exile, crammed into less than half-a-square-mile, a pressure cooker with poor services, few jobs, and no prospects.\n\nNow that frustration has found an outlet. I'm meeting a Hamas fighter who requested anonymity because he spoke outside the chain of command.\n\nDo you think that, since October 7, there is greater support for armed resistance?\n\nHamas fighter (through interpreter): Yes. Of course there was support before, but not as much as we are seeing now. There was a general mobilization a month after the events of October 7. Pretty much all the youth in this camp signed up to join Hamas.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Rising support for the resistance is visible in plain sight. The camp is run by Fatah, which was co-founded by Yasser Arafat and has led the Palestinian Authority since its creation.\n\nBut Hamas has been gaining ground here, chipping away at Fatah's status as the guardian of the Palestinian cause, its green colors gradually usurping Fatah's yellow. The green flag of Hamas and other symbols like these posters of its military spokesperson Abu Obaida, have spread throughout the camp since October 7, signaling growing support for armed resistance, even in areas that were not traditionally dominated by Hamas.\n\nFatah has been losing legitimacy for years now amid accusations of rampant corruption and its failure to achieve Palestinian statehood in the wake of the 1993 Oslo Accords, as part of which it renounced violence in return for recognition and the nominal authority to govern.\n\nBut some within Fatah never laid down arms, like Munir Maqdah, the most senior Fatah military official in the camp.\n\nMunir Maqdah, Fatah Military Commander (through interpreter): We participate in daily military action inside the West Bank in the face of Israeli occupation.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Maqdah is a leader in the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a branch of Fatah founded during the second Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s. He points to Israel's continued occupation and settlement of Palestinian land in the West Bank as evidence that the Oslo Accords have failed.\n\nMunir Maqdah (through interpreter): Negotiations have been tried for 30 years and will not give the Palestinian people anything. The Palestinian people have no choice but to take their rights by force and blood. Today, it's blood for blood until we get rid of this occupation in the land of Palestine.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Words that are finding fertile ground among disenfranchised Palestinian youth. But mobilization inside the camp is a delicate matter. It risks drawing Israeli airstrikes and alienating the Lebanese government, which sees it as a violation of its sovereignty.\n\nTo get a glimpse into the secretive recruitment process, I visit a mosque in a neighborhood that is a Hamas stronghold. Hassan Shanaa, a local Hamas official, tells me that hundreds of young men have approached him since October ready to take up arms against Israel, what they call the Zionist entity.\n\nHassan Shanaa, Hamas Official (through interpreter): There is a large number of young people who want to join the movement to fight, not to enter the movement and go through the recruitment process. No, they wanted us to give them weapons and go to Palestine through Southern Lebanon, so they can fight the Zionist entity.\n\nSimona Foltyn: The selection process can span years, with new recruits vetted at multiple stages. Religious instruction is at the very core of joining Hamas, which, unlike the more secular Fatah, is an Islamist movement.\n\nHassan Shanaa (through interpreter): First of all, he has to be committed and pray and take lessons with us. If his foundations and goals are where they should be, he will go out to the second stage and maybe take a special lesson.\n\nSimona Foltyn: The next stage is military training, which is where it gets more complicated. Hamas doesn't enjoy Fatah's status as the security provider in the camps, and isn't officially allowed to maintain an armed presence inside Lebanon.\n\nBut I met one new joiner who took part in covert training exercises, which take place in coordination with Hamas ally Lebanese paramilitary group Hezbollah.\n\nHamas recruit (through interpreter): They teach us about weapons, how to take them apart and put them together, about bombs, these kinds of things.\n\nSimona Foltyn: And this training is inside the camp or outside?\n\nHamas recruit (through interpreter): No, we go out and come back. I went out two, three times and came back.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Have a lot of your friends joined Hamas?\n\nHamas recruit (through interpreter): There are many, a lot. All were encouraged after October 7.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Hamas is trying to capitalize on the youth's newfound zeal to obtain with force what hasn't been achieved with words. For Hassan Shanaa, the death and destruction in Gaza are a price worth paying.\n\nHassan Shanaa (through interpreter): The Zionist entity and the American administration were betting that adults here would die and children would forget. We say to the whole world, despite the tragedy, the massacres, the killing and the destruction, there's no alternative homeland to Palestine except Palestine.\n\nSimona Foltyn: Haniyeh's assassination has for now dashed hopes for a cease-fire. Many here see armed struggle as the only way forward.

AFP was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the video.\n\nThe video was the \"result of our hunt\", Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing at the time.\n\n\"The hunt will not stop until he is captured, dead or alive. We are determined to capture him.\"\n\nIt was not the video that was important, Rear Adm Hagari said, but the intelligence the military could glean from it that would help find other top militants.\n\nDays later, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant claimed that Sinwar was \"on the run\" and moving from \"hideout to hideout\".\n\nEarlier in August, the military announced that in July it had killed Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas's armed wing and, along with Sinwar, one of the alleged planners of the Oct 7 attack.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoav Gallant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Deif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/08/09/FILES-PALESTINIAN-ISRAEL-CONFLICT-HAMAS-SINWAR-085941.jpg?VersionId=UTvKXwfIkXhA_NbvqiIe1YUkqu12iOfI", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802851", "eventUri": "eng-9802851", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 60, "textEnd": 65, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-10", "textStart": 1548, "textEnd": 1554}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 89, "relevance": 1}

political bureau chief and key negotiator Ismail Haniyeh, for which Israel has been blamed.\n\nHamas appointed Yahya Sinwar - believed to be the mastermind behind the 7 October attack on Israel - as the head of its political bureau following Haniyeh's death.\n\nReports on Thursday suggested that Khalil al-Hayya, a Qatar-based member of the group's political bureau, will continue to lead indirect negotiations with Israel under the leadership of Sinwar.\n\nOn Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that it will send a team on 15 August to finalise the framework of a Gaza truce deal.\n\nIn a post on X, which came after the statement by the Qatari, Egyptian and American leaders, it said: \"Following the proposal of the United States and the mediators, Israel will

being planned for 15 August, which will be attended by officials from the three mediating countries, including CIA Director William Burns who is expected to head the US delegation.\n\nThe US news site Axios reported that a resumption of negotiations was pushed for by the United States in recent days.\n\nThe outlet cited an Israeli official as saying that Israel was made aware of the joint statement that was issued by Qatar, Egypt and the US.\n\nThe Israeli official told the outlet that Israel will \"Israel will go anywhere and cooperate with any initiative that can promote a deal for the release of the hostages\".\n\nThe New Arab's Arabic language edition Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported on Thursday that Western officials are pushing regional parties to deescalate tension and reach a \"comprehensive\" settlement that would prevent Iran and Hezbollah from responding to the assassinations of Haniyeh and Hezbollah military leader Fouad Shukr, as well as ending the war on Gaza.\n\nReuters quoted a senior US administration official as saying that Biden does not expect a deal to be announced on 15 August but that the meeting would be \"preparatory\" in nature.\n\nThe official said that an Iranian retaliation for Haniyeh's assassination on its soil would \"undermine any hopes for ceasefire\", warning that the \"consequences\" of an Iranian attack on Israel would be \"very significant\".\n\nIsrael's brutal onslaught on the besieged Gaza Strip has killed over 40,000 people and left at least 91,700 injured.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news",

During mediated negotiations in Rome two weeks ago, the Israeli team \"presented new demands to the framework,\" The Washington Post said, leaving U.S. officials \"from Biden on down\" and Israeli military and political leaders \"furious at Netanyahu's last-minute ultimatum.\"", "source": {"uri": "theweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Week"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_weber@theweek.com", "name": "Peter Weber", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "week_us@theweek.com", "name": "Week Us", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamim_bin_Hamad_Al_Thani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdel_Fattah_el-Sisi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abdel Fattah el-Sisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZQ5RPeawHMaRMJSB3Ei5en-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802851", "eventUri": "eng-9802851", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 404, "textEnd": 411}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 460917069, "relevance": 2}

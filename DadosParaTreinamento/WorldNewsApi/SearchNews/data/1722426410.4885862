I am very confused on the current state or stasis of the PNC. What is happening? Who is/is not standing for leader-today? Who gets to vote? How does Vincent Alexander verify them? Will there be statements of poll? A count? Where is GECOM when you need them! The Stabroek News, as the Guyana journal of record, might think of abating my confusion in a long-not too long-analysis piece. Here\u2019s hoping.

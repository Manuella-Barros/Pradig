This festival is dedicated to marital happiness and marks the onset of the monsoon season. It involves fasting, prayers, and various cultural activities. Women observe this day by fasting and performing rituals to seek blessings from Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati for prosperity, marital joy, and well-being. Traditionally, women don green attire, adorn themselves with elaborate jewellery, and participate in flower-adorned swinging ceremonies.\n\nDate and Timings for Hariyali Teej 2024\n\nHariyali Teej is celebrated on Shukla Paksha Tritiya in the month of Shravana, typically two days before Nag Panchami. In 2024, Hariyali Teej will be observed on Wednesday, August 7. According to Drik Panchang, the auspicious timings for the festival are:\n\nOn Hariyali Teej, homes are thoroughly cleaned, sanitized, and adorned with flowers. A Shiv Lingam, along with idols of Goddess Parvati, Lord Shiva, and Lord Ganesha, is placed for worship. The deities are honoured through a sixteen-step ceremony, which lasts all night. Women observe a Nirjala Vrat (fast) on this day, abstaining from food and water. Both married and single women can partake in this fast; married women seek blessings for their spouse's long life and family's prosperity, while unmarried women fast in hopes of finding a good husband and a happy marriage. The fast is broken after 24 hours, following the completion of all rituals.\n\nHistory of Hariyali Teej\n\nThe legend of Hariyali Teej recounts how Parvati underwent 107 reincarnations before finally marrying Shiva on her 108th birth during Shukla Paksha Tritiya of Shravan. In her previous lives, Parvati renounced worldly ties and lived on dry leaves to win Shiva's love, though he remained unaware due to his vow of celibacy. To draw his attention, Parvati created a Shiva Lingam from sand in the Himalayas, symbolizing her unwavering devotion. Moved by her sincerity, Shiva appeared, granted her wish, and accepted her as his wife. The festival celebrates the belief that women who fast with devotion receive blessings from Shiva and Parvati.\n\nSignificance of Hariyali Teej\n\nHariyali Teej is particularly significant for married women, as fasting on this day is believed to ensure their husbands' long life and well-being. Wearing all 16 traditional ornaments is thought to protect their spouse from harm, a tradition cherished by newlyweds. Unmarried girls also participate in the festivities, praying for a good husband. Additionally, the festival celebrates the monsoon season, symbolized by the lush greenery.

It is believed that Goddess Parvati fulfills the desires of those who fast and worship diligently during Hartalika Teej.\n\nIn 2023, Hariyali Teej was celebrated on Wednesday, August 7.\n\nHartalika Teej is rooted in Indian mythology, recounting the story of Goddess Parvati. Her father wished for her to marry Lord Vishnu, but she desired Lord Shiva as her husband. On the day of the proposed marriage, Parvati's friends help her escape to a dense forest to avoid the wedding with Vishnu. There, she prayed fervently to Lord Shiva, who was moved by her devotion and appeared before her. He accepted her plea, and they eventually married. This day, known as Hartalika Teej, marks the acceptance of Parvati by Shiva.\n\nHariyali Teej is a significant Hindu festival that commemorates the marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati.

The festival remembers the day when Shiva accepted Parvati as his wife after her years of devotion and austerity.

In Punjab, it is known as Teeyan, while in Rajasthan, it is called Shingara Teej.\n\nWhile Hariyali Teej is traditionally observed by married women for the well-being of their husbands, unmarried girls also participate in the festival in some regions to pray for a desirable groom.\n\nThe Teej festival, including Hariyali Teej, Kajari Teej, and Hartalika Teej, is dedicated to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati.

This year, the festival is set to be observed on August 7. This festival, deeply rooted in cultural and religious traditions, marks the onset of the monsoon season and celebrates the union of Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva.

According to legend, Goddess Parvati took 108th birth to win Lord Shiva's love and commitment and to marry him. Her devotion and perseverance were finally rewarded when Shiva accepted her as his wife on Shukla Paksha Tritiya of Shravan. Hariyali Teej thus commemorates their reunion and is seen as a celebration of marital bliss and the power of unwavering devotion.\n\nThe festival holds immense significance for married women, who pray for the well-being and longevity of their husbands, and for unmarried women, who seek a life partner with qualities akin to those of Lord Shiva. Hariyali Teej is also an occasion for women to come together, celebrate, and strengthen social bonds.\n\nHariyali Teej is a beautiful festival that celebrates the divine love of Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva, symbolising marital bliss, devotion, and the joyous spirit of the monsoon season.

Hariyali Teej is dedicated to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati and it falls during the Sawan (or Shravana) month which is the holy month to observe various fasts devoted to Shiva and Parvati.\n\nHariyali Teej commemorates Lord Shiva and Maa Parvati's union, symbolizing the profound bond between the universe's masculine and feminine energies. According to legends, Goddess Parvati spent 107 births in rigorous penance to win over Lord Shiva's affection. It was during her 108th birth that Devi Parvati could finally win over Lord Shiva on this day. She also came to be known as Teej Maata.\n\nTritiya Tithi Begins - 07:52 PM on Aug 6, 2024\n\nTritiya Tithi Ends - 10:05 PM on Aug 7, 2024\n\nHariyali Teej is celebrated by women mainly in north India, especially in states including Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Jharkhand. Hariyali Teej celebrations mainly see the participation of married women. They observe a rigorous 'nirjala' fast (a fast where they don't even drink water), wear vibrant traditional attire, and get beautiful mehndi designs on their palms. Women fast seeking the long life of their husbands. Unmarried girls also participate, fasting with the hope of finding suitable life partners.\n\nAccording to Drik Panchang, \"On this day women pray and worship Goddess Parvati for conjugal bliss and happy married life. During Hariyali Teej married women visit their parents' home, wear new clothes preferably green sari and bangles, prepare swings, and use it in pair while singing Teej songs.\"\n\nHariyali Teej is celebrated in monsoons when there is greenery and flora and fauna all around. That's the significance of \"hariyali\". As the festival falls on the Tritiya tithi, it is known as Hariyali Teej.\n\nThe origins of Hariyali Teej trace back to ancient Hindu mythology. According to legend, Goddess Parvati underwent severe penance and numerous rebirths to win Lord Shiva's heart and marry him. Her dedication and unwavering love were eventually rewarded, symbolizing the triumph of perseverance and devotion.

Hariyali Teej is typically celebrated in the northern Indian states of Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Bihar, Jharkhand, Mahdya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, is well known for its Teej-related festivities.\n\nSignificance Of Teej\n\nTeej is an auspicious festival celebrated with fasting, prayers, and sacred rituals for the well-being of their husbands and children. It is believed that Teej is a celebration of the pure bond shared by Devi Parvati and her husband, Lord Shiva. Teej is celebrated in remembrance of Parvati's dedication and devotion to Lord Shiva. This represents that in modern day and age, married women seek blessings during Teej festivities to have a desirable marriage and husband, along with health and prosperous wishes for their children.\n\nHow To Prepare For Teej?\n\nDuring the Teej festivities, women often dress up in green outfits and fancy themselves with accessories, along with varieties of mehendi designs being applied to their hands and feet. The women can then be seen singing festive folk songs and enjoying swings hung from trees that are beautifully decorated with flowers, paints, and leaves.\n\nWhat Is The Shubh Muhurat For Hariyali Teej 2024?\n\nHariyali Teej is typically celebrated two days before Nag Panchami. Teej is observed on Shukla Paksha Tritiya. According to Drik Panchang, a well-known Hindu calendar website, the Shubh Muhurat starts at 7:52 PM on August 6, Tuesday, and ends at 10:05 PM on August 7, Wednesday.\n\nWhy Is Hariyali Teej Celebrated?\n\nAccording to ancient folklore, Mata Parvati took 107 births due to Lord Shiva's atonement. Eventually, at Devi Parvati's 108th birth, she was able to win Lord Shiva and came to be known as 'Teej Mata'. It is believed that Parvati married Shiva on her 108th birthday during the Shukla Paksha Tritiya of Shravan.\n\nParvati travelled to the Himalayas to symbolise unwavering love and made a Shiva Lingam from the sand. In her past lives, the goddess had renounced worldly ties and lived on dry leaves to win Shiva's love. However, Lord Shiva had remained unaware due to his vow of celibacy.\n\nBut after seeing her continued devotion and considering her sincere fasting and rituals, Lord Shiva accepted Parvati as his wife", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teej", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teej"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvati", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parvati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shiva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindu calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaipur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jaipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehndi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mehndi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Folklore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naga_Panchami", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naga Panchami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paksha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paksha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lingam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reincarnation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddess", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goddess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Himalayas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Conferences_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Conferences and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-08/91eed256-dabc-4447-a6c1-3096e4b9249a/FPJ CUSTOM PIC (31).jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790878", "eventUri": "eng-9790878", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 1623, "textEnd": 1631}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1666, "textEnd": 1674}], "sentiment": 0.6000000000000001, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

This festival, dedicated to the divine union of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, symbolises marital bliss and the monsoon season's lush greenery. As Hariyali Teej 2024 approaches, let's delve into its date, time, significance, puja vidhi, and more.\n\nHariyali Teej, typically observed two days before Nag Panchami, is celebrated on the Tritiya Tithi of Shukla Paksha in the month of Shravana. This festival honours the divine union of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. In 2024, according to the Gregorian calendar, Hariyali Teej will fall on Wednesday, August 7, with the following timings:\n\nAccording to legend, Parvati underwent 107 reincarnations before finally marrying Shiva on her 108th birth during the Shukla Paksha Tritiya of Shravan. In her previous lives, she renounced worldly ties, subsisting on dry leaves in her quest for Shiva's love, though he remained unaware due to his vow of celibacy. To capture his attention, Parvati journeyed to the Himalayas, where she crafted a Shiva Lingam from sand, symbolising her unwavering love. Moved by her devotion, Shiva appeared, granted her wish, and acknowledged her as his wife due to her sincere fast and rituals.

This year, as per the Gregorian calendar, Hariyali Teej will be celebrated on Wednesday, August 7, 2024.\n\nIt celebrates devotion, renewal, and the vibrant essence of nature, while primarily commemorating the divine union of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, symbolising the ideal of marital harmony and eternal love.\n\nParvati, a goddess, underwent 107 reincarnations before marrying Shiva on her 108th birth.

From date to time, scroll down to learn more about this auspicious occasion. (Also read: Hiroshima Day 2024: Date, history, significance and observance of 79th year of World War II atomic bombings )\n\nHariyali Teej, typically observed two days before Nag Panchami, is celebrated on Shukla Paksha Tritiya in the month of Shravana in honour of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. According to the Gregorian calendar, this year, the festival will be observed on Wednesday, August 7. According to Drik Panchang, the auspicious timings to observe the occasion are as follows:\n\nOn this day, the house is thoroughly cleaned, sanitised, and decorated with flowers. A Shiv Lingam, along with idols of Goddess Parvati, Lord Shiva, and Lord Ganesha, is placed in the home. The deities are worshipped in a sixteen-step ceremony, and the Puja lasts all night. Women observe a Nirjala Vrat (fast) on Hariyali Teej, refraining from eating or drinking anything for the entire day. Both married and single women can observe this fast. Married women do so to seek blessings for wealth, harmony, and the long life of their spouse and family, while unmarried women fast in hopes of finding a good husband and having a happy marriage. After 24 hours, once all the rituals of the Hariyali Teej Puja and Vrat are completed, women can drink water.\n\nAccording to legend, Parvati went through 107 reincarnations before finally marrying Shiva on her 108th birth during Shukla Paksha Tritiya of Shravan. In her past lives, she renounced worldly ties and lived on dry leaves to win Shiva's love, though he remained unaware due to his vow of celibacy. To get his attention, Parvati travelled to the Himalayas and made a Shiva Lingam from sand, symbolising her unwavering love. Touched by her devotion, Shiva appeared, granted her wish, and accepted her as his wife because of her sincere fasting and rituals. This festival celebrates the belief that women who observe the fast with sincerity receive blessings from Shiva and Parvati.\n\nHariyali Teej holds great significance for married women, as it is believed that fasting on this day ensures the long life and well-being of their husbands.

The festival coincides with the monsoon season when the environment is lush and green, enhancing the festive spirit that the name \"Hariyali,\" which means greenery, suggests. This day celebrates the union of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, hoping to bless their devotees with happiness, prosperity, and good fortune.\n\nOn this auspicious day, married Hindu women adorn themselves in traditional attire with \"solah shringar,\" the sixteen embellishments that symbolize marriage, like vermillion, green bangles, toe rings, anklets, and gold jewelry. \"Women seek blessings of Lord Shiva and Mata Parvati by offering prayers to them.\" They often visit their parents' homes, receive gifts and clothes, and celebrate with their family members.\n\nUnmarried women also participate in this festival with great devotion. They observe fasts and offer prayers to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, seeking blessings for a desired husband. \"It is believed that by performing puja rituals on this auspicious day, unmarried women get blessings of the Lord and Goddess and also get the desired life partner.\"\n\nThe rituals associated with Hariyali Teej are elaborate and performed with strict adherence to tradition.\n\nWomen begin their day early by taking a holy bath and cleaning their homes, particularly the puja room. They wear beautiful dresses, preferably in green, symbolizing the monsoon season. \"Green color represents auspiciousness.\" They prepare satvik food for bhog prasad and set up a puja area with an idol of Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva or a Shiv Parivar idol.\n\nA diya made of desi ghee is lit in front of the idol, which is decorated with flowers and garlands. Offerings of vermillion and other shringar items are made to Mata Parvati. Women then recite the Hariyali Teej Katha and offer bhog prasad such as kheer and Panchamrit to the deities. They chant the Aarti to seek blessings for a happy married life and the well-being of their husbands. \"Unmarried women also seek blessings of the Lord and the Goddess and pray to get the desired husband like Mahadev.\"\n\nMarried women also take blessings from their in-laws by touching their feet and giving them gifts or clothes. After performing the puja at home, women visit temples where they perform additional rituals and offer shringar items to Maa Parvati. Women gather to sing bhajans related to Hariyali Teej.\n\nAfter fasting throughout the day, women break their fast in the evening, at sunset, after seeking blessings from their husbands by touching their feet. \"After observing fast for the whole day, finally they break their fast in the evening at the time of sunset and before that they seek blessings from their husbands by touching their feet.\"\n\nThe puja is concluded with a special mantra: \"Sarva Mangal Maangalyaye Shive Sarvartha Sadhike Sharanyaye Tiryambike Gauri Narayani Namostute..!!\"\n\nHariyali Teej stands as a vivid representation of cultural devotion, the sanctity of marriage, and the longing for marital bliss and prosperity.

AI Shows Scary Pictures\n\nHariyali Teej, one of the significant festivals in India, is celebrated with much fervor and joy, marking the arrival of the monsoon season and honoring the divine union of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. While the essence of the festival remains consistent, its observance showcases a rich tapestry of regional variations that add to the cultural diversity of India. Here's a glimpse into how different regions celebrate Hariyali Teej.\n\nDespite the differences in celebration styles, the underlying essence of Hariyali Teej remains the same -- celebrating love, devotion, and the joy of the monsoon season.\n\n1. Rajasthan\n\nIn Rajasthan, Hariyali Teej is a grand affair. Women dress in vibrant green clothes, symbolizing fertility and prosperity. The celebration includes singing traditional folk songs, dancing, and applying intricate mehndi (henna) designs on their hands. Swinging on beautifully decorated swings (jhoolas) is a central activity, symbolizing the joy of the rainy season. Processions featuring beautifully adorned idols of Goddess Parvati are taken out, accompanied by folk music and dance.\n\n2. Uttar Pradesh\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, particularly in the Braj region (Mathura and Vrindavan), Hariyali Teej is celebrated with devotional fervor. The festivities include singing songs dedicated to Lord Krishna and Radha, as the region has a deep association with their divine love. Women gather to swing on the jhoolas while chanting and singing bhajans. Special prayers and rituals are conducted in temples, and sweets like ghewar and malpua are prepared and distributed among friends and family.\n\n3. Haryana\n\nHaryana's Hariyali Teej is marked by traditional rituals and community gatherings. Women perform a series of fasts and rituals to seek the blessings of Goddess Parvati for marital bliss and well-being. The festival is an occasion for women to reconnect with their maternal homes, and they are showered with gifts, clothes, and sweets. Cultural programs, including folk dances like ghoomar, and fairs add to the festive spirit.\n\n4. Punjab\n\nIn Punjab, Hariyali Teej is celebrated with a blend of joy and devotion. The festival is called 'Teej' and is a day for women to enjoy themselves, free from their daily chores. They dress in bright green attire, apply mehndi, and adorn themselves with traditional jewelry. The highlight is the community gathering where women sing and dance to traditional Punjabi folk songs. Swings are set up in courtyards and gardens, where women and girls enjoy swinging while singing and making merry.\n\n5. Bihar\n\nIn Bihar, Hariyali Teej is celebrated with a focus on rituals and fasting. Married women observe a day-long fast without consuming water, praying for the long life and prosperity of their husbands. The fast is broken in the evening after performing puja (worship) of Goddess Parvati. The festivities include folk songs, traditional dances, and the application of mehndi. It is also customary for women to receive gifts from their in-laws and maternal homes.\n\n6. Madhya Pradesh\n\nMadhya Pradesh celebrates Hariyali Teej with great enthusiasm, particularly in the Malwa and Nimad regions. Women dress in green sarees and jewelry, gather for communal prayers, and sing traditional songs. Swings are adorned with flowers, and women enjoy swinging while engaging in joyful conversations. The festival is an opportunity for women to socialize and celebrate together, strengthening community bonds.\n\n7. Maharashtra\n\nIn Maharashtra, Hariyali Teej is observed more subtly compared to the northern states. Women still engage in traditional rituals, including fasting and prayers for marital bliss. However, the celebration is more private, focusing on family gatherings and traditional meals. Women visit temples to offer prayers and seek blessings for a harmonious married life.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This festival holds significant importance for married women in Sanatan Dharma. Hariyali Teej is mentioned in various religious texts. It is believed that by observing this fast, married women's husbands are granted a long life, and unmarried women find perfect husbands. On Hariyali Teej, Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati are worshipped. Fasting on this day is said to bring numerous forms of happiness and also to lead to early marriage.\n\nAstrologer Pandit Kalki Ram of Ayodhya states that the fast of Hariyali Teej is observed on the Tritiya Tithi of the Shukla Paksha in the month of Sawan. According to mythology, on this day, Goddess Parvati undertook a long penance for water to make Lord Shiva her husband. Her penance was accepted by Lord Shiva on the Tritiya Tithi of the Shukla Paksha in the month of Sawan. Consequently, married women fast on this day for the long life of their husbands, while unmarried girls fast to find their desired groom. Observing this fast is believed to increase happiness and prosperity in life, making the fast of Hariyali Teej highly significant in Sanatan Dharma.\n\nOn the day of Hariyali Teej, the observances begin early in the morning during the Brahma Muhurta, which is considered an auspicious time for spiritual activities. After taking a ritualistic bath, devotees prepare to worship Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. The preparations involve setting up a clean and sacred space for the worship, often decorated with flowers and other items of significance.\n\nThe worship ceremony involves various steps. Devotees offer prayers, flowers, and other offerings to the deities. They light incense and lamps, creating a serene and reverent atmosphere. Following this, they recite or listen to the story of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, which narrates the deep devotion and penance undertaken by Goddess Parvati to win the love and acceptance of Lord Shiva as her husband.\n\nIn addition to the storytelling, devotees chant mantras dedicated to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. These mantras are believed to be powerful and infallible, capable of invoking the deities' blessings. The mantra that unmarried women need to chant is OM UMAMAHESHWARABHYAM NAMAH OM GAURAYA NAMAH OM PARVATYAI NAMAH.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paksha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paksha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teej", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teej"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shiva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalki", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kalki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvati", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parvati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pandit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astrology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religious text"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhurta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muhurta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Om"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brahma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mantra"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Myths_and_Folktales", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Myths and Folktales", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Pagan", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Pagan", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/08/image-2024-08-06t105303.347-2024-08-2c7a72cfe15586bd715fec6570a80a5b-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790878", "eventUri": "eng-9790878", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The festival is celebrated on Tritiya Tithi of Shukla Paksha in the holy month of Sawan. This year, it will be celebrated on August 7, 2024.\n\nSignificance of Hariyali Teej\n\nThe festival is devoted to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati.On this day, married women observe a fast and offer prayers to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati for a happy and prosperous marital life.

It is said that goddess Parvati spent 107 births in Shiva's penance. Thus, after Devi Parvati's 108th birth, the goddess could finally win over Lord Shiva and came to be known as 'Teej Mata'. Parvati is believed to have married Shiva on her 108th birthday during Shukla Paksha Tritiya of Shravan.\n\nIt is also said that Goddess Parvati travelled to the Himalayas to symbolise unwavering love and made a Shiva Lingam from the sand. In her past lives, the goddess had renounced worldly ties and lived on dry leaves to win Shiva's love.\n\nHere are some rules that one should keep in mind while fasting for Hariyali Teej:\n\n1. The fast is observed by married women for the long life of their husbands. And in some places, unmarried girls also observe this fast to get the desired groom. According to experts, if the fast is observed once by a married woman, it has to be observed every year.\n\n2. While fasting, women renounce water and food for 24 hours and eat only after the muhurat ends the next morning, after offering vermilion to Goddess Parvati.\n\n3. Consumption of onions and garlic is avoided on this day. Also, drinking alcohol and consuming meat and eggs are prohibited on this day.\n\n4. During the muhurat time of puja, women have to offer prayers to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, perform arti of both deities and pray for the long lives of their husbands.\n\n5. On this day, homemade food and sweets like ghewar, gujiya. thekwa, kheer, coconut laddoo, and fresh fruits are offered to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati.\n\n6. After performing the evening puja, the women observing the fast touch the feet of their husbands and seek blessings.\n\n7. During the puja ritual, Lord Shiva is offered cow milk, bel batra, dhature ke phool, and leaves too. All these items are believed to be Lord Shiva's favourites.\n\nDo's\n\nIf you are not observing nirajala vrat, you can eat nuts, fruits, dairy products like milk and butter and selected flours like Kuttu ka Atta (buckwheat flour), Singhare ka Atta (water chestnut flour) or Rajgira ka Atta (amaranth flour).\n\nDrink water, milk, buttermilk, and fresh juices throughout the day to keep the body hydrated.\n\nReplace table salt with rock salt or sendha namak for cooking recipes during fast. Also, while using spices stick to cumin seeds, cinnamon, green cardamom, cloves, black pepper powder, red chilli powder, and black peppercorns.\n\nDon'ts\n\nAccording to experts, preparation of dishes using onion, garlic and spices should be avoided. Also, other heat-generating foods and oils like mustard oil or sesame oil should be avoided.\n\nApart from these, consumption of meat, egg, alcohol and tobacco is also strictly prohibited during the festival.\n\nAnd if you are fasting, do not have a proper full meal or the last meal before the sandhya aarti or the sunset.\n\nAvoid drinking packaged juices as they may contain added salt and preservatives to enhance the flavour.\n\nThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Mehendi is a custom to seek blessings from Goddess Parvati, the divine embodiment of marital peace and bliss. Mehendi is believed to promote marital well-being and harmony. Applying mehendi also fosters a sense of bond and community, bringing women together as they sing, dance, and share stories to celebrate their married lives. It's a social activity that gathers large groups of women.\n\nYou can never go wrong with a simple floral design, With intricate swirls, petals, and leaves being the highlight of the design, it's perfect for paying tribute to nature and goes well with the signature green attire worn on Hariyali Teej.\n\nThis design features a fusion of dainty floral design with bold geometric shapes. It also gives a minimalistic appearance, as it focuses more on delicate design shapes than filling up the space. With a space devoid of mehendi in the design, the borders around the space create an illusion of a temple arch. This minimalistic design with the temple arch pattern is ideal for a holy festival like Hariyali Teej.\n\nGo full artistic this holy season and create art styles that depict you and your husband.It shows your devotion and love towards your life partner and they will surely be over the moon with this design.

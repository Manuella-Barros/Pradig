The Fir Park club confirmed that Kelly will not be returning next season with his contract expiring. The goalkeeper is reportedly being lined up for a return to Rangers with Robby McCrorie not keen to sit on the bench for another season. Aberdeen are thought to be interested in him and Clement could swoop for Kelly to boost his goalkeeping options after Jon McLaughlin left on a free. Kelly is still available for nothing, but he's signed on again with the Steelmen for a few weeks to ensure they are paid the six-figure UEFA compensation for having players at a tournament. A club statement read: \u201cThe former Motherwell skipper will not be returning to Fir Park next season however, a contract extension was agreed between player and club that will see Kelly remain a Motherwell player for the duration of the tournament.\u201d Kelly was given the nod by Steve Clarke ahead of veteran Hearts keeper Craig Gordon. The 41-year-old won his 75th cap off the bench against Finland and became Scotland's oldest ever player, but won't be on the plane that jets out to germany on Sunday.

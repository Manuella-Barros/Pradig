The Northern Ireland rider encountered the flying missile on the opening lap of Saturday's Supersport race. Jordan was struck by a bird flying out of a hedge at the Sarah's Cottage section of the course, but he managed to compose himself to finish eighth in the 600 class. The Magherafelt rider told the Isle of Man's official coverage: \"I was coming out of Sarah's (Cottage) there on the first lap, and just before I went onto Cronk-Y-Voddy this bird just came straight out of the hedge and hit me on the head again.

And it's not something you want to be making a habit of. But I'm alright. It just gave me a bit of a shock.\" It isn't the first time Jordan has struck a bird at the TT. He sustained two black eyes when one cracked his visor during a practice session back in 2022. Despite his latest nasty encounter, Jordan was satisfied with a solid top-10 finish on the Mountain Course in tricky conditions following some morning rain. He added: \"It didn't feel as good as the first Supersport race. We made a slight change to the bike to manage the bumps, and it was still really nervous. And with the damp patches out there and getting hit by a bird, it knocked me off my momentum a wee bit. \"A top 10 finish at the TT is a really good achievement, but I know I should be aiming higher. We will come back on the Supersport and try again. \"I was texting my mates this morning to send me photos of different parts of the course (to check the conditions). I was the first one off down the road so I was getting there first. \"There are some parts more damp than others. There are a few places that if you go off line then it's damp. But the wind and all that there has been the same all week, so you deal with it. \"You have to trust what the marshals give you and the boards telling you where the damp patches are. You have to go off the feel of things. \"The first race (of the day) is the worst. I get really nervous and have that sick feeling and what not. But you settle down after the first race. The whole TT has been stop start this year.\" Sign up to our free sports newsletter to get the latest headlines to your inbox", "summary": "The Northern Ireland rider managed to finish eighth despite hitting a bird in Saturday's Supersport race", "url": "https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/sport/other-sport/motorsport/isle-man-tt-paul-jordan-29317976", "image": "https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/incoming/article29317982.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Paul-Jordan.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:24:50", "author": "Gareth Fullerton", "authors": ["Gareth Fullerton"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.157}

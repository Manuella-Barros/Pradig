Nestled in the Essex countryside, this spot in South Woodham Ferrers is ideal for young farmers. Marsh Farm offers regular activities alongside indoor and outdoor play areas. This year, a 'Bubble 'n' Bop' children's festival is running from July to September, and promises to be \"bursting with fun\". Visitors can also explore a trail that winds around paddocks housing sheep and goats, leads into a chicken run, past horses, and into the heart of the farm where modern piggery, cow and sheep pens are located. During summer, tractor and pony rides add an extra layer of authenticity to the farm experience.

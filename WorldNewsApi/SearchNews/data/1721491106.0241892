Norate Makeup Brush Cleaner Shoppers Say: \"I have been trying to clean my make up brushes with stuff I already have in my home and it just wasn't working very well. I saw the great reviews and the great price of this product, ordered it, and could not BELIEVE how well it works. The make up legit melts off the brushes. My brushes have not been this clean since I bought them.\" EcoTools Makeup Brush and Sponge Shampoo Shoppers Say: \"I've been skeptical about items that seem like glorified soap but got it as a gift. This cleaned my brushes like nothing else, with just a drop, a few seconds of spreading it around, and literally about 10 seconds of swishing in warm water. It was unbelievable. It took out weeks of caked on 24-hour concealer and foundation and left my brush soft and fluffy like it were brand new. I will always use this (and my brushes will always be clean!).\" Cinema Secrets Professional Makeup Brush Cleaner Minthe Makeup Brush Cleaner Mat - Pack of 2 Shoppers Say: \"I was skeptical that this product would work since I don't clean my brush a lot. This helps a lot. I was surprised that my brushes were more clean than ever and now I don't break out as easy. I recommend this to anyone else who deals with daily breakouts from using make up products.\" Golikee Makeup Brush Cleaner Mat Shoppers Say: \"I am so glad I bought this item. For a while I have been looking for something to wash and dry my makeup and facial brushes and this is it! You can dry your items upside down (hanging ) and upside up ( siting on a flat surface), the portion for cleaning brushes is a great idea. It is also compact in size, I like the fact it is made of silicone because I can disinfect with hot water and reuse it for a long time.\" Ricris Premium Makeup Brush Cleaner Shoppers Say: \"I was really behind on cleaning my makeup brushes and they looked pretty bad. I saw this product was on sale and decided to try it out. It's SO easy to clean your brushes with this!! It takes just a few minutes and there's no mess or additional towels etc needed and they come out dry so most of your brushes you can use right away. I clean my brushes much more regularly now that I have this!\" How Do I Clean My Hairbrush? Denman Hairbrush Cleaning Brush Shoppers Say: \"I was absolutely disgusted with my brush. I use a \"tangle teezer\" and it was full of dust, product lint and hair. I could only ever get some of the hair out. Just received this gadget and my brush looks brand new. It only took me 5 minutes. This is so helpful. I'd hate to keep replacing brushes due to all the lint and build up and now I don't have to!\" Ship-Shape Comb & Brush Cleaner - 2 lbs Shoppers Say: \"Used this to clean up elderly shower-averse relatives' combs and brushes that hadn't been cleaned possibly ever. First tried a hot water + Dawn soak and scrubbing which was mildly effective but too much ick stayed behind. The buildup came right off pretty much on its own in a hot bath of this Ship-Shape and everything looks AMAZINGLY clean. Dunked tweezers, scissors, nail clippers, and anything else I could think of in and everything's now remarkably clean. Adding this to the regular cleaning tasks for the household!\" How Do I Clean My Silicone Beauty Tools? La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser How Do I Clean My Jade Roller & Gua Sha Tool? Method Foaming Hand Soap - Pack of 3 Utopia Towels Cotton Washcloths Set - Pack of 24 Shoppers Say: \"Comparing reviews, I decided on these as an extra Christmas gift for my mom so she could do her face daily without running out of facecloths. I was very pleasantly surprised. These are lovely and soft but not too thick. I didn't want thick ones as they hold so much extra water and don't fold nicely in the closet either. Yes, there are threads that needed to be cut off but not one was sewed badly and the color is holding true after several washes. They even haven't shrunk into strange shapes! I'm mightily impressed.\" How Do I Clean My Metal Tweezers, Nail Clippers & More?

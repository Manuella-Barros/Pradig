With the groundswell of cities removing Confederate monuments from public view, the Red Sox want to remove a racist piece of their own history.\n\nHenry claimed that he is \"haunted\" by the legacy of former owner Tom Yawkey and his racist legacy. Yawkey Way, the street just outside Fenway Park, was named for the man who was the team's owner from 1933 to 1976. His wife, Jean Yawkey and the Yawkey Trust owned the team from his death in 1976 until Henry bought the club in 2002.\n\nYawkey is a complicated historical figure, but from 1947 to 1959 the Red Sox refused to integrate while the rest of baseball did. Boston was the final team in Major League Baseball to employ a black player when Pumpsie Green was signed in 1959.\n\nAs the linked article in the Boston Herald points out, even after the Red Sox did finally integrate in 1959, the organization wasn't exactly friendly towards players of color.\n\nThat legacy has haunted the team, and the city of Boston, for decades. Being that Yawkey Way is a public street and maintained with taxpayer dollars, changing it would make sense.\n\nHere is what Henry had to say about the issue in an email to the Herald:\n\n\"I discussed this a number of times with the previous mayoral administration and they did not want to open what they saw as a can of worms. There are a number of buildings and institutions that bear the same name. The sale of the Red Sox by John Harrington helped to fund a number of very good works in the city done by the Yawkey Foundation (we had no control over where any monies were spent). The Yawkey Foundation has done a lot of great things over the years that have nothing to do with our history.\"\n\nHenry said if it were up to him, he'd like to rename the street after David Ortiz.\n\nHe continued:\n\n\"The Red Sox don't control the naming or renaming of streets. But for me, personally, the street name has always been a consistent reminder that it is our job to ensure the Red Sox are not just multi-cultural, but stand for as many of the right things in our community as we can -- particularly in our African-American community and in the Dominican community that has embraced us so fully. The Red Sox Foundation and other organizations the Sox created such as Home Base have accomplished a lot over the last 15 years, but I am still haunted by what went on here a long time before we arrived.\"\n\nHenry finished his thoughts with this conclusion:\n\n\"We ought to be able to lead the effort and if others in the community favor a change, we would welcome it -- particularly in light of the country's current leadership stance with regard to intolerance.\"\n\nIt seems like the Red Sox are resolute in wanting to stop honoring a controversial and racist past and officially move on from what they believe was a dark part of their history.", "id": "9780831", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Red Sox Broaching Name Change for Yawkey Way Due to Racist Ex-Owner", "image": "https://usatthebiglead.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-186639973.jpg?w=640", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "209299", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "id": "303573", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baseball"}, "id": "303711", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball"}, {"label": {"eng": "African American"}, "id": "304393", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "id": "310475", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox"}, {"label": {"eng": "David Ortiz"}, "id": "310595", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ortiz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Herald"}, "id": "316414", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Herald"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}, "id": "403817", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yawkey Way"}, "id": "632062", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawkey_Way"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yawkey (MBTA station)"}, "id": "1001683", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawkey_(MBTA_station)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tom Yawkey"}, "id": "1134582", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Yawkey"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pumpsie Green"}, "id": "1139670", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpsie_Green"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of monuments and memorials of the Confederate States of America"}, "id": "1282363", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monuments_and_memorials_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jean R.

In addition to the Red Sox, that would mean the owner of a large souvenir stand across the street from Fenway Park, as well as a hamburger restaurant on the corner, he said. (The owners of the souvenir shop told the Herald they would not be opposed to a name change.)\n\n\"The different property owners would need to get together and discuss this,\" Kennedy said. \"You need a consensus to petition the city.\"\n\nYawkey came into his inheritance in 1933 at the age of 30 and promptly bought into the then all-white sport of major league baseball.\n\nThen he did what he could to keep it that way.\n\nAs other teams abandoned the color barrier, the Red Sox held out, giving Robinson a tryout and scouting Mays, but opting to sign neither. The club eventually signed Pumpsie Green as its first black player in 1959 - more than a decade after Robinson debuted for the Brooklyn Dodgers and after even Willie O'Ree took the ice for the Boston Bruins as the first black player in the NHL.\n\nYawkey owned the club until his death in 1976, when his wife, Jean, took control. She died and left the ballclub in the care of a foundation that bore their name; trustee John Harrington ran the team until it was sold to Henry and his partners in 2002.\n\n\"When we got here in 2002, one of the first things (Henry) did was acknowledge the shameful past in terms of race relations and inclusion,\" Kennedy said.\n\nStill, the team has struggled to accomplish its goal of making Fenway more welcoming to minorities.\n\nIn May, Orioles outfielder Adam Jones said a fan called him a racist slur; Kennedy apologized. The same week, a fan was banned from the ballpark for life for using a variant of the N-word while speaking to another fan about the national anthem singer.\n\nThe Red Sox also distanced themselves from their flagship radio broadcaster, WEEI, where hosts doubted Jones' version of the events; former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling also said Jones was lying.\n\nHenry told the Herald that he had previously approached the city about changing the name, but Mayor Tom Menino \"did not want to open what they saw as a can of worms.\" The Yawkey Foundation, which was funded largely by the $700 million Henry's group paid for the team, has been a philanthropic force in Boston for the past 15 years.\n\n\"The Yawkey Foundation has done a lot of great things over the years that have nothing to do with our history,\" Henry told the paper.\n\nAmong the things in Boston named for Yawkey are an athletic building at Boston College and the Red Sox Most Valuable Player Award bestowed by the local chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America.\n\nHenry told the Herald he would like to see the street renamed for David Ortiz; the city has already named an extension of the road after the former Red Sox slugger, who retired last year.\n\n\"That's a conversation for another day,\" Kennedy said.", "id": "9805753", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Red Sox owner wants to

In addition to the Red Sox, that would mean the owner of a large souvenir stand across the street from Fenway Park, as well as a hamburger restaurant on the corner, he said. (The owners of the souvenir shop told the Herald they would not be opposed to a name change.)\n\n\"The different property owners would need to get together and discuss this,\" Kennedy said. \"You need a consensus to petition the city.\"\n\nYawkey came into his inheritance in 1933 at the age of 30 and promptly bought into the all-white sport of major league baseball.\n\nThen he did what he could to keep it that way.\n\nAs other teams abandoned the color barrier, the Red Sox held out, giving Robinson a tryout and scouting Mays but opting to sign neither. The club eventually signed Pumpsie Green as its first black player in 1959 -- more than a decade after Robinson debuted for the Brooklyn Dodgers and after even Willie O'Ree took the ice for the Boston Bruins as the first black player in the NHL.\n\nYawkey owned the club until his death in 1976, when his wife, Jean, took control. She died and left the ballclub in the care of a foundation that bore their name; trustee John Harrington ran the team until it was sold to Henry and his partners in 2002.\n\n\"When we got here in 2002, one of the first things (Henry) did was acknowledge the shameful past in terms of race relations and inclusion,\" Kennedy said.\n\nStill, the team has struggled to accomplish its goal of making Fenway more welcoming to minorities.\n\nIn May, Orioles outfielder Adam Jones said a fan called him a racist slur ; Kennedy apologized. The same week, a fan was banned from the ballpark for life for using a variant of the N-word while speaking to another fan about the national anthem singer.\n\nThe Red Sox also distanced themselves from their flagship radio broadcaster, WEEI, where hosts doubted Jones' version of the events; former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling also said Jones was lying.\n\nHenry told the Herald that he had previously approached the city before about changing the name, but mayor Tom Menino \"did not want to open what they saw as a can of worms.\" The Yawkey Foundation, which was funded largely by the $700 million Henry's group paid for the team, has been a philanthropic force in Boston for the past 15 years.\n\n\"The Yawkey Foundation has done a lot of great things over the years that have nothing to do with our history,\" Henry told the paper.\n\nAmong the things in Boston named for Yawkey are an athletic building at Boston College and the Red Sox Most Valuable Player Award bestowed by the local chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America.\n\nHenry told the paper he would like to see the street renamed for David Ortiz; the city has already named an extension of the road after the former Red Sox slugger , who retired last year.\n\n\"That's a conversation for another day,\" Kennedy said.", "id": "9809043", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Red Sox owner John

(Jim Rogash/Getty Images)\n\nThe Boston Red Sox want to confront their racist past and change the name of iconic Yawkey Way.\n\nThe street, a two-block portion of public roadway that runs in front of Fenway Park, is named for Tom Yawkey, who owned the team from 1933 until his death in 1976, and whose widow and family trust owned it until 2002.\n\nYawkey's tenure is tainted by a racist legacy which includes the franchise being the last Major League team to integrate in 1959, 12 years after Jackie Robinson became the first African-American in the Majors.\n\nJohn Henry, who purchased the team from the Yawkeys, told the Boston Herald he is \"haunted\" by the racist legacy that lingers from Yawkey's ownership and the time is right for change.\n\nIn an email to the Herald, Henry said:\n\n\"I discussed this a number of times with the previous mayoral administration and they did not want to open what they saw as a can of worms,\" Henry wrote in the email. \"There are a number of buildings and institutions that bear the same name. The sale of the Red Sox by John Harrington helped to fund a number of very good works in the city done by the Yawkey Foundation [we had no control over where any monies were spent]. The Yawkey Foundation has done a lot of great things over the years that have nothing to do with our history.\"\n\nHenry said he would like to see it changed to David Ortiz Way or Big Papi Way, in honour of the Dominican Republic-born Red Sox great who retired following last season. A portion of the street was named David Ortiz Drive in his honour this past June.\n\n\"The Red Sox don't control the naming or renaming of streets,\" Henry said. \"But for me, personally, the street name has always been a consistent reminder that it is our job to ensure the Red Sox are not just multi-cultural, but stand for as many of the right things in our community as we can -- particularly in our African-American community and in the Dominican community that has embraced us so fully.

In addition to the Red Sox, that would mean the owner of a large souvenir stand across the street from Fenway Park, as well as a hamburger restaurant on the corner, he said. (The owners of the souvenir shop told the Herald they would not be opposed to a name change.)\n\n\"The different property owners would need to get together and discuss this,\" Kennedy said. \"You need a consensus to petition the city.\"\n\nYawkey came into his inheritance in 1933 at the age of 30 and promptly bought into the all-white sport of major league baseball.\n\nThen he did what he could to keep it that way.\n\nThis Aug. 22, 1948 file photo shows Brooklyn Dodgers Jackie Robinson, right, stealing home plate as Boston Braves' catcher Bill Salkeld is thrown off-balance on the throw to the plate during the fifth inning at Ebbets Field in New York.

Even so, the Boston Red Sox are reportedly working on moving away from a name that was long attached to the franchise -- Yawkey.\n\nAccording to the Boston Herald, the Boston Red Sox are looking to change the name of Yawkey Way, the street the runs alongside Fenway Park that acts as a welcoming market place for fans on game days.\n\nFrom the Herald:\n\n\"Red Sox principal owner John Henry, saying he's still \"haunted\" by the racist legacy of his legendary predecessor Tom Yawkey, told the Herald that his franchise welcomes renaming Yawkey Way. The Sox, he said, should take the lead in the process of rebranding the Jersey Street extension outside Fenway Park that was renamed to honor the former owner in 1977.\"\n\nThe Yawkey name is deeply entrenched in Red Sox lore. But nowadays, it represents a less-desirable aspect of the team's past. Yawkey was famously resistant to the signing of African American players, including the team's choice to pass a prospective player named Jackie Robinson (who famously went on to break the color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers).\n\nInstead, the Red Sox went on to become the last team in the majors to break the color barrier with the signing of Pumpsie Green in 1959.\n\nThe Red Sox have been active in street naming as of late.

I never had it anywhere else.\"\n\nThe renaming of the public street is ultimately up to the city of Boston, not the Red Sox, but Henry suggested the street be renamed after David Ortiz instead.\n\nTags: boston red sox mlb john henry boston Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "id": "9775698", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Red Sox owner in favor of renaming Yawkey Way outside Fenway", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3420615.1503000844!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/186639973.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "209299", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "219173", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "id": "303571", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher"}, {"label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "id": "303573", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball"}, {"label": {"eng": "African American"}, "id": "304393", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"}, {"label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}, "id": "305788", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "id": "310475", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}, "id": "310660", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles"}, {"label": {"eng": "American League"}, "id": "310669", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "id": "312580", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger"}, {"label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "id": "312732", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Herald"}, "id": "316414", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Herald"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jackie Robinson"}, "id": "348632", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Robinson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baseball color line"}, "id": "348637", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_color_line"}, {"label": {"eng": "CC Sabathia"}, "id": "403816", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC_Sabathia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}, "id": "403817", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yawkey Way"}, "id": "632062", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawkey_Way"}, {"label": {"eng": "History of the Brooklyn Dodgers"}, "id": "680293", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Brooklyn_Dodgers"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yawkey (MBTA station)"}, "id": "1001683", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawkey_(MBTA_station)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tom Yawkey"}, "id": "1134582", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Yawkey"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pumpsie Green"}, "id": "1139670", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpsie_Green"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of ethnic slurs"}, "id": "1366306", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_slurs"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of African-American firsts"}, "id": "1366357", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African-American_firsts"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 381, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 757, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African"}], "time": "20:56:00"}

They didn't add a black player to their ranks until 1959, 12 years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. At the time, owner Tom Yawkey was accused of being a racist. And now, all these years later, the Red Sox want to eliminate a piece of his legacy because of it.\n\n[Now's the time to sign up for Fantasy Football! Join for free]\n\nCurrent Red Sox owner John Henry told the Boston Herald, in a story that published Thursday, that he wants to change the name of Yawkey Way, the street outside of Fenway Park that's a pre-game entry point and popular gathering spot. Henry told The Herald that he is \"haunted\" over the racial issues in the Red Sox's past and would prefer to change the name of the street \"if others in the community favor a change.\"\n\nHenry suggests renaming it after recently retired slugger Davis Ortiz. Here's more from The Herald's Michael Silverman:\n\nThe team is not trying to erase its history, but as Henry said, the time is right for the change and the conversation about race that it will spark.\n\n\"I discussed this a number of times with the previous mayoral administration and they did not want to open what they saw as a can of worms,\" said Henry in an email. \"There are a number of buildings and institutions that bear the same name. The sale of the Red Sox by John Harrington helped to fund a number of very good works in the city done by the Yawkey Foundation (we had no control over where any monies were spent). The Yawkey Foundation has done a lot of great things over the years that have nothing to do with our history.\"\n\nIf it were up to Henry, he would rename the street \"David Ortiz Way\" or \"Big Papi Way.\" But before a new name is considered, the name change process needs to start with Henry and the one other Yawkey Way abutter petitioning the City of Boston for approval.\n\n\"The Red Sox don't control the naming or renaming of streets,\" Henry said. \"But for me, personally, the street name has always been a consistent reminder that it is our job to ensure the Red Sox are not just multi-cultural, but stand for as many of the right things in our community as we can - particularly in our African-American community and in the Dominican community that has embraced us so fully. The Red Sox Foundation and other organizations the Sox created such as Home Base have accomplished a lot over the last 15 years, but I am still haunted by what went on here a long time before we arrived.\"\n\nYawkey Way got its name in 1977, a year after Yawkey died. He'd overseen the team since 1933. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1980.\n\nHenry is right that the Red Sox don't control the naming of streets, but, according to The Herald, it doesn't sound like this process would be too tough. Since it's not a residential street, changing the name of Yawkey Way would only require the approval of two businesses -- the Red Sox and The '47 Brand, which is also on Yawkey Way. Henry says the Red Sox have already talked to current employees who worked under the Yawkeys -- Tom's wife Jean took over as owner after his death -- and they were OK with changing the name.\n\nBobby D'Angelo of '47 Brand told The Herald that he's in favor of changing the name too:\n\n\"Honestly, we're not talking about a human being here, we're talking about the name of a street,\" he said. \"I can't lose sleep over Yawkey Way changing its name, there's just too many other things in this world to worry about. That's the last thing we would worry about.\"\n\nIt probably won't be that easy in the court of public opinion. As recent events in the country have shown, the tangling of race and history is a hot-button issue that is sure to inspire some angry opinions.\n\nRead More\n\nThis isn't a Confederate monument we're talking about, so the renaming of Yawkey Way shouldn't inspire a Charlottesville-type protest, but the same people who get mad because statues are getting taken down are very likely to get mad at the Red Sox for this.\n\nHenry said the Boston City Council previously didn't want to open a can of worms with this issue in the past. Well, the can is open now.\n\nMore MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports:\n\n- - - - - -\n\nMike Oz is the editor of Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?

The Sox, he said, should take the lead in the process of rebranding the Jersey Street extension outside Fenway Park that was renamed to honor the former owner in 1977.\n\nYawkey's legacy as owner from 1933 to 1976, and then by his widow Jean Yawkey and the Yawkey Trust until Henry bought the team in 2002, was as complicated as it was lengthy.\n\nAn inescapable, significant and enduring part of the Yawkey legacy is a racist one, and Yawkey -- a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame -- oversaw the 12 year-stretch from 1947 to 1959 in which the Red Sox watched every other team in Major League Baseball integrate before they became the last club to do so. That residue will not disappear when Yawkey Way is renamed, but it also does not need to diminish the positive impact the Yawkey Trust, funded primarily by the $700 million sale of the team when Henry came aboard, still makes today for multiple worthy causes in Boston and New England.\n\nIt's also where the Red Sox conduct their business and on game days hold permanent rights, after reaching a controversial deal with the city in 2013, to close the street and sell concessions.\n\nThe team is not trying to erase its history, but as Henry said, the time is right for the change and the conversation about race that it will spark.\n\n\"I discussed this a number of times with the previous mayoral administration and they did not want to open what they saw as a can of worms,\" said Henry in an email. \"There are a number of buildings and institutions that bear the same name. The sale of the Red Sox by John Harrington helped to fund a number of very good works in the city done by the Yawkey Foundation (we had no control over where any monies were spent). The Yawkey Foundation has done a lot of great things over the years that have nothing to do with our history.\"\n\nIf it were up to Henry, he would rename the street \"David Ortiz Way\" or \"Big Papi Way.\" But before a new name is considered, the name change process needs to start with Henry and the one other Yawkey Way abutter petitioning the City of Boston for approval.\n\n\"The Red Sox don't control the naming or renaming of streets,\" Henry said. \"But for me, personally, the street name has always been a consistent reminder that it is our job to ensure the Red Sox are not just multi-cultural, but stand for as many of the right things in our community as we can - particularly in our African-American community and in the Dominican community that has embraced us so fully. The Red Sox Foundation and other organizations the Sox created such as Home Base have accomplished a lot over the last 15 years, but I am still haunted by what went on here a long time before we arrived.\"\n\nEven after the Red Sox became the final MLB team to integrate in 1959, the climate often remained chilly and hostile to players of color.\n\nThe Sox skipped the opportunity to sign Jackie Robinson two years before the Dodgers signed him to break the MLB color barrier, and then again passed on a shot to sign Willie Mays two years after baseball was integrated by Robinson in 1947. Yawkey and his associates didn't find an African-American player worthy to make their team until Pumpsie Green joined in 1959.\n\nUnder general managers Dick O'Connell (1961-62, 1965-77) and Dan Duquette (1994-2002) in particular, the Red Sox' roster construction began to be handled with a far more color-blind style, and the complexion of the Red Sox began to resemble other teams. African-American and Latino players were signed in greater numbers but racial issues did not disappear. Former outfielder and coach Tommy Harper's 1986 Elks Club anti-discrimination lawsuit was one lowlight, with Harper noting that the gathering spot in the club's Winter Haven, Fla., spring training home was still segregated.\n\nWhile this year's Red Sox team fields more position players of color and Hispanics on an everyday basis than any in recent history, the current ownership has not been able to escape being thrust into ugly racial episodes.\n\nStarter David Price reported that he has heard racial taunts while warming up in the bullpen at Fenway last year.\n\nIn May, Baltimore center fielder Adam Jones reported that he heard the a racial slur directed at him plus had a bag of peanuts thrown at him.\n\nThe Red Sox reacted swiftly to the Jones incident, vowing to do whatever they could to make their ballpark a safe haven from racism.\n\nThe Red Sox, who still have many employees who worked under Jean Yawkey and remember her fondly, began an internal discussion about changing the name of the street which gives Fenway Park - 4 Yawkey Way - its address.\n\nThey reached consensus, Henry said, to favor a name change.\n\n\"\"We ought to be able to lead the effort and if others in the community favor a change, we would welcome it - particularly in light of the country's current leadership stance with regard to intolerance,\" Henry said.\n\nPractically speaking, the process for renaming a public street in Boston where there are no residents and only businesses requires a petition to be launched by the abutters. The petition requires 100 percent of the abutters to sign it.\n\nOf the six parcels with Yawkey Way addresses, there are only two abutters: Henry's Red Sox and the D'Angelo family, owners of '47 Brand and the merchandise shops across the street from Fenway.\n\nThe D'Angelos are on board with a name change.\n\n\"I understand the way the climate is around the Red Sox that they would potentially want to do something like that,\" said Bobby D'Angelo, son of the formerly named Twins souvenir shop's founder Arthur D'Angelo.\n\nD'Angelo, who spoke before Henry said he welcomed a name change, said re-naming the street would \"not be a big deal at all.\"\n\n\"Honestly, we're not talking about a human being here, we're talking about the name of a street,\" he said. \"I can't lose sleep over Yawkey Way changing its name, there's just too many other things in this world to worry about. That's the last thing we would worry about.\n\n\"We don't look at this thing as a monumental change. It may be in the city's eyes, a Yawkey Way name change, but the only thing it changes is our stationery. Besides that, that's life.\"\n\nIf the abutters petition the city for a name change, the Public Improvement Commission would then hold a hearing to consider a new street name.", "id": "9809010",

In addition to the Red Sox, that would mean the owner of a large souvenir stand across the street from Fenway Park, as well as a hamburger restaurant on the corner, he said. (The owners of the souvenir shop told the Herald they would not be opposed to a name change.)\n\n\"The different property owners would need to get together and discuss this,\" Kennedy said. \"You need a consensus to petition the city.\"\n\nYawkey came into his inheritance in 1933 at the age of 30 and promptly bought into the all-white sport of major league baseball.\n\nThen he did what he could to keep it that way.\n\nAs other teams abandoned the color barrier, the Red Sox held out, giving Robinson a tryout and scouting Mays but opting to sign neither. The club eventually signed Pumpsie Green as its first black player in 1959 -- more than a decade after Robinson debuted for the Brooklyn Dodgers and after even Willie O'Ree took the ice for the Boston Bruins as the first black player in the NHL.\n\nYawkey owned the club until his death in 1976, when his wife, Jean, took control. She died and left the ballclub in the care of a foundation that bore their name; trustee John Harrington ran the team until it was sold to Henry and his partners in 2002.\n\n\"When we got here in 2002, one of the first things (Henry) did was acknowledge the shameful past in terms of race relations and inclusion,\" Kennedy said.\n\nStill, the team has struggled to accomplish its goal of making Fenway more welcoming to minorities.\n\nIn May, Orioles outfielder Adam Jones said a fan called him a racist slur ; Kennedy apologized. The same week, a fan was banned from the ballpark for life for using a variant of the N-word while speaking to another fan about the national anthem singer.\n\nThe Red Sox also distanced themselves from their flagship radio broadcaster, WEEI, where hosts doubted Jones' version of the events; former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling also said Jones was lying.\n\nHenry told the Herald that he had previously approached the city before about changing the name, but mayor Tom Menino \"did not want to open what they saw as a can of worms.\" The Yawkey Foundation, which was funded largely by the $700 million Henry's group paid for the team, has been a philanthropic force in Boston for the past 15 years.\n\n\"The Yawkey Foundation has done a lot of great things over the years that have nothing to do with our history,\" Henry told the paper.\n\nAmong the things in Boston named for Yawkey are an athletic building at Boston College and the Red Sox Most Valuable Player Award bestowed by the local chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America.\n\nHenry told the paper he would like to see the street renamed for David Ortiz; the city has already named an extension of the road after the former Red Sox slugger , who retired last year.\n\n\"That's a conversation for another day,\" Kennedy said.", "id": "9795126", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Haunted by legacy, Red

It's been a fixture for quite a while.\n\nSome might not know that it's named after former Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey, however, and his legacy includes being the last major-league owner to integrate his team. The Red Sox sat by for 12 years while every other baseball team signed a black player before doing so.\n\nIn light of this, current Red Sox owner John Henry told the Boston Herald that he is \"haunted\" by this legacy and would like to lead an effort to rename Yawkey Way.\n\n\"The Red Sox don't control the naming or renaming of streets,\" Henry said. \"But for me, personally, the street name has always been a consistent reminder that it is our job to ensure the Red Sox are not just multi-cultural, but stand for as many of the right things in our community as we can - particularly in our African-American community and in the Dominican community that has embraced us so fully. The Red Sox Foundation and other organizations the Sox created such as Home Base have accomplished a lot over the last 15 years, but I am still haunted by what went on here a long time before we arrived.\"\n\nHenry said a lot more, so for those interested definitely hop over to bostonherald.com.\n\nOne item of particular interest?\n\nHenry would like to rename the street either \"David Ortiz Way\" or \"Big Papi Way.\" A nearby street was already renamed \"David Ortiz Drive\" when the Red Sox retired Ortiz's No. 34 in June.\n\nIt's not up to Henry, as he pointed out multiple times, because it's a city street. Still, the Red Sox are a huge part of Boston and Ortiz is an icon there.

Yawkey Way is named after former team owner Tom Yawkey, a Baseball Hall of Famer who owned the team from 1933 until his death in 1976. Yawkey was accused of being a racist during his tenure as the team's owner because of how long it took the Red Sox to employ a black player (1959, making them the last team in the majors to integrate).\n\nCurrent Red Sox owner John Henry wants to make a change. Henry said to the Boston Herald on Thursday that the club would lead the charge to rename Yawkey Way.\n\nRed Sox principal owner John Henry, saying he's still \"haunted\" by the racist legacy of his legendary predecessor Tom Yawkey, told the Herald that his franchise welcomes renaming Yawkey Way. The Sox, he said, should take the lead in the process of rebranding the Jersey Street extension outside Fenway Park that was renamed to honor the former owner in 1977.\n\nBut Henry just can't snap his fingers and make the change - the city of Boston will need to make the change after an official petition from the Red Sox and the one other abutter of the road.\n\nThat might not be too difficult - there are only two abutters on Yawkey Way, and the other one is receptive to the viewpoint of Henry and the Red Sox.\n\nOf the six parcels with Yawkey Way addresses, there are only two abutters: Henry's Red Sox and the D'Angelo family, owners of '47 Brand and the merchandise shops across the street from Fenway.\n\nThe D'Angelos are on board with a name change.\n\n\"I understand the way the climate is around the Red Sox that they would potentially want to do something like that,\" said Bobby D'Angelo, son of the formerly named Twins souvenir shop's founder Arthur D'Angelo.\n\nD'Angelo, who spoke before Henry said he welcomed a name change, said re-naming the street would \"not be a big deal at all.\"\n\nHenry also claimed that the team's employees reached a consensus regarding a name change.\n\n\"\"We ought to be able to lead the effort and if others in the community favor a change, we would welcome it - particularly in light of the country's current leadership stance with regard to intolerance,\" Henry said.\n\nRacial issues at Fenway Park have been a hot button topic this season following Adam Jones' claims that fans yelled racial slurs at him during a Red Sox-Orioles game in May.\n\nAs for a potential new name for the street, Henry had a pair of suggestions: David Ortiz Way or Big Papi Way.

Henry told The Boston Herald on Thursday.\n\nYawkey Way, which runs alongside the team's Fenway Park, is named for Tom Yawkey, who owned the franchise from 1933 to 1976. Under his leadership, the Red Sox passed on the chance to sign Jackie Robinson -- who broke Major League Baseball's color barrier for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947 -- and did not sign their first black player until 1959.\n\nYawkey's stance against signing black players reportedly cost the Red Sox a chance to sign Hall of Famer Willie Mays, and made the franchise the last team in baseball to integrate its roster.\n\nYawkey died in 1976, and the street outside Fenway was named for him a year later. But that could change if Henry gets his way.\n\n\"For me, personally, the street name has always been a consistent reminder that it is our job to ensure the Red Sox are not just multi-cultural, but stand for as many of the right things in our community as we can - particularly in our African-American community and in the Dominican community that has embraced us so fully,\" Henry told the Herald.\n\nHenry, who bought the Red Sox in 2002, added that he is \"still haunted by what went on here a long time before we arrived.\"\n\nYawkey resisted signing black players until every other Major League team already had, but that was not the end of his list of offenses.\n\nHe reportedly used a racial slur to dismiss Robinson from a tryout for the team, according to the Boston Globe. Robinson later blamed Yawkey for the persistence of baseball's unwritten ban on black players, and once referred to him as \"the most bigoted man in baseball,\" the journalist Howard Bryant, a Boston native who previously worked for the Herald, wrote in his book Shut Out: A Story of Race and Baseball in Boston.\n\nBlack players have long regarded Boston as an undesirable destination thanks to its reputation as a hostile place for African-Americans to play.\n\n\"Many black ballplayers over the years, starting with Jackie Robinson and funneling down, from David Justice, Albert Belle, and Tim Raines, to Gary Sheffield and Dave Winfield, have all either expressed hesitancy about playing in Boston or inserted language into their contracts that expressly prevented them from ever being traded to the Red Sox,\" Bryant wrote in his book.\n\nBoston newspaper columnists and websites have called for changes to the name of Yawkey Way for years, especially as black baseball players have continued to face racial taunts from fans inside Fenway. The street's name, columnist Ron Chimelis wrote in 2014, \"stands as a big, ugly blotch on the multi-colored complexion of the modern Red Sox.\"\n\nWe ought to be able to lead the effort...particularly in light of the country's current leadership stance with regard to intolerance. Red Sox owner John W. Henry\n\nAnd even though Boston's roster now features a number of prominent black and Latino players, some Major Leaguers still consider Fenway the worst environment in baseball for black players.\n\nIn January, Red Sox pitcher David Price told the Boston Globe that he had heard racial taunts from fans while warming up in the bullpen during the 2016 season. Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones, meanwhile, told USA Today that he was \"called the N-word a handful of times\" by fans during a game in May.\n\nThe Red Sox organization and Henry apologized to Jones, and the incident apparently sparked the decision to try to change the name of Yawkey Way, Henry told the Herald. The owner also appeared to reference President Donald Trump, albeit not by name, as a reason to seek the change now.\n\n\"We ought to be able to lead the effort and if others in the community favor a change, we would welcome it -- particularly in light of the country's current leadership stance with regard to intolerance,\" Henry said.\n\nThe change will no doubt spark controversy among Red Sox fans. Yawkey Way is a popular gathering place before and after games, and over the years has become an iconic part of Fenway Park's history.\n\nThe owner of the only other business on the street, however, also supports changing its name, according to the Herald. So even though the Red Sox do not have the authority to change the street's name, its days as Yawkey Way could be numbered.\n\nStill, given the number of times black players in all sports have said they have heard racial slurs from Boston sports fans, renaming the street will only be a first step toward making the city's sports venues more hospitable places for black athletes and fans to visit.", "id": "9788958", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Red Sox Will Push To Change Fenway Park Street Named For Racist Former Owner", "image":

The occasional generational talent that would arrive (Ted Williams, most notably) would wither away via futility and frugality. Part of this was because of a stubborn inability to see obviously emerging trends, his most famous failure born from bigotry.\n\nThe Red Sox were the last team in Major League Baseball to integrate, in 1959, a full 12 seasons after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Brooklyn. Yawkey was so opposed to employing a black player, he chose, for a dozen seasons, to run his team at a decided competitive disadvantage. He demonstrably cared more about having an all-white team than winning.\n\nHe actually could have signed Robinson. In 1945, Boston politicians forced the Red Sox to have a tryout for African-American players under threat that they wouldn't allow games to be played on Sunday. Robinson was one of three players brought to a sham of a workout. Robinson impressed the assembled media and some scouts, but never stood a chance with Yawkey.\n\nInstead, Robinson soon signed a minor-league deal with Brooklyn, joined the majors a season later and went on to an iconic, Hall of Fame career. Pair him with Williams in the middle of the late 1940s Red Sox lineup, and perhaps that Red Sox World Series drought ends six decades earlier.\n\nJohn Henry is a great baseball owner. In 2002 he bought the Sox from the Yawkey Trust and has delivered three World Series titles, a modernized Fenway Park and a complete overhaul in the team's racial progressiveness.\n\nYet he can't get over that in 1977, the City of Boston honored the then-recently deceased Yawkey by renaming a tight sliver of a street that runs along the left field line outside Fenway after him. Yawkey Way has been its name ever since. These days, during the season, it is shut down and used as a pregame fan gathering, drinking and dining spot.\n\n\"Haunted,\" Henry said in an email to the Boston Herald, citing Yawkey's racism.\n\nAnd he'd like to see the street name changed to something else. The Red Sox don't own the street. The city does, so it's not an organizational decision. Henry said city politicians have rebuffed him in the past because they didn't want to \"open a can of worms.\"\n\nAfter incidents and a terrorist attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend, and \"in light of the country's current leadership stance with regard to intolerance,\" Henry said he is going to try to open that can all by himself. Here's a billionaire businessman going after Donald Trump via Tom Yawkey Way.\n\n\"For me, personally, the street name has always been a consistent reminder that it is our job to ensure the Red Sox are not just multi-cultural, but stand for as many of the right things in our community as we can - particularly in our African-American community and in the Dominican community that has embraced us so fully,\" Henry told the Herald. \"I am still haunted by what went on here before I arrived.\"\n\nThe city owns the streets and a city is owned by its residents. Like with any of these issues, including statues commemorating Confederate heroes, it is fair and proper for the people of the city to determine who gets honored, whether in the first place or as time passes.\n\nA democratic process is the appropriate remedy here. Either the people get to vote on the issue directly by ballot, or their elected officials decide via feedback from their constituents. Fair is fair. In this case, the process involves everyone with a Yawkey Way address to agree to have the issue heard by the Public Improvement Commission. There are but two such abutters, buildings owned by Henry and one by a merchandise shop, which is on board with the name change.\n\nRead More\n\nA politician thought it was appropriate to take the then-Jersey Extension and name it after Tom Yawkey in the first place. So it is fine if a politician, or political process, decides to name it something else.\n\nTimes change. Cities change. Street names can change, too.\n\nHenry said he'd like to name it David Ortiz Way or Big Papi Way, after the beloved former star originally from the Dominican Republic. Maybe Jimmy Fund Way (after the Sox longstanding charity) or Pumpsie Green Way (the team's first African-American player) would suffice, also.\n\nMainly, Henry just doesn't want Yawkey Way, even though he made sure to praise the Yawkey Foundation, which has used the $700 million in proceeds from the sale of the team to fund important work in and around Boston.\n\nIs it fair to rename the street? There should be a hesitation in applying 2017 standards to historical figures. History doesn't fit into a perfect box. It's complicated, messy and gray. People are capable of doing both great things and terrible things, having clear vision and blind spots.\n\nBoston was founded in 1630 and is a city proud of its past, particularly its part in the founding of the country. Yet none of the people then lived like people do now. Societal norms evolve. What passed for heroes and progressive thinking in the past doesn't always today.\n\nTo simply punish everyone for being born when they were born, even if they fought for the concepts that in turn developed this nation into what it became, would be short-sighted.\n\nWhen it comes to Yawkey, however, there is this: he isn't just considered regressive by the standards of today, he was considered regressive by the standards of his day.\n\nChanging the name of the street to reflect current life in Boston doesn't eliminate Tom Yawkey from the history. Indeed, everyone should continue to learn from his mistaken thinking. A plaque outside Fenway telling his full story would be far more appropriate, and powerful, than a street sign bearing his name.\n\nIf anything, change can be educational.\n\n\"We ought to be able to lead the effort,\" Henry said. \"And if others in the community favor a change, we would welcome it.\"\n\nNear the Fens of Boston, a long way from Charlottesville, Donald Trump or the Confederacy, the issue moves on in an unexpected manner, right into the history of baseball.", "id": "9809021", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Let the people of Boston decide the fate of Yawkey Way",

His widow, Jean Yawkey, and the Yawkey Trust held the team until Henry bought the team in 2002.\n\n--\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\n--\n\nInformation from: Boston Herald, http://www.bostonherald.com", "id": "9779398", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Haunted by legacy, Red Sox owner wants to rename Yawkey Way | FOX Sports", "image": "https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2016/12/default_image.vresize.440.220.high.0.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "209299", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "id": "303573", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baseball"}, "id": "303711", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball"}, {"label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}, "id": "304985", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "id": "310475", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baseball park"}, "id": "310553", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_park"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}, "id": "315690", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Herald"}, "id": "316414", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Herald"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jackie Robinson"}, "id": "348632", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Robinson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}, "id": "403817", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yawkey Way"}, "id": "632062", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawkey_Way"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yawkey (MBTA station)"}, "id": "1001683", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawkey_(MBTA_station)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Willie O'Ree"}, "id": "1129525", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_O'Ree"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tom Yawkey"}, "id": "1134582", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Yawkey"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jean R.

This is this just something that we've been talking about for a while.\n\n\"We know that there are a number of our fans who have felt uncomfortable coming to Fenway Park, especially people of color, and we've always felt we want to be inclusive, no matter what someone's color of their skin is, and this is just a way we thought of doing it for a long time.\"\n\nHenry told the Herald that the Red Sox tried to rename Yawkey Way many years ago, but the administration of former Mayor Thomas M.

Red Sox president Sam Kennedy told The Associated Press it was part of the team's effort to make everyone feel welcome at the Fenway Park. Henry did not return a message from the AP seeking comment.\n\nUnder Yawkey, the Red Sox were the last franchise in the major leagues to field a black player. That was in 1959, more than a decade after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier with the Dodgers.\n\nBut even this season, the team has struggled to make the ballpark feel welcoming to minorities. In May, Kennedy apologized to Orioles outfielder Adam Jones after he said a fan called him a racist slur. The Red Sox also distanced themselves from their flagship radio broadcaster, where hosts doubted Jones' version of the events.\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data?

Yawkey, who owned the Red Sox from 1933 to 1976, has the famed street to the west of Fenway Park named after him, as well as the MBTA commuter rail station near the ballpark. A new bill is petitioning to have the name of the station changed to something that is \"consistent with and reflects the values of the commonwealth.\"\n\nThe bill is sponsored by Reps. Ruth B. Balser of Newton and Byron Rushing of Boston. The full text of the measure is not yet online, but was provided to DigBoston.\n\n\"I think [the proposed bill] makes perfect sense,\" says Segun Idowu, a racial justice organizer and co-organizer for Boston Police Camera Action Team. \"I'm confused how it's named 'Yawkey' anyway, in light of what we know about him.\" In fact, in a Thursday story in the Boston Herald, Red Sox principal owner John Henry is quoted as saying the franchise should lead the effort to rename Yawkey Way, saying the club is still \"haunted\" by the former owner's legacy.\n\nYawkey the man's history, like that of many others, is complicated. He was a philanthropist whose foundations have given a great deal of money to cancer research and treatment in the City of Boston, including building the Yawkey Center for Cancer Care at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He also donated 20,000 acres of land in South Carolina as a wildlife preserve upon his death.\n\nBut under Yawkey, the Red Sox were the last team in Major League Baseball to integrate, not signing Pumpsie Green until 1959, a full 12 years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in the league. And, while it's not confirmed who yelled a racial slur in the direction of Black players, including Robinson, who worked out before the team in 1945, it is speculated that the words came from Yawkey.\n\nIn a 1965 Sports Illustrated interview, Yawkey lamented that people blamed him for the Red Sox's slow move to integration, and attempted to defend himself against the charges. \"I have no feeling against colored people... But they are clannish, and when that story got around that we didn't want Negroes, they all decided to sign with some other club,\" he told the magazine. \"Actually, we scouted them all along, but we didn't want one because he was a Negro, we wanted a ballplayer.\"\n\nThe Yawkey commuter rail stop was opened on April 29, 1988. Used initially only for special service to Fenway Park on game days, it was used by trains on the Framingham Line, as well as by \"Fenway Flyer\" trains on the Attleboro (now Providence/Stoughton) and Franklin Lines. Regular commuter service began in 2001, and in 2014 the MBTA re-opened it as a brand new, full-service station on the Framingham/Worcester Line.\n\nToday, Yawkey Station is a beautiful sight to behold. It's futuristic, majestic, and sparkling. Visible from the Mass Pike, you can't help but notice it as you drive by. But some people argue that its name tarnishes the gorgeous new infrastructure.\n\nWhen the renovated and expanded station debuted in 2014, Larry Lucchino, then-president and chief executive officer of the Boston Red Sox, told the Boston Globe, \"The renovated Yawkey Way commuter rail station and the expanded Worcester-Framingham rail schedule will have a profound impact on many of our fans who use public transportation.\"\n\nBut for some Massachusetts residents and baseball fans, seeing Tom Yawkey's name honored with its own station has a profoundly negative impact on them. Day in and day out, the station serves as a reminder not only of Boston's racist history, but of the fact that the city and state are still willing to celebrate people who engaged in racist and oppressive behavior.\n\nIdowu says that while renaming these significant points in Boston where people gather is important, it is also important that legislators are not just focusing on symbols.\n\n\"If this bill says it wants to make sure our symbols are consistent with Massachusetts values, my hope is if it passes, they will also pass legislation that is in line with those values, like prison reform and [bills to support communities of color in the marijuana industry],\" he says. \"I think the communities who would be offended and brought down by the symbols we have up, these same communities are also tired of only being given symbolic victories. Let's also make sure people of color are not being discriminated against in the transportation realm when we file transportation bills.\"\n\nThis bill, filed long before the events in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend, becomes incredibly prescient to the ongoing conversation around whether there is a place for things like Confederate monuments and symbols that honor people with racist history in this country. As Boston prepares for white supremacists to descend on the city for a \"Free Speech Rally\" this weekend, we have an opportunity to examine who we want to be and what legacy we want to present to the world. Taking a hard look at who our monuments and streets and public stations are named for is one way of doing that.\n\nIf the bill is approved, a special commission would be assigned to create a new name for the station. The commission would include a wide array of people, including a representative for the Secretary of Transportation, people appointed by both the House and Senate, a racial justice expert, someone from the Fenway neighborhood community, someone from the Boston NAACP, and someone from the Red Sox organization, among others. Zineb Curren, Senior Director of Corporate Communications for the Red Sox, told DigBoston that the team is \"aware of the bill, and since it has not passed, there is no committee or participation from the club at this time.\"\n\n\"There's a fair number of people who are very concerned with the history of Mr. Yawkey,\" the bill's co-sponsor, Rep. Balser told DigBoston. \"There is considerable evidence that Yawkey was resistant to integrate the Red Sox... A state overseen railway station should be named for someone more reflective of Massachusetts' values.\"", "id": "9783944", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "LAWMAKERS PUSH TO RENAME THE

America's id, its long-concealed combination of racism and xenophobia, has been dragged out of the spider-filled closets -- in which it too long resided -- by the events in Charlottesville and the president's equivocations about the nature of white supremacists and neo-Nazis.\n\nThe backlash, which has found expression in dozens of different places, from corporate boardrooms to Baltimore to Durham, has now reached the executive offices of the Boston Red Sox, where principal owner John Henry said he would lead a movement to rename Yawkey Way, the street outside of Fenway Park that is named for 1933-1976 team owner Tom Yawkey.\n\nThe longtime fixture -- who bridged eras connecting Ted Williams, Yaz, and Carlton Fisk -- inherited millions in timber and mining interests and used them to purchase the bankrupt Red Sox franchise, resisting integration to the bitter end. The Red Sox were the last team to break the color line, adding utilityman Pumpsie Green to the roster 14 years after the Brooklyn Dodgers signed Jackie Robinson and 12 years after Robinson and countless other African-American ballplayers reached the big leagues.\n\nTo put it another way, when Robinson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962, the Red Sox had only been integrated, and halfheartedly at that, for three years. There was no Curse of the Bambino; there was only Yawkey and a prejudice that prevented the Red Sox from competing on a level playing field with the teams that had availed themselves of the talents of Robinson, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, et al.\n\nFrank Robinson, who reached the major leagues in 1956, was a career .350/.464/.724 hitter as a visitor to Fenway Park. Think about what his career might have looked like, what Red Sox fans would have seen him do, had Yawkey and his henchmen/drinking buddies been anything other than white supremacists at the time he had been scouted and signed by the Cincinnati Reds. Take that and multiply it times Larry Doby, Ernie Banks, and Monte Irvin.\n\nYawkey made a point of employing overt racists like Mike \"Pinky\" Higgins, who served in multiple roles with the organization beginning in 1947, rising to manager and general manager, positions he held at various times through 1965. The former third baseman, a Texas native, told a Boston sportswriter, \"There'll be no [racial epithet beginning with \"N\"] on this ballclub as long as I have anything to say about it.\" When pressed on this and other issues, such as his desire to take a wrecking ball to historic Fenway Park, Yawkey said the writers, \"[had] better not push me too far or I'll take this team out of Boston. I am not bluffing.\"\n\nOver the years, many of Yawkey's associates defended him as being an egalitarian at heart who just happened not to employ any black people on his baseball team. It was all just a coincidence or a conspiracy by others, such as Higgins, that the team owner was somehow helpless to thwart. There is a curious passage in Carl Yastrzemski's book, \"Yaz: Baseball, the Wall, and Me\":\n\nI was aware of another rap that the ball club had -- a bad rap. It was that the Red Sox -- and Mr. Yawkey in particular -- were anti-black. We talked about that a lot. All I knew was that I was on one side of [Yawkey's] locker and that Joe Foy and then Reggie Smith, who were both black, had seats on the other side of him. He spent more time talking with us than with any of the other players... Whenever he read a story that claimed we didn't have enough black ballplayers, he'd come to me and say, \"Yaz, don't you think I'd rather have signed a Willie Mays instead of a Gary Geiger?\"\n\nFormer Boston Red Sox player Carl Yastrzemski waves to fans before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 1 of baseball's World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2013, in Boston. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)\n\nThe earliest a conversation among Foy, Smith and Yawkey could have taken place was in September of 1966, over 20 years after Branch Rickey signed Robinson. Further, Yawkey's organization had first crack at signing Willie Mays. The Sox intentionally filed a bad scouting report without actually evaluating him. Similarly, the Sox, acting under pressure, gave Robinson, Sam Jethroe, and Marvin Williams a tryout at Fenway Park in April of 1945. In a moment that has gone down as a low point -- perhaps the low point -- in baseball history, someone observing the closed workout shouted, \"Get those [that word again] off the field!\"\n\nNo one knows who said that, but some witnesses said it had been Yawkey.\n\nUp until Green was promoted to the big league club, all Yawkey would say about integration was, \"The Red Sox will bring up a Negro when he meets our standards.\" Either 15 major league clubs had lower standards than the Red Sox or someone was making weak excuses. Though Green ended the team's 12-year holdout in favor of 19th-century racial standards, the mid-1960s had passed before the club truly embraced a meritocratic lineup, adding African-American stars like George Scott and the vastly underrated Reggie Smith.\n\nBy then, though, Yawkey had subsided into alcoholic reclusiveness and illness. Others were managing the club, and any gestures toward equality made by the team have to be regarded as undertaken at its own initiative, without reference to the recalcitrant owner.\n\nThis unrepentant bigot had a portion of Boston's Jersey Street renamed in his honor in 1977, the year after his death. In 1980, for reasons best known to the voters, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. He had gone to the grave the winner of three pennants (1946, 1967, 1975) and no championships. His own limitations were the principal reason why.\n\nNow Henry, who has done so much to rescue the team from Yawkey's sour legacy, wants to further distance his club from this avatar of American apartheid, saying, \"I am still haunted by what went on here a long time before we arrived.\"\n\nHe should be.\n\nYawkey spent a great deal of money on players in his early years as Sox owner, mostly because he liked the idea of being around athletes, of taking batting practice on the field with his idols. Overall, though, he punished Boston fans, punished them year after year, deprived them from seeing the best players in the game attempt to win them championships. He gave them Lefty Grove, Jimmie Foxx, Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, and many other white greats, but he also gave them a lot of Billy Consolo, Don Buddin, and Jack Lamabe, because servicing his raw hatred and base ignorance was much, much more important than servicing Boston's fans.\n\nThe more enlightened of them would have welcomed a championship. Those who shared Yawkey's views, at least initially, might have learned something. We will never know. They never got that chance because Yawkey never gave it to them.\n\nKudos to John Henry. Tom Yawkey doesn't deserve to be in the Hall of Fame, he doesn't deserve to have a street named after him, he deserves no monument to his memory whatsoever.\n\nWell, maybe a sewer. That would be instructive. What the country is going through now is terrible and somewhat frightening; ancient scabs have been removed and the pus of centuries is flooding the streets in places like Charlottesville. If the momentary resurgence of racist activism allows us to confront the myths of the past -- in the small but significant way Henry is attempting in Boston -- at the end of the day we'll be a better nation for it.\n\nDisavowing Yawkey, as much a stain on baseball as Cap Anson or any other perpetuator of the color line, is a wonderful step toward our final, belated, maturation as a country.\n\nRelated Items:AL East, Boston Red Sox, MLB Today FanRag Sports Daily MLB Newsletter", "id": "9860769", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "CTBNL | Disavowing Yawkey wonderful

Henry wants to push the city into making the change and says he has been wanting to do so since he bought the team in 2002.\n\n\"For me, the street name has always been a consistent reminder that it is our job to ensure the Red Sox are not just multicultural, but stand for as many of the right things in our community as we can -- particularly in our African-American community and in the Dominican community that has embraced us so fully,\" Henry told Silverman.\n\n\"I am still haunted by what went on here a long time before we arrived,\" he said.\n\nI thought it was Henry's job to ensure the Red Sox win ballgames and make money for him and his partners. And he is far from the only one \"haunted\" by the bad old days.\n\nYawkey's record and the racially tinged history of the Red Sox has been well-trod ground beneath mine and many other bylines for 30 years.\n\nThe short version: Boston was the very last major-league team to integrate. Yawkey reportedly passed on Willie Mays and Jackie Robinson. Tommy Harper infamously filed a racial discrimination lawsuit in 1986. And African-American ballplayers were nearly extinct in Boston for a large chunk of the 1980s and '90s.\n\nWorse, Fenway was flat-out ugly when it came to certain minority ballplayers -- especially those who happened to play for the Yankees.\n\nJohn Henry's 2017 Red Sox bear little resemblance to nearly every team that played during the Yawkey Era. These Red Sox are racially diverse, athletic and built around starting pitching.\n\nBoston, too, has changed tremendously since Yawkey Way was christened in 1977. That part of the equation continues to be missed by far too many.\n\nWhatever happened with Orioles outfielder Adam Jones earlier this year remains an outlier, and when a fan in another incident was heard using the \"n-word\" at Fenway this year, he was banned for life. Twice is too much, but it is not the norm. Not even close.\n\nIn Yawkey's day, you'd probably be banned from Fenway for not using the \"n-word.\"\n\nDavid Price, who apparently is both racially oppressed and the recipient of the richest contract in Boston sports history, claims he heard racist taunts last year while warming up in the bullpen at Fenway. The next time Price warms up at the ballpark, the profanity and vitriol directed his way will be 100-percent performance- and personality-based. Guaranteed.\n\n#Progress.\n\nSince the hell that was Charlottesville this past weekend, the rush to delete and revise American history has hit warp speed. Soon, the most offensive item in the Washington Redskins name will be the \"Washington\" part.\n\nThere isn't much history to preserve here, as Yawkey Way is a mere 40 years old. \"Historic legacies\" in Boston are measured in centuries, not decades.\n\nBut then what? Do the Red Sox scrub Yawkey from their official history? Does Henry's newspaper purge the names of Tom and Jean Yawkey from its archives? Does Teddy Ballgame's statue come down because he may have killed Asian civilians while flying combat missions over Korea?\n\nWiping Yawkey Way from Google Maps will make many people -- including Henry -- feel good, I'm sure. Mostly about themselves.\n\nBut when it comes to substance, this is a double-stack nothingburger with extra cheese. It alters nothing about the past. It does not undo Yawkey's misdeeds.

Kennedy noted that renaming the street is not exclusively a Red Sox decision and nothing has changed at this point. A public hearing is needed first, and all landowners along Yawkey Way would need to be in agreement. Per the Herald, that appears the case.\n\n\"I want to be clear it's not an indictment on the Yawkey Foundation, the great work that goes on there,\" Kennedy said. \"The Red Sox need to start to engage the community and have an open conversation with our neighbors and other community stakeholders and then of course City Hall, sort of the beginning of the process.\n\n\"I'm well aware of the fantastic work that the Yawkey Foundation has done and there's an undeniable track record of fantastic, good deeds, generosity and there's great people that work there and have been affiliated and associated with it. This is in no way a reflection of anyone's feelings toward the Yawkey Foundation.\"\n\nThe political climate in which the Red Sox decided to take this stance, as some Confederate statues come down across the country, indeed factored into the decision, per Kennedy. But he painted the decision as part of an ongoing conversation, rather than the product of a tipping point.\n\n\"The timing I think is probably a result that, as an organization, we've elevated the conversation around what we can do ... with respect to making Fenway as inclusive and welcoming as possible,\" Kennedy said. \"Certainly the Adam Jones [incident] and the follow-up incident the next day ... just the overall climate in our country right now, the conversation has been elevated and has been a sustained conversation throughout the course of the year internally, in private and in public with different community groups, community leaders, elected officials, business partners.\n\n\"So I'm really proud to work for an organization that has those types of conversations and is open to discussing em and tackling what may be perceived to be sensitive issues. So I don't know that there is a specific reason for the timing, other than John has been the leader of our organization for 16 years and it's been a conversation he's been engaged in, and we've all been engaged in, for some time.\"\n\nKennedy said there was no final meeting where a decision was made internally.\n\nIf the street is renamed, what about other ties to Yawkey?\n\n\"I don't have a list of everything Yawkey related and no one is suggesting that we wipe out or erase our past or history at all,\" Kennedy said. \"In fact, I think it's important to understand our history. The real issue here is, it's symbolic and it's something that is powerful and we have heard from many people in the community that it is something that has made folks feel uncomfortable about coming to Fenway. That's been troubling to us. So I don't think you're going to see anyone trying to completely erase our history.\"\n\nAnd why not take action sooner? Already on Thursday, the discussion on social media and sports talk radio, for some, centered on pandering -- and the perception that's what the Red Sox are doing.\n\n\"We've been here for 16 years,\" Kennedy said. \"You know I suppose we could have engaged in a more forceful and public way on this issue in the past, but we've really been focused on ways to make Fenway as inclusive and accepting as possible. We've focused on community outreach, building the Red Sox Foundation. Yeah, I suppose some could say, 'Why now?'\n\n\"There's not a specific reason for that other than the things we discussed and the sustaining and elevating the conversation around everything under our control and our sphere of influence that would make everyone feel welcome at Fenway.\"\n\nThere is an MBTA station named for Yawkey near the ball park. It does not appear the Sox are making an active push for it to be renamed at this time.\n\n\"If that becomes a topic, if we're asked to weigh in on that, we will as well, we'd be supportive of exploring it,\" Kennedy said. \"If it makes people feel uncomfortable or unwelcome, then that's something that absolutely needs to be looked at.\"\n\nThe Yawkey Foundation gave a statement that it was \"disheartened by any effort to embroil the Yawkeys in today's political controversy.\"", "id": "9860735", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Sam Kennedy: Yawkey Way name 'has made folks feel uncomfortable'", "image": "http://www.csnne.com/sites/csnne/files/2017/08/17/2014lyawkey.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "209299", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "id": "302718", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "id": "310475", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Herald"}, "id": "316414", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Herald"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conversation"}, "id": "321120", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sports radio"}, "id": "377934", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_radio"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}, "id": "403817", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park"}, {"label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority"}, "id": "423290", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Transportation_Authority"}, {"label": {"eng": "Comcast SportsNet New England"}, "id": "589263", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast_SportsNet_New_England"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yawkey Way"}, "id": "632062", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawkey_Way"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yawkey (MBTA station)"}, "id": "1001683", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawkey_(MBTA_station)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tom Yawkey"}, "id": "1134582", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Yawkey"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 11, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 333, "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 334, "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Regional", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Regional"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 505, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants"}], "time": "03:01:00"}

He owned the team for more than 40 years and left behind a legacy rife with racist, discriminatory, and altogether unsavory practices.\n\nIn comments to the Boston Herald, current Sox owner John Henry says he has discussed the process with city leadership in the past but that it was considering opening a can of worms.\n\nSome Sox fans may agree that the road should have been changed years ago, or at least more publicly acknowledged that it was a process that should be initiated, maintains that he has been \"haunted\" by the team's past and the legacy of those that came before him.\n\n\"But for me, personally, the street name has always been a consistent reminder that it is our job to ensure the Red Sox are not just multi-cultural, but stand for as many of the right things in our community as we can - particularly in our African-American community and in the Dominican community that has embraced us so fully. The Red Sox Foundation and other organizations the Sox created such as Home Base have accomplished a lot over the last 15 years, but I am still haunted by what went on here a long time before we arrived.\"\n\nWhat complicates matters for the organization, and prevents them from simply saying \"it's changing today, the time has come,\" is that the road is a public road. It is supported by taxpayer money and falls under the city's jurisdiction. It is only closed on game days, but that still leads some to believe that the team can make this decision unilaterally.\n\nNot only do the Red Sox have to agree that the time has come but so do any other businesses that abut the road. Fortunately, one other owner does (the D'Angelo family) and they are on board with a potential switch as well.\n\nNext, they will submit a petition for a name change to Boston's Public Improvement Commission and hope the city agrees with their outlook.\n\nIn his explanation for why now is the time to push this process forward Henry even alluded to Trump's discriminatory policies, saying,\n\n\"We ought to be able to lead the effort and if others in the community favor a change, we would welcome it - particularly in light of the country's current leadership stance with regard to intolerance.\"\n\nThe other question is what it could be changed to, if that change is allowed. Henry is publicly throwing his support behind David Ortiz receiving the honor but acknowledges that it will be an ongoing process. Perhaps, in this particular situation, a fan vote should be eschewed for a more official process.\n\nAfter all, despite not having the best history with race, the Sox do have some great options in this case. There's Pumpsie Green, who first broke the color barrier on Boston's roster, or Jim Rice. Or it could be as easy as putting Ortiz's name on it, especially as (as Henry notes) Dominican fans and players have become an important part of the Boston family.\n\nWhatever the case, it'll be up to the city to say yes or no at the end of the day. With the increased rate of other cities and organizations removing monuments and changing names, now may finally be the time for this supposed can of worms to be embraced.", "id": "9790759", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Red Sox owner wants Boston to rename street near Fenway tied to team's racist history", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BXgHfYatgcnEutvAx2oS4_oDX7A=/0x0:4896x2754/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56245941/143128031.0.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "209299", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Family (biology)"}, "id": "303765", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"}, {"label": {"eng": "African American"}, "id": "304393", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "id": "310475", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox"}, {"label": {"eng": "David Ortiz"}, "id": "310595", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ortiz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Herald"}, "id": "316414", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Herald"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baseball color line"}, "id": "348637", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_color_line"}, {"label": {"eng": "D'Angelo"}, "id": "350878", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Angelo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}, "id": "403817", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jim Rice"}, "id": "536280", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Rice"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yawkey Way"}, "id": "632062", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawkey_Way"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tom Yawkey"}, "id": "1134582", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Yawkey"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pumpsie Green"}, "id": "1139670", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpsie_Green"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 381, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 496, "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Leadership", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Leadership"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 500, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 784, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change"}], "time": "22:49:00"}

The Red Sox were in the process of losing 100 games for the first time in three decades. They were averaging barely 8,000 fans a game and drawing fewer than a thousand some days, so I could sit pretty much anywhere I wanted on that nearly deserted bandwagon.\n\nI was born in Baltimore and lived in Maryland during the first years of my childhood, so I was a fan of the Orioles when my family moved to Chelmsford in 1962 and listened to their games on a short-wave radio. My dad would take me to Fenway when the Orioles were in town. The Orioles were a very good team in the early 1960s (though not quite as good as the Yankees), while the Red Sox were not good at all and getting worse by the week.\n\nBut every time my dad took me to Fenway, the Orioles lost. Every single time. I'd be so depressed on the ride home my dad threatened to stop taking me to games. I didn't want to stop going to games, so after three summers of perpetual disappointment and to preserve my sanity I did the pragmatic thing and switched my allegiance to the Red Sox.\n\nI must have been insane. My timing could not have been worse.\n\nAs All-Star shortstop Rico Petrocelli, who caught the pennant-clinching ball on the last day of the season, recalled in \"Tales From the 1967 Red Sox Dugout,\" the book I co-authored with him: \"The people who did show up at Fenway Park were nasty. The crowds were so small that you could hear everything they yelled at us, and most of it was negative.\n\nBy 1965 I had my driver's license and could drive into Boston myself. I was making $14 a week working part-time in one of Lowell's garment factories on Perkins Street, and every couple weeks or so I'd go to Fenway. On-street parking close to the ballpark was a breeze -- no paying $50-60 to park in a lot in those days. I'd walk right up to the ticket window and buy a cheap seat in the grandstand. Then my brother Dick or my friends and I would try to sneak into the acres of empty box seats.\n\nSometimes the ushers ignored us, but the mean ones would check our tickets and throw us out in spite of our arguments that no one was sitting there anyway.\n\nThere weren't a lot of Red Sox games on TV back then, so when I wasn't at Fenway I'd listen to games on the radio while doing my homework. By then they couldn't even beat the Orioles anymore, but I stuck it out with them.\n\nIt was still easy to get tickets during the first few months of 1967. But after Tony Conigliaro beat the White Sox with an 11th-inning walk-off homer in June, and 15,000 fans poured into Logan Airport to mob the team when it returned home riding a 10-game winning streak right after the All-Star break, the Red Sox were suddenly popular again.\n\n\"The Impossible Dream,\" the theme song to the hit Broadway musical \"Man of La Mancha,\" had become their anthem, and tickets became scarcer. I enthusiastically looked at the schedule and thought about buying tickets to the last two games of the season against Minnesota, thinking the pennant might be decided then. To this day I regret I didn't.\n\nI did order World Series tickets by mail and was sorely disappointed to be shut out. How unjust! The front-runners and late-arriving bandwagon jumpers had gobbled up all the tickets while so many of the faithful few who had gone to games during the lean years went unrewarded. Why, we may never get another chance to see the Red Sox in a World Series!\n\nA pivotal season\n\nWe were wrong, of course. The \"Impossible Dream\" season of 1967 turned out to be the most pivotal year in Red Sox history.\n\nTheir history can be broken into five parts. They won five World Series in the first 20 years of their existence, followed by nearly two decades lowlighted by some of the worst teams in baseball. The arrival of Jimmie Foxx and Ted Williams after Tom Yawkey bought the club featured some of the best teams in club history, although they won just one pennant. By the end of the 1950s the Red Sox were in a gradual decline that bottomed out in 1965.\n\nNo one could have forecast it way back in 1967, but the \"Impossible Dream\" heralded the longest period of sustained success in Red Sox history, now at 50 years and still going with no signs of ebbing anytime in the foreseeable future.\n\nIt would be almost understandable if fans too young to remember the truly lean years before 1967 -- and spoiled by the 40 winning seasons, 15 postseason appearances, nine division titles, five pennants, and three World Series championships since then -- believe the Red Sox have always been a contender playing to SRO crowds at beloved Fenway Park. Do they realize just how close we all came to losing the Red Sox forever, how everything that's happened to the team in the last 50 years may well have happened somewhere else?\n\nOfficially, John Wyatt was credited with a team-leading 20 saves in 1967. But it was the entire Red Sox team, the \"Cardiac Kids,\" whose regulars averaged 23 years of age, that saved baseball in Boston.\n\nIn mid-June of 1967, before the Sox had caught the imagination and inflamed the passion of their fans, Yawkey, sick of losing seasons, sick of losing a million dollars a year, and sick of playing in a crumbling 55-year-old relic, said he would move the team out of Boston unless a modern ballpark was built with public money. It was front-page news, but few seemed to take him seriously or even care.\n\n\"This is not a threat; this is a mere statement of fact,\" the 64-year-old multi-millionaire owner, renowned for overpaying underperforming players, told The Boston Globe's Will McDonough. \"I cannot continue indefinitely under present circumstances. I am losing money with the Red Sox, and no one -- unless he's a damned fool -- likes to lose money. Maybe there are people who feel I would wait forever. They probably figure: 'What the hell, that guy has all kinds of money.'\n\n\"They better not call my bluff,\" Yawkey warned the politicians. \"I don't bluff. All I have to do is open the door.\"\n\nThere was a brief flurry of activity by legislators, and for a few weeks proposals for a modern new park were floated. Late in the summer an architect's sketch of a $60 million ballpark graced the pages of the Boston newspapers.\n\nBut by then no one cared anymore about modern ballparks. All they cared about was the Red Sox. They've been caring about the Red Sox for the last half-century now, and Fenway Park is still here.\n\nAnd every one of those tens of millions of Red Sox fans who has jumped on an overcrowded bandwagon and lined the streets of Boston to wave to the parading duck boats after another World Series title owes an eternal debt of gratitude to the 1967 \"Impossible Dream\" Red Sox.\n\nChaz

(Michael Dwyer/Associated Press)\n\nFrom Michael Bennett and Marshawn Lynch to LeBron James and Kevin Durant, athletes are using their platforms to address concerns about racial injustice. Amid a newly charged debate over symbols of the country's history of discrimination, Thursday brought evidence that major sports teams may be starting to follow suit.\n\nThree Tampa teams -- the Buccaneers, Rays and Lightning -- issued a joint statement in which they pledged to help pay to remove a Confederate monument from the downtown area of the city. Meanwhile, Boston Red Sox owner John Henry said that he would push to change the name of Yawkey Way, a street outside of Fenway Park, because it honors a former team owner whose legacy includes racial intolerance.\n\nTom Yawkey owned the Red Sox from 1933 to 1976, and under his guidance, the team became the last in MLB to integrate, pointedly passing on the likes of Jackie Robinson and Willie Mays. Following his death, the street was named in his honor in 1977. His widow, Jean Yawkey, owned the team until her death in 1992, at which point it was held by a family trust for 10 more years.\n\n\"I am still haunted by what went on here a long time before we arrived,\" Henry, who bought the Red Sox in 2002, said in an email to the Boston Herald. He added, \"For me, personally, the street name has always been a consistent reminder that it is our job to ensure the Red Sox are not just multi-cultural, but stand for as many of the right things in our community as we can -- particularly in our African-American community and in the Dominican community that has embraced us so fully.\"\n\nAlthough Henry said he had broached the renaming idea with Boston officials in the past, the timing of his comments to the Herald, coming in the wake of the events in Charlottesville and President Trump's widely criticized reaction to them, was not coincidental. \"We ought to be able to lead the effort and if others in the community favor a change, we would welcome it -- particularly in light of the country's current leadership stance with regard to intolerance,\" Henry said.\n\nThe planned removal of a statue depicting Confederate military commander Robert E. Lee drew hundreds of protesters to Charlottesville, including many white nationalists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members. Hundreds more showed up to counterprotest, leading to violent clashes and an incident in which a driver who reportedly espoused racist and pro-Nazi views killed a woman and injured at least 19 others.\n\nTrump came under fire for being slow to specifically denounce the white nationalists, and while he eventually did so, he has continued to decry \"the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.\" The recent violence led to protesters in Durham, N.C., toppling a Confederate statue, while cities such as Baltimore and Birmingham, Ala., removed or covered up Civil War monuments and other cities looked into how they could avoid becoming the next Charlottesville.\n\nIn Tampa, an agreement had been reached last month to remove the 106-year-old monument, which depicts two Civil War soldiers next to an obelisk. On Wednesday, Hillsborough County (Fla.) commissioners voted contentiously to allow a maximum of 30 days for enough private money, around $140,000, to be raised for its removal.\n\nProtesters push to have a Confederate monument removed at the old Hillsborough County Courthouse in Tampa. (Octavio Jones/The Tampa Bay Times via AP)\n\n\"I will be highly surprised if we are able to raise those dollars in 30 days,\" Les Miller, the county's lone black commissioner, said Wednesday (via tampabay.com). \"I would hope that we don't have a Charlottesville, Va., in Hillsborough County. I pray that we don't.\"\n\nYet it took just one day to raise the necessary funds, thanks in part to local sports figures such as former Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy, first black head coach to win the Super Bowl, and Lightning winger J.T. Brown, one of approximately 30 black players in the NHL. \"That could have been in Tampa, could be anywhere in the country where the statues are,\" Brown said to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\n\"I was just thinking to myself, how was I going to explain to my daughter if she was old enough, how would I explain why someone doesn't like her? Or why is this going on in the world today?\" Brown continued. \"For me that kind of re-motivated me to make sure I'm doing everything I can to make sure the community is a better place for her and everyone.\"\n\nOther individuals also contributed, and then, while saying that \"this monument does not reflect the values of our community,\" the three Tampa teams announced they would cover the rest. \"Now more than ever before, we must stand united and committed to diversity and inclusion as we all attempt to heal from the tragedy in Charlottesville,\" they said in the statement.\n\nTampa does not have an NBA team, but if it did, it would almost certainly have contributed funds, as well. The league, as demonstrated by comments from players, coaches and executives, has a notable culture of social and political awareness, and the election of Trump only seemed to intensify the atmosphere.\n\nJames, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton last fall, said Tuesday on Twitter, \"Hate has always existed in America. Yes we know that but Donald Trump just made it fashionable again!\"\n\nOn Thursday, Durant, who led the Warriors past James's Cavaliers for the NBA title, said he would skip the traditional champions' White House visit. \"I don't respect who's in office right now,\" Durant said, adding that he thought his teammates would \"all agree\" with him.\n\nGrizzlies head coach David Fizdale sharply criticized Trump's responses to Charlottesville Wednesday, and he referred to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in advocating the removal of Civil War monuments in Memphis, \"Take 'em down. I don't know what the hesitation is,\" he said. \" ... Whatever gets those things down immediately, we got to do it. It splits people apart. It creates a public safety hazard having that thing in our city.\"\n\nThe NFL doesn't quite have the same outspoken culture, possibly because of the league's quasi-militaristic nature, or possibly because, unlike their NBA counterparts, players don't have guaranteed contracts. The continued unemployment of former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who began kneeling during renditions of the national anthem last season and inspired other football players and athletes in different sports to emulate his example, could be having a chilling effect on some players.\n\nNevertheless, the first round of NFL preseason games last week saw at least four players stage anthem protests, including the Seahawks' Michael Bennett, the Raiders' Marshawn Lynch, the Eagles' Malcolm Jenkins and the Rams' Robert Quinn, the latter two by raising their fists. On Thursday, before an Eagles-Bills game, Jenkins again staged his protest, and this time, he was given a show of support from teammate Chris Long.\n\nVia @AP_Sports, here's a photo of Malcolm Jenkins and Chris Long's protest during the national anthem: pic.twitter.com/hSOhGEbE2A\n\n-- Jonathan Tannenwald (@jtannenwald) August 17, 2017\n\nBennett said onWednesday, \"It would take a white player to really get things changed.\" Long was a likely candidate to respond in some way, given that he not only has been vocal on social issues, but also was raised in Charlottesville, played for the University of Virginia and owns a home there.\n\n\"You know that subculture exists in our country, and it has in our country for a long time, but when they all get together in one place -- especially your hometown -- it really bothers you,\" Long said Monday of white nationalists (via philly.com). \"You can say what you want about the president's remarks. I wish he'd categorically spoken out against white supremacy.\"\n\nWhereas Jenkins, who began his protests last season, and Kaepernick have been particularly concerned about police killings of black men, Bennett told ESPN that what happened in Charlottesville and afterward spurred him to action. \"Over the weekend, so much violence, so much hate,\" he said. \"I just wanted to remember why we were American citizens, remember the freedom, the liberty and the equality, make sure we never forget that.\"\n\nNow some teams are reacting, as well, even if it means possibly upsetting fans in Tampa and Boston. Other fans, not to mention more than a few players, are likely applauding the ownership-level steps into social activism.\n\nRead more:\n\nSorry for the inconvenience fans, but black athlete activism

{"id": 232035038, "title": "Scottish Labour virus in YouTube! \u2013 Talking-up Scotland / Facts on NHS, Crime, ferries and everything else you can think of", "text": "By NMRN BBC Website Scotland page: There is now only one story in the top section of this page re the nasty political episode we recently witnessed with Dross U turning on his former decision on standing as an MP and choosing the seat of a sick colleague who himself stated he wanted to still stand as the chosen Tory candidate for that seat\u2026..this story is the fifth story in their top section of stories (Soon I am sure to descend even lower as a story before it disappears completely)\u2026\u2026..compare and contrast with the multitude of stories on Michael Mathieson which lasted for days/weeks which as headlines were all \u2018attacks\u2019 on Mr Mathieson and not as a story one that very quickly became a story via his colleagues defending him that was headlined as such by the BBC website. The headline in this fifth story on Dross is: \u201cTories insist Ross played no part in dropping candidate\u201d Way way further down are other older stories on this episode via DRoss and Duguid in other sections of this page\u2026\u2026\u2026also soon , I am sure, to disappear..\u2026completely. Also in top section of this page is a story on Sarwar headlined as: \u201cSunak\u2019s early return from D-Day events \u2018unforgivable\u2019 \u2013 Sarwar\u201d Labour the third party at Holyrood and currently with only 2 WM MP\u2019s elected via Scotland yet Anas Sarwar is promoted as if he was the Scottish FM and also as if the majority of MP\u2019s elected via Scotland were Labour MP\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2026..this story re Sarwar is the third story on the BBC Scottish Politics page\u2026\u2026\u2026sorry has the actual FM of Scotland , John Swinney, not also remarked on this sorry Tory episode via Sunak\u2026\u2026and thus why then is that not also being headlined on the BBC website via either their Scotland page or their Scottish Politics page. Just so readers know this is what our actual FM John Swinney was reported as having said (elsewhere in the media) on that sorry Tory PM episode: \u201cThe SNP leader told journalists during a campaign event in Livingston: \u201cI think Rishi Sunak\u2019s credibility is completely destroyed by his departure from D-Day early and the insult he delivered to the veterans who had travelled to Normandy for that solemn occasion\u201d Also on the BBC Scottish Politics page there are headlined stories that are headlined only about David Duguid not Dross\u2026.also soon, I am sure, to disappear from that page\u2026.in the hope that it, as another Tory nasty and sorry episode, is then also forgotten and thus deemed insignificant. BTW I had a heads up from a friend that when she was on YouTube there was a lot of videos interrupted by advertising from Scottish Labour\u2026\u2026 she told me she had a multitude of Scottish (INO) Labour videos taht kept coming up and interrupting what she was watching\u2026..her daughter also told her this happened to her too \u2026then I read this funny comment online: \u201d Is it just me, but why the f I\u2019m gettin Scottish Labour adds like every 3 minutes on youtube\u201d? \u201cIt only started like yesterday evening and today, literally anything I watch after 3 mins and the again and again getting this Scottish Labour ad. I\u2019m not even in politics idk wtf who\u2019s Scottish Labour are and so on, but if you f kin paid for this, f**** off. Ok\u201d? Someone else responded \u201cYes, I\u2019m getting the same crap too, My twitter feed is also full of Labour tweets. They\u2019ve obviously splurged a lot of money to various social media platforms to get their message out. Still can\u2019t say I am any the wiser on what they stand for though, other than Unionism and genocide\u201d So I spoke to my friend again and she said that was exactly what happened to her on YouTube\u2026every three mins or so another advert came up for Scottish Labour\u2026..she said it must be costing them a mint\u2026..so how much money are they, as a party, getting via donations and how much are they spending on trying to gain seats in Scotland\u2026.plus all of the free publicity via the medial here in Scotland\u2026\u2026I would be surprised if after all of that they didn\u2019t indeed win over some voters\u2026\u2026..mind you my friend said the constant adverts irritated her more and thus had an adverse impact on how she felt about Labour\u2026.(as in same reaction as the person quoted above via their online comment on this\u2026.so this could backfire on Labour party big time\u2026..as be seen as propaganda and also Q\u2019s asked where this money for these multitude of adverts has come from to do this ) Has anyone else seen this via Social media\u2026.Facebook, YouTube etc ? This reminds me of pre Brexit and all of the Facebook adverts, many of which were fake declarations (Lies) on what would happen if we both stayed in and also left the EU\u2026\u2026\u2026..with Cambridge Analytica behind many of these adverts\u2026\u2026\u2026.whose doing these Scottish Labour\u2019s adverts ?????\u2026\u2026\u2026. BTW the BBC in 2017 ran a story on their website entitled \u201cElection 2017: Scottish voters targeted by \u2018dark ads\u2019 on Facebook\u201d\u2026.hmm have they, the BBC, also seen the excessive amount of online ads via Scottish Labour targeting Scottish voters just now for this 2024 GE\u2026\u2026\u2026.. In 2017 \u201cthe UK\u2019s Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, launched an investigation into political adverts on social media and the \u201cpotential impact they have on an individual\u2019s privacy\u201d. \u201cFacebook is a gold mine of personal data\u201d\u2026\u2026.\u201dThis information allows parties an unprecedented opportunity to splinter their message \u2013 to tailor, tweak, personalise and craft their messages to very specific niches of the electorate\u201d. \u201cBut, unlike traditional posters or pamphlets, political adverts on social media are \u201cdark\u201d in the sense that only the intended audience will see the advert \u2013 our neighbours may very well see a different advert from the same party\u201d However in this BBC story they, BBC, chose to highlight what they said was a \u2018Dark ad\u2019 via the SNP\u2019s Mhairi Black which they, BBC , said was targeting voters under 20 the ad was her face and a message \u201cSTOP Scrolling\u201d with the SNP Logo on picture\u2026..where they, BBC, state \u201cFor the first time we get an insight into the world of so-called \u201cdark advertising\u201d and how Scottish voters specifically have been targeted\u201d So this is now the 2024 GE and \u2018Dark ads\u2019 via Scottish Labour are extremely active and excessive on social media targeting Scottish voters\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..so then BBC Scotland whose corporation is self appointed monitor of dark Ads in elections\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..over to you\u2026.and start do your job ! Waiting !\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..still waiting\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..still waiting !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

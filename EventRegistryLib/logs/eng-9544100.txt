(Courtesy of OMA)\n\nThe state could yank funding from a planned French art museum in Jersey City if officials there fail to provide a balanced budget to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority by the end of the month, the authority's director warned.\n\nThe $34 million in funding the agency promised to build the Centre Pompidou outpost won't be released by the state until city officials prove the museum won't be a financial black hole, said the agency's chief, Tim Sullivan. Sullivan recently sent a letter to a city official threatening to revoke its funding pledge because of a $19 million revenue shortfall.\n\n\"If we get a letter in response saying here's a really credible plan to move forward, I think that'll change the circumstances. If we can't, then I think the Legislature and the governor deserve the transparency to know that this funding may not be able to be deployed,\" Sullivan said.\n\nState officials have supported the \"transformative\" project to bring a satellite of the Parisian art museum to Jersey City -- and still hope it happens, Sullivan stressed.\n\nBut poor revenue numbers the city shared in late March \"kind of blew our hair back,\" he added. That's when he said the city first disclosed a plan that found Jersey City's Pompidou would bring in about $4 million in revenue annually, but have recurring expenses of $23 million.\n\nJersey City Mayor Steve Fulop revealed the Economic Development Authority's funding threat late last month, alleging on social media that it was political retribution for his criticism of Gov. Phil Murphy's administration and his withdrawal of support for the first lady's Senate bid.\n\nIn an interview, Fulop adamantly denied that state officials just became aware of the projected revenue shortfall.\n\nCity officials shared emails dating back months that show similar paltry revenue projections. In a June 2023 email the city sent to Sullivan and Eric Brophy, a senior economic staffer in Murphy's office, attachments show an estimated $3 million from ticketing, programs, events, shops and retail, and $6 million in projected fundraising. The estimates say that fundraising will be \"an important leverage\" to fund the $24 million annual operating budget.\n\nThe city also shared operating budgets of museums around the country, with revenues ranging from $7 million to $38 million annually.\n\nFulop said the state supported the project from its inception until January, when he criticized the Murphy administration's job overseeing NJ Transit.\n\nSullivan agreed the Murphy administration has been supportive of the museum project. He declined to say outright that the letter was not politically motivated, saying the \"facts speak for themselves.\"\n\nSullivan also wouldn't say how much Jersey City would have to kick in for the state to recommit to the project, but \"the gap has to be a lot closer to zero than 19.\"\n\nAn email obtained by the New Jersey Monitor shows Brophy told city officials in January that \"no funding will/can be released until there is a full funding plan in place.\" This was before Fulop pulled his endorsement, but after his critique of NJ Transit.\n\nWhile Sullivan and Fulop feuded last week, Republican legislative budget officers criticized the Pompidou project, telling Lt. Gov. and Secretary of State Tahesha Way in a letter that state funding promised for the museum should go toward a \"more responsible purpose.\" The state has pledged an additional $24 million for the museum in this year's budget.\n\nCity officials have until May 26 to respond to Sullivan, though Fulop told NJBiz he'd reply within a week. He did not respond to the New Jersey Monitor for further comment.\n\nPreconstruction work on the museum has begun near the city's Journal Square PATH station. Construction was supposed to begin this month, but workers haven't broken ground yet because the city is awaiting funding from Economic Development Authority, Sullivan said.\n\nFulop said the goal is to present the state with a project that is \"consistent for what the state's involvement is\" with other similar institutions, like the Liberty Science Center and the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.\n\n\"We are going to do our best to help and work with them to get to a plan to solve for a structure similar to institutions,\" said Fulop. \"But here's the thing -- they've been partners every step of the way, but if they want to say no, they control the cards.\"\n\nHe said it would be a \"missed opportunity for New Jersey and Jersey City\" if the state pulls funding for \"punitive\" reasons.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Pompidou", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centre Pompidou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Fulop", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steven Fulop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_City,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jersey City, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jersey City, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Art museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Murphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Economic_Development_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Economic Development Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NJ_Transit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NJ Transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahesha_Way", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tahesha Way"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(rail_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PATH (rail system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journal Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Science_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty Science Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Performing_Arts_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Performing Arts Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/new_jersey_monitor_articles_866/6b609ba0f04953626b90470f56847899", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544100", "eventUri": "eng-9544100", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 3603, "textEnd": 3609}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

New Jersey mayor accuses Murphy of political payback", "body": "(The Center Square) -- A New Jersey mayor is suggesting a state agency's move to pull funding for a French museum project was in retaliation for his refusal to endorse First Lady Tammy Murphy's U.S. Senate candidacy.\n\nOn Friday, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority threatened to pull funding for the controversial Pompidou Museum project unless the Jersey City Redevelopment Agency \"rectifies\" a $19 million shortfall on its books.\n\nBut an outraged Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop took to social media to claim the agency's move is retaliation for him pulling back his endorsement of Murphy's now-suspended bid for the Democratic nomination to run for embattled Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez's seat.\n\nThe Democrat said the project was on track for state funding until he announced that he was backing Rep. Andy Kim, D-NJ, in the primary race.\n\n\"We heard zero from the state for months other than all is good except for the exact week I said I was endorsing Andy Kim,\" Fulop posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"That EXACT week we all of a sudden got multiple letters from Trenton after months of silence. What changed?\"\n\nIn the letter, the state development agency attributed the decision to a $19 million shortfall that \"continues to pose a substantial challenge\" to approving additional taxpayer dollars for the project.\n\n\"While we are eager to continue working with you on the CPxNJ project, the annual operating gap remains too significant to release any funding at this time,\" Tim Sullivan, the agency's CEO, wrote. \"With federal funding deadlines looming and the state budget process underway, it is clear that we must meaningfully narrow this gap.\"\n\nThe agency gave the city until May 26 to submit updated plans that \"rectifies\" the operating shortfall or it will \"have to consider whether it is more prudent for the state to use these funds for other fiscal priorities that the Legislature and governor might identify through the budget and federal fund process.\"\n\nJersey City officials have touted the museum project as key to revitalization efforts for the city's long-neglected downtown. Pompidou X would be a satellite of Centre Pompidou, Paris' famed museum of modern art, and would exhibit art from the Pompidou's collection, including artists such as Frida Kahlo, Henri Matisse and Marcel Duchamp, officials say.\n\nBut the $200 million museum project has drawn criticism from Republican lawmakers who called it a \"circus of excess and waste\" of taxpayer dollars fueled by the state's pay-to-play laws.\n\nA review by GOP lawmakers last year found more than $33 million in taxpayer dollars will be paid to the Centre Pompidou French Arts Museum in Paris - $11 million of which is for the right to use the Pompidou name on the museum for five years.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 30 no-bid consultants will receive an estimated $40 million for the project's \"extravagant\" soft costs, the report claimed, including a food consultant, a \"vertical transportation\" consultant, a French legal consultant, and consultants for lighting, sound and signage.\n\nRepublicans blame the state's pay-to-play laws for allowing no-bidding vendors to make campaign contributions to the governor, lawmakers, and other officeholders backing the project.\n\nIn his statement, Fulop outlines the timeline between when he was told that the project was funded to when the state agency threatened to pull the plug, which coincides with his endorsement of Kim in the U.S. Senate race. He said he would still provide the information requested by the state for the project.\n\n\"I've been the mayor long enough to know that if the state wants to kill this then it is beyond my control and we will move on but let's be clear on the timelines and actions,\" he added. \"Overall, It would be a shame for NJ to lose it but it is beyond my control.\"", "source": {"uri": "nj1015.com",

He certainly wouldn't mind | Stile", "body": "This is a time when the 2025 candidate for governor should be making allies out of establishment leaders, not enemies. On the other side of the aisle, Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli, with his steady stream of grip-and-grin photos on Instagram, seems to be running a more predictable playbook that relies on goodwill and outreach.\n\nFulop, the 47-year-old ex-Marine and investment banker, on the other hand, seems to be going out of his way to antagonize the high council of elders who rule the New Jersey Democratic Party.\n\nHe went from endorsing first lady Tammy Murphy's campaign for the U.S. Senate to criticizing the effort and then switching his support to her chief rival -- and now the Democrats' presumptive nominee -- Rep. Andy Kim.\n\nHe teamed up with Gov. Phil Murphy -- they seemed like BFFs in their joint aspiration to open the proposed Centre Pompidou outpost in Jersey City. Now Fulop and Murphy are locked in a very public and increasingly bitter dispute, with the mayor accusing the governor of pulling the plug on the project in retaliation for Fulop's endorsement switch.\n\nIt was just last fall that Fulop was a great cheerleader for the Democratic campaign for the Assembly, publicly praising the party patroons of Middlesex County -- citing county Democratic Chairman Kevin McCabe in a shoutout and vowing to help raise money for the campaign.\n\nBut last month, Fulop condemned the Middlesex County party as a descendant of the machine corruption wielded by legendary Jersey City Mayor Frank \"I am the Boss\" Hague. The cheerleader now has become a reformer -- and a scold.\n\nFulop brushed aside suggestions that rank opportunism -- putting his ambition ahead of party goals -- led him to rail against the Middlesex machine last month amid the court fight over the use of the county line ballot design, a little-known election feature that has sustained political bosses' power in New Jersey for decades.\n\nThere is nothing inconsistent, he says, in raising money to help Democratic candidates duel the Republican Party of Donald Trump in the November election. Meanwhile, Fulop, with unabashed criticism, is lending his voice to a chorus of grassroots activists seeking to change a system that has sustained Democratic Party power in Trenton for nearly two decades.\n\nAnd besides, he argues, it's not as if he has always been the most beloved figure in Democratic Party circles since he rose from the City Council to the mayor's perch in 2013.\n\n\"I don't think that I've ever, politically speaking, been entirely embraced by the county organizations,\" he said in an interview in a caf\u00e9 next to City Hall one day last week.\n\nMore Charlie Stile: Where is progressive Phil Murphy on smoking in NJ casinos? In lame-duck territory\n\nIs he following Andy Kim's example? Fulop says no\n\nYet this isn't another one of Fulop's typical skirmishes with the party machinery and his off-again, on-again allies in Hudson County. He is gambling that the path to power can be found by riding full-speed down the lane of the outsider.\n\nAs his rivals for governor court the insiders' endorsements, money and machinery, Fulop is courting the grassroots activists and Democratic Party voters who propelled Kim's successful buck-the-machine candidacy for the Senate.\n\nNot only did Kim dispatch Tammy Murphy despite seemingly insurmountable odds, but his long-shot lawsuit struck down the county line, a step that loosened the grip of machine power and gave outsiders a fighting chance to compete in primaries.\n\nKim recognized that the energy and momentum of the party percolated outside the clubhouse door. His campaign tapped long-simmering disgust with imperious Democratic leadership. He ignited a revolt. He also proved that operating outside the norms -- and occasionally taking shots at the establishment leaders who snubbed him -- is a path to power. And now Fulop is positioning himself as an heir to Kim, observers say.\n\n\"I think he sees himself as making a play for the progressives and the good government groups,\" said Micah Rasmussen, the director of the Rebovich Center for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. \"Can I be the beneficiary of the Andy Kim movement? Can I keep the band together?\"\n\nFulop dismissed suggestions that he's simply following in Kim's footsteps, noting that he announced nearly a year ago his intention to create a political operation separate from the traditional Democratic Party establishment.\n\nThat announcement was followed up with the creation of groups of volunteers in most counties who get from him routine updates on strategy, policy and organizing through monthly Zoom calls and frequent updates on the Basecamp app.\n\nIt is that input from voters and volunteers -- Fulop now counts 500 who have signed on to his outreach -- that first signaled trouble with Tammy Murphy's campaign. It was his own internal Greek chorus that led him to publicly call for abolishing party lines last October, before Kim formally filed his lawsuit -- back when the idea of the line being replaced by a block ballot design seemed like the pipe dream of academics and good government advocates.\n\n\"Andy has certainly made us recognize that we're on the right path,\" Fulop said. \"What he was able to achieve with the grassroots support is pretty significant. But I think that we were on a course of building the structure regardless.\"\n\nSome insiders scoff at Fulop's self-casting as what one party leader derisively called \"the patron saint\" of the anti-line coalition, arguing that he's been very much the player of the insider, transactional Jersey brand of politics. Fulop is taking this posture, they say,because he has little choice. Other rivals, like Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, would certainly have the competitive edge in the Democratic-rich counties in North Jersey.\n\nFormer Senate President Stephen Sweeney, who is also planning a bid for the nomination, would have a distinct advantage in South Jersey. And after years of infighting in Hudson, it's not entirely clear that Fulop can count on his home base for support. So the only thing left to do is come out swinging for the fences as an outsider.\n\n\"He has nowhere else to go,\" one longtime Democratic operative told me.\n\nCan Fulop's new approach fend off county bosses?\n\nEmbracing the role as the defiant outsider has allowed Fulop to flout the standard rules of campaign conduct. A Democratic candidate for governor can normally be expected to seek the support of an outgoing two-term governor who remains fairly popular with voters.\n\nFulop has found more use for Murphy as a foil. Much of the anger that fueled Kim's rise was directed at the governor, who was viewed by many as stacking the deck for his wife's candidacy. Murphy rejected the charge of nepotism, but the grassroots activists -- long shut out by party leaders -- scoffed.\n\nFulop denies he has made the Murphys his useful political pi\u00f1ata as part of his appeal to the grassroots. But he says at times he intends to criticize Murphy \"where we can say that he had not done a good job.\"\n\n\"I think that's fair,\" he continued. \"It's part of a campaign process, because if I'm ultimately making my case to the voters and why I'm qualified ... it's just important to do. Otherwise, why am I running?\"\n\nFulop has said he intends to spend $10 million to recruit and vet independent slates of down-ballot candidates to run for in New Jersey's 2025 cycle. So far, he has compiled a spreadsheet of some 90 names of potential running mates. He says at least one incumbent legislator has expressed interest but wanted to meet in secret. He did not share the lawmaker's name.\n\nLooming over this strategy, though, is a sense that the party leadership may mobilize and find a way to reassert its power -- despite the court ruling that struck down the line. Few believe that Democratic county bosses will quietly retreat and surrender power quickly. That concern was underscored last week with the release of the Essex County primary ballot, which was redesigned to conform to the federal court's order for a block ballot design.\n\nBut the design arrayed the new block format to create an effective horizontal line of candidates endorsed by the Essex County Democratic Organization. It was the old line dressed up in a new format. It was also a reminder that change may take longer than Fulop or any other self-styled reformer may believe.\n\nFulop acknowledged the \"real possibility\" of the old guard flexing its muscle, but added, \"I also told myself that I am not going to look back on this campaign in 2025 and say I should have done differently.\"", "source": {"uri": "northjersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

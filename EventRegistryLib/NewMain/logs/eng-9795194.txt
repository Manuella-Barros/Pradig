He struck out two.\n\n2024 Road Splits: Luis Severino hasn't been quite as sharp on the road where he is 3-2 with a 4.42 ERA and a 1.16 WHIP.\n\nKyle Freeland (3-4) with a 5.64 ERA and a 1.51 WHIP\n\nLast Start: Kyle Freeland picked up the win over the Angels on Wednesday, allowing one run on six hits over seven innings while striking out six.\n\n2024 Home Splits: Kyle Freeland has been surprisingly been better at Coors Field than at home where he is 1-0 with a 1.88 ERA and a 1.00 WHIP.\n\nAs the New York Mets prepare to face the Colorado Rockies on the road this Tuesday night, Luis Severino stands out as the key player who can lead the Mets to victory. Severino has been a reliable force on the mound this season, and his recent performances suggest he is more than capable of outdueling Kyle Freeland and the Rockies.\n\nSeverino has been a cornerstone for the Mets' rotation, boasting a 7-4 record and a solid 3.93 ERA. His ability to command the strike zone has been evident, as shown by his WHIP of 1.24, which ranks among the league's best. His ability to generate strikeouts (96 strikeouts over 123.2 innings) and limit walks has been crucial in maintaining control on the mound.\n\nOn the other side, Kyle Freeland has struggled mightily this season, posting a 3-4 record with a 5.64 ERA and a WHIP of 1.51. Freeland's inconsistency and tendency to give up runs early in games present a significant opportunity for the Mets' offense. The Mets' lineup, featuring power hitters like Pete Alonso and Francisco Lindor, can capitalize on Freeland's vulnerabilities, providing the run support Severino needs.\n\nThe Mets have displayed considerable offensive firepower this season, ranking in the top half of the league in home runs and RBIs. Players like Alonso and Lindor have been instrumental in driving in runs and setting the tone for the offense. Their ability to get on base and hit for power will be crucial against a struggling Freeland.\n\nWith Luis Severino's strong form, the Mets' offensive firepower, and Kyle Freeland's struggles, New York is well-positioned to secure a win on Tuesday night. Severino's ability to control the game from the mound, combined with the Mets' potent lineup, should be enough to outmatch the Rockies and give the Mets a crucial road victory.\n\nWhy The Rockies Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nAs the Colorado Rockies prepare to host the New York Mets this Tuesday night, Kyle Freeland emerges as the pivotal player who can lead the Rockies to victory. Despite a challenging season, Freeland's recent performances and the unique advantages of Coors Field provide a compelling case for a Rockies win over Luis Severino and the Mets.\n\nFreeland has experienced a rollercoaster season, but his ability to bounce back is noteworthy. With a 3-4 record and a 5.64 ERA, Freeland has shown flashes of brilliance, particularly in his recent outings. Notably, he pitched six strong innings against the Giants, allowing just two earned runs and striking out four. Freeland's ability to limit damage and keep his team in games is crucial, especially when supported by a potent Rockies offense.\n\nCoors Field's altitude presents a distinct advantage for the Rockies. The thin air in Denver allows the ball to travel further, making it a hitter's paradise and a challenging environment for visiting pitchers. The Rockies are well-versed in leveraging these conditions to their advantage. This familiarity gives Freeland and the Rockies a significant edge over Severino, who may struggle to adapt to the unique pitching conditions at Coors Field.\n\nLuis Severino has had a solid season with a 7-4 record and a 3.93 ERA, but he has shown vulnerabilities, particularly in high-altitude environments. Severino's recent outing against the Twins, where he surrendered six runs over three innings, highlights his occasional struggles with command and consistency. The Rockies' lineup, featuring power hitters like C.J. Cron and Ryan McMahon, can capitalize on Severino's inconsistencies and put runs on the board early.\n\nThe Rockies have demonstrated considerable offensive potential, especially at home. Players like Doyle and McMahon have been instrumental in driving in runs and setting the tone for the offense. Their ability to get on base and hit for power will be crucial against Severino.\n\nWith Kyle Freeland's resilience, the unique home-field advantage of Coors Field, and Luis Severino's occasional inconsistencies, the Rockies are well-positioned to secure a win on Tuesday night. Freeland's ability to navigate the challenges of Coors Field, combined with the Rockies' potent lineup, should be enough to outmatch the Mets and give Colorado a crucial home victory.\n\nFinal Mets-Rockies Prediction & Pick\n\nIn this intriguing matchup between the Mets and Rockies, Luis Severino's recent form gives the Mets a slight edge. Severino has been solid with a 3.78 ERA and 96 strikeouts over 123.2 innings this season. However, Coors Field's notorious hitter-friendly conditions could pose a challenge. Kyle Freeland, despite his struggles (5.64 ERA), has shown resilience at home with a 1.88 ERA over 24 innings at Coors Field. The Rockies' familiarity with their home turf could be a factor. Ultimately, this game may come down to offensive production. Given the Mets' stronger lineup and Severino's consistency, expect a close contest with the Mets narrowly edging out the Rockies in a low-scoring affair.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_kerman@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Garrett Kerman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Freeland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Freeland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocky Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McMahon_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan McMahon (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._J._Cron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "C.

It could be considered a form of tough love, or maybe it is the idea that kids need to learn things themselves. So, as a little kid, when the stove was hot, you may have gotten a warning, or maybe not. But, after touching it one time you probably were smart enough to not ever touch a hot stove again. What does this have to do with betting? Well, there are times that I get burned but still try and touch the stove again. This could be one of those times as the Mets take on the Rockies.\n\nThe Mets are the single greatest turnaround of the MLB season. Don't get it crazy or anything, I mean just this season, not of all time. I'm sure some teams have performed better, and even the Astros might be willing to lay claim to the title this year. The Mets looked like an absolute dumpster fire and are now in a position to win a Wild Card spot. What changed with the team? Probably their offensive output is the biggest reason that they went from a sub-.500 club to being six games over entering tonight's contest. On June 12, the team started the day nine games under, meaning they've gone 31-16 over their past 47 games, good for a .660 winning percentage. Is all of this sustainable? Unlikely, but the team is playing good baseball and after last year's debacle, I suppose the Mets fans deserve this impressive run. They put Luis Severino on the mound against the Rockies tonight. He has been a solid pitcher for the club this season with a 7-4 record, 3.93 ERA, and a 1.24 WHIP. He does tend to pitch worse on the road, but it isn't drastically bad. He also has only allowed 14 homers in 21 starts this season. Severino has never pitched at Coors and only has six total at-bats against him from two Rockies hitters.\n\nI am sure there are some desperate Rockies fans out there who are wishing Colorado could pull off some sort of massive turnaround like the Mets. Unfortunately, the team hasn't been good at all this season, and there is very little hope for coming seasons. I've detailed this in the past, but the team doesn't have reliable starting pitching, their best player in the past decade was traded away (Nolan Arenado) and they replaced him with a guy who is constantly injured (Kris Bryant). The farm system is ranked 21st according to MLB.com. They do have a few players in the top 100, but only one pitcher, and that won't cut it long-term. One guy that has been good for the team over the years, but not consistently good, is tonight's starter, Kyle Freeland. Freeland used to be a moneymaker when he was on the mound at Coors. A few years ago, at home, he was an under machine. This season, he has only made four starts there, but he has once again been insanely good at home, and very bad on the road. He has allowed just five earned runs over 24 innings on the home mound. He has pitched three consecutive quality starts at home, and the Rockies are 3-1 overall in his home games. Mets hitters do have success against Freeland, hitting .311 against him, so it is possible the club could get to him.\n\nThis is normally a game that you'd look at and say \"The Mets are the better team, let's take them and move on.\" I'm here to tell you I don't think the value is on the Mets. In this one, with Freeland on the mound, and Severino on the road, I lean toward the Rockies taking this one. The Rockies are bad, but they are about .500 at home (still under, but I want to say something positive about them). I got burned taking the Marlins last night, but I'll put my hand on the stove again and try to grab the Rockies here at plus money.\n\nFor more sports betting information and plays, follow David on X/Twitter: @futureprez2024", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_troy@outkick.com", "name": "David Troy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winning percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Freeland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Freeland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Arenado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Arenado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kris Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farm team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1486183628.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795194", "eventUri": "eng-9795194", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 1084, "textEnd": 1091}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The Mets have put themselves in contention with a strong surge that began in early June, but they are in the midst of a tough stretch.\n\nThey have started their current 10-game road trip 2-2 and have struggled to produce with runners in scoring position. The Mets were 2-for-10 in those situations in a 3-2 loss against the host Los Angeles Angels on Sunday, their second straight one-run setback.\n\n\"We were always just one swing away,\" New York outfielder Brandon Nimmo said.\n\nNot every player made the flight from Los Angeles to St. Louis. Severino was sent to Denver early to get ready for his start, and he knows it's important to build off Monday's win over the Cardinals.\n\n\"This is the longest road trip I've ever seen,\" Severino said recently. \"It's going to be tough for us, but this is what we get paid for, to go out there and play every day.\"\n\nGetting to Colorado ahead of the rest of the team will give Severino a chance to get acclimated to the thin air, which should help considering he has never pitched in Denver. Severino has never even faced the Rockies.\n\nFreeland, on the other hand, has some experience against Severino's team. He is 2-1 with a 2.52 ERA in five career appearances (four starts) against the Mets and can get another win if he continues to pitch like he has since coming off the injured list.\n\nIn his seven starts since being activated from the 60-day IL on June 23, Freeland is 3-1 with a 2.91 ERA and has logged six quality starts. The most recent one came in his latest outing, when he held the Angels to one run over seven innings on Wednesday in a bounce-back performance. Before that, Freeland was roughed up by the San Francisco Giants in his only poor start since coming off the IL.\n\nFreeland acknowledged that he failed to pitch inside against San Francisco and worked on that in a bullpen session.\n\n\"It was a pretty easy correction for me,\" Freeland said.\n\nTuesday marks the Rockies' first home game since center fielder Brenton Doyle earned NL Player of the Month honors for July. In 25 games last month, Doyle hit .333 with 11 home runs, seven doubles and 27 RBIs. His 19 extra-base hits led the majors in July, and he also played exceptional defense.\n\n\"I absolutely love his defense,\" Freeland said of Doyle. \"And with his offense this year, he's turned an extreme corner, showing that he can hit for average and power.\"\n\n--Field Level Media\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com",

With the Atlanta Braves also losing on Tuesday, the Mets still remain 1.5 games back of the final spot.\n\nRockies starter Kyle Freeland's 5.64 ERA and his team's overall ERA of 5.50 should've been welcome signs to the Amazins', but they failed to pick up timely hits needed to secure a win.\n\nThe Mets did, however, get on the board first in the top of the second inning after Harrison Bader's single scored Pete Alonso and Jose Iglesias. But a bizarre play that featured two errors allowed Rockies second baseman Brendan Rodgers to score, shortening the deficit to 2-1.\n\nFollowing an errant throw by Bader, third baseman Mark Vientos attempted to retrieve the ball in foul territory. Vientos fumbled the ball and it appeared to fall into the dugout after going through a hole in the netting.\n\nIn the fourth, catcher Elias Diaz tied the game with an RBI double then Jake Cave followed up with a two-run homer that put the Rockies up, 4-2.\n\nBrandon Nimmo's RBI single in the fifth cut the deficit to one right before Freeland departed the game due to a blister on his forefinger. Despite being charged for three runs, Freeland showcased good stuff through 4.2 innings. He allowed four hits, two walks and struck out seven over 73 pitches.\n\nAfter a nine-minute rain delay, reliever Justin Lawrence (4-4) took the mound and struck out J.D. Martinez with a runner on second to end the inning. The Mets' trend of leaving runners on base continued Tuesday, with seven left on base and the team going 2-for-7 with runners in scoring position.\n\nThe Rockies' fifth run came on a Rodgers RBI double in the fifth. It was the last run Mets starter Luis Severino (7-5) allowed before he ending his outing by retiring Kris Bryant. The righty allowed eight hits, five runs (four earned), no walks and struck out five in as many innings.\n\nThe Amazins' last chance to shorten the lead with a runner in scoring position came in the sixth. Down 5-3, Carlos Mendoza put in Jesse Winker to pinch-hit for Luis Torrens with Alonso on third and Iglesias on first. But Winker ended up hitting into a double play to end the frame.\n\nHuascar Brazoban relieved Severino and pitched two scoreless frames, but lefty Alex Young allowed an insurance run in the eighth that stretched the deficit to three. Colorado's Victor Vodnik came in the ninth to convert his sixth save of the season.\n\nThe two teams will deploy righty starters in their matchup on Wednesday night, with Paul Blackburn (4.11) taking the mound against Ryan Feltner (4.97 ERA).", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fiifi_frimpong@nydailynews.com", "name": "Fiifi Frimpong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Freeland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Freeland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cave", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Iglesias_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Iglesias (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Bader", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Bader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Feltner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Feltner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Young_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Young (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Torrens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Torrens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Blackburn_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Blackburn (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raisel_Iglesias", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raisel Iglesias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kris Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Overall, that's a 3-5 stretch against teams going nowhere.\n\nThe Mets (59-54) need better as they attempt to keep up in the National League postseason race.\n\nThey began the day 1 \u00bd games behind for the third wild-card spot.\n\nThe Mets had the NL's fourth-easiest remaining schedule as the day began, according to Fangraphs.\n\nIt's been a maddening stretch for manager Carlos Mendoza's bunch.\n\nThe Mets looked good in sweeping the Yankees two games (and winning all four this season) in the second Subway Series.\n\nThere were also two victories in three games against a Twins team competing for the AL wild card.\n\nBut against the lesser opponents, it's been mostly a disappointing offensive attack that is to blame.\n\nIn their four losses to the Angels and Marlins, they scored four runs or less in each, as was the case again Tuesday.\n\nIn his first career start at Coors Field (he had never faced the Rockies), Luis Severino allowed five runs, one of which was unearned, on eight hits with five strikeouts.\n\nSeverino's misfortune was allowing an altitude-fueled homer in the fourth -- a fly ball by Jake Cave that cleared the left-field fence for two runs.\n\nHarrison Bader's two-run single in the second gave the Mets a 2-0 lead.\n\nPete Alonso walked to begin the rally and Jose Iglesias singled with one out before Bader blooped one over shortstop Ezequiel Tovar's extended glove for two runs.\n\nThe Rockies scored an unearned run against Severino in the second.\n\nAfter Brendan Rodgers got plunked, Kris Bryant singled to right-center and Bader's throw to third in an attempt to nail the lead runner was errant.\n\nMark Vientos scrambled to retrieve the ball near the dugout, but in his haste dropped it.\n\nThe ball rolled underneath the netting attached to the railing and dropped into the dugout, by rule allowing Rodgers to advance from third and Bryant from second.\n\nWith the Mets' lead trimmed to 2-1, Michael Toglia hit a grounder to second on which Iglesias slid to stop and in one motion fired home to the plate, nailing Bryant.\n\nCave's homer in the fourth was the highlight of a three-run inning that gave the Rockies a 4-2 lead.\n\nElias Diaz stroked a two-out RBI double before Cave lofted a fly ball to left field that kept carrying until it had cleared the fence as Severino watched in disbelief.\n\nRodgers' single leading off the inning started the rally.\n\nBrandon Nimmo delivered an RBI single in the fifth that pulled the Mets within 4-3. Tyrone Taylor, who doubled in three runs a day earlier, began the rally with a double.\n\nContinuing a recent trend of playing down to their level of competition, the Mets wasted scoring chances in the mid-to-late innings Tuesday night in a 6-3 loss to the Rockies at Coors Field.\n\nAfter Nimmo's single, Rockies starter Kyle Freeland departed the game with a blister on his index finger and reliever Justin Lawrence entered to retire J.D. Martinez for the final out in the fifth.\n\nAfter a nine-minute rain delay in the fifth -- during which the tarp wasn't placed on the field -- Severino returned to the mound and allowed an RBI double to Rodgers that widened the Mets' deficit to 5-3.\n\nTovar's leadoff single following the rain delay started Severino's trouble in the inning.\n\nAlonso and Iglesias each singled to put runners on the corners in the sixth before pinch-hitter Jesse Winker grounded into an inning ending double play.\n\nNimmo's double in the seventh gave the Mets runners on second and third with two outs -- Francisco Lindor had singled ahead of Nimmo -- but another threat went unfulfilled as Martinez was retired.\n\nAlex Young allowed two hits and two walks in the eighth, allowing the Rockies to extend their lead to 6-3.

Luis Severino didn't pitch great, but the biggest issue tonight was the Mets' continued inability to get a big hit in nearly any situation.\n\nIt started off promising, however. The Mets jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the second inning when Harrison Bader poked a single over the shortstop's head to score two.\n\nBut in Coors Field, you usually need more than two runs. The Rockies started pecking away in the bottom half of the second, when Severino hit Brendan Rodgers with a pitch, and then Kris Bryant ripped a base hit into the gap. No runs were going to score on the play, but a wild throw from Bader in center field got past the infielders and went all the way to the third base dugout. Severino once again did not back up the play. Mark Vientos went to retrieve ball, but somehow fumbled it when trying to pick it up, and it went into the Rockies dugout. Rodgers scored on the play and Bryant wound up all the way on third.\n\nThanks to some defensive heroics by Jose Iglesias -- gunning down Bryant at home on a ground ball despite playing back -- Severino got through the inning with the lead, but found more trouble later. Rodgers led off the fourth by hitting a ground ball to third that Vientos probably should've had, but was extremely late reacting to, and couldn't get it on a dive as it went into left field for a hit. But Severino retired the next two hitters and nearly got through the inning, until Elias Diaz ripped an RBI double down the right field line to score Rodgers from first and tie the game. Then the next batter, nine-hole hitter Jake Cave, lofted a two run homer to left that gave the Rockies a 4-2 lead.\n\nThe Mets got one back in the 5th on a Brandon Nimmo RBI single, but couldn't cash another run. After a brief, weird, 9-minute rain delay in which the tarp was never put on the field, Severino went back out for the fifth. Ezequiel Tovar led off with a single, but Severino got through the next two hitters without issue, nearly getting through another inning before finding more trouble with two outs. A wild pitch moved Tovar from second to third after he had advanced on a groundout earlier. Rodgers then followed with a sharp a ground ball to third that Vientos dove for, but booted into foul territory and struggled to get after it, allowing the run to score and Rodgers to get all the way to second. It was the third misplay of the night by Vientos, whose third base defense is quickly becoming a major, major liability for this team. He's directly cost them several runs over the past week, and arguably cost them three tonight.\n\nSeverino got through the inning without allowing another run, finishing his night. It was another uneven outing for him, though this one could be slightly more excused due to Coors Field weirdness and the exploits of Vientos at third. Severino allowed five runs (four earned) runs across five innings, but encouragingly, his velocity was back tonight after being down last week, and he struck out five and did not walk anyone.\n\nMeanwhile, now down 5-3, the Mets struggles to find the big hit continued. They had runners at the corners with one out in the sixth and Jesse Winker pinch hitting for Luis Torrens. Winker grounded into an inning-ending double play on the first pitch.\n\nIn the seventh, down 5-3, the Mets had two men in scoring position for J.D Martinez, who grounded out to end the inning.\n\nHuascar Brazoban bounced back from his rough game in Anaheim with two scoreless frames in the sixth and seventh, but lefty Alex Young struggled in the eighth and allowed another run to put the Mets down 6-3.\n\nIn the ninth, the Mets once again tried to make some noise when Francisco Alvarez singled to lead off the frame, but despite Bader and Tyrone Taylor both getting in 3-ball counts, neither of them could get on base, and then Francisco Lindor grounded out to end the game and sealing the Mets third loss in their last four games.\n\nThe Rockies bullpen, sporting a cool 5.63 ERA on the year, tossed 4.1 scoreless innings against the Mets.\n\nThe travel schedule has been tough, but these are games the Mets need to win. After dropping a series to the Angels over the weekend, the next two games have become near must-wins. With San Diego and Arizona playing their best ball of the season and seemingly never losing anymore, the Mets could slip pretty far out of a playoff spot if they don't turn it around quickly. The Mets aren't a great team, but they are better than these teams by standard deviations and need to cash the wins whenever they can. Their at bats in big spots have been awful, and their defense -- particularly Vientos -- has been shoddy. They are playing down to their opponents.\n\nThe Mets will try again to beat the 42-72 Rockies tomorrow behind Paul Blackburn.", "source": {"uri": "amazinavenue.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

With the Atlanta Braves also losing on Tuesday, the Mets still remain 1.5 games back of the final spot.\n\nRockies starter Kyle Freeland's 5.64 ERA and his team's overall ERA of 5.50 should've been welcome signs to the Amazins', but they failed to pick up timely hits needed to secure a win.\n\nThe Mets did, however, get on the board first in the top of the second inning after Harrison Bader's single scored Pete Alonso and Jose Iglesias. But a bizarre play that featured two errors allowed Rockies second baseman Brendan Rodgers to score, shortening the deficit to 2-1.\n\nFollowing an errant throw by Bader, third baseman Mark Vientos attempted to retrieve the ball in foul territory. Vientos fumbled the ball and it appeared to fall into the dugout after going through a hole in the netting.\n\nIn the fourth, catcher Elias Diaz tied the game with an RBI double then Jake Cave followed up with a two-run homer that put the Rockies up, 4-2.\n\nBrandon Nimmo's RBI single in the fifth cut the deficit to one right before Freeland departed the game due to a blister on his forefinger. Despite being charged for three runs, Freeland showcased good stuff through 4 2/3 innings. He allowed four hits, two walks and struck out seven over 73 pitches.\n\nAfter a nine-minute rain delay, reliever Justin Lawrence (4-4) took the mound and struck out J.D. Martinez with a runner on second to end the inning. The Mets' trend of leaving runners on base continued Tuesday, with seven left on base and the team going 2 for 7 with runners in scoring position.\n\nThe Rockies' fifth run came on a Rodgers RBI double in the fifth. It was the last run Mets starter Luis Severino (7-5) allowed before ending his outing by retiring Kris Bryant. The righty allowed eight hits, five runs (four earned), no walks and struck out five in as many innings.\n\nThe Amazins' last chance to shorten the lead with a runner in scoring position came in the sixth. Down 5-3, Carlos Mendoza put in Jesse Winker to pinch-hit for Luis Torrens with Alonso on third and Iglesias on first. But Winker ended up hitting into a double play to end the frame.\n\nHuascar Brazoban relieved Severino and pitched two scoreless frames, but lefty Alex Young allowed an insurance run in the eighth that stretched the deficit to three.

The one silver lining was that six of those games were against the lowly Angels and Rockies.\n\nHowever, after dropping 2-of-3 to the Angels over the weekend, the Mets could not use Monday's win over the Cardinals as a catapult to victory against the Rockies on Tuesday night.\n\nIn their 6-3 loss, Luis Severino gave up five runs (four earned) in his first start at Coors Field while the offense mustered just three runs and struck out nine times. They also left six runners on base and were 2-for-7 with runners in scoring position.\n\n\"It's usually more runs on the board [at Coors Field],\" manager Carlos Mendoza said of Tuesday's loss. \"We didn't hit many balls hard. We got a couple of two-out hits... but after that, you can make the case that we didn't make hard contact today.\"\n\nHarrison Bader's two-run single in the second put the Mets up 2-0 but that lead was erased in the fourth when Severino really struggled.\n\nElias Diaz tied the score with a double and Jake Cave punctuated the three-run inning with a two-run shot on a high fastball that the lefty got on top of. The home run ball went 372 feet and would have gone out in 25 other parks, but off the bat, many believed it was a fly out but the ball carried, perhaps a byproduct of the Coors Field atmosphere.\n\n\"It's really tough to pitch here,\" Severino said of Coors Field. \"I have to tip my hat to [German] Marquez and [Kyle] Freeland who had some good years here. It's unbelievable. The breaking pitches are not the same... Every time I threw the breaking ball it wasn't close to what it is. It's really tough. It's one of those games where you just have to go out there and compete.\"\n\nIn addition to the Cave home run, some defensive misplays made it tough for the Mets to hold on to their early lead.\n\nThe third inning saw a run score after Bader overthrew the cutoff man on a single and the ball skipped past Mark Vientos into the dugout via a hole in the netting. That allowed the runner on third to score and cut the Mets' lead to 2-1.\n\nTyrone Taylor, starting in right field, also bobbled a ball on the exchange, which allowed a runner to score. A clean pickup prevents that runner from scoring.\n\nSeverino's velocity was the fastest it's been all season and he believes his stuff was good enough to warrant a better outcome.\n\n\"It was just a weird game,\" he said. \"It was just like I was making pitches and every ball they hit was finding ways to go to the outfield. It's just one of those days you have to keep working hard. Other days, that's definitely five-to-six innings with one or two earned runs. I just need to keep competing and getting better.\"\n\nThe Mets are now 2-3 halfway through their 10-game road trip -- 1-3 against the Angels and Rockies, so far -- but the team doesn't see this stretch as a missed opportunity.\n\n\"They are also trying to do their job,\" Severino said of the Rockies. \"We just need to find ways to win. We're having a tough stretch right now.

They were a smiley bunch who showed no sign of having flown thousands of miles across several time zones on consecutive days for one makeup game -- a contest they won, which no doubt helped the mood.\n\nBut then the next game started and, well, they played like they didn't know what city they were in or what time it was. The Mets lost to the Rockies, 6-3, with another underwhelming offensive performance.\n\nAltogether, they were shut down by lefthander Kyle Freeland and a series of relievers. The ERAs of the Colorado pitchers: 5.65, 5.82, 5.40, 6.61, 3.64.\n\nAmong the primary culprits: J.D. Martinez, who grounded out with the tying run on second base to end the fifth and seventh innings, and Jesse Winker. Appearing in the sixth inning as a pinch hitter against righthanded reliever Justin Lawrence -- one of his primary duties -- Winker grounded into an inning-ending double play.\n\nFreeland lasted 4 2/3 innings, allowing three runs, four hits and two walks. He was in good shape to pitch longer but exited because of a blister on his left index finger.\n\nThe good news for the Mets (59-54): Luis Severino looked a lot more like himself, even if he didn't have the line to match.\n\nHe wound up allowing five runs (four earned) and eight hits in five innings. But he boasted a season-best average fastball velocity at 97.1 mph and threw his single hardest pitch of his year at an even 99.\n\nThat represented an important rebound over his previous start, an ugly outing against the Twins at Citi Field, from which manager Carlos Mendoza pulled him after just three innings. His fastball velocity that day was his worst of the season: 94.7 mph. It raised questions about Severino's strength and workload down the stretch of his first full season since 2018.\n\nMendoza said before the game that the Mets would be \"keeping a close eye on\" Severino.\n\n\"You're always looking at what the velo looks like,\" Mendoza said. \"Obviously, it was down his last outing. But he continues to check all the boxes, all the measures that we do.\"\n\nAs for the runs Severino allowed against Colorado? All came on borderline plays.\n\nThe Rockies (42-72) broke through initially when Mark Vientos fielded an errant throw from the outfield near the Mets' dugout. But when he bobbled the ball, it fell into the netting, through a rip and into the dugout -- awarding Brendan Rodgers (hit by pitch) the plate.\n\nTheir second run came across on Elias Diaz's double, but only after Tyrone Taylor misplayed it in rightfield, allowing Rodgers to score on a play at the plate.\n\nThe next batter, Jake Cave, sent a routine-looking fly ball to leftfield. But it carried and carried through the thin mountain air for a two-run home run. According to MLB's ball-tracking technology, balls hit at that speed and that angle have an expected batting average of .090.\n\nSeverino's last run came on Rodgers' two-out RBI double in the fifth.

The Mets had the very rare task of leaving the west coast for a day then getting back on a plane to play again on the west coast the next day.\n\nNew York is not complaining about the tough schedule. Hopefully, the victory against St. Louis got the Mets going and they can take the momentum from that victory into a winnable Rockies series.\n\nThe Mets played the Rockies at home in their last series before the All Star break. They won the first two but dropped the final game before the break.\n\nOnly one of the six starters expected to start a game in this series for the Mets and Rockies also started in the previous series.\n\nRyan Feltner pitched game two of the last series. He is lined up to do the same in this series. In the earlier series, Feltner gave up four runs and was not able to get out of the third inning.\n\nThe balls were flying in that series. The two teams combined for at least 10 runs in all three games. Most of the runs came from home runs. Expect some real offense in this series. The Coors Field elevation could lead to fireworks.\n\nLuis Severino gets the ball in game one today. The ex-Yankee is coming off his worst start of the year. Severino had nothing in his outing against the Twins. It seemed like every pitch Severino threw was hit.\n\nSeverino is key to the Mets' success down the stretch. He has been dominant at times, but he has also been hit really hard. It will be interesting to see which way he trends as his innings total continues to go up.\n\nPaul Blackburn will start game two. Coors Field seems to be favorable for Blackburn's way of pitching. Blackburn is a ground ball pitcher. That helps him at Coors Field, where balls fly out of the park.\n\nDavid Peterson is pitching game three of the series. Peterson had a nice bounce back start in his last go around. He only walked one in that outing. The left hander becomes a much more dangerous pitcher if he keeps control of the strike zone.\n\nBrandon Nimmo has been in a real slump since the break but he is in a good place to break out of it. Nimmo always succeeds in Colorado. That success is not random and the reason for it goes way beyond the hitter friendly nature of the stadium.\n\nNimmo hails from Wyoming. Because his friends and family live in a remote location, he rarely gets to play in front of them. However, when Nimmo goes to Colorado, he gets a full entourage. The long time Met clearly relishes playing in front of and seeing his family. Expect him to break out of his slump in a big way.\n\nThe Mets can get rolling again tonight in Colorado.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_gurwitch@postandcourier.com", "name": "Ben Gurwitch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Feltner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Feltner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Peterson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Peterson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Blackburn_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Blackburn (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795194", "eventUri": "eng-9795194", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

He will be happy to be out of July, which was his worst month in a Mets uniform. Severino had three solid starts, but they were sandwiched between two dreadful outings. Coors Field is not the easiest place to bounce back, but Severino hopes to start August on the right foot.\n\nHere is how the Mets lineup behind Severino:\n\n1.) SS Francisco Lindor\n\n2.) LF Brandon Nimmo\n\n3.) DH J.D. Martinez\n\n4.) 1B Pete Alonso\n\n5.) 3B Mark Vientos\n\n6.) 2B Jose Iglesias\n\n7.) C Luis Torrens\n\n8.) CF Harrison Bader\n\n9.) RF Tyrone Taylor\n\nNew York faces lefty Kyle Freeland. The lefty on the mound means Jeff McNeil and Jesse Winker start the game on the bench. Mark Vientos got a rare off day yesterday. He will be ready to go today.\n\nVientos has mashed lefties all season. He is hitting .366 with a 1.116 OPS against southpaws.\n\nJose Iglesias has also had a lot of success against lefties. Iglesias is hitting .366 with a .944 OPS against lefties. Iglesias apparently enjoys playing in Coors Field. He had a very solid year in 2022 while playing for the Rockies.\n\nKyle Freeland never got back to his age 25 form. He has basically been a mediocre pitcher for six seasons in a row. Freeland has had success against the Mets throughout the years. He has a 2.52 ERA vs. them in 25 innings but the Mets are built to hit lefties. They should find success against Freeland.\n\nHere is how the Rockies lineup behind Freeland:\n\n1.) DH Charlie Blackmon\n\n2.) SS Ezequiel Tovar\n\n3.) CF Brenton Doyle\n\n4.) 3B Ryan McMahon\n\n5.) 2B Brendan Rogers\n\n6.) RF Kris Bryant\n\n7.) 1B Michael Toglia\n\n8.) C Elias Diaz\n\n9.) LF Jake Cave\n\nHow to Watch\n\nThe first pitch is scheduled for 8:40 EST. Mets fans can watch the game on SNY, or MLB.TV.

In case you were wondering, it would have been out in 26 parks including Citi Field.\n\nAfter a short rain delay (around nine minutes long) where the tarp was not deployed, Severino would allow a run in the fifth and his night was over.\n\nSeverino pitched five innings (89 pitches/65 strikes) allowing five runs (four earned) on eight hits and one HBP. His velocity was the highest it was all season, which is an encouraging sign after his last start.\n\n-The Mets' defense cost their team some runs early in this one. One defensive miscue occurred in the second. With a man on first, Kris Bryant -- playing his first game since -- hit a single into the gap but Bader overthrew Francisco Lindor and Severino wasn't backing up, allowing the ball to head toward the Mets dugout. Mark Vientos rushed to catch up with the ball, but he bobbled it and it slipped into the dugout through a hole in the netting. That allowed Brendan Rodgers to score from third and Bryant to go to third after he went to second on the overthrow. An error was charged to Bader and Vientos on the play. One batter later, Michael Toglia hit a shot to Jose Iglesias who picked it on the short hop and gunned Bryant down at home plate to preserve the 2-1 lead.\n\nPoor defense resulted in the Rockies' second run. In the fourth, Elias Diaz hit a double with two outs and Rodgers on first, Tyrone Taylor played the ball well in right field but bobbled the exchange, which cost them any chance at getting Rodgers at home.\n\n-Despite the defense and Severino's rough outing, the Mets offense had chances to tie or take the lead against the Rockies. The team finished 2-for-7 with RISP and left six men on base. The biggest chances were in the sixth with runners on the corners and one out, and manager Carlos Mendoza called Jesse Winker off the bench but the lefty grounded into an inning-ending double play.\n\nIn the seventh, J.D. Martinez grounded out with two outs and men on second and third.\n\n-Harrison Bader did come through with runners in scoring position when he hit a two-run single in the second with two outs. He finished 1-for-3.\n\n-Pete Alonso was moved back to the cleanup spot after Monday's game in the No. 5 hole. He finished 1-for-3 with a walk and two strikeouts. Lindor struggled mightily, going 1-for-5 with three strikeouts. Iglesias (2-4) and Brandon Nimmo (2-4, RBI) were the only Mets with more than one hit.\n\n-One bright spot for the Mets on Tuesday was recently acquired reliever Huascar Brazoban. After allowing the winning runs in Saturday's loss against the Angels, he pitched two perfect innings in this one.\n\nAlex Young was one out away from pitching a scoreless eighth but Diaz hit a two-out single to put the Rockies up 6-3.\n\nThe Rockies had plenty of traffic on Tuesday with nine hits but it was Cave's two-run shot that gave Colorado the lead for good was a Coors Field special.\n\nThe Mets continue their three-game series with the Rockies on Wednesday night.

Bryant had his third multi-hit game since coming off the injured list in late July.\n\nJose Iglesias and Brandon Nimmo had two hits for New York.\n\nThe game was delayed for nine minutes in the bottom of the fifth when the grounds crew dealt with a soggy infield from a quick downpour.\n\nColorado starter Kyle Freeland left the game with two outs in the fifth with a blister on his pitching hand. He fell one out short of being in line for the win after he allowed an RBI single by Nimmo RBI that trimmed New York's deficit to 4-3. Justin Lawrence (4-4) got out of the inning with one pitch and tossed 1 1/3 innings to get the victory.\n\nFreeland allowed three runs on four hits and struck out seven in 4 2/3 innings.\n\nThe Rockies had staked Freeland to the lead in the fourth inning after Harrison Bader put New York in front with a two-run single in the second.

Cave followed with his fifth home run of the season.\n\nColorado countered the Mets' run in the fifth inning when Rodgers' two-out double off Mets starter Luis Severino drove in Ezequiel Tovar to make it 5-3.\n\nSeverino (7-5) gave up five runs -- four earned -- on eight hits and struck out five in five innings.\n\nThe Rockies added another run in the eighth when Bryant doubled, and pinch runner Sam Hilliard scored on Diaz's single.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "sunherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@sunherald.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Freeland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Freeland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Rodgers_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Rodgers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cave", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Iglesias_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Iglesias (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kris Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Hilliard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Hilliard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_runner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinch runner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielder's_choice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielder's choice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Bader", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Bader"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/je82fl/picture290823339/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/2843b5c6-b0e9-4dba-aaa5-49f54b07e716", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795194", "eventUri": "eng-9795194", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The stoppage was timed to perfection with fans abandoning their seats due to rain, which later caused a tarp-free, nine-minute delay. In front of a distracted audience, Freeland stayed in the game to face one more batter, gave up his third run on a single to Brandon Nimmo, then was pulled from the game. Nimmo had advanced to second, representing the tying run.\n\nThe Mets went 0-for-3 with runners in scoring position the rest of the night. Lawrence induced an inning-ending double play from Jesse Winker with runners on the corners in the sixth. The next inning, Black consulted Chivilli after men reached second and third, another threat to tie it. Chivilli got JD Martinez to ground into the third out.\n\nVodnik worked around a leadoff single to earn the save.\n\nEight of the game's nine runs were scored with two outs, most notably Jake Cave's fifth home run of the season. His two-run shot to the opposite field lifted the Rockies to a 4-2 lead in the fourth that they never relinquished.\n\nUp until then, they had relied on a small measure of luck to scrap back from an early 2-0 deficit. Mets third baseman Mark Vientos, chasing down an errant relay throw from Harrison Bader, fumbled the ball into his own dugout through a fortuitous hole in the netting at one point. If the netting wasn't ripped in the precise spot where Vientos was trying to pick up the ball, it wouldn't have trickled out of play, and Colorado wouldn't have been granted the free extra base that allowed Brendan Rodgers to walk home.\n\nThat was the Rockies' first run. Their second was assisted by a bobble in the right-field corner that allowed Rodgers to score from first on Elias Diaz's two-out double, setting up Cave's homer.\n\nRodgers, Diaz and Kris Bryant each contributed two hits to the win, which the Rockies hope can ignite a bounce-back home stand after their 3-7 trip to California.\n\nNolan Jones' rehab assignment was put on pause due to the birth of his first child \"a couple of days ago,\"\n\nBlack said Tuesday. Jones is currently back in Denver with his wife and newborn, but he will return to the minors to resume his rehab soon. The 26-year-old left fielder has missed more than half this season due to back and knee injuries.\n\nTV: Rockies.TV (streaming); Comcast/Xfinity (channel 1262); DirecTV (683); Spectrum (130, 445, 305, 435 or 445, depending on region).\n\nRadio: 850 AM/94.1 FM\n\nMaking his 23rd start of the season, Feltner is hoping to navigate the Rockies to a result that reflects the recent quality of his pitching more accurately than his current win-loss record does. In his last seven outings, he has an ERA of 2.88 that ranks seventh in the National League since June 26. He has posted three consecutive quality starts, surpassing 90 pitches in all three. Overall, he's one of six MLB pitchers with 10 or more losses this season despite an ERA under 5.00. This will be Feltner's third career matchup against the Mets. He is 0-2 against them with a 7.71 ERA.\n\nBlackburn will make his second start for New York after being acquired from Oakland at the trade deadline July 30. The 30-year-old went six innings in his Mets debut, allowing one run and striking out six on the way to a win over the Angels. It was also just his second start since returning from the injured list, where he was stuck from May 11 to July 26 with a stress fracture in his right foot. His only career start against the Rockies was an 11-3 win at Coors Field last July. Blackburn tossed six strong innings without issuing a walk. This season, he has struggled more on the road, with a 6.39 ERA in six starts.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri":

There, they'll play the Rockies (41-72), who currently have the worst record in the National League.\n\nThe Mets' lineup has been much better over the last couple of months than it was earlier in the season. And recently -- over the last two weeks, specifically -- several Mets have been fantastic at the plate. Jeff McNeil (198 wRC+), Pete Alonso (164 wRC+), and Harrison Bader (140 wRC+) have led the way, while Tyrone Taylor (139 wRC+), Mark Vientos (135 wRC+), Luis Torrens (133 wRC+), J.D. Martinez (114 wRC+), and Francisco Lindor (107 wRC+) have been above league average. Among their regulars, only Brandon Nimmo, Jose Iglesias, and Francisco Alvarez have really been struggling, and Jesse Winker has only made 15 plate appearances since the team traded for him on July 28.\n\nThe Mets' pitching staff has been doing well for a good while now, too. Over the last thirty days, Mets pitchers rank 10th in baseball with a 3.71 ERA. Mets starting pitchers rank seventh with a 3.43 ERA, and their bullpen has moved in the right direction with a 4.17 ERA that ranks 19th over that span. That might not sound like much, but Mets relievers had a 5.82 ERA from June 15 through July 14, a number over that stretch that was the second-worst in baseball -- ahead of only the Rockies.\n\nAnd speaking of the Rockies, well, they're bad. Collectively, they have an 81 wRC+ that is the second-worst mark in all of baseball. Only the White Sox -- the team that might break the '62 Mets' record for losses in a single season -- have been worse by that metric.\n\nJacob Stallings leads the way among Rockies hitters with a 122 wRC+, albeit in just 204 plate appearances thus far. Having gotten more playing time than expected earlier in the season while Elias D\u00edaz was out, he took advantage of it, and over the past couple of weeks, he's been red-hot and splitting playing time with D\u00edaz pretty evenly. Aside from Stallings, though, only Brenton Doyle (106 wRC+) and Ryan McMahon (102 wRC+) have been better than league average hitters.\n\nOn the mound, the Rockies have been the worst team in baseball with a 5.52 ERA. Even accounting for the effects of playing at altitude, their 117 ERA- is the second-worst in the league -- once again ahead of only the White Sox. Neither the rotation nor the bullpen has truly been better than the other, as each of those segments of the Colorado pitching staff also ranks dead last in baseball in ERA.\n\nWhen these teams played in Queens earlier this month, the Mets won the first two games before dropping the series finale. Simply put, this series is one that the Mets need to and should win, and a sweep should be the goal.\n\nBack in the Mets' division-winning season in 2015, the team played a three-game series in Denver in August. They went into that series with a 3.5-game lead in the division and proceeded to score 33 runs over the course of the series en route to a sweep. This time around, they're 1.5 games back of a Wild Card spot and 7.0 games back of the first-place Phillies, but the opportunity to leave Denver in an improved position is still very much there.\n\nSeverino (2024): 123.1 IP, 96 K, 44 BB, 14 HR, 3.93 ERA, 4.37 FIP, 101 ERA-\n\nIn his most recent start, Severino was flat out bad and gave up six runs to the Twins in just three innings. That ended a short run in which he had been really effective, but he's now just a tick below league average on the season. All things considered, that's still a pretty good outcome for him this year, but given the renewed absence of Kodai Senga, it would be nice if Severino were trending more toward being a number two pitcher than a number three or four.\n\nFreeland (2024): 59.0 IP, 48 K, 15 BB, 9 HR, 5.64 ERA, 4.34 FIP, 119 ERA-\n\nNow in his eighth season as a member of the Rockies' rotation, Freeland is putting up his worst single-season ERA since 2019. And while home/road splits are very much the norm for Colorado's pitchers, Freeland's are extreme this year. He has a 1.88 ERA on the road and a whopping 8.23 ERA at home. Over the course of his career, his ERA at home is just fourth-tenths of a run higher than it is on the road.\n\nBlackburn (2024): 57.0 IP, 44 K, 16 BB, 8 HR, 4.11 ERA, 4.40 FIP, 105 ERA-\n\nMost Mets fans probably weren't very familiar with Blackburn -- if they'd heard of him at all -- before the team got him in a trade with the A's at the deadline. He made a great first impression, though, as he gave up just one run in six innings with six strikeouts and two walks in his debut with the team in Anaheim on Friday night.\n\nFeltner (2024): 121.1 IP, 106 K, 39 BB, 17 HR, 4.97 ERA, 4.33 FIP, 105 ERA-\n\nThe 27-year-old righty has taken a step forward this year after accumulating a 6.06 ERA over the past three seasons. He has a 6.14 ERA at home and a 4.19 ERA on the road this year. Mets pitchers have to pitch at altitude in this series, too, but hey, that's encouraging.\n\nPeterson (2024): 59.2 IP, 47 K, 27 BB, 6 HR, 3.47 ERA, 4.56 FIP, 89 ERA-\n\nWhat David Peterson has done this season and what he might be expected to do moving forward are different things. As you can see above, he's done better than his FIP by over a full run. Statcast's xERA looks even worse at 5.30, and over at Baseball Prospectus, his 4.75 DRA sits in between the two. Over the course of his career, Peterson's ERA has been nearly identical to his FIP. He'll likely need to improve upon his drastically-reduced strikeout rate to keep up a mid-threes ERA the rest of the way.\n\nGomber (2024): 116.0 IP, 84 K, 28 BB, 22 HR, 4.66 ERA, 4.91 FIP, 99 ERA-\n\nThis year, Gomber has been one of those rare Rockies pitchers who has been significantly better at home than on the road. He's sporting a 3.83 ERA at Coors Field, which is more than respectable given the conditions there. With a low strikeout rate and a home run problem, though, he's a pitcher the Mets need to get to in the series finale -- regardless of how well the series has gone up to that point.", "source": {"uri": "amazinavenue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Amazin' Avenue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_mcshane@amazinavenue.com", "name": "Chris McShane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_D\u00edaz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edwin D\u00edaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Torrens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Torrens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_independent_pitching_statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defense independent pitching statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Iglesias_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Iglesias (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

How about we look at some props instead? New York visits Colorado tonight, their third city in three days, shades of Frank Sharp of Sharp Records, although I imagine they flew.\n\nThe Mets signed the one-time Yankee future ace to a one-year, $13 million \"pillow\" contract this offseason in a deal that made all the sense in the world for both parties. Severino's once super-promising career hit some major speed bumps in recent years as he threw just 18 innings total between 2019 and 2021. He then threw to a disastrous 6.65 ERA in 2023 ahead of hitting free agency. For the Mets, 2024 looked like a transition year as they focused their adds on short contracts. If the season went well, great, they now had nice pieces to carry them for a year. If the season went poorly, any of those pieces that looked ok could now fetch back longer-term assets in trades.\n\nThe season of course has gone pretty well as the Mets sit in the middle of a multi-team scrum for one of the three Wild Card spots, and Severino has certainly contributed to all that. He has gone 7-4 with a 3.93 ERA and 1.24 WHIP, solid but not quite ace-like. While both numbers closely resemble his career marks of 3.81 ERA and 1.19 WHIP, he gets there in a very different way. Severino has a career 25 percent strikeout rate, including 27.7 percent as recently as 2022. In 2024, that has dipped to 18.2 percent on a career-low 8.4 percent SwStr percentage rate.\n\nSo why the over on his strikeout prop? Well, for starters, the price is more than commensurate with his current strikeout level. Severino has struck out 96 batters in 21 starts, or 4.57 strikeouts per start. And, most importantly, he will not exactly face the 1927 Yankees here, or even the 2015 Royals for that matter. The 2024 Rockies carry a whopping 26 percent strikeout rate on the season, and a league-high 29.5 percent in the last 30 days. The Rockies might field an entire lineup of guys with at least a 25 percent strikeout rate in this stretch. Even their best hitters like Brenton Doyle (30.2%) and Ezequiel Tovar (28.6%) have trouble here. Michael Toglia has nine homers in the month but a 34.7 percent strikeout rate. Playing at Coors does not improve these numbers much as the Rockies have a teamwide 24 percent strikeout rate at home.\n\nStay up-to-date with all things MLB betting with RotoWire's MLB odds and MLB futures. Looking for a bankroll booster? This DraftKings promo code is offering $150 in bonus bets.\n\nI will take a walk down Narrative Street here. Nimmo hails from somewhat nearby Cheyenne, Wyoming, and always has a pack of family and friends cheering him on at Coors. He always seems to deliver for them as he has a .316/.423/.526 triple slash line vs. Colorado. The Rockies start lefty Kyle Freeland, but Nimmo has modestly reverse career splits with a .270 batting average vs. southpaws as opposed to .263 vs. righties. In 2024, he has gone full reverse: .282 vs. lefties and just .214 vs. righties. In addition, Nimmo hits much better on the road, both this season (.263 vs. .205) and in his career (.279 vs. .250).\n\nFurther, Nimmo should bat early (second in the order) and often as this game has a total of 11.5 runs. Expect at least five plate appearances, including at least a couple with runners on, which should lead, hopefully, to some nice production.", "source": {"uri": "rotowire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RotoWire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeouts_per_nine_innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeouts per nine innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murderers'_Row", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murderers' Row"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocky Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenton_Doyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brenton Doyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezequiel_Tovar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ezequiel Tovar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Toglia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Toglia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne,_Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Freeland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Freeland"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/rotowire/image/upload/ar_16:7,c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,g_auto:custom_no_override,q_auto,w_800/hbvjyaw9ukneh3ddihe8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795194", "eventUri": "eng-9795194", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The right-hander will try to build off that performance on Wednesday night when he faces the Colorado Rockies in Denver.\n\nColorado recorded a 6-3 win in the opener of the three-game series on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Rockies will send right-hander Ryan Feltner (1-10, 4.97 ERA) to the mound against Blackburn (5-2, 4.11), who will go from pitching in front of a mostly empty stadium in Oakland to a rabid fan base in New York.\n\nIf he pitches like he did against Los Angeles, he'll fit in fine. Blackburn's acquisition was a boost to a rotation hit hard by injuries, and he paid immediate dividends. His teammates enjoyed his debut and what he can do for the Mets.\n\n\"Pauly's an All-Star (in 2022) for a reason, and anytime he takes the ball you've got a really good chance to win,\" the Mets' Pete Alonso told reporters. \"He's a very polished arm.\"\n\nBlackburn has faced Colorado once in his career, last season in Denver when he was pitching for the Athletics. He got the win with six innings of two-run ball.\n\nBlackburn will attempt to get New York back to even on this 10-game road trip. The Mets are 2-3 so far and have lost ground to Arizona and San Diego in the NL wild-card standings.\n\nColorado is far back in the standings and already is playing for the future. The Rockies are on track for their second straight 100-loss season, but the blame doesn't rest with the left side of the infield. Third baseman Ryan McMahon and shortstop Ezequiel Tovar are a formidable duo that plays nearly flawless defense.\n\n\"Gold Glove caliber,\" Colorado manager Bud Black said. \"(McMahon) and Tovar on the left side -- I can't think of a better shortstop/third base tandem than those two guys. I challenge anybody to show me a better pair.\"\n\nFeltner has been on the receiving end of their defense, but it hasn't been enough to get him out of a personal losing streak. Feltner has not won since April 12 at Toronto, a streak that has spanned 19 starts.\n\nFeltner has experienced some bad luck during the winless streak, mostly in his last seven starts. In those outings he has a 2.88 ERA and is 0-3 with four no-decisions and has not allowed more than three earned runs in eight starts.\n\nEnding his futility Wednesday night might seem remote considering his history against New York. He has faced the Mets twice in his career and took the loss both times. He has given up 10 runs in 11 2/3 innings and lasted just 3 2/3 innings when he faced them in New York last month.\n\nIt also was the only time since early June he didn't pitch at least five innings.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki",

The British budget carrier declined to comment.\n\nThe insolvency comes as thousands of Germans enjoy their summer holidays and just ahead of a September general election.\n\nBerlin has granted a bridging loan of \u20ac150 million to allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany while negotiations continue.\n\nThe government said it expected decisions to result from these negotiations in the coming weeks.\n\nLufthansa has already leased Air Berlin planes to provide flights by its Eurowings budget airline and has made no secret of its interest in taking on more of Air Berlin's business while being mindful of the potential obstacles posed by debts and anti-trust issues.\n\n\"Lufthansa has played a canny waiting game over a number of years and is now well placed to cherry pick those parts of Air Berlin's operation that suit it best without buying the whole loss-making enterprise,\" Jonathan Wober, analyst at CAPA-Centre for Aviation, said.\n\nRecord loss\n\nRyanair said Air Berlin was being prepared for Lufthansa's takeover, which it said would breach competition laws.

Alitalia, another of Etihad's investments, is also in administration and is seeking bidders.\n\nMeanwhile talks between Etihad and TUI, Europe's largest tour operator, about forming a joint venture holiday airline by merging TUIfly with Air Berlin's leisure airline Niki collapsed earlier this year.\n\nShares in Air Berlin last traded down 34 percent at \u20ac0.51 today, valuing the airline at about \u20ac60 million.

The British budget carrier declined to comment.\n\nThe insolvency comes as thousands of Germans enjoy their summer holidays and just ahead of a September general election.\n\nBerlin has granted a bridging loan of 150 million euros (US$176 million) to allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany while negotiations continue.\n\nThe government said it expected decisions to result from these negotiations in the coming weeks.\n\nLufthansa has already leased Air Berlin planes to provide flights by its Eurowings budget airline and has made no secret of its interest in taking on more of Air Berlin's business while being mindful of the potential obstacles posed by debts and anti-trust issues.\n\n\"Lufthansa has played a canny waiting game over a number of years and is now well placed to cherry pick those parts of Air Berlin's operation that suit it best without buying the whole loss-making enterprise,\" Jonathan Wober, analyst at CAPA-Centre for Aviation, said.\n\nRECORD LOSS\n\nRyanair said Air Berlin was being prepared for Lufthansa's takeover, which it said would breach competition laws. But German transport minister Alexander Dobrindt said he was confident there would be no anti-trust issues because the business would be sold off in bits.\n\nIn a statement published after trading hours, the Irish carrier said it had lodged a complaint with the German and European competition authorities regarding \"the obvious conspiracy\" playing out in Germany over Air Berlin.\n\n\"This manufactured insolvency is clearly being set up to allow Lufthansa to take over a debt-free Air Berlin which will be in breach of all known German and EU competition rules,\" Ryanair said.\n\nAir Berlin, which became famous for its \"Mallorca shuttle\" services, piled up debt after a series of takeovers and bookings have been hit in recent months by concerns over its finances.\n\nIt made a net loss in almost every year since 2008 and in 2016 reported a record deficit of 782 million euros (US$915 million), equivalent to more than 2 million euros a day.\n\nFunding from Etihad Airways, which bought into the airline in 2011, has helped to keep it afloat and the Abu Dhabi-based airline provided an additional 250 million euros in April.\n\nBut Etihad has been reviewing its European investments after they failed to bring in the profits expected. Alitalia , another of Etihad's investments, is also in administration and is seeking bidders.\n\nMeanwhile talks between Etihad and TUI , Europe's largest tour operator, about forming a joint venture holiday airline by merging TUIfly with Air Berlin's leisure airline Niki collapsed earlier this year.\n\nShares in Air Berlin last traded down 34 percent at 0.51 euros on Tuesday, valuing the airline at about 60 million euros. Ten years ago the carrier was worth around 1 billion euros.\n\nLufthansa shares were up 4.7 percent at 20.59 euros.\n\nPilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) blamed the shortcomings of past management at Air Berlin for its woes and expressed anger with Etihad. \"It is a scandal that Etihad is dodging its responsibility and is leaving Air Berlin's staff out in the cold,\" VC President Ilja Schulz said in a statement.\n\n(Reporting by Victoria Bryan, Maria Sheahan; and Gernot Heller.

The British budget carrier declined to comment.\n\nThe insolvency comes as thousands of Germans enjoy their summer holidays and just ahead of a September general election.\n\nBerlin has granted a bridging loan of 150 million euros ($176 million) to allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany while negotiations continue.\n\nThe government said it expected decisions to result from these negotiations in the coming weeks.\n\nLufthansa has already leased Air Berlin planes to provide flights by its Eurowings budget airline and has made no secret of its interest in taking on more of Air Berlin's business while being mindful of the potential obstacles posed by debts and anti-trust issues.\n\n\"Lufthansa has played a canny waiting game over a number of years and is now well placed to cherry pick those parts of Air Berlin's operation that suit it best without buying the whole loss-making enterprise,\" Jonathan Wober, analyst at CAPA-Centre for Aviation, said.\n\nRECORD LOSS\n\nRyanair said Air Berlin was being prepared for Lufthansa's takeover, which it said would breach competition laws. But German transport minister Alexander Dobrindt said he was confident there would be no anti-trust issues because the business would be sold off in bits.\n\nIn a statement published after trading hours, the Irish carrier said it had lodged a complaint with the German and European competition authorities regarding \"the obvious conspiracy\" playing out in Germany over Air Berlin.\n\n\"This manufactured insolvency is clearly being set up to allow Lufthansa to take over a debt-free Air Berlin which will be in breach of all known German and EU competition rules,\" Ryanair said.\n\nAir Berlin, which became famous for its \"Mallorca shuttle\" services, piled up debt after a series of takeovers and bookings have been hit in recent months by concerns over its finances.\n\nIt made a net loss in almost every year since 2008 and in 2016 reported a record deficit of 782 million euros ($915 million), equivalent to more than 2 million euros a day.\n\nFunding from Etihad Airways, which bought into the airline in 2011, has helped to keep it afloat and the Abu Dhabi-based airline provided an additional 250 million euros in April.\n\nBut Etihad has been reviewing its European investments after they failed to bring in the profits expected. Alitalia , another of Etihad's investments, is also in administration and is seeking bidders.\n\nMeanwhile talks between Etihad and TUI, Europe's largest tour operator, about forming a joint venture holiday airline by merging TUIfly with Air Berlin's leisure airline Niki collapsed earlier this year.\n\nShares in Air Berlin last traded down 34 percent at 0.51 euros on Tuesday, valuing the airline at about 60 million euros. Ten years ago the carrier was worth around 1 billion euros.\n\nLufthansa shares were up 4.7 percent at 20.59 euros.\n\nPilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) blamed the shortcomings of past management at Air Berlin for its woes and expressed anger with Etihad. \"It is a scandal that Etihad is dodging its responsibility and is leaving Air Berlin's staff out in the cold,\" VC President Ilja Schulz said in a statement.

The British budget carrier declined to comment.\n\nThe insolvency comes as thousands of Germans enjoy their summer holidays and just ahead of a September general election.\n\nBerlin has granted a bridging loan of \u20ac150 million ($176 million) to allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany while negotiations continue.\n\nThe government said it expected decisions from these negotiations in coming weeks.\n\nLufthansa has already leased Air Berlin planes to provide flights by its Eurowings budget airline and has made no secret of its interest in taking on more of Air Berlin's business, although debts and anti-trust issues were potential obstacles.\n\n\"Lufthansa has played a canny waiting game over a number of years and is now well placed to cherry pick those parts of Air Berlin's operation that suit it best without buying the whole lossmaking enterprise,\" Jonathan Wober, analyst at CAPA-Center for Aviation, said.\n\nRyanair said Lufthansa was being set up to take over Air Berlin, which it said would breach competition laws. But German transport minister Alexander Dobrindt said he was confident there would be no anti-trust issues because the business would be sold off in bits.\n\nAir Berlin, which became famous for its \"Mallorca shuttle\" services, piled up debt after a series of takeovers and bookings have been hit in recent months by concerns over its finances.\n\nIt made a net loss in almost every year since 2008 and in 2016 reported a record deficit of \u20ac782 million, equivalent to more than \u20ac2 million a day.\n\nFunding from Etihad Airways, which bought into the airline in 2011, has helped to keep it afloat and the Abu Dhabi-based airline provided an additional \u20ac250 million in April.\n\nBut Etihad has been reviewing its European investments after they failed to bring in expected profits. Alitalia, another of Etihad's investments, is also in administration and is seeking bidders.\n\nMeanwhile talks between Etihad and TUI, Europe's largest tour operator, about forming a joint venture holiday airline by merging TUIfly with Air Berlin's leisure airline Niki collapsed earlier this year.\n\nShares in Air Berlin were down 32 percent at \u20ac0.53 by 2.18 p.m. GMT, valuing the airline at roughly \u20ac60 million.

(Michael Kappeler/dpa via AP)\n\nThe loan cash is expected to last for three months, the government said, after which the airline's future is uncertain. Rival Lufthansa, which is Germany's biggest carrier, and another unidentified airline are in talks to take over some operations, the government said.\n\nUnion ver.di called it a \"severe blow\" for the more-than 7,000 employees of Air Berlin.\n\n\"Our priority now lies with securing the jobs,\" said Christine Behle, a union board director. \"Air Berlin must proceed with transparency and provide all important information.\"\n\nEconomy Minister Brigitte Zypries said that the bridge loan should give Air Berlin enough time to wrap up talks on the sale of some operations.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing was prompted by the decision by Etihad, which holds a 29.2 percent stake, to stop funneling money into the airline after years of propping it up.\n\nAir Berlin said that in light of Etihad's decision, it \"came to the conclusion that there was no further positive way ahead for Air Berlin.\"\n\nAlready the carrier had been trying to ease its costs and lighten its debt load of 1.2 billion euros. In December, it reached a deal to lease 38 plans to Lufthansa's units Eurowings and Austrian Airlines.\n\nEtihad Airways said the bankruptcy filing was \"extremely disappointing for all parties,\" especially as it had supported the airline over six years, but that it could not continue pumping money into a loss-making business.\n\n\"As a minority shareholder, Etihad cannot offer funding that would further increase our financial exposure. We remain open to helping find a commercially viable solution for all parties,\" it said.\n\nIt said it had injected 250 million euros of additional funding into Air Berlin as recently as April and helped it \"explore strategic options\" for its business. But it said the carrier's business \"deteriorated at an unprecedented pace, preventing it from overcoming its significant challenges and from implementing alternative strategic solutions.\"\n\nThe Emirati national airline said it continues to have codeshares and other business relationships with Air Berlin and will support its management.\n\nShares in Air Berlin plunged 39 percent on Tuesday after being suspended for trading earlier.\n\nAir Berlin's decision comes three and a half months after another Etihad-backed European carrier, Alitalia, entered its second round of bankruptcy protection in a decade.\n\nEtihad said at the time that Alitalia needed a \"fundamental and far-reaching restructuring\" and it was not prepared to keep pumping money into the struggling Italian airline.\n\nKirsten Grieshaber in Berlin and Adam Schreck in Dubai contributed to this story.", "id": "9323639", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Air Berlin files for bankruptcy after shareholder pulls plug - Aurora Sentinel", "image": "http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aurorasentinel/asuplads/20170815092012/AP17227477891562.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 812, "date": "2016-10-05", "amb": false, "textEnd": 824}, {"textStart": 1143, "freq": 5, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1156}, {"textStart": 1345, "date": "2016-09-29", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1359}, {"textStart": 1888, "date": "2017-06-12", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1901}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "8861", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "111334", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Euro"}, "id": "302536", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "id": "302694", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flag carrier"}, "id": "312659", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_carrier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}, "id": "316354", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}, "id": "316652", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}, "id": "326178", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways"}, {"label": {"eng": "Codeshare agreement"}, "id": "331477", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeshare_agreement"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eurowings"}, "id": "351761", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurowings"}, {"label": {"eng": "Berlin Tegel Airport"}, "id": "356757", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Tegel_Airport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Austrian Airlines"}, "id": "398058", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Airlines"}, {"label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf Airport"}, "id": "770970", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00fcsseldorf_Airport"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 72, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 304, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 328, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 855, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1043, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation"}], "time": "17:02:00"}

The British budget carrier declined to comment.\n\nThe insolvency comes as thousands of Germans enjoy their summer holidays and just ahead of a September general election.\n\nBerlin has granted a bridging loan of 150 million euros ($176 million) to allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany while negotiations continue.\n\nThe government said it expected decisions from these negotiations in coming weeks.\n\nLufthansa has already leased Air Berlin planes to provide flights by its Eurowings budget airline and has made no secret of its interest in taking on more of Air Berlin's business, although debts and anti-trust issues were potential obstacles.\n\n\"Lufthansa has played a canny waiting game over a number of years and is now well placed to cherry pick those parts of Air Berlin's operation that suit it best without buying the whole loss-making enterprise,\" Jonathan Wober, analyst at CAPA-Centre for Aviation, said.\n\nRECORD LOSS\n\nRyanair said Lufthansa was being set up to take over Air Berlin, which it said would breach competition laws. But German transport minister Alexander Dobrindt said he was confident there would be no anti-trust issues because the business would be sold off in bits.\n\nAir Berlin, which became famous for its \"Mallorca shuttle\" services, piled up debt after a series of takeovers and bookings have been hit in recent months by concerns over its finances.\n\nIt made a net loss in almost every year since 2008 and in 2016 reported a record deficit of 782 million euros ($915 million), equivalent to more than 2 million euros a day.\n\nFunding from Etihad Airways, which bought into the airline in 2011, has helped to keep it afloat and the Abu Dhabi-based airline provided an additional 250 million euros in April.\n\nBut Etihad has been reviewing its European investments after they failed to bring in expected profits. Alitalia, another of Etihad's investments, is also in administration and is seeking bidders.\n\nMeanwhile talks between Etihad and TUI, Europe's largest tour operator, about forming a joint venture holiday airline by merging TUIfly with Air Berlin's leisure airline Niki collapsed earlier this year.\n\nShares in Air Berlin were down 32 percent at 0.53 euros by 1418 GMT, valuing the airline at roughly 60 million euros. Ten years ago the carrier was worth around 1 billion euros.\n\nLufthansa shares were up 4.1 percent at 20.47 euros.\n\nPilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) blamed the shortcomings of past management at Air Berlin for its woes and expressed anger with Etihad. \"It is a scandal that Etihad is dodging its responsibility and is leaving Air Berlin's staff out in the cold,\" VC President Ilja Schulz said in a statement.\n\n($1 = 0.8548 euros) (Reporting by Victoria Bryan, Maria Sheahan; and Gernot Heller; Editing by Greg Mahlich and David Holmes)\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "id": "9307016", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Air Berlin files for insolvency after Etihad withdraws support - Times of India", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 287, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 293}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "8861", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "110227", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00fcsseldorf", "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "111334", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Euro"}, "id": "302536", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "id": "302694", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}, "id": "304668", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryanair"}, "id": "315139", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}, "id": "316354", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}, "id": "316652", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alitalia"}, "id": "324150", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alitalia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}, "id": "326178", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways"}, {"label": {"eng": "EasyJet"}, "id": "336815", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyJet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eurowings"}, "id": "351761", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurowings"}, {"label": {"eng": "Berlin Tegel Airport"}, "id": "356757", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Tegel_Airport"}, {"label": {"eng": "TUIfly"}, "id": "567912", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUIfly"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 855, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 857, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control"}], "time": "15:29:00"}

German Economic Minister Brigitte Zypries said Monday that loan should keep Air Berlin flying for at least three months.\n\nShe added Air Berlin is in negotiations with Lufthansa AG, Germany's national air carrier -- a deal that could see Lufthansa take over some of Air Berlin's assets and air routes.\n\nThe announcement of insolvency puts thousands of German jobs at risk, and comes weeks before German Chancellor Angela Merkel runs for re-election.", "id": "9292934", "details": {"liCnt": 385}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Air Berlin files for insolvency after Etihad backs out", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2451502802952/2017/i/15028032753144/v2.1/Air-Berlin-files-for-insolvency-after-Etihad-backs-out.jpg?lg=4", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 0, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 7}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "1", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "109", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "8861", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Euro"}, "id": "302536", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "id": "302694", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"}, {"label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}, "id": "304668", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flag carrier"}, "id": "312659", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_carrier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}, "id": "316354", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}, "id": "316652", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alitalia"}, "id": "324150", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alitalia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}, "id": "326178", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brigitte Zypries"}, "id": "428172", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_Zypries"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 855, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 857, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control"}], "time": "14:09:00"}

But the airline says it wants to remain in operation following a government bailout.\n\nIn a stock market filing Tuesday, Germany's second largest airline said it had filed for bankruptcy protection after its main shareholder, Gulf carrier Etihad, had withdrawn funding for Air Berlin.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Air Berlin had come to the conclusion that there was no \"positive prognosis for continuing the airline,\" the filing said. It added that two members of the board of directors, who joined after being nominated by Etihad, had resigned.\n\nHowever, the airline requested the right to carry out insolvency proceedings under its own management, which would \"facilitate negotiations with Lufthansa and other interested parties about a possible sale of Air Berlin operations,\" the airline said.\n\nAccording to German government sources, Berlin will support the plan with a bridge loan of 150 million euros ($176.2 million), ensuring that Air Berlin flights would continue according to schedule.\n\n\"We're in a time when many tens of thousands of travelers and vacationers are in multiple international holiday spots,\" the Economics Ministry and Transportation Ministry said in a joint statement. \"The return flights of these travelers back to Germany with Air Berlin would not have been otherwise possible.\"\n\nThe government funding also makes sure that Air Berlin aircraft currently under lease from rivals Eurowings and Austrian Airlines can stay in operation.\n\nLosses forever?\n\nStill in June, the German airline insisted it had sufficient cash to stay solvent despite suffering heavy losses and a string of flight cancellations. \"Insolvency is not an issue for us. We have sufficient liquidity and a reliable partner, Etihad, which has pledged its support through to October 2018,\" a spokeswoman said at the time.\n\nAir Berlin booked losses amounting to 1.2 billion euros for the last two years, and has depended on cash infusions from key shareholder Etihad for many years. Except for two quarters, Air Berlin has never turned a profit since 2008.\n\nIn a bid turn to the tide, the budget carrier has embarked on a massive restructuring plan in September 2016 that included renting 38 aircraft with crew to Lufthansa and slashing 1,200 jobs - about one in seven of its workforce.\n\nAmid the restructuring, it was hit by a series of flight cancellations and severe delays, leading to a flood of complaints. This has led to a massive drop in customers.\n\nBetween January and July, a total of 13.79 million passengers flew on the airline, marking a decrease of 16 per cent compared to the same period in 2016. In July alone, the total number of passengers served by Air Berlin fell by 24 percent compared to the same month last year.\n\nNow, Germany's flagship carrier, Lufthansa, appears to become Air Berlin's savior. Germany's biggest airline said Tuesday that it was \"already in negotiations with Air Berlin to take over parts of the Airberlin Group and is exploring the possibility of hiring additional staff.\"", "id": "9273019", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Air Berlin files for bankruptcy protection | Business | DW | 15.08.2017", "image": "http://www.dw.com/image/39179723_304.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2106, "date": "2018-10-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2118}, {"textStart": 2482, "date": "2016-09-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2496}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "111334", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Euro"}, "id": "302536", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "id": "302694", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"}, {"label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}, "id": "304668", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}, "id": "309522", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}, "id": "316354", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}, "id": "316652", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Insolvency"}, "id": "317041", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency"}, {"label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}, "id": "326178", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eurowings"}, "id": "351761", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurowings"}, {"label": {"eng": "Austrian Airlines"}, "id": "398058", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Airlines"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 72, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 78, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 328, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 855, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality"}], "time": "11:14:00"}

second biggest airline, filed for insolvency on Tuesday after its main shareholder, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, withdrew financial aid for the loss-making carrier.\n\nThe move by the struggling airline forced the German government to step in to provide it with a temporary credit of 150 million euros (176 million dollars) to help it continue operating.\n\n\"Air Berlin operations can be carried on to its full extent, as a result avoiding a discontinuation of the airline operation,\" the Ministry for Economic Affairs said in a statement.\n\nREAD: International Drinks Festival Comes To

especially as Etihad has provided extensive support to airberlin for its previous liquidity challenges and restructuring efforts over the past six years,\" Etihad said in a statement.\n\nAir Berlin has operated at a loss every year since 2008, except for 2012, when it sold off its frequent flyer programme.\n\nEtihad acquired a 29.2 per cent stake in Air Berlin in 2012, becoming its largest shareholder and providing injections of capital to keep the airline afloat.\n\nGermany's biggest airline, Lufthansa, is now in talks with Air Berlin to take over sections of operations as part of a wider restructuring of Air Berlin, which ran up a loss last year of about 782 million euros and has debts totalling nearly 1.2 billion euros.\n\n\"Negotiations are very advanced, particularly with Lufthansa,\" German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said on Tuesday in Berlin, noting that other companies are also looking to acquire parts of Air Berlin.\n\nThe transport minister wouldn't expect a deal between Germany's two largest airlines to result in antitrust problems, because Lufthansa isn't interested in buying the entire company, but rather only parts of the insolvent company.\n\nAir Berlin said its Niki Luftfahrt GmbH and Leisure Cargo GmbH units were not part of the insolvency plan.", "id": "9454051", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Geneva airport:

general election.\n\nBut Berlin said it has granted a bridging loan of 150 million euros (US$176 million) which will allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure jobs for its 7,200 workers in Germany while negotiations continue.\n\nAir Berlin is in talks with Lufthansa and another airline about selling its assets, the government said, adding that it expected a decision in the coming weeks.\n\nLufthansa has already leased crewed planes from Air Berlin to provide flights by its Eurowings budget airline and has made no secret of its interest in taking on more of Air Berlin's business, although it has said debts and anti-trust issues were potential obstacles.\n\n\"Lufthansa has played a canny waiting game over a number of years and is now well-placed to cherry pick those parts of Air Berlin's operation that suit it best without buying the whole loss-making enterprise,\" Jonathan Wober, analyst at CAPA-Centre for Aviation, said.\n\nAir Berlin, which became famous for its \"Mallorca shuttle\" services, piled up debt after a series of takeovers and concerns over its finances have hit bookings in recent months.\n\nIt has made a net loss in almost every

airline in 2011, has helped to keep it afloat in recent years, but the Abu Dhabi-based airline has been reviewing its European investments after they failed to bring in the profit it expected.\n\nEtihad last provided additional funding of 250 million euros to Air Berlin in April.\n\nItalian national airline Alitalia, another of Etihad's investments, is also in administration and

The European Commission subsequently confirmed thatit was investigating whether the assistance to the Berlin-basedbudget airline was compliant with antitrust legislation.\n\nA commission spokesperson said that it was in a \"constructivecontact with Germany\" and always willing to discuss governmentplans in order to ensure that state aid did not illegally distortcompetition.\n\nGerman Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt did not believe anyantitrust regulation had been breached considering that only apartial sale of Air Berlin was being negotiated.\n\nNonetheless, rival budget airline Ryanair has announced itsintention to challenge the provision of state aid before EUcompetition authorities.\n\n\"This artificial insolvency has clearly been constructed toenable Lufthansa to acquire Air Berlin without its debt and thiscontradicts competition rules in Germany and the EU,\" Ryanair wroteon its website. Ryanair saw an \"obvious conspiracy between theGerman government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin.\"\n\n\"Now Lufthansa can make domestic flights even more expensivethan they already are. Passengers are paying the price for thismonopoly,\" the Dublin-based carrier added.\n\nSeveral German media quoted an unnamed insider on Wednesdaysaying that the objective of Air Berlin's insolvency had been to\"keep Ryanair out.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Air Berlin was forced to file for insolvency whenits biggest shareholder Etihad refused to offer additionalfinancial support for the unprofitable airline. The Abu-Dhabi basedstate-owned carrier had sustained Air Berlin throughout years offinancial and organizational woes.\n\nAir Berlin had not been profitable for years, posting a recordloss of 780 million euros (913 million dollars) in 2016 andaccumulating a pile of debt worth 1.2 billion euros (1.4 billiondollars). The firm revealed last week that passenger numbers inJuly had fallen sharply by 24 percent, finally leading Etihad torenege on an earlier promise of open-ended funding.\n\nDuring the three months which are now available to Air Berlinfor self-administered insolvency procedures, the German governmentwill pay the wages of its 7,200 employees. It remains unclear howmany of the firm's staff could keep their jobs.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned for the jobs of employees,\" ChristineBehle, director of the trade union ver.di said Wednesday.\n\nLufthansa so far only made a vague statement that an acquisitionwould \"offer the opportunity to hire staff\" and that it intended\"to bring these negotiations to a swift and positiveconclusion.\"\n\nThe rival firm has considered buying Air Berlin for severalyears but always balked at the mountain of debt which it would haveto assume. At the close of trading on Tuesday, Lufthansa's stockwas the biggest daily winner on the DAX exchange after jumping by4.4 percent.

The European Commission subsequently confirmed that it was investigating whether the assistance to the Berlin-based budget airline was compliant with antitrust legislation.\n\nA commission spokesperson said that it was in a \"constructive contact with Germany\" and always willing to discuss government plans in order to ensure that state aid did not illegally distort competition.\n\nGerman Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt did not believe any antitrust regulation had been breached considering that only a partial sale of Air Berlin was being negotiated.\n\nNonetheless, rival budget airline Ryanair has announced its intention to challenge the provision of state aid before EU competition authorities.\n\n\"This artificial insolvency has clearly been constructed to enable Lufthansa to acquire Air Berlin without its debt and this contradicts competition rules in Germany and the EU,\" Ryanair wrote on its website. Ryanair saw an \"obvious conspiracy between the German government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin.\"\n\n\"Now Lufthansa can make domestic flights even more expensive than they already are. Passengers are paying the price for this monopoly,\" the Dublin-based carrier added.\n\nSeveral German media quoted an unnamed insider on Wednesday saying that the objective of Air Berlin's insolvency had been to \"keep Ryanair out.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Air Berlin was forced to file for insolvency when its biggest shareholder Etihad refused to offer additional financial support for the unprofitable airline. The Abu-Dhabi based state-owned carrier had sustained Air Berlin throughout years of financial and organizational woes.\n\nAir Berlin had not been profitable for years, posting a record loss of 780 million euros (913 million dollars) in 2016 and accumulating a pile of debt worth 1.2 billion euros (1.4 billion dollars).

German airline Air Berlin aims to strike deals to sell assets to two or more buyers by the end of September, before a government loan keeping its planes in the air runs out, its chief executive said.\n\nThe group is in talks with a total of three aviation firms, including Lufthansa, German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung quoted Thomas Winkelmann as saying in its Thursday edition.\n\nAll three are \"reputable in terms of their finances, sufficiently large to offer Air Berlin a secure future and are interested in keeping Germany as a base of operations\", he said, without naming any of the interested parties.\n\nAir Berlin, Germany's second-largest airline, filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday after key shareholder Etihad Airways withdrew funding following years of losses, leaving valuable runway slots up for grabs.\n\nThe insolvency comes with thousands of Germans enjoying summer holidays, and just ahead of a September general election.\n\nThe German government granted a bridging loan of \u20ac150 million (SR658.69 million) to allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany while negotiations go on.\n\nThe move offers Lufthansa and rivals a chance to acquire slots at airports such as Berlin Tegel and Duesseldorf, with Germany's largest airline keen to defend its domestic position against expansion by low-cost rival Ryanair.\n\nAccording to Winkelmann, the negotiations also include assets of Air Berlin unit Niki, which Etihad had agreed to buy for \u20ac300 million earlier this year.\n\nRedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland, a group which represents German newspapers, cited government sources as saying that Lufthansa, its budget carrier Eurowings and Condor would likely snap up Air Berlin's most valuable landing slots.\n\nIt said a few slots could also go to Ryanair, which has filed a complaint with German and European Union competition authorities over the insolvency process, which its chief executive describes as a \"conspiracy\".\n\nLufthansa has confirmed it is in talks to take over parts of Air Berlin's business, while a source has said easyJet was also part of the negotiations.\n\nThomas Cook's German airline Condor said on Wednesday it was ready to play \"an active role\" in Air Berlin's restructuring, without being more

In April this year, Etihad provided EUR 250 million of additional funding to Air Berlin as well as supporting the airline to explore strategic options for the business. However, Air Berlin's business has deteriorated at an unprecedented pace, preventing it from overcoming its significant challenges and from implementing alternative strategic solutions.

Ryanair seems to prefer staying on the sidelines sulking.\n\nA day after Air Berlin had announced it was seeking protection from its creditors, Lufthansa was the best-performing European stock, up 4.7 percent in morning trading, with budget rivals EasyJet and Ryanair hot on its heels. The jump in European airline stocks was prompted by a German government announcement, saying Lufthansa and another airline were in talks to take over some of Air Berlin's assets.\n\nLufthansa has made no secret of its interest in taking on more of Air Berlin's business while being mindful of the potential obstacles posed by debts and anti-trust issues. The German flagship carrier already has a close relationship with its former rival following an agreement last year to lease 40 Air Berlin aircraft and crew.\n\n\"Lufthansa has played a canny waiting game over a number of years and is now well placed to cherry-pick those parts of Air Berlin operations that suit it best without buying the whole loss-making enterprise,\" said Jonathan Wober, analyst at CAPA-Centre for Aviation.\n\nAnd Anand Date, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to investors that a combined Lufthansa-Air Berlin would have \"strong positions\" at several key airports, including Vienna, D\u00fcsseldorf and Zurich. \"It's a very close statement between Lufthansa, Air Berlin and the German government, which suggests Lufthansa is in quite a good position with regards to what it wants to do with Air Berlin's assets,\" he added.\n\nAir Berlin filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday after key shareholder Etihad Airways withdrew funding following years of losses, leaving valuable runway slots up for grabs.\n\nThe insolvency comes with thousands of Germans enjoying summer holidays abroad on flights booked with the airline. Therefore, the German government has granted a bridging loan of 150 million euros ($176 million) to allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany while negotiations continue.\n\nOther contenders\n\nBerlin is expecting decisions to result from these negotiations in the coming weeks. German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said he did not expect any deal to rescue Air Berlin as a complete airline.\n\n\"There is no transfer of Air Berlin as a whole... there are parts of the business that will go to Lufthansa and there are interested parties for other bits of the business, so we do not expect cartel difficulties,\" Dobrindt said\n\nEasyJet, Europe's second biggest low-cost airline, is understood to be the second carrier in the race for Air Berlin assets, according to sources close to the talks.\n\n\"The goal has been to keep out Ryanair,\" one person familiar with the talks told the news agency Reuters. EasyJet would be keen to acquire slots to boost its small presence in Germany, where Lufthansa dominates. An EasyJet spokesman said the airline would not comment on speculation.\n\nRyanair sulking in the wings\n\nMeanwhile, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, Ireland's Ryanair, is not believed to be seeking any part of Air Berlin. The airline even lodged a competition complaint on Tuesday with German authorities and the European Commission.\n\nIt claimed that there was an \"obvious conspiracy\" between the German government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin to carve up Air Berlin's assets, excluding competitors and ignoring EU competition and state aid rules.\n\n\"This is clearly being set up for Lufthansa to take over Air Berlin, which will be in breach of all known German and EU competition rules. Now even the German government is supporting this Lufthansa-led deal with 150 million euros of state aid.

Weeks before an election where Angela Merkel will seek a fourth term, the German government was forced to step in with a loan to keep Air Berlin's planes flying through the busy summer vacation season -- and at least until November.\n\nYet as ripe with losers as Air Berlin's history has been, there are also beneficiaries in the airline's collapse. Deutsche Lufthansa AG, the No. 1 airline in the country, has attempted a creeping takeover of Air Berlin ever since its rival's woes deepened. Lufthansa was quick to assume the role of rescuer, saying it supports Air Berlin in its restructuring effort and will engage in swift negotiations to absorb more of the troubled carrier.\n\n\"For Lufthansa we see any moves as defensive -- blocking other more competitive airlines from expanding,\" RBC Capital analyst Damian Brewer said in a note to clients.\n\nThat points to faster consolidation of the travel sector in Europe's largest economy, where airlines compete increasingly on price. Low-cost specialists EasyJet Plc and Ryanair Holdings Plc have muscled forcefully into the German market, aggressively pushing into Frankfurt and Berlin.\n\nRyanair needed no time to snap at Lufthansa's helping hand, saying Air Berlin is being \"set up\" for an acquisition by its bigger rival, and that such a move would be in breach of antitrust regulation. The Irish carrier said the government's pledge of 150 million euros ($176 million) in aid to keep Air Berlin operating will \"drive domestic airfares in Germany even higher than they already are,\" according to a statement by Ryanair. \"German customers and visitors will suffer higher airfares to pay for this Lufthansa monopoly.\"\n\nAir Berlin's latest turnaround included cutting its fleet in half by leasing planes to Lufthansa and hiving off Niki, a subsidiary focused on vacation travel. The strategy was to concentrate on hubs in Berlin and Dusseldorf, largely to funnel traffic to Etihad's long-haul routes. With the Gulf carrier's pullout and Air Berlin's deteriorating operations, that plan proved unviable.\n\nDespite the turmoil, Air Berlin remains a force to be reckoned with in Germany. The carrier commands a market share of about 28 percent in Berlin, transporting more than 5 million passengers in the first seven months of 2017. It has built a major presence on routes connecting Germany with Austria and Switzerland, and is a strong player in transporting Germans to sunny vacation destinations such as Sardinia, Mallorca, and Crete.\n\nLufthansa doubled down on its support for Air Berlin after Tuesday's insolvency filing, saying it's already in talks to take over parts of its ailing rival and provide an avenue for employees seeking a new job. Germany's government signaled its willingness to back those plans, with Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt saying he doesn't see competition concerns.\n\nThe past decade has been tough on Europe's former flag carriers. Some, like Alitalia SpA, have limped on under varying owners -- the Italian airline filed for insolvency four months before Air Berlin -- while others such as Malev of Hungary have outright disappeared. Established players like KLM, Aer Lingus and Swissair have been pulled into three giant holding companies: IAG SA, Air France-KLM Group, and Lufthansa's own family of carriers, leaving only a few independents such as SAS Group, Finnair, and LOT Polish Airlines.\n\nYet Europe remains far more fractured than the U.S. That uneven global playing field is visible in projections by the International Air Transport Association, which estimated in December that almost 61 percent of the global industry's 2017 net income will come from North America. European airlines, by contrast, may see profit slump 25 percent, depressed by intense competition.\n\nFrom the onset, Etihad struggled with the ownership restrictions on Air Berlin, which gave some sway over the German carrier's direction but never the full control it would have needed for a real turnaround. The same hurdle knee-capped Etihad's foray into Italy and hastened the demise of Alitalia, all but blowing up the Gulf carrier's plan to build a loose network of equity alliances that could feed global passengers into its Abu Dhabi hub.\n\nEtihad \"couldn't have picked two more insolvent companies than Alitalia and Air Berlin,'' said Stephen Furlong, an analyst at brokerage J&E Davy Holdings Ltd. in Dublin.\n\nWith billions spent on second-tier airlines and demand in the Middle East falling, Etihad ultimately decided to pull the plug on Air Berlin, and withdraw its two representatives from the supervisory board. It was an inglorious retreat for a carrier that once had high-flying ambitions to rival Emirates. With the departure last month of the architect of that plan, former Chief Executive Officer James Hogan, Etihad and its government owners are reviewing their strategy, leading to the demise of Alitalia and Air Berlin in quick succession.\n\nFor Air Berlin shareholders, there's little left to salvage from their investment. The shares, which sold for 12 euros each in an initial public offering in May 2006, have languished as a penny stock since 2015. Today, the carrier's market value stands at about 60 million euros -- less than a single narrow-body Airbus or Boeing aircraft.", "id": "9311980", "details": {"liCnt": 56}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "The Real Losers in Air Berlin's Demise", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i8N_SwyNNT_U/v0/1200x800.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 5502, "date": "2006-05-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 5510}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Austria"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "11", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Austria"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "42", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "109", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "111334", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt am Main, Stadt"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "277805", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt am Main, Stadt"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "id": "302694", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"}, {"location": null, "score": 4, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Angela Merkel"}, "id": "303059", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}, "id": "304668", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aer Lingus"}, "id": "304731", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aer_Lingus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryanair"}, "id": "315139", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}, "id": "316354", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}, "id": "316652", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin"}, {"label": {"eng": "LOT Polish Airlines"}, "id": "316707", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOT_Polish_Airlines"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alitalia"}, "id": "324150", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alitalia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}, "id": "326178", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways"}, {"label": {"eng": "KLM"}, "id": "333309", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM"}, {"label": {"eng": "Swissair"}, "id": "333310", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swissair"}, {"label": {"eng": "EasyJet"}, "id": "336815", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyJet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air France\u2013KLM"}, "id": "439758", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France\u2013KLM"}, {"label": {"eng": "Finnair"}, "id": "458605", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnair"}, {"label": {"eng": "SAS Group"}, "id": "478363", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_Group"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 855, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 857, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control"}], "time": "15:57:00"}

There are also antitrust concerns.\n\nWith the holiday season at its height and the general election just five weeks away, Chancellor Angela Merkel could not have afforded to let the country's second-largest airline collapse.\n\n\"80,000 stranded holidaymakers, that's almost 80,000 voters. The political calculation is that simple,\" said one official in Berlin.\n\nBut the government's decision on Tuesday to grant a bridging loan of \u20ac150 million (\u20ac177 million) has caused controversy. The aim of the loan is to keep Air Berlin, which on Tuesday filed for bankruptcy protection after its biggest shareholder Etihad refused to make further funds available, operational for three months pending talks to sell it.\n\nMs. Merkel tried to limit the political fallout on Wednesday. Asked in a YouTube interview how big the risk was that taxpayers would pay for a rescue, Ms. Merkel said: \"That is quite low, otherwise we would not have been allowed to grant this bridge loan ... We can say that in all likelihood the taxpayer will not have to pay for that.\"\n\n\"Air Berlin isn't a systemically relevant company. I ask myself why the government has gotten involved.\"\n\nBut even members of her own party doubt that. \"We're never going to see those \u20ac150 million again,\" said Michael Fuchs, economic policy spokesman for Ms. Merkel's conservatives.\n\nIn the first quarter, Air Berlin lost \u20ac23.5 million a month. Analysts expect even bigger losses in the second quarter which was beset by delays and cancellations as the airline's troubles deepened. The second-quarter results haven't been published yet.\n\nEconomics Minister Brigitte Zypries and Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt are pinning their hopes for a repayment of the loan on the sale of its attractive take-off and landing slots in Germany.\n\nThe problem is that Air Berlin's management recently revised down the value of those slots to \u20ac80 million from \u20ac176 million.\n\nOpposition politicians have scented blood. \"Economics Minister Brigitte Zypries has failed on all levels,\" said Michael Theurer of the pro-business Free Democratic Party.\n\nDieter Janecek, economic policy spokesman of the Greens, said: \"Air Berlin isn't a systemically relevant company. I ask myself why the government has gotten involved.\"\n\nNational carrier Lufthansa is likely to clinch many of those prized slots because its long-running presence at the airports affected will make it eligible for preferential treatment in their allocation. Such a deal, however, might be subject to strict conditions to prevent Lufthansa from gaining a dominant position at these airports, the head of Germany's antitrust watchdog, Achim Wambach, told newspaper Rheinische Post.\n\nTransport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said antitrust issues should not narrowed down to market positions in individual, regional airports.\n\n\"We need a German champion in international air travel,\" Mr. Dobrindt was quoted as saying by Rheinische Post on Thursday. \"Therefore it is of the utmost importance that Lufthansa is able to buy substantial parts of Air Berlin.\"\n\nThere's an alternative scenario in which Lufthansa would obtain the slots by acquiring parts of the airline. Air Berlin already flies 38 planes for Lufthansa and that business has been placed in a separate company, Air Berlin Aeronautics GmbH, to shield it from an insolvency. In theory, Lufthansa could place other parts of Air Berlin that it's interested in, such as its long-haul jets, into that company and then wholly acquire it. Or it could buy the individual planes and their crews one by one.\n\nIn addition to Lufthansa, two other carriers are interested in buying parts of Air Berlin, the insolvent firm's Chief Executive Thomas Winkelmann told newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine. Travel agency Thomas cook and its airline subsidiary Condor have expressed interest in Air Berlin's operations, while insiders told news agency Reuters that Easyjet was also among the parties eyeing assets.\n\nIrish budget rival Ryanair has lodged a complaint with the German antitrust regulator, the Bundeskartellamt, and the European Commission, accusing the German government of providing \"unlawful state aid\" and of conspiring with Lufthansa to carve up Air Berlin.\n\n\"There's nobody out there at the moment speaking for German consumers or for visitors to Germany who will be paying much higher air fares.\"\n\nIn an interview with Handelsblatt, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the government was providing the loan so that Lufthansa can take over Air Berlin.\n\n\"This will involve the number one airline in Germany taking over the number two airline in Germany, eliminating almost all competition on German domestic routes so that Lufthansa can increase air fares even higher and penalize German consumers even more,\" Mr. O'Leary said.\n\n\"And there's nobody out there at the moment speaking for German consumers or for visitors to Germany who will be paying much higher air fares. If Lufthansa wants to acquire Air Berlin, why didn't Lufthansa lend Air Berlin \u20ac150 million? They're going to break almost every known German and EU competition rule on the basis of 'Air Berlin is in financial difficulty and we've got to protect German passengers.' It shows yet again that there's one rule for the Germans and a different rule for everybody else.\"\n\nHe added that Ryanair and other airlines would be interested in buying parts of Air Berlin if it went through a \"normal and fair\" liquidation process.\n\nThe German government said its support for Air Berlin did not breach antitrust rules. And a spokeswoman for the EU Commission said she was \"confident that solutions can be found in keeping with EU law.\" She said complaints such as the one lodged by Ryanair would not delay the process.\n\nThis isn't, of course, the first time that the German government has intervened to shore up a struggling company. In 1999, then-Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der boosted his failing approval ratings by arranging a state loan to save construction group Holzmann. The company went bust before the loan was paid out, however.\n\nIn 2002, cellphone company Mobilcom came knocking and got \u20ac50 million in assistance from state-owned development bank KfW, \u20ac270 million less than it had requested.\n\nIn the financial crisis, Germany used KfW to make \u20ac40 billion available for firms that were healthy but couldn't get credit. Only a fraction of that money was every used.\n\nAir Berlin's staff, meanwhile, will be watching developments even more anxiously than holidaymakers. Flight crews have the best chance of keeping their jobs, but they will face salary cuts because Lufthansa will likely employ them under the contract of its budget unit Eurowings which pays less than Air Berlin.\n\nBut the future looks gloomy for Air Berlin's ground staff such as maintenance crews and administrative employees.", "id": "9680942", "details": {"liCnt": 12}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Air Berlin's State Rescue Sparks Turbulence", "image": "https://global.handelsblatt.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/airberlincounterteaser-e1502918293889.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "111334", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "id": "302694", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"}, {"label": {"eng": "Angela Merkel"}, "id": "303059", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Commission"}, "id": "303458", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Competition law"}, "id": "306638", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung"}, "id": "308334", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesellschaft_mit_beschr\u00e4nkter_Haftung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryanair"}, "id": "315139", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}, "id": "316354", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}, "id": "316652", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Federal Cartel Office"}, "id": "317407", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Cartel_Office"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gerhard Schr\u00f6der"}, "id": "366708", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Schr\u00f6der"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alexander Dobrindt"}, "id": "405219", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Dobrindt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brigitte Zypries"}, "id": "428172", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_Zypries"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 855, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 857, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control"}], "time": "12:03:00"}

three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany while negotiations go on.\n\nThe move offers Lufthansa and rivals a chance to acquire slots at airports such as Berlin Tegel and Duesseldorf, with Germany's largest airline keen to defend its domestic position against expansion by low-cost rival Ryanair.\n\nAccording to Winkelmann, the negotiations also include assets of Air Berlin unit Niki, which Etihad had agreed to buy for \u20ac300 million ($354 million) earlier this year.\n\nSeizing opportunities\n\nRedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), a group which represents German newspapers, cited government sources as saying that Lufthansa, its budget carrier Eurowings and Condor would likely snap up Air Berlin's most valuable landing slots.\n\nIt said a few slots could also go to Ryanair, which has filed a complaint with German and European Union competition authorities over the insolvency process, which its chief executive describes as a \"conspiracy\".\n\nLufthansa has confirmed it is in talks to take over parts of Air Berlin's business, while a source has said easyJet was also part of the negotiations.\n\nThomas Cook's German airline Condor said on Wednesday it was ready to play \"an active role\" in Air Berlin's restructuring, without being more specific.\n\nGermany's Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said the asset sales were an opportunity for the country's aviation sector to bolster its footprint.\n\n\"The opportunity should be seized to strategically position the 140 aircraft, the capacities and the employees of Air Berlin and strengthen the position of Germany's aviation sector in the international market,\" German daily Bild quoted him as saying.", "id": "9695508", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17",

Last month the airline - Germany's second-biggest carrier - lost a quarter of its customers compared with July last year.\n\nGermany's economy minister, Brigitte Zypries, said that a deal whereby Lufthansa took over part of the insolvent airline should be struck in the next few months.\n\nRyanair said: \"This manufactured insolvency is clearly being set up to allow Lufthansa to take over a debt-free Air Berlin which will be in breach of all known German and EU competition rules.\n\n\"Now even the German government is supporting this Lufthansa-led monopoly with 150m euros of state aid so that Lufthansa can acquire Air Berlin and drive domestic air fares in Germany even higher than they already are.\"\n\nRyanair has lodged competition complaints with the German regulator, the Bundeskartellamt, and the European Commission.\n\nLufthansa said it was already in negotiations with Air Berlin to take over parts of the company and is exploring the possibility of hiring additional staff. \"Lufthansa intends to conclude these negotiations successfully in due time.\"\n\nRyanair has in the past made other criticisms of the relationship between Air Berlin and Lufthansa.\n\nLufthansa has been operating 38 Air Berlin Airbus jets on its behalf under a \"wet lease\" arrangement. In January Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary described the deal as a \"joke\".\n\nHe told the German magazine WirtschaftsWoche that the deal was \"a takeover with the aim of dominating the market.

government loan keeping its planes in the air runs out, its chief executive said.\n\nThe group is in talks with a total of three aviation firms, including Lufthansa, German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) quoted Thomas Winkelmann as saying in its Thursday edition.\n\nAll three are \"reputable in terms of their finances, sufficiently large to offer Air Berlin a secure future and are interested in keeping Germany as a base of operations\", he said, without naming any of the interested parties.\n\nAir Berlin, Germany's second-largest airline, filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday after key shareholder Etihad Airways withdrew funding following years of losses, leaving valuable runway slots up for grabs.\n\nThe insolvency comes with thousands of Germans enjoying summer holidays, and just ahead of a September general election.\n\nThe German government granted a bridging loan of \u20ac150-million (137.01 million pounds) to allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany while negotiations go on.\n\nThe move offers Lufthansa and rivals a chance to acquire slots at airports such as Berlin Tegel and Duesseldorf, with Germany's largest airline keen to defend its domestic position against expansion by low-cost rival Ryanair.\n\nAccording to Winkelmann, the negotiations also include assets of Air Berlin unit Niki, which Etihad had agreed to buy for \u20ac300-million ($354-million) earlier this year.\n\nRedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), a group which represents German newspapers, cited government sources as saying that Lufthansa, its budget carrier Eurowings and Condor would likely snap up Air Berlin's most valuable landing slots.\n\nIt said a few slots could also go to Ryanair, which has filed a complaint with German and European Union competition authorities over the insolvency process, which its chief executive describes as a \"conspiracy\".\n\nLufthansa has confirmed it is in talks to take over parts of Air Berlin's business, while a source has said easyJet was also part of the negotiations.\n\nThomas Cook's German airline Condor said on Wednesday it was ready to play \"an active role\" in Air Berlin's restructuring, without being more specific.\n\nGermany's Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said the asset sales were an opportunity for the country's aviation sector to bolster its footprint.\n\n\"The opportunity should be seized to strategically position the 140 aircraft, the capacities and the employees of Air Berlin and strengthen the position

Another source said the number of aircraft Lufthansa wanted to take was smaller.\n\nAir Berlin has been in preliminary talks with a total of three aviation firms, including Lufthansa, over the sale of its assets, Chief Executive Thomas Winkelmann told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and aims to strike deals with at least two of them by the end of September.\n\nEarlier this week a source familiar with the matter said Easyjet was among those in talks, and Thomas Cook's German airline Condor said it was ready to play \"an active role\" in Air Berlin's restructuring.\n\nThe airline's demise also offers Lufthansa and rivals a chance to acquire coveted runway slots at Air Berlin's hub airports, Berlin Tegel and Duesseldorf, with Germany's largest airline keen to defend its domestic position against the incursion of low-cost rival Ryanair.\n\nRedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland, a group which represents German newspapers, cited government sources as saying that Lufthansa, its budget carrier Eurowings and Condor would likely snap up Air Berlin's most valuable slots.\n\nRND said a few slots could also go to Ryanair.", "id": "9845270", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Air Berlin to hold asset sale talks with Lufthansa", "image": "https://img.rasset.ie/000e8086-1600.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "110227", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00fcsseldorf", "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "111334", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "id": "302588", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "id": "302694", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aviation"}, "id": "302715", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Commission"}, "id": "303458", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade union"}, "id": "303738", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline hub"}, "id": "304585", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_hub"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryanair"}, "id": "315139", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}, "id": "316354", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}, "id": "316652", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}, "id": "326178", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rheinische Post"}, "id": "327593", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinische_Post"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung"}, "id": "330423", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Allgemeine_Zeitung"}, {"label": {"eng": "EasyJet"}, "id": "336815", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyJet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Berlin Tegel Airport"}, "id": "356757", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Tegel_Airport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Condor Flugdienst"}, "id": "412805", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condor_Flugdienst"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 855, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 857, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control"}], "time": "07:47:00"}

It was propped up by its main shareholder, Etihad, but the Gulf airline announced it was no longer willing to invest.\n\nLufthansa is in talks and would be well placed to take over most of its ailing competitor - prompting criticism from rival Ryanair.\n\nEasyJet would be keen to acquire slots to boost its small presence in Germany, where Lufthansa dominates. However, it is unlikely to countenance a full takeover: Air Berlin operates a large Airbus fleet similar to easyJet's but also has more than 100 Boeing planes, as well as high costs and pension liabilities.\n\nAn easyJet spokesman said it would not comment on speculation.\n\nAir Berlin made losses of \u20ac782m in 2016. Etihad, which owns almost 30% of Air Berlin, said the developments were \"extremely disappointing\" but it could not keep injecting cash, after investing an additional \u20ac250m in April.\n\nAn Etihad spokesman said: \"Air Berlin's business has deteriorated at an unprecedented pace, preventing it from overcoming its significant challenges and from implementing alternative strategic solutions. Under these circumstances, as a minority shareholder, Etihad cannot offer funding that would further increase our financial exposure.\"\n\nThe Gulf airline had also invested heavily in the perennially loss-making Alitalia before deciding to stem the cashflow earlier this year, pushing the Italian carrier similarly into administration.\n\nThe German government, like Italy's before it with Alitalia, is now helping to find a solution to protect jobs. Ryanair, which has bid for Alitalia, is not believed to be seeking any part of Air Berlin.\n\nA Ryanair spokesman said: \"This is clearly being set up for Lufthansa to take over Air Berlin, which will be in breach of all known German and EU competition rules. Now even the German government is supporting this Lufthansa-led deal with \u20ac150m of state aid.

As far as I know, the other bidders will be invited for talks afterward and then an overall package will be put together,\" said Lufthansa's deputy chair Christine Behle, who represents labour union Verdi on the company's supervisory board.\n\nShe also told Reuters negotiations would begin on Friday and she expected them to continue through the weekend.\n\nAir Berlin, Germany's second-largest airline, filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday after shareholder Etihad Airways withdrew funding following years of losses.\n\nWith many Germans travelling on their summer holidays and a September general election looming, Berlin has granted a bridging loan of 150 million euros ($176 million) to keep Air Berlin's planes in the air for up to three months and secure 7,200 jobs in Germany while buyers for its assets are found.\n\nThat means that the race is on to carve up the airline and obtain anti-trust approval for any deals before Air Berlin runs out of cash.\n\nTransport Minister Alexander Dobrindt has called for Lufthansa to buy a major part of the assets, saying Germany needs a \"national champion\" in international aviation.\n\n\"That is why it is urgently necessary that Lufthansa can take over significant parts of Air Berlin,\" he told daily newspaper Rheinische Post.\n\nHis comments came after rival European airline Ryanair filed a complaint with German and European Union competition authorities over the handling of the insolvency process, which its chief executive describes as a \"conspiracy\".\n\nGermany's transport ministry already faces allegations by the European Commission of maintaining a cosy relationship with its domestic industry and questions about whether authorities did enough to uncover an emissions scandal at carmaker Volkswagen, which is partially state-owned.\n\nAIRCRAFT DEAL\n\nOne scenario Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr has presented to the flagship carrier's supervisory board is that it could take on as many as 90 of Air Berlin's roughly 140 leased planes, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nThat would include the 38 aircraft that Lufthansa is already leasing from Air Berlin and its leisure airline Niki, which is not part of the insolvency proceedings.\n\n\"These are ideas that Lufthansa is bringing into the talks,\" the source said, adding no decisions had been made yet. Another source said the number of aircraft Lufthansa wanted to take was smaller.\n\nAir Berlin has been in preliminary talks with a total of three aviation firms, including Lufthansa, over the sale of its assets, Chief Executive Thomas Winkelmann told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), and aims to strike deals with at least two of them by the end of September.\n\nEarlier this week a source familiar with the matter said easyJet was among those in talks, and Thomas Cook's German airline Condor said it was ready to play \"an active role\" in Air Berlin's restructuring.\n\nThe airline's demise also offers Lufthansa and rivals a chance to acquire coveted runway slots at Air Berlin's hub airports, Berlin Tegel and Duesseldorf, with Germany's largest airline keen to defend its domestic position against the incursion of low-cost rival Ryanair.\n\nRedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), a group which represents German newspapers, cited government sources as saying that Lufthansa, its budget carrier Eurowings and Condor would likely snap up Air Berlin's most valuable slots.\n\nRND said a few slots could also go to Ryanair.\n\n($1 = 0.8548 euros) (Additional reporting by Sabine Wollrab;

Meanwhile, \"another airline\" - rumoured to be Easyjet or Condor - is likely to swallow the rest.\n\n\"The [airport] slots in Germany, that is the actual value of Air Berlin,\" said Mr Machnig, \"and many will endeavour to secure them to have a certain position in the German market\".\n\nAir Berlin employs 7,200 people and among its few remaining assets are its slots in major German airports, including Munich, Frankfurt, D\u00fcsseldorf and Berlin.\n\nAccording to the federal transport ministry, the takeover will be concluded next week. Until then the day-to-day costs of the airline will be financed by the loan from the state-owned KfW bank, backed by a state guarantee.\n\nThe Irish airline said it doubted Germany's cartel authority would stop the deal, making it \"all the more important\" that Brussels take \"immediate and decisive action\".\n\nThe European Commission confirmed it was studying the loan.\n\nThe airline's chief executive Thomas Winkelmann said Air Berlin was a \"victim of constant postponements\" of Berlin's new airport, now six years behind schedule and still not open.\n\nBut critics blame a revolving door of managers and their competing, contradictory strategies for crashing the airline.\n\nThe final blow came when major shareholder Etihad from Abu Dhabi refused to extend the loss-making airline any further credit.\n\nHeinrich Grossbongardt, a German aviation analyst, named Lufthansa the big winner of Air Berlin's collapse, Easyjet a possible runner-up and Ryanair the big loser.\n\n\"And it's a bad loser,\" he said. \"When airlines collapsed elsewhere it moved in quickly and aggressively with its own capacity, but the slots aren't free this time.\"", "id": "9564018", "details": {}, "date":

Another source said the number of aircraft Lufthansa wanted to take was smaller.\n\nAir Berlin has been in preliminary talks with a total of three aviation firms, including Lufthansa, over the sale of its assets, Chief Executive Thomas Winkelmann told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), and aims to strike deals with at least two of them by the end of September.\n\nEarlier this week a source familiar with the matter said easyJet (EZJ.L) was among those in talks, and Thomas Cook's (TCG.L) German airline Condor said it was ready to play \"an active role\" in Air Berlin's restructuring.\n\nThe airline's demise also offers Lufthansa and rivals a chance to acquire coveted runway slots at Air Berlin's hub airports, Berlin Tegel and Duesseldorf, with Germany's largest airline keen to defend its domestic position against the incursion of low-cost rival Ryanair.\n\nRedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), a group which represents German newspapers, cited government sources as saying that Lufthansa, its budget carrier Eurowings and Condor would likely snap up Air Berlin's most valuable slots.\n\nRND said a few slots could also go to Ryanair.\n\n($1 = 0.8548 euros)\n\n(Additional reporting by Sabine Wollrab;

Two of them, Air Berlin and Alitalia, are now bankrupt.The CEO behind the strategy has left Etihad.But some investments have paid off.\n\nEtihad's grand plan for global domination looks to be in deep trouble.\n\nIn July, the Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates-based aviation giant announced a staggering $1.87 billion loss for 2016. This after posting a $103 million profit the previous year.\n\nEtihad blames $808 million of losses on financial exposure to partner airlines such as Air Berlin and Alitalia.\n\nNow things have gone from bad to worse.\n\nOn Tuesday, Air Berlin entered into administration, declaring itself insolvent and initiating a major restructuring. Air Berlin's financial implosion happened just three months after Alitalia's bankruptcy in May.\n\nTogether, Etihad's total financial exposure to the two troubled European carriers edges north of $4.5 billion.\n\n\"Etihad had a very ambitious and creative but very risky strategy, which was to invest in airlines in different countries to gain a proxy presence as an airline group, and two of its riskiest investments were Air Berlin and Alitalia,\" Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst for Atmosphere Research Group, told Business Insider.\n\nIn July, the chief architect of the plan, former Etihad CEO James Hogan, exited the company he helped build.\n\n\"This development is extremely disappointing for all parties, especially as Etihad has provided extensive support to Air Berlin for its previous liquidity challenges and restructuring efforts over the past six years,\" Etihad said in a statement. \"However, Air Berlin's business has deteriorated at an unprecedented pace, preventing it from overcoming its significant challenges and from implementing alternative strategic solutions.\"\n\nThe company declined to comment further on what effect Air Berlin's and Alitalia's financial troubles will have on Etihad Aviation Group.\n\n(REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer)\n\nGoing global\n\nOver the past few years, Etihad embarked on an equity-acquisition spree that has seen the carrier take substantial ownership stakes in a series of \"partner airlines.\" This includes 49% of Alitalia; 29.2% of Air Berlin; 49% of Air Serbia; 24% of Jet Airways; 21.8% of Virgin Australia; 40% of Air Seychelles; 49.8% of Niki; and 33% of Swiss-based Etihad Regional. But Etihad sold its stake in Etihad Regional in July.\n\nLast September, these partner airlines along with Etihad Airways and its accompanying subsidiaries were reconfigured to form Etihad Aviation Group.\n\nIn theory, Hogan's partnership concept makes a tremendous amount of sense. Investing in or taking over struggling airlines in advantageous markets for pennies on the dollar while simultaneously growing Etihad's global reach is strategically sound. The approach also allows Etihad to enter potentially hostile markets free of political opposition and without the need to launch an operation from scratch.\n\nIn practice, the partnership strategy is much more complex. Some have worked out well for Etihad. For instance, Air Serbia has relaunched and become a solid feeder into the Etihad network. The investment in Jet Airways has helped Etihad unlock the potentially lucrative Indian market. And Virgin Australia has become a viable competitor for Qantas.\n\n(An Air Serbia Airbus A330.AP)\n\nAt the same time, Germany's Air Berlin and Italy's national carrier, Alitalia, have not fared so well. Both airlines were acquired to help Etihad increase its reach into the prized European and transatlantic markets, and to a certain extent, they have done exactly that. Operationally, though, Air Berlin and Alitalia have continued to bleed money.\n\nRead More\n\nOn the face of it, the $2.35 billion Alitalia investment seemed like a solid deal. For the cost of a few Airbus A380 superjumbos, the company acquired a major airline with a fleet of 100 planes, Hogan told Business Insider in 2015.\n\nThe same goes for the Air Berlin deal.\n\n\"Air Berlin, on paper, looked like it would be very beneficial for Etihad,\" Harteveldt said. \"It gave Etihad access to a major European market that's arguably the strongest in terms of economic strength and demand for air travel.\"\n\nSo what happened?\n\n\"These two investments have turned out to be sort of Etihad biting off more than it can chew,\" Airways senior business analyst Vinay Bhaskara told Business Insider.\n\nWhat went wrong\n\nAccording to Bhaskara, there are two types of reclamation projects that tend to succeed in the airline industry. The first is an airline that is underperforming simply because it is \"making boneheaded strategic errors\" to the point the airline is essentially its own worst enemy. These are easier to fix because they tend to be in good markets with good fundamentals. So a management change should do the trick, Bhaskara said. Jet Airways falls into this category.\n\n(AP)\n\nThe second is an underperforming airline that is government-owned or struggling with an incredible amount of internal dysfunction. These turnarounds can be successful if an outside force such as Etihad is \"handed the keys to the kingdom\" to tear down and rebuild the airline after making wholesale changes. This is exactly what Etihad was able to do at Air Serbia, Bhaskara added.\n\nTechnically, Air Berlin and Alitalia should have gone into this second category. But Etihad was never given the chance to implement the same type of full rebuild as Air Serbia.\n\nWith Alitalia, Etihad brought in new management, revamped its product, and improved its service. Many of the old problems that plagued the \"Old Alitalia,\" however, still plague the \"New Alitalia\" today. Bhaskara said one of the major issues the airline ran into was the powerful labor unions that prevented Etihad from making drastic changes that could have made the airline profitable.\n\nIn April, Alitalia entered into administration after workers rejected a management-restructuring plan that would have cut salaries and jobs at the airline.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, the last time Alitalia generated an annual profit was in 2002 -- one year before the founding of Etihad Airways.\n\n(An Air Berlin Airbus A330.Andreas Wiese / airberlin)\n\nAir Berlin's situation is different than Alitalia's but equally dysfunctional.\n\nAir Berlin's downfall\n\nAccording to Harteveldt, Air Berlin faced myriad issues ranging from a delayed airport to a disjointed product strategy. First, the airport. Even though Berlin is one of the largest and most important cities in Europe, it doesn't actually have a world-class airport. The state-of-the-art Berlin Brandenburg Airport was scheduled to open in 2010. But delays have now pushed to as late as 2020.\n\nAs a result, Air Berlin hasn't been able to develop the mega hub it had hoped for in its hometown. Instead, it has to settle for a smaller hub, in Dusseldorf. But that pales in comparison to the hubs Lufthansa has in larger markets like Frankfurt and Munich, Harteveldt told us.\n\nAt the same time, Air Berlin has been facing stiff competition from low-cost carriers like RyanAir, EasyJet, WizzAir, and other carriers. And then there was the airlines own \"basket case\" business strategy.\n\n\"Air Berlin just didn't have a clear strategy,\" Harteveldt said. \"It was a low-cost, bare-bones airline for its short-haul European flights, but it tried to be a traditional full-service airline on its long-haul flights. It didn't accomplish either objective very well.\"\n\n(Airbus/Etihad)\n\nEven though the labor situation at Air Berlin was less contentious than Alitalia, it still plagued the airline.\n\n\"In Europe, airlines are high-profile industries that are highly unionized, and the unions work very hard to protect their workers' jobs,\" Harteveldt said. \"Compared to the United States, for example, it very difficult for an airline in Europe to gain the labor efficiency that it needs, whether that be wages or productivity or anything else.\"\n\nSo where does that leave Air Berlin?\n\nWhat's next for Etihad's partners\n\nWhile Etihad is willing to explore commercial opportunities with the airline, it has made it clear that after $2.3 billion in investment its coffers are now off limits to Air Berlin.\n\n\"You can hear the sound of Etihad wiping its hands of Air Berlin all the way from Abu Dhabi to California,\" Harteveldt said.\n\nAlthough Harteveldt believes the Alitalia will likely fly on, the analyst thinks Air Berlin is effectively done as an airline. But Bhaskara believes it's still too early to say whether Air Berlin's fate is sealed.\n\n(An Alitalia crew member walks past Alitalia employees who take part in a strike at Fiumicino international airport in Rome.Thomson Reuters)\n\nAir Berlin CEO Thomas Winkelmann has spoken out publicly to reassure his customers that the airline's flights will operate as usual with the help of a bridging loan worth $176 million.\n\nAll is not lost for the Etihad partner airline strategy.\n\n\"In some cases, it looks like Etihad bet on some winning horses,\" Harteveldt said. \"Alitalia is still on the track and so we can't call that race yet.\"\n\nWhile it seems as if the Etihad partnership strategy will probably live on to fight another day, Air Berlin and Alitalia have proved to be two painful and expensive speed bumps along the way.\n\nNOW WATCH: This $41K plane ticket comes with a shower, bed, and butler service\n\nMore From Business Insider\n\nGermany's second largest airline is in grave

Lufthansa declined to comment on the matter.\n\nAir Berlin itself has said it is in talks with three aviation firms and aims to strike deals with at least two of them by the end of September.\n\nSAFE LANDINGS\n\nRedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), a group which represents German newspapers, cited government sources as saying that Lufthansa, its budget carrier Eurowings and Thomas Cook's German airline Condor would likely snap up Air Berlin's most valuable landing slots.\n\nA source has said easyJet was also part of the negotiations.\n\nRND said a few slots could also go to Ryanair, which has filed a complaint with German and European Union competition authorities over the insolvency process, which its chief executive describes as a \"conspiracy\".\n\nGermany faces allegations by the European Commission of maintaining a cosy relationship with its domestic industry and questions about whether authorities did enough to uncover an emissions scandal at carmaker Volkswagen, which is partially state-owned.

This after posting a $103 million profit the previous year.\n\nEtihad blames $808 million of losses on financial exposure to partner airlines such as Air Berlin and Alitalia.\n\nNow things have gone from bad to worse.\n\nOn Tuesday, Air Berlin entered into administration, declaring itself insolvent and initiating a major restructuring. Air Berlin's financial implosion happened just three months after Alitalia's bankruptcy in May.\n\nTogether, Etihad's total financial exposure to the two troubled European carriers edges north of $4.5 billion.\n\n\"Etihad had a very ambitious and creative but very risky strategy, which was to invest in airlines in different countries to gain a proxy presence as an airline group, and two of its riskiest investments were Air Berlin and Alitalia,\" Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst for Atmosphere Research Group, told Business Insider.\n\nIn July, the chief architect of the plan, former Etihad CEO James Hogan, exited the company he helped build.\n\nREUTERS/Fabian Bimmer\n\nOver the past few years, Etihad embarked on an equity-acquisition spree that has seen the carrier take substantial ownership stakes in a series of \"partner airlines.\" This includes 49% of Alitalia; 29.2% of Air Berlin; 49% of Air Serbia; 24% of Jet Airways; 21.8% of Virgin Australia; 40% of Air Seychelles; 49.8% of Niki; and 33% of Swiss-based Etihad Regional. But Etihad sold its stake in Etihad Regional in July.\n\nLast September, these partner airlines along with Etihad Airways and its accompanying subsidiaries were reconfigured to form Etihad Aviation Group.\n\nIn theory, Hogan's partnership concept makes a tremendous amount of sense. Investing in or taking over struggling airlines in advantageous markets for pennies on the dollar while simultaneously growing Etihad's global reach is strategically sound. The approach also allows Etihad to enter potentially hostile markets free of political opposition and without the need to launch an operation from scratch.\n\nIn practice, the partnership strategy is much more complex. Some have worked out well for Etihad. For instance, Air Serbia has relaunched and become a solid feeder into the Etihad network. The investment in Jet Airways has helped Etihad unlock the potentially lucrative Indian market. And Virgin Australia has become a viable competitor for Qantas.\n\nAir Serbia Airbus A330.AP\n\nAt the same time, Germany's Air Berlin and Italy's national carrier, Alitalia, have not fared so well. Both airlines were acquired to help Etihad increase its reach into the prized European and transatlantic markets, and to a certain extent, they have done exactly that. Operationally, however, Air Berlin and Alitalia have continued to bleed money.\n\nOn the face of it, the $2.35 billion Alitalia investment seemed like a solid deal. For the cost of a few Airbus A380 superjumbos, the company acquired a major airline with a fleet of 100 planes, Hogan told Business Insider in 2015.\n\nThe same goes for the Air Berlin deal.\n\n\"Air Berlin, on paper, looked like it would be very beneficial for Etihad,\" Harteveldt said. \"It gave Etihad access to a major European market that's arguably the strongest in terms of economic strength and demand for air travel.\"\n\nSo what happened?\n\n\"These two investments have turned out to be sort of Etihad biting off more than it can chew,\" Airways senior business analyst Vinay Bhaskara told Business Insider.\n\nAccording to Bhaskara, there are two types of reclamation projects that tend to succeed in the airline industry. The first is an airline that is underperforming simply because it is \"making boneheaded strategic errors\" to the point at which the airline is essentially its own worst enemy. These are easier to fix because they tend to be in good markets with good fundamentals. Thus, a management change should do the trick, Bhaskara said. Jet Airways falls into this category.\n\nAP\n\nThe second is an underperforming airline that is government owned or struggling with an incredible amount of internal dysfunction. These turnarounds can be successful if an outside force such as Etihad is \"handed the keys to the kingdom\" to tear down and rebuild the airline after making wholesale changes. This is exactly what Etihad was able to do at Air Serbia, Bhaskara added.\n\nTechnically, Air Berlin and Alitalia should have gone into this second category. But Etihad was never given the chance to implement the same type of full rebuild as Air Serbia.\n\nWith Alitalia, Etihad brought in new management, revamped its product, and improved its service. Many of the old problems that plagued the \"Old Alitalia,\" however, still plague the \"New Alitalia\" today. Bhaskara said one of the major issues the airline ran into was the powerful labor unions that prevented Etihad from making drastic changes that could have made the airline profitable.\n\nIn April, Alitalia entered into administration after workers rejected a management restructuring plan that would have cut salaries and jobs at the airline.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, the last time Alitalia generated an annual profit was in 2002 -- one year before the founding of Etihad Airways.\n\nAir Berlin Airbus A330. Andreas Wiese / airberlin\n\nThe Air Berlin situation is slightly different than Alitalia, but equally dysfunctional.\n\nAccording to Harteveldt, Air Berlin faced a myriad of issues ranging from a delayed airport to a disjointed product strategy.\n\nFirst, the airport. Even though Berlin is one of the largest and most important cities in Europe, it doesn't actually have a world class airport.\n\nThe state-of-the-art Berlin Brandenburg Airport was scheduled to open in 2010. However, persistent delays have now pushed that day to as late as 2020.\n\nAs a result, Air Berlin hasn't been able to develop the mega hub it had hoped for in its home town. Instead, it has to settle for a smaller hub in Dusseldorf. However, that pales in comparison to the hubs Lufthansa has in larger markets like Frankfurt and Munich, Harteveldt told us.\n\nAt the same time, Air Berlin has been facing stiff competition from low-cost carriers like RyanAir, EasyJet, WizzAir, and other carriers.\n\nAnd then there was the airlines own \"basket case\" business strategy.\n\n\"Air Berlin just didn't have a clear strategy,\" Harteveldt said. \"It was a low cost, bare bones airline for its short haul European flights, but it tried to be a traditional full-service airline on its long-haul flights.\"\n\n\"It didn't accomplish either objective very well,\" the analyst added.\n\nAirbus/Etihad\n\nEven though the labor situation at Air Berlin was less contentious than Alitalia, it was still an issue that plagued the airline.\n\n\"In Europe, airlines are high profile industries that are highly unionized and the unions work very hard to protect their workers' jobs,\" Harteveldt said. \"Compared to the United States, for example, it very difficult for an airline in Europe to gain the labor efficiency that it needs whether that be wages or productivity or anything else.\"\n\nSo where does that leave Air Berlin?\n\nWhile Etihad is willing to explore commercial opportunities with the airline, it has made it clear that after $2.3 billion in investment its coffers are now off limits to Air Berlin.\n\n\"You can hear the sound of Etihad wiping its hands of Air Berlin all the way from Abu Dhabi to California,\" Harteveldt said.\n\nAlthough Harteveldt believes the Alitalia will likely fly on, the analyst thinks Air Berlin is effectively done as an airline. However, Bhaskara believes it's still too early to say whether Air Berlin's fate is sealed.\n\nAn Alitalia crew member walks past Alitalia employees who take part in a strike at Fiumicino international airport in Rome Thomson Reuters\n\nAir Berlin CEO Thomas Winkelmann has spoken out publicly to ensure his customers that the airline's flights will operate as usual with the help of a bridging loan worth $176 million.\n\nAt the end of the day, all is not lost for the Etihad partner airline strategy.\n\n\"In some cases, it looks like Etihad bet on some winning horses,\" Harteveldt said. \"Alitalia is still on the track and so we can't call that race yet.\"\n\nWhile it seems like the Etihad partnership strategy will probably live on to fight another day, Air Berlin and Alitalia have proven to be two very painful and expensive speed bumps along the way.", "id": "9505941", "details": {"liCnt": 13}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "One of American, Delta, and United's most

A state loan will only keep it afloat for some weeks. DW's Henrik B\u00f6hme hopes for wise decisions in the interest of employees.\n\nWhen a previously agreed tranche of 50 million euros ($59 million) from Etihad was not transferred to Air Berlin's account last Friday, alarm bells rang at the headquarters of Germany's second-biggest carrier. It finally dawned on the airline's management that the sheiks of Etihad Airways had cut off their money supply.\n\nThis didn't really come as a big surprise, since Etihad, once a major player among Gulf airlines alongside Emirates and Qatar Airways, has enough problems of its own. Etihad's strategy of buying into troubled competitors has failed miserably.\n\nGigantic debt levels\n\nPerhaps Etihad's underlying strategy was to lull rivals into a sense of security and then let them die slowly, whilst collecting the valuable bits and pieces and taking over important routes. But with Air Berlin and Alitalia, Etihad has had to grapple with two formidable money-burners, which are now being bailed out by the taxpayer.\n\nRead also: Air Berlin files for bankcruptcy protection\n\nAir Berlin's debts currently amount to 1.2 billion euros. Since 2011, i.e. since its first investment in the German carrier, Etihad has pumped over 1.5 billion euros into its ailing subsidiary. Etihad pledged in the spring of this year that it would continue to provide additional financial support for at least another one and a half years. But in the end, it decided against it.\n\nPassengers who have flown Air Berlin in recent months have been able to see for themselves what a terrible state the airline has been in. There have been many cancellations, massive delays, and ticket transfers to dubious carriers. I wouldn't be surprised if damage claims to the tune of millions of euros are on their way.\n\nEverything under control? Forget it!\n\nAt its London shareholders meeting in June, Air Berlin executives bent over backward to present an optimistic outlook, despite earlier speculation about the carrier's desolate situation and the need for public guarantees. But shareholders were told that everything was under control and that the situation wasn't nearly as bad as portrayed. There was no talk about possible insolvency procedures.\n\nAnd now, only two months later, we have a complete admission of failure. How blind must executives have been to not be aware of Etihad's own problems?\n\nThe taxpayer is now once again called upon to come to the rescue, with a 150-million-euro loan to prevent Air Berlin from stopping operations immediately, in the middle of the holiday season. The government may have reasoned it might not be a bright idea to cause chaos for travelers by declining to provide a shot in the arm.\n\nAir Berlin, for its part, is now suffering from the many strategic blunders it has made over the past few years. It got worse with every decision taken and every management reshuffle. Whenever a hole was plugged, two new problems seemed to appear elsewhere.\n\nDomestic rival Lufthansa, which has already taken over 38 Air Berlin planes and concomitant staff, will look over what's left of its erstwhile competitor and will most likely boost its own no-frills subsidiary, Eurowings, with the pickings.\n\nIt remains to be hoped that many of Air Berlin's 8,500 employees will keep their jobs.

At the same time, slots in Berlin used for short-haul services could help EasyJet narrow the gap to Ryanair Holdings Plc in Europe's biggest economy.\n\nAir Berlin filed for insolvency Tuesday as leading shareholder Etihad Airways PJSC of Abu Dhabi pulled the plug on funding the unprofitable carrier, which will rely on a government loan to keep flying for the next three months. Lufthansa, Germany's biggest airline and the No. 3 in Europe, revealed that it was in talks about buying parts of its national rival, while EasyJet has also expressed an interest, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nA deal could be \"very attractive\" for Lufthansa if it can acquire elements of Air Berlin, which has 8,600 workers, without taking on the company's debt or staff contracts, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts including Daniel Roeska said in a note. There's also a \"strategic rationale\" behind EasyJet making a move, and the U.K. carrier has the business model to make a transaction work, they said.\n\nWhile the 150 million-euro ($177 million) loan should get Germans home from their summer vacations, Air Berlin will likely run out of cash at the end of the three-month period, setting a deadline for negotiations, Bernstein said.\n\nLufthansa, which is unlikely to be able to buy all of Air Berlin for antitrust reasons, already has strong links to its one-time arch rival following a deal that handed it 38 of the smaller carrier's Airbus SE A320-series planes plus crews under a six-year lease deal. Some 33 of those aircraft are slated for deployment with Eurowings and five with the group's Austrian Airlines division.\n\nAt the same time, Air Berlin planned to offload its own Austrian unit Niki, which has 21 A321 jets, by combining it with 14 aircraft from TUI AG, Europe's largest tour operator. Though the plan suffered a setback in June when TUI failed to agree terms with Etihad, it said Tuesday that it's ready to participate in Air Berlin's restructuring. Thomas Cook Group Plc's Condor arm, which books seats on Air Berlin flights, also said it could play an \"active role\" in a rescue plan.\n\nAir Berlin's Swiss Belair arm, which has seven A320-family planes, is set to close at the end of the summer, according to an announcement in March, while the company was due to full control of regional affiliate LGW, with 20 Bombardier Inc. Q400 turboprops.\n\nThe restructuring steps were designed to trim the Air Berlin fleet to just 75 jets from almost 150, leaving it focused on inter-continental routes from Berlin and Dusseldorf, fed by shorter European flights, plus minor hubs in Munich and Stuttgart. It currently serves about 20 long-haul destinations with 17 Airbus A330 wide-body jets, with the focus on the U.S. and the Caribbean.\n\nAs Air Berlin's doesn't own its aircraft, the main value for suitors may be in its landing rights, which are usually distributed by a national coordinator after airlines apply for them. German Economic Minister Brigitte Zypries, though, said slots may be sold off by the insolvency administrator to raise funds.\n\nLufthansa's global strategy is increasingly built around beefing up Eurowings, initially created to defend its European turf against the likes of Ryanair by taking over short-haul routes outside of its Frankfurt and Munich hubs.\n\nWhile the unit has been swollen by the Air Berlin lease deal and the acquisition of Brussels Airlines, the transfer of existing short-haul routes from the parent airline has been slowed by union opposition, putting new emphasis on expanding long-haul services. By the end of this year Eurowings will have more than 160 aircraft spread across 11 bases, including a fleet of A330s.\n\nAt the very least, Lufthansa is likely to want to safeguard the leased Air Berlin planes, which fly mainly on Mediterranean routes, according to Bernstein, and could use that structure to add more operations from the smaller carrier.\n\nFor EasyJet, acquiring parts of the Air Berlin short-haul business would help make up lost ground in Germany, where it lags well behind Ryanair. The Luton, England-based company announced in June that it would shut a base in Hamburg, where it stations four A320-series aircraft, at the end of the summer season, leaving only its Berlin operation, which utilizes 12 planes.\n\nRyanair locates nine jets in Berlin, but also has eight other bases in Germany including Cologne-Bonn and Hamburg, as well as Frankfurt, where it will station seven planes this winter in a direct challenge to Lufthansa at its primary hub. A 10th base will open in Memmingen, outside Munich, in September.\n\nComplicating matters, EasyJet's Berlin flights operate out of Schoenefeld airport rather than the main Tegel hub used by Air Berlin. Current thinking calls for Tegel to be closed when the new and long-delayed Berlin Brandenburg hub opens, though those plans are under review.\n\nWhether EasyJet or Ryanair buys Air Berlin assets, both are likely to benefit from the German No. 2's exit, with one competitor less in the market, Per-Ola Hellgren, an analyst at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, said in an investor note. Eurowings has a higher cost base than both carriers, he said.\n\nProgress on a carve up of Air Berlin could be rapid, according to Bernstein's Roeska, with Lufthansa keen to bolster its defenses against low-cost carriers and the German government eager to protect jobs in an election year. The alternative could make Germany \"a clear target for imminent attack,\" he said.\n\n\"If there is no deal, and Air Berlin collapses, Lufthansa will be facing a large capacity gap in the German market at precisely the time Ryanair is looking to make good on its ambitious expansion.\"", "id": "9662474", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Lufthansa Swoop for Air Berlin Would Add

We answer the key questions.\n\nFor the short term, yes. The German federal government has provided \u20ac150 million in loans to the stricken airline, ensuring that planes will continue to fly for the next three months, Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries announced on Tuesday.\n\nZypries also did not rule out providing more funds for the company at the end of that three-month period.\n\nWhat about the long term?\n\nThe government hopes that Lufthansa will buy up parts of Air Berlin during the next three months, thus ensuring that by the time the state loan has run out, new owners will be in place who can keep on running services on the Air Berlin lines. One of those owners is likely to be Lufthansa, who announced on Tuesday that they were in talks to buy up parts of their competitor.\n\nAre my tickets still valid?\n\nApparently, yes. Air Berlin announced on Tuesday that all flights booked with the company remain valid. They also said that the flight plans for the airline and its subsidiary Niki would remain unchanged and that every scheduled flight would take place.\n\nBut the airline has been hit by delays and cancellations in recent months and repeatedly sought to reassure customers that everything was okay. So history should tell us that anyone flying with Air Berlin shouldn't be shocked if they are hit by problems.\n\nCan I still buy tickets with Air Berlin?\n\nThe company said on Tuesday that customers can buy tickets on all flights which have been scheduled by the company. The Local on Tuesday looked into buying flights from Berlin to Munich in December - i.e. after the government's three months deadline - and was offered seats starting at \u20ac41.60.\n\nWhat does this mean for ticket prices?\n\nRyanair are furious about the insolvency, claiming it has been planned to allow for a takeover of the company by Lufthansa, Germany's largest carrier.\n\nRyanair spokesman Robin Kiely said that a takeover by Lufthansa would contravene all German and EU competition rules. He also claimed that the German government was supporting Lufthansa by providing \u20ac150 million in credit to Air Berlin.\n\n\"German travellers as well as people visiting Germany will have to deal with higher prices and will end up paying for the Lufthansa monopoly,\" he said.\n\nTransport Minister Alexander Dobrindt has claimed that a partial takeover by Lufthansa would not contravene competition rules, as they would not be buying up the whole company. He further claimed that talks were underway with several airlines for the sell-off of other parts of Air Berlin.", "id": "9309106", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Five things you need to know after the Air Berlin insolvency", "image": "https://www.thelocal.de/userdata/images/article/61761d1d6f52992b040604a9b7a1b93778a1238747ac8b06b1bbc0ee0245e2d0.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "M\u00fcnchen"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "106391", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "label": {"eng": "M\u00fcnchen"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "111334", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "id": "302694", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryanair"}, "id": "315139", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}, "id": "316354", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}, "id": "316652", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alexander Dobrindt"}, "id": "405219", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Dobrindt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brigitte Zypries"}, "id": "428172", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_Zypries"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 72, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 855, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 857, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1043, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation"}], "time": "15:42:00"}

The company's operating loss had more than doubled last year to 667 million euros ($787 million) due to various write-offs and restructuring charges as it belatedly tried to save itself.\n\nThe company said in a statement to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange that it had had no option after Etihad refused to offer any further financial support. Etihad had bought into a number of European airlines in recent years, not least because it hoped they would drive long-haul traffic to its hub in Abu Dhabi and also support its efforts to break into the U.S. market.\n\nHowever, that strategy has unravelled as losses proved too heavy to sustain. In May, Italian flag-carrier Alitalia went into bankruptcy proceedings, leaving Etihad sitting on a loss of nearly $2 billion.\n\nEtihad didn't respond immediately to a request for comment from Fortune.\n\nAir Berlin said it's now in talks with German flag carrier Lufthansa for parts of its business. It has also asked for, and been given, a 150 million euro bridging loan from the federal German government to avoid disruptions to service -- especially during the height of tourist season -- while it conducts such talks.\n\nDespite its well-publicized troubles, Air Berlin had insisted as recently as June that it wasn't about to go bankrupt.\n\n\"Insolvency is not an issue for us. We have sufficient liquidity and a reliable partner, Etihad, which has pledged its support through to October 2018,\" a spokeswoman from the airline told AFP at the time.\n\nShares in other European airlines rose in response to the news. Companies such as Ryanair and Easyjet have warned about excess capacity on their routes in recent earnings statements, and the exit of Air Berlin from the market will reduce the pressure on them to keep fares down. Ryanair's stock was up 2.3% in mid-afternoon in Europe, while EasyJet was up 3.2% and Lufthansa was up 3.4%.", "id": "9294850", "details": {"liCnt": 69}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Air Berlin Files for Insolvency as Etihad Pulls the Plug", "image": "https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-827590028.jpg?w=720", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1763, "date": "2018-10-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1775}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "109", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "8861", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Euro"}, "id": "302536", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "id": "302694", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}, "id": "302744", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tourism"}, "id": "303659", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline hub"}, "id": "304585", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_hub"}, {"label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}, "id": "304668", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}, "id": "309428", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}, "id": "309522", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flag carrier"}, "id": "312659", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_carrier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryanair"}, "id": "315139", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}, "id": "316354", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}, "id": "316652", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Insolvency"}, "id": "317041", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alitalia"}, "id": "324150", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alitalia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}, "id": "326178", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frankfurt Stock Exchange"}, "id": "329282", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_Stock_Exchange"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flag of Germany"}, "id": "329972", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Germany"}, {"label": {"eng": "EasyJet"}, "id": "336815", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyJet"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 72, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 855, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 857, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control"}], "time": "14:20:00"}

The airline had been running at a loss for several years, prompting owner Etihad to pull the plug on Tuesday.\n\nAir Berlin is particularly strong at Zurich airport, operating 11 daily flights to destinations such as Berlin and D\u00fcsseldorf. It is second only to Swiss International Air Lines in terms of passengers transported from Zurich airport.\n\nA \u20ac150 million (CHF170 million) emergency credit line from the German government will keep Air Berlin flying until the end of August, but the long-term future of the carrier will probably boil down to a takeover from a rival.\n\nIt has been reported that Lufthansa, the owner of Swiss, is in talks to take over Air Berlin. It has also been speculated that budget airlines EasyJet or Ryanair could join the bidding.\n\nIf there is a future takeover, the new owner will have to take a hard look at a business model that has seen continuous losses since 2008. Last year, Air Berlin booked a \u20ac782 million annual loss. Even Etihad, based in the oil-rich Abu Dhabi, has decided it can no longer support the continuous haemorrhage.\n\nThe Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger sees only one result of Lufthansa buying up Air Berlin: more expensive tickets for passengers. \"At first glance from the passengers point of view, the development [Air Berlin's near collapse] is not so good,\" the newspaper said in an editorial on Wednesday. \"They must reckon with higher prices.\"\n\nAnother option being touted for Air Berlin in the media is the sale of some airline slots. Traffic from Zurich to Germany is especially valuable. A spokesperson for Swiss told the Tages-Anzeiger that it was in principle always looking for opportunities to add new slots, regardless of their current owner.\n\nShould that happen, competition to many German destinations would shrink.\n\nIn the meantime, Swiss tour operators are refusing to panic. Hotelplan Suisse and Kuoni said that all tickets already purchased remain valid. But the pair are less confident about their longer-term relationship with the German carrier.\n\nIn recent years, the United Arab Emirates flagship carrier Etihad had embarked on a buying spree of European airlines, such as Air Berlin and Alitalia. This included a majority stake in the Swiss carrier Darwin Airline, which it sold earlier this summer.", "id": "9450175", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Passengers may pay price for Air Berlin strife", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "1", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "42", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "8861", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Z\u00fcrich"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "92738", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z\u00fcrich", "label": {"eng": "Z\u00fcrich"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "110227", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00fcsseldorf", "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "111334", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "id": "302694", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"}, {"label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}, "id": "304668", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryanair"}, "id": "315139", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}, "id": "316354", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}, "id": "316652", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}, "id": "326178", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways"}, {"label": {"eng": "Swiss International Air Lines"}, "id": "332380", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_International_Air_Lines"}, {"label": {"eng": "EasyJet"}, "id": "336815", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyJet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tages-Anzeiger"}, "id": "367314", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tages-Anzeiger"}, {"label": {"eng": "Z\u00fcrich Airport"}, "id": "528307", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z\u00fcrich_Airport"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 328, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 855, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 857, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control"}], "time": "10:04:00"}

Staff and clients, including Berlin's Brandenburg airport, face an anxious few months.\n\nOnly a federal government loan of 150 million euros ($175.4 million) saved Air Berlin and its daughter company Niki from the embarrassment of having to cease flights with immediate effect.\n\nThe bridging loan should ease some of the immediate pressure on the company, which was once Germany's second biggest airline after Lufthansa but has run into serious financial difficulties in the ten years since it became a public company.\n\nWith Etihad no longer willing to prop up the beleaguered carrier, Air Berlin looks set to be dismantled and divided by Lufthansa, EasyJet or Ryanair, although the latter's CEO Michael O'Leary has claimed the deal is \"corrupt\" as any Lufthansa takeover would create a monopoly.\n\nRelocation to Frankfurt\n\nAir Berlin's pilots and crew seem likely to have the best chance of avoiding redundancy, with the impending takeover likely to incorporate the majority of current cabin crew.\n\nIf Lufthansa takes Air Berlin under its wing, routes are likely to transfer to the company's low-flying subsidiary Eurowings. Such a move would protect many jobs.\n\nHowever, Air Berlin's demise could mean a more uncertain future for the 1,200 employees at the Berlin headquarters and the 700 employees working at the Berlin technology subsidiary.\n\nThe boss of Germany's services trade union Verdi, Christine Behle, is concerned for the futures of these employees. \"Every possible buyer already has an administration,\" she said, adding that this would also apply to the airline's technology. After the application for insolvency, an initial discussion between the union and the management will be held on Friday. \"We want to help shape it,\" Behle announced.\n\nHowever, cabin crew will not be immune from the negative effects of a Lufthansa takeover. Lufthansa's Frankfurt base raises the possibility of an enforced relocation for staff from Berlin. The worst case scenario is that even long-serving flight attendants would be forced to reapply for their jobs, possibly receiving only the starting salary.\n\n\"This would result in up to 40 percent wage loss for some flight attendants,\" explains Christine Behle. In negotiations with Lufthansa, Verdi and cabin crew trade union UFO want to ensure that the years of employment of Air Berlin employees are recognized.\n\nFurther blow to Berlin-Brandenburg Airport\n\nAs if Berlin's projected and protracted airport, Berlin-Brandenburg or BER, wasn't mired in enough trouble, the news of Air Berlin's emergency landing comes as yet another blow to the airport.\n\nAir Berlin is the most important customer for the airport company Berlin-Brandenburg (FBB). Almost 30 percent of the flights handled in Berlin bear the airline's red and white logo, and the airline had plans to turn BER into its hub, but had to drop these plans.\n\nThere is still a special terminal area for Air Berlin at BER with nine passenger bridges, the so-called \"S\u00fcdpier\". An Air Berlin lounge with 200 seats has been waiting empty for guests for years.\n\nAs yet, Lufthansa and Easyjet have shown no interest in creating a hub at BER and the share of passengers who change at BER is likely to be smaller if no other airline wants to establish a hub there. And that is a problem for the FBB, because every second euro at BER is to be generated by the shopping malls and catering offers in the terminals. Passengers booking direct flights, however, consume significantly less at the airport than passengers who have time to walk through the terminal.", "id": "9724697", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Air Berlin insolvency to hit staff and clients | Business | DW | 17.08.2017", "image": "http://www.dw.com/image/40139217_304.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Land Brandenburg"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "110989", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg", "label": {"eng": "Land Brandenburg"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "111334", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt am Main, Stadt"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "277805", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt am Main, Stadt"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Euro"}, "id": "302536", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "id": "302694", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}, "id": "302700", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airport"}, "id": "302716", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade union"}, "id": "303738", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline hub"}, "id": "304585", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_hub"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryanair"}, "id": "315139", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}, "id": "316354", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}, "id": "316652", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}, "id": "326178", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)"}, "id": "336321", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_(1944\u201350)"}, {"label": {"eng": "EasyJet"}, "id": "336815", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyJet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eurowings"}, "id": "351761", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurowings"}, {"label": {"eng": "Berlin Brandenburg Airport"}, "id": "401531", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Brandenburg_Airport"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 328, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation"}], "time": "15:12:00"}

But there's no gap to step into here because they're going to keep the airline flying,\" O'Leary said, referring to the failure of Hungarian airline Malev in 2012.\n\nOverall, low-cost carriers account for only 33 percent of flights from Germany, against a market share of around 42 percent in Europe as a whole and 61 percent in Britain, according to data from Flightglobal Schedules data.\n\nWhile Air Berlin is small internationally, it has 27 percent of the market for German domestic flights, while Lufthansa has 68 percent.\n\nThe opportunity offered by Air Berlin's demise has already sparked interest from Britain's easyJet, which is in talks with the German government over its assets, a source has said.\n\n\"Lufthansa and easyJet would be a good fit,\" said the first source of the slots on offer.\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas Cook's German airline Condor said on Wednesday it was ready to play \"an active role\".\n\nINDUSTRIAL PRIZE\n\nAmong Air Berlin's potentially most attractive assets include its presence in Germany's industrial heartland of North Rhine Westphalia, where it has around a third of the slots at Duesseldorf airport.\n\n\"(Duesseldorf) is particularly important as it is a heavily slot-constrained airport for environmental reasons and is at the heart of the German economy providing potentially more lucrative business traffic for Lufthansa,\" aviation consultant John Strickland said.\n\nWhile Lufthansa has long been interested in taking over more of Air Berlin's operations and the insolvency means it stands a better chance of being able to pick up parts of the business without taking on Air Berlin's debt, it may still fall foul of competition rules.\n\n\"It could be difficult for Lufthansa to acquire all of Air Berlin's slots, especially as Lufthansa is very strong in Germany,\" Jens-Olrik Murach, a partner at Brussels-based law firm Gibson Dunn, said.\n\nLiberum analyst Gerald Khoo also said Lufthansa would have to be careful to avoid increasing its costs, whether through securing aircraft that Air Berlin already flies on behalf of Lufthansa, or through taking on further assets.\n\nHe said that Lufthansa's position in Germany may be secure for a while yet as Ryanair and easyJet may not be able to re-deploy capacity to Germany this winter.\n\n\"However, we would expect German airports to move up the list of priorities for next summer for both major low-cost carriers, whether or not they attempt to pick up assets and/or staff from Air Berlin's bankruptcy process,\" he said in a note.

Image for illustrative purpose.\n\nBy Davide Barbuscia\n\nDUBAI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Etihad Airways' bonds issued through a special purpose vehicle have dropped more than five points in the secondary market a day after Air Berlin, in which Etihad has a large minority stake, filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nIn April, the \"EA Partners\" bonds dropped by almost 10 cents on the dollar after workers at the Italian carrier Alitalia - in which Etihad has a 49 percent stake - rejected the company's latest turnaround plan, blocking it from accessing rescue financing.\n\nAn \"internal debt assumption\" agreement between Etihad and Alitalia - revealed through a Fitch note in the days following Alitalia entering special administration, but had been signed earlier - put a floor under the bonds, and they subsequently bounced back almost to par value.\n\nBut it is unclear if a similar agreement is in place for Air Berlin , and some of EA Partners' creditors fear that after years of losses supporting the German carrier, Etihad might not cover the carrier's portion of debt in the SPV bonds.\n\nAdvertisement Etihad and Air Berlin declined to comment.\n\n\"Air Berlin adds to what has been a steady stream of bad news - whether related to Alitalia or Etihad itself,\" said a Dubai-based portfolio manager, speaking on condition of anonymity because of commercial sensitivities.\n\nEtihad's is undertaking a strategic review which began last year and saw it offload its minority stake in a regional European carrier in July before announcing on Tuesday it was no longer willing to prop up Air Berlin.\n\n\"The added problems don't necessarily mean help isn't still on the way for the bond, but it does it make it more complicated. The bond's credit enhancement has limits, and so does the appetite for bailouts,\" the portfolio manager said.\n\nYields on the notes - a $700 million bond maturing in 2020 and a $500 million bond maturing in 2021 - jumped by more than 2 percentage points after Air Berlin's bankruptcy announcement. The 2021 had a bid yield of 11.5 percent on Wednesday, up from 9.1 percent before the announcement. The 2020 notes were quoted at 12.3 percent on Wednesday, from 9.4 percent on Monday.\n\nThe EAP bonds include Etihad and several other airlines partially-owned by the Abu Dhabi carrier. The bond proceeds were used to enter into separate debt obligations with the entities involved, which included Etihad Airways, Etihad Airport Services, Alitalia, Air Berlin, and other airlines such as Air Serbia and Air Seychelles.\n\nThe bond had no cross-default provision, and according to their structure none of the SPV partners is legally obliged to support other partners in the event of a default. However, the paper is generally perceived as Etihad's credit, to the point that traders and portfolio managers have assumed in the past that reputational considerations could push the Abu Dhabi-owned company to bail out other SPV members, should the need arise.\n\nAccording to Air Berlin's 2016 annual report published in April, Etihad confirmed by letter its intention to provide the necessary support to Air Berlin to enable it to meet its financial obligations for a period of 18 months from April 28.\n\nHowever, it is not clear to what extent the letter is binding, and whether creditors can rely on it. The bonds are due beyond the 18 month period indicated in the letter, said an investment analyst at a hedge fund in London.\n\nAn independent auditor in the same report said: \"The group is reliant on a letter of support from a significant shareholder; as with such letters there remains a doubt whether this can be enforced in the event that such a need arises.\"\n\nIn the absence of some official announcement from the companies involved, the bonds are likely to drift, said the analyst. \"Now that Etihad has given up on Air Berlin, they could distance themselves from the debt assumption agreement with Alitalia too,\" he added.\n\n(Additional reporting by Alexander Cornwell in Dubai and Victoria Bryan in Berlin, editing by David Evans) ((Davide.Barbuscia@thomsonreuters.com;))", "id": "9500484", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Etihad Airways, partners' bonds drop again as Air Berlin bankruptcy sparks bailout concerns", "image": "https://images.zawya.com/images/cia/zLarge/141130041017ITLE.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 93, "date": "2012-12-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 110}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 173, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 179}, {"textStart": 3298, "date": "-04-28", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3306}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "8818", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "8861", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "111334", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "id": "302694", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}, "id": "316652", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alitalia"}, "id": "324150", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alitalia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}, "id": "326178", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways"}, {"label": {"eng": "Berlin Tegel Airport"}, "id": "356757", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Tegel_Airport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Seychelles"}, "id": "415052", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Seychelles"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Serbia"}, "id": "581818", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Serbia"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 755, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 855, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 857, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control"}], "time": "14:39:00"}

The other, John P. MacDonald, had run a charter airline in West Berlin called Modern Air, which collapsed after the 1973 oil embargo sent airlines' expenses through the roof.\n\nThe two saw a unique opportunity: the Potsdam agreement in 1945 gave the allied powers of Britain, France and the United States just three small air corridors into Berlin, which was under the control of the Soviets. The only planes allowed to fly in these corridors were airlines of the three Western allies, not German airlines. Long after the war, a joint American-Soviet air control center in Berlin enforced this limitation.\n\n\"Merging companies with different DNA doesn't work well, especially in the airline business\"\n\nThe airline, which filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday, was conceived as a European short-haul airline much like Ryanair and Easyjet are today. But the entry of the Middle East's Etihad airways into the company's ownership ranks five years ago changed the airline's trajectory into a short haul/long haul hybrid that had no real strategy, said Shane Lundgren, the son of the founder, who was also one of the airline's pilots for 15 years.\n\n\"Merging companies with different DNA doesn't work well, especially in the airline business,\" the younger Mr. Lundgren, who now lives in Oregon, said in an interview with Handelsblatt Global.\n\nBut in 1979, when he was furloughed waiting for an opening as a Pan Am pilot, the elder Mr. Lundgren saw that West Berlin was prospering despite being surrounded by Russian troops and people there craved holidays in the sun far away from the barbed wire of the Berlin Wall.\n\nUsing aircraft that had been part of Modern Air's fleet, the team began assembling pilots and crew, mostly from Modern Air, which had been based in New York. Because only a US-based airline could fly to Berlin, they created Air Berlin as a charter company based in Mr. Lundgren's home state of Oregon.\n\nIn fact, the airline literally got off the ground in secret because the four powers had not approved its use of the air corridors. When the first Air Berlin plane flew into Berlin's Tegel Airport, it was quickly moved to a remote corner of the tarmac, where workers painted USA on the side of the plane.\n\nThe airline's first flight was on April 28, 1979 to Palma de Mallorca, a favorite destination of winter-weary Germans. It expanded to long haul flights to the US and European cities, but nearly went under when Mr. MacDonald decided to challenge Pan Am's monopoly on the Berlin-Frankfurt route. By 1986, Mr. MacDonald and the two German directors who ran the airline had departed and Mr. Lundgren took over management himself.\n\nThe airline went through another transformation when the Berlin Wall fell, taking with it the monopoly limitation on flights to Berlin. The airline switched to being a German company, Air Berlin GmbH & Co. Luftverkehrs KG, in what the younger Lundgren called \"the first time in history that an airline has switched nationality.\"\n\nHis father formed a partnership with Joachim Hunold, a former rock'n'roll roadie who had once worked as a baggage handler in D\u00fcsseldorf but had become an executive at a German charter airline. Mr Hunold bought 82.5% of Air Berlin's shares.\n\nThe airline grew to more than 140 jets in the next 20 years as Mr. Hunold went on a buying spree, acquiring its rivals, LTU, the former Deutsche British Airways, Niki airways and Belair.\n\n\"It didn't help that there was a financial collapse in 2008 after Air Berlin had its IPO and acquired all these other airlines,\" Shane Lundgren said.\n\nHe added that he and his father both advised Etihad, which had acquired a one-third interest in the airline in 2011, to stick with the airline's development as a European carrier. But he said that Etihad was more interested in Air Berlin's long haul routes based in D\u00fcsseldorf and didn't bring a cohesive strategy to running the airline.\n\n\"They never took the time to deal with the nuts and bolts of making a success of Air Berlin,\" he said.\n\nShane said that his father, now 75 and still in good health, splits his time between Oregon and London.\n\n\"We were very saddened to hear the news about the bankruptcy,\" he said. \"We still have a lot of friends at the airline and hope they will continue to be well treated.\" He added that it was unusual for an airline to enter insolvency proceedings in the summer, which is the height of its business year, so things must have reached a crisis point with Etihad's financial support.", "id": "9385591", "details": {},

But there's no gap to step into here because they're going to keep the airline flying,\" O'Leary said, referring to the failure of Hungarian airline Malev in 2012.\n\nOverall, low-cost carriers account for only 33 percent of flights from Germany, against a market share of around 42 percent in Europe as a whole and 61 percent in Britain, according to data from Flightglobal Schedules data.\n\nWhile Air Berlin is small internationally, it has 27 percent of the market for German domestic flights, while Lufthansa has 68 percent.\n\nThe opportunity offered by Air Berlin's demise has already sparked interest from Britain's easyJet, which is in talks with the German government over its assets, a source has said.\n\n\"Lufthansa and easyJet would be a good fit,\" said the first source of the slots on offer.\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas Cook's German airline Condor said on Wednesday it was ready to play \"an active role\".\n\nINDUSTRIAL PRIZE\n\nAmong Air Berlin's potentially most attractive assets include its presence in Germany's industrial heartland of North Rhine Westphalia, where it has around a third of the slots at Duesseldorf airport.\n\n\"(Duesseldorf) is particularly important as it is a heavily slot-constrained airport for environmental reasons and is at the heart of the German economy providing potentially more lucrative business traffic for Lufthansa,\" aviation consultant John Strickland said.\n\nWhile Lufthansa has long been interested in taking over more of Air Berlin's operations and the insolvency means it stands a better chance of being able to pick up parts of the business without taking on Air Berlin's debt, it may still fall foul of competition rules.\n\n\"It could be difficult for Lufthansa to acquire all of Air Berlin's slots, especially as Lufthansa is very strong in Germany,\" Jens-Olrik Murach, a partner at Brussels-based law firm Gibson Dunn, said.\n\nLiberum analyst Gerald Khoo also said Lufthansa would have to be careful to avoid increasing its costs, whether through securing aircraft that Air Berlin already flies on behalf of Lufthansa, or through taking on further assets.\n\nHe said that Lufthansa's position in Germany may be secure for a while yet as Ryanair and easyJet may not be able to re-deploy capacity to Germany this winter.\n\n\"However, we would expect German airports to move up the list of priorities for next summer for both major low-cost carriers, whether or not they attempt to pick up assets and/or staff from Air Berlin's bankruptcy process,\" he said in a note.

And while German passengers love a bargain more than most, there is a growing awareness that budget travel can often come at a cost.\n\nSo when Ryanair joined a campaign to retain Berlin's second airport, which it doesn't service, mayor Michael M\u00fcller savaged them for pushing an \"aggressive\" business model, at the cost of local authorities, that was \"not based on sustainability\".\n\nThat is the burdened backstory of Ryanair in Germany and why its cries of foul over a \u20ac150 million bridging loan for Air Berlin elicited chortles of schadenfreude.\n\nAn economics ministry official said nobody was surprised by their reaction. \"Clatter,\" he said, \"is part of their business model.\"\n\nBut this is not about whether Germany likes Ryanair or not but whether Germany's enabling an Air Berlin carve-up between Lufthansa and possibly Easyjet is legal.\n\nAir Berlin, one year shy of its 40th birthday, began life as a flying Mallorca taxi, shuttling Germans to and from their favourite island. Although it flew 80,000 passengers a day, it still lost \u20ac782 million last year after a disastrous expansion strategy left it trapped between Lufthansa and low-cost rivals.\n\nIts best business decision was its last: to file for insolvency during an election campaign, when not even Angela Merkel could resist rescuing stranded German holidaymakers. But even if Brussels backs the bridging loan, not everybody believes it will be repaid.\n\nA week ago the Berlin mayor attacked Ryanair for a business model that \"privatises profits, protects investors and ensures costs are covered by the taxpayer\".

But on Tuesday, Etihad, which has a 29 percent stake and supplies plenty of debt financing, effectively pulled the plug. It won't provide any more financial help and its two representatives have quit Air Berlin's board.\n\nAir Berlin's collapse is alarming for its almost 9,000 employees, but it's been a long time coming. The company has about 1.2 billion euros in net debt and minus-1.8 billion euros of shareholder equity, according to Bloomberg data. Compared to budget carriers such as Ryanair Holdings Plc and EasyJet Plc, which are busy adding capacity and cutting fares, Air Berlin's cost base was simply too high.\n\nGulf carriers like Eithad were once feared in Europe but they're struggling now, as Gadfly colleague David Fickling has explained. Etihad's strategy of buying minority stakes in various far-flung airlines appears to have been particularly ill-conceived: the Abu Dhabi hub carrier reported a $1.9 billion loss for its 2017 fiscal year. Another Eithad investment, Alitalia SpA, filed for bankruptcy in May.\n\nIn theory, these airline failures should be an opportunity for the needed consolidation of Europe's skies, which are far more fragmented than in the U.S. It makes European airlines susceptible to adding too much capacity, at little profit. The five biggest carriers on the continent control just 46 percent of the market, whereas in the U.S. just four carriers have a stranglehold on more than two-thirds of the domestic market.\n\nBut don't bet on things changing in a hurry. Lufthansa hopes to profit from its rival's troubles and has already leased some of its planes for its own new low-cost airline, Eurowings. The German government, perhaps conscious of federal elections next month, has offered Air Berlin a bridging loan.\n\nRyanair and its ilk will be scouring for opportunities too to push into the German market. The Irish carrier is one of several airlines to have submitted non-binding bids for Alitalia. That could mean Europe's oversupply of airline seats ends up being preserved -- albeit at airlines with stronger balance sheets. Expect more of the same rather than up, up and away.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.", "id": "9295860", "details": {"liCnt": 12}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Air Berlin's Magnificent Flying Insolvency Machine", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/in0iampNtiAA/v0/1200x920.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "8861", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Euro"}, "id": "302536", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "id": "302694", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}, "id": "302744", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder"}, {"location": null, "score": 4, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}, "id": "304668", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}, "id": "309522", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryanair"}, "id": "315139", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}, "id": "316354", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}, "id": "316652", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alitalia"}, "id": "324150", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alitalia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}, "id": "326178", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways"}, {"label": {"eng": "EasyJet"}, "id": "336815", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyJet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eurowings"}, "id": "351761", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurowings"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 78, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 855, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 857, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1043, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation"}], "time": "14:25:00"}

Sure enough, as Air Berlin filed for insolvency on Tuesday, almost every other European airline gained altitude. EasyJet's shares were up 4.5%, Ryanair's by 3.3%, British Airways owner IAG's by 2.9%, and even little Wizz Air improved 4.6%.\n\nThe reaction makes sense. Air Berlin has been loss-making for years but it is still a top 10 European airline, measured by numbers of passengers, and thus has been able to irritate rivals by merely surviving. That is why one reason why low-cost winners, such as easyJet and Ryanair, grumble about irrational economics and the current state of overcapacity in the market.\n\nIn a business like aviation, it is rarely safe to assume any airline's financial crisis is terminal. But Air Berlin's troubles, like those at Alitalia (now in administration), do look destined to lead a major restructuring of some form. Credit lines from the German government are only a temporary measure. The harder fact is that Etihad, a big shareholder in both Air Berlin and Alitalia, seems to have abandoned its strange strategy of throwing millions of euros at loss-making investments.\n\nShould either easyJet or Ryanair exploit a once-in-a-generation opportunity to pick up the pieces, buy Air Berlin and bag a big slice of the German market? Ryanair has spoken about wanting a 20% share there eventually and easyJet has been expanding too.\n\nBoth should tread carefully. The prize assets are slots at big German airports. If they become available on a clean basis, then fine. But restructuring a loss-making airline of the size of Air Berlin could be a messy business.\n\nYet Ryanair has certainly got the right idea in demanding that state-aid rules are followed. The Irish carrier smells \"an obvious conspiracy\" to deliver Air Berlin on a debt-free basis to national flag-carrier Lufthansa. A stitch-up would indeed be outrageous. It is worth making a fuss at Brussels - just don't get mugged into overpaying as an alternative.\n\nFund managers shouldn't get too pumped up over pay pressure\n\nThe City's fund managers would like you to know they are not a bunch of supine lickspittles on the troubled issue of executive pay. On the contrary, says Chris Cummings, chief executive of trade body the Investment Association, 2017's round of annual meetings shows shareholders \"are flexing their muscles and holding big business to account\".\n\nReally? This claim seems to rest on \"dissent\" being defined as a vote of 20% or more against a company's pay resolution. True, such a level can be noteworthy in a field where Soviet-style majorities are commonplace. But would you really describe a 20% vote as a muscular show of force? If you score a fifth of goals in a football match, you've lost.\n\nThe association's curious yardstick is also capable of generating flattering conclusions whatever the reading. When the number of \"rebellions\" falls, as at FTSE 100 companies, it means \"companies have listened\". But when the figure increases, as at FTSE 250 firms, we're told it doesn't mean the board has closed its ears; rather, it shows the companies are \"in the investor spotlight\".\n\nTo be fair to the association, its work behind the scenes almost certainly contributed to six FTSE 350 companies withdrawing contentious pay proposals last year instead of risking a defeat. That is a significant figure. The association is also plainly on the side of reform. It has backed the mandatory publication of pay ratios and wants boardroom pay to be simpler.\n\nJolly good, but before boasting about its members' toughness, the association needs to look outside the window. FTSE 100 chief executives took a collective 17% pay cut to \"only\" \u00a34.5m last year but, to most observers, the big new factor was the government's threat to introduce pay ratios, workers on pay committees and annual binding votes. Those ideas probably persuaded a few pay committees to tone things down, at least temporarily.\n\nYes, greater fund manager pressure may have helped at the margin, but, please, don't tell us shareholder activism is winning. If it were that easy, the government wouldn't be contemplating reform after so many years of dancing around the subject.\n\nGovernment still on the wrong track over rail fares\n\nAnnoyed that rail fares will go up by 3.6%? So you should be. Linking the annual increase to July's retail prices index, which consistently gives higher readings than the consumer prices index, makes no sense. The Bank of England uses CPI for inflation-targeting. CPI is used for calculating annual increases to benefits. And CPI forms one part of the triple-lock on pensions. By rights, RPI should be history.\n\nTo quote the Office for National Statistics: \"We know there will be a focus on the RPI this month, but the national statistician has been clear it is not a good measure and we do not recommend its use.\" The ONS trots out the same line every August.

Nach Angaben aus Wien soll das unbedingt verhindert werden. Dem Niki-Betriebsrat zufolge ist Air Berlin daran interessiert, den Betrieb bei Niki am Laufen zu halten.\n\nDie \u00f6sterreichische Tochter von Air Berlin soll nicht mit in den Strudel der Insolvenz gerissen werden. Es gebe die Zusage der Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrung, dass der vom Ex-Rennfahrer Niki Lauda gegr\u00fcndeten Niki das n\u00f6tige Geld zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt werde, sagte Betriebsrat Stefan Tankovits in Wien. \"Wir haben auch die Anzeichen bekommen, dass Air Berlin sehr interessiert daran ist, hier den Betrieb am Laufen zu halten, um uns dann m\u00f6glichst reibungslos verkaufen zu k\u00f6nnen.\" Bisher seien alle \u00dcberweisungen aus Deutschland erfolgt, erg\u00e4nzte Peter Stattmann von der Gewerkschaft GPA.\n\n\"Wir lassen niemanden im Regen stehen\", versprach \u00d6sterreichs Verkehrsminister J\u00f6rg Leichtfried. \"Unser Ziel ist, heimische Arbeitspl\u00e4tze zu sichern und daf\u00fcr zu sorgen, dass die \u00d6sterreicherinnen und \u00d6sterreicher gut von ihrem Urlaub nach Hause kommen.\" Niki hat bisher nicht Insolvenz angemeldet, h\u00e4ngt aber finanziell am Tropf von Air Berlin, bei der die Zahlungen der Flugg\u00e4ste ankommen. In der Insolvenz sind \u00dcberweisungen aber nicht unproblematisch, weil es darum geht, m\u00f6glichst viel Geld f\u00fcr die Gl\u00e4ubiger zu sichern.\n\nAuszuschlie\u00dfen sei eine Insolvenz von Niki nicht, sagte Betriebsrat Tankovits. \"Wir sind auf alles vorbereitet.\" Nach der Ansicht von Gewerkschafter Stattmann sind die Gehaltszahlungen Ende August die n\u00e4chste Nagelprobe. \"Wir werden sehen - es ist uns zugesagt worden - ob das auch so eintrifft.\" Verkehrsminister Leichtfried sagte zu, dass sich die Regierung in Wien im Falle einer Insolvenz um eine L\u00f6sung bem\u00fchen werde.\n\nNiki geh\u00f6rt zu den wertvollsten Verm\u00f6genswerten, die Air Berlin in der Insolvenz zu Geld machen kann. Verhandlungen mit der Lufthansa \u00fcber eine \u00dcbernahme von Teilen von Air Berlin, darunter Niki, laufen. Interesse an der \u00f6sterreichischen Airline haben einem Insider zufolge aber auch andere Unternehmen angemeldet, unter anderem die britische Billigfluglinie Easyjet. Attraktiv sind vor allem die Start- und Landerechte von Niki am Flughafen in der NRW-Metropole D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\nUnterdessen warnte Bundeswirtschaftsministerin Brigitte Zypries die Lufthansa davor, sich einer \u00dcbernahme von Air Berlin zu sicher zu sein. Aus Wettbewerbsgr\u00fcnden m\u00fcsse mehr als eine Airline zum Zug kommen. \"Nat\u00fcrlich ist die Bundesregierung da nicht vorfestgelegt\", sagte ein Sprecher des Ministeriums.\n\nVerkehrsminister Alexander Dobrindt hatte sich daf\u00fcr starkgemacht, dass die Lufthansa die wesentlichen Teile von Air Berlin bekommt. Das Wirtschaftsministerium stellte klar, dass die Bundesregierung an den Verhandlungen \u00fcber die Zukunft von Air Berlin nicht beteiligt sei. Der Bund hatte einen Massekredit von 150 Millionen Euro bereitgestellt. Damit soll Zeit gewonnen werden, um eine zukunftsf\u00e4hige und sinnvolle L\u00f6sung zu finden, wie der Sprecher sagte.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Austria"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Austria"}, "type": "loc", "id": "11"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc", "id": "56"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Austria"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wien"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wien"}, "type": "loc", "id": "99882"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00fcsseldorf", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "type": "loc", "id": "110227"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "loc", "id": "111334"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302694", "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302720", "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303495", "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303738", "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304599", "label": {"eng": "Works council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304668", "label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insolvency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "307219", "label": {"eng": "Insolvenz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309471", "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310422", "label": {"eng": "Wealth (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "316354", "label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "316652", "label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyJet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "336815", "label": {"eng": "EasyJet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Dobrindt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "405219", "label": {"eng": "Alexander Dobrindt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_Zypries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "428172", "label": {"eng": "Brigitte Zypries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niki_Lauda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "431113", "label": {"eng": "Niki Lauda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niki_(airline)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "467909", "label": {"eng": "Niki (airline)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_slot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "505093", "label": {"eng": "Landing slot"}}]}], "totalResults": 422, "pages": 422}}}

Die Bundesregierung hatte angek\u00fcndigt, Air Berlin mit einem Kredit zu unterst\u00fctzen, um den Flugbetrieb zun\u00e4chst abzusichern.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Austria"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Austria"}, "type": "loc", "id": "11"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Austria"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wien"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wien"}, "type": "loc", "id": "99882"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302588", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302694", "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302720", "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302744", "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303302", "label": {"eng": "News agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303379", "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vereinte_Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303737", "label": {"eng": "Ver.di"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303738", "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_council", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304599", "label": {"eng": "Works council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304668", "label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305943", "label": {"eng": "Workplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insolvency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307219", "label": {"eng": "Insolvenz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "316354", "label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Berlin", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "316652", "label": {"eng": "Air Berlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "326178", "label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niki_(airline)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "467909", "label": {"eng": "Niki (airline)"}}]}], "totalResults": 423, "pages": 423}}}

Then, people are lured in when they're feeling fear and anxiety and vulnerability. They want explanation, support, understanding and leadership and, where do you go?\"\n\nIn her new film, \"A Sacrifice,\" Scott, the daughter of filmmaker Ridley Scott, focuses on people who are united by the climate crisis. They talk about a better world and find others who want solutions.\n\nBased on Nicholas Hogg's book, \"Tokyo,\" Scott's film follows a social psychologist and his daughter as they navigate life in a new country. Originally set in Japan, the location was moved to Germany, when the pandemic interrupted filming. The new spot, however, added another layer.\n\n\"Moving the story made perfect sense in terms of its deep-rooted culture of progressive activism,\" Scott offers in a director's statement, \"and, crucially, East Berlin's four-decade experience of being a collectivist society under communist dictatorship.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Australian actor projects a \"wonderfully endearing\" quality that makes the story resonate when he makes a few missteps with his daughter.\n\nSadie Sink, who plays the daughter, \"has that wisdom beyond her years.\" When put in play with Bana, their characters \"sort of have a friendship more than a father/daughter relationship.\"\n\nSink's character begins to explore Berlin while her father is at work. She meets a young man who introduces her to the underground party scene and, ultimately, a cult.\n\nThe story, Scott says, is a cautionary tale for the times we live in. \"It's 'be careful of the information you trust, be careful of the people you trust and give your power to.' We live in a post-truth world and you have to be very, very cautious.\"\n\nScott says it was very easy to make the leap from what seemed like a political activist organization to a cult. Their methods - ones that lead to death - start harmlessly then involve ingesting liquids and poisons.\n\nThe film \"drip feeds\" you story points and character changes enough that it keeps you guessing - \"until there's a significant reveal at the end.\"\n\nThe overriding message: \"Think for yourself,\" Scott says.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

She meets a young man who introduces her to the underground party scene and, ultimately, a cult.\n\nThe story, Scott says, is a cautionary tale for the times we live in. \"It's 'be careful of the information you trust, be careful of the people you trust and give your power to.' We live in a post-truth world and you have to be very, very cautious.\"\n\nScott says it was very easy to make the leap from what seemed like a political activist organization to a cult. Their methods - ones that lead to death - start harmlessly then involve ingesting liquids and poisons.\n\nThe film \"drip feeds\" you story points and character changes enough that it keeps you guessing - \"until there's a significant reveal at the end.\"\n\nThe overriding message: \"Think for yourself,\" Scott says.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

Then, people are lured in when they're feeling fear and anxiety and vulnerability. They want explanation, support, understanding and leadership and, where do you go?\"\n\nIn her new film, \"A Sacrifice,\" Scott, the daughter of filmmaker Ridley Scott, focuses on people who are united by the climate crisis. They talk about a better world and find others who want solutions.\n\nBased on Nicholas Hogg's book, \"Tokyo,\" Scott's film follows a social psychologist and his daughter as they navigate life in a new country. Originally set in Japan, the location was moved to Germany, when the pandemic interrupted filming. The new spot, however, added another layer.\n\n\"Moving the story made perfect sense in terms of its deep-rooted culture of progressive activism,\" Scott offers in a director's statement, \"and, crucially, East Berlin's four-decade experience of being a collectivist society under communist dictatorship.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

While he immerses himself in his work, his rebellious teenage daughter, Mazzy (Sadie Sink), becomes embroile...\n\nCults succeed by feeding on fear that exists in the world, says writer/director Jordan Scott.\n\n\"They mirror, basically, what's happening. Then, people are lured in when they're feeling fear and anxiety and vulnerability. They want explanation, support, understanding and leadership and, where do you go?\"\n\nIn her new film, \"A Sacrifice,\" Scott, the daughter of filmmaker Ridley Scott, focuses on people who are united by the climate crisis. They talk about a better world and find others who want solutions.\n\nBased on Nicholas Hogg's book, \"Tokyo,\" Scott's film follows a social psychologist and his daughter as they navigate life in a new country. Originally set in Japan, the location was moved to Germany, when the pandemic interrupted filming. The new spot, however, added another layer.\n\n\"Moving the story made perfect sense in terms of its deep-rooted culture of progressive activism,\" Scott offers in a director's statement, \"and, crucially, East Berlin's four-decade experience of being a collectivist society under communist dictatorship.\"\n\nMoving locations changed plenty. \"The original script was so rooted in Japanese culture,\" Scott says. \"So, all that went out the window and had to be rewritten for Berlin. All the characters changed hugely.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nEric Bana, who plays the psychologist, was with the project throughout its changes. \"Even when we were shooting in Tokyo, he hung in there with me,\" Scott says. The Australian actor projects a \"wonderfully endearing\" quality that makes the story resonate when he makes a few missteps with his daughter.\n\nSadie Sink, who plays the daughter, \"has that wisdom beyond her years.\" When put in play with Bana, their characters \"sort of have a friendship more than a father/daughter relationship.\"\n\nSink's character begins to explore Berlin while her father is at work. She meets a young man who introduces her to the underground party scene and, ultimately, a cult.\n\nThe story, Scott says, is a cautionary tale for the times we live in. \"It's 'be careful of the information you trust, be careful of the people you trust and give your power to.' We live in a post-truth world and you have to be very, very cautious.\"\n\nScott says it was very easy to make the leap from what seemed like a political activist organization to a cult. Their methods - ones that lead to death - start harmlessly then involve ingesting liquids and poisons.\n\nThe film \"drip feeds\" you story points and character changes enough that it keeps you guessing - \"until there's a significant reveal at the end.\"\n\nThe overriding message: \"Think for yourself,\" Scott says.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller\n\nMovies in a Minute:

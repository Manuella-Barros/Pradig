{"id": 225002648, "title": "Parents in Scotland may be due more than \u00a3209 each month for children under-16 this year", "text": "The Scottish Government has announced that the families of more than 329,000 children under the age of 16 are now receiving \u00a3106.80 every four weeks through the Scottish Child Payment. The weekly payment of \u00a326.70, which is unique to Scotland, can help families with the cost of living crisis - over \u00a3677 million has been paid since the benefit launched in 2021. Families could be due up to \u00a3209 each month for every child under 16, if they are also claiming Child Benefit from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Child Benefit is a separate UK-wide payment that is worth \u00a325.60 for the eldest or only child and is also paid every four weeks, amounting to \u00a3102.40. Families claiming both benefits for children under 16 could be due \u00a3209.20 each month during the current financial year, however, it\u2019s important to be aware that Child Benefit and Scottish Child Payment are paid separately and will not arrive on the same day. Scottish Child Payment is part of a wider package of payments - including the three Best Start Grants and Best Start Foods - which together have provided over \u00a3829 million in vital financial support at key stages of a child\u2019s life. There is no cap on the number of children in one family who can receive these payments. In a new survey, the majority of families said that the payments helped their child to take part in social or educational opportunities and also helped them buy milk and healthy food for their children. Respondents also said they found it straightforward to apply with more than 90 per cent of people noting the application was clear and did not take too long to complete. Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: \u201cAs the First Minister has set out, eradicating child poverty is the number one priority for the Scottish Government. \u201cScottish Child Payment plays a key part in that mission. Together with our Best Start Grant and Best Start Foods payments, this package of financial support, which is worth almost \u00a325,000 per child by the time their child turns 16, is helping to make sure all children in Scotland get the best start in life. \u201cWe have provided over \u00a3829 million to help people raise their families, putting money into the pockets of people who need it most. \u201cThis crucial cash is available as soon as expectant parents know they are pregnant all the way through to their child starting nursery, then going to primary and secondary school and helps them cover costs of caring for their children. \u201cWe know from our recent research that families say the application process is clear and doesn\u2019t take too long to apply. So I would urge families to apply for our package of five family payments and get the money they are entitled to.\u201d Below is everything you need to know about the Scottish Child Payment, you can find more information and apply directly on MyGov.Scot here.

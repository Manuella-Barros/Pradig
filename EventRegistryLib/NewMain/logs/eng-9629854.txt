In that context, what he meant was that not many Nigerian traffickers had been arrested in the past few years.\n\nSo how does that concern the NDLEA?\n\nThe Thai envoy clarified this in his next statement: \"I would like to thank Your Excellency (Marwa) and to inform you that the government of Thailand gives more importance to the certificate of the NDLEA of Nigeria before issuing visas. There may be some other criteria and other qualifications they might need, but I think it is not the priority. The priority document the government of Thailand needs is the certificate from NDLEA.\n\n\"It means that if a Nigerian has the NDLEA certificate, 90 per cent to 95 per cent assurance is guaranteed that they can receive the visas to enter the Kingdom of Thailand.\"\n\nTwo facts are deduced from the statement of the Thai envoy. The first and most obvious is the importance of the visa clearance certificate the NDLEA issues to Nigerians travelling to Thailand, and at least, seven other countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Brazil, Pakistan, Philippines and Russia.\n\nThis clearance is essentially a background check conducted by the NDLEA to ensure that an applicant does not have any drug-related record. A diligent check and clearance mean that those who receive the visa can be trusted not to get involved in drug trafficking during their stay in those countries.\n\nBy implication, the NDLEA kept the bad eggs out.\n\nAside from the visa clearance, the agency's interdiction at international airports has helped keep at bay, the wave of potential drug mules that could have trafficked illicit substances from Nigeria to the Middle East and Southeast Asia.\n\nThis way, the NDLEA has also kept Nigerian traffickers out of Thailand.\n\nTruth be told, since 2021 when Marwa took over the affairs of the anti-narcotic body and began far-reaching reforms, the NDLEA has regained efficiency in its operations. With over 50, 000 arrests in three years, the trafficking space into or out of Nigeria has shrunk.\n\nWhile Nigerians may be oblivious of the importance of this development, countries around the world, their governments and anti-drug agencies are appreciative of the efforts of Nigeria's NDLEA. They show their appreciation with donations of operational equipment and resources, as well as greater collaboration.\n\nThe Thai government has similarly offered the same thing. Overall, the NDLEA performance has put Nigeria in good light. What that means is that the image of the country, hitherto defined by stereotypes of Nigerians as drug traffickers, is being redeemed.", "source": {"uri": "dailytrust.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Trust"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Drug_Law_Enforcement_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Drug Law Enforcement Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Thailand", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Thailand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charg\u00e9_d'affaires", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charg\u00e9 d'affaires"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule_(smuggling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mule (smuggling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://dailytrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NDLEA-uncovers-large-farm-of-marijuana-in-Kano-e1637501727420.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629854", "eventUri": "eng-9629854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Among the many aspects of governance, one agency stands out for its remarkable performance; the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).\n\nUnder the robust leadership of Brigadier-General Mohammed BubaMarwa (rtd), the NDLEA has emerged as a symbol of unprecedented success, exemplifying how focused leadership and unwavering support from the presidency can yield outstanding results in combating the pervasive drug menace.\n\nThe NDLEA was established by Decree No. 48 of 1989. Its creation was a response to the rising tide of drug abuse and trafficking that threatened the social and economic fabric of Nigeria. The agency was mandated to combat drug trafficking and reduce the demand for illicit drugs through comprehensive enforcement and prevention strategies.\n\nOver the years, the agency had faced numerous challenges, including inadequate funding, lack of modern equipment, and corruption within its ranks. However, under Marwa's leadership, significant strides have been made to address these issues and revitalize the agency.\n\nWhen President Tinubu assumed office, he inherited a highly effective NDLEA leadership under Marwa, a leader whose commitment to eradicating drug abuse and trafficking has been resolute.\n\nRecognising the critical importance of continuity and stability in achieving long-term objectives of the NDLEA, President Tinubu provided full support to the agency, ensuring that Marwa's strategic initiatives are not only sustained but also expanded. This strategic decision has paid off immensely, as the NDLEA's performance over the past year has been nothing short of exemplary.\n\nUnder Marwa's leadership, and with the support of President Tinubu, the NDLEA has orchestrated a series of high-impact operations that have significantly disrupted the activities of drug cartels and traffickers across the country. The agency's tactical operations have led to record-breaking seizures of narcotics, arrests of high-profile drug lords, and dismantling of extensive drug networks. These successes are not mere statistics; they represent a substantial blow to the drug economy that funds other criminal activities and threatens national security.\n\nThe NDLEA's operational success is further highlighted by its intelligence-driven approach, which has enhanced the agency's ability to anticipate and thwart drug-related crimes before they escalate. This proactive stance has not only curtailed drug trafficking but has also instilled a sense of fear and caution among potential offenders, thereby acting as a significant deterrence.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of the NDLEA's success is its investment in capacity building and professional development. Recognising that a well-trained and adequately equipped workforce is essential for effective drug law enforcement, the agency has undertaken extensive recruitment and training programmes. These initiatives have brought onboard professionals, including doctors, lawyers, and psychologists, who provide specialised skills and support in various aspects of drug enforcement and rehabilitation.\n\nAdditionally, the NDLEA has established numerous rehabilitation centres across the country, ensuring that those who fall victim to drug abuse receive the necessary support and treatment to reintegrate them into society. This dual focus on enforcement and rehabilitation underscores the agency's holistic approach to tackling the drug problem, addressing the issues both in supply and demand sides.\n\nThe NDLEA has also made significant strides in enhancing its operational infrastructure. The construction of new barracks and office complexes has improved the living and working conditions of its personnel, boosting morale and operational efficiency. These infrastructural developments are a testament to the agency's commitment to providing a conducive environment for its workforce, which in turn enhances their effectiveness in carrying out their duties.\n\nAdditionally, the media has played a crucial role in shaping public perception of the NDLEA's efforts. Positive coverage of the agency's major operations and successes has helped to build public support and awareness. News reports highlighting the significant drug seizures and the arrests of high-profile traffickers have reinforced the message that the NDLEA is a formidable force in the fight against drugs.\n\nMoreover, the agency's proactive engagement with the media has ensured that its achievements are widely publicised. Regular press briefings, detailed reports, and media tours of NDLEA facilities have kept the public informed and engaged. This transparency and openness have further enhanced the agency's credibility and public trust.\n\nWhile the NDLEA's achievements are commendable, it is essential to consider the broader legislative environment that impacts its operations. Recently, the National Assembly has proposed amendments to the NDLEA Act, which include the introduction of the death penalty for drug trafficking and production offences. While the intention behind this proposal is to deter drug trafficking through stringent punishment, it raised significant human rights concerns.\n\nNigeria is a signatory to various international treaties that oppose the death penalty, and implementing such a measure would contravene these commitments. Moreover, from a moral and ethical standpoint, the death penalty is a draconian response that fails to address the underlying socio-economic factors driving individuals into the drug trade.\n\nInstead, a life sentence coupled with comprehensive rehabilitation and reintegration programmes would be a more humane and effective approach to dealing with drug offenders.\n\nLooking ahead, there are several areas where the NDLEA can build on its current successes. Strengthening community outreach and preventive education programmes will be crucial in reducing the demand for drugs. By raising awareness about the dangers of drug abuse and providing alternatives for at-risk populations, the NDLEA can further mitigate the drug problem at its roots.\n\nMoreover, increased funding and operational autonomy will empower the NDLEA to expand its reach and effectiveness. Ensuring that the agency has the necessary resources to sustain and enhance its operations is vital for maintaining the momentum in the commendable fight against drugs. The government's role in providing an enabling environment for the NDLEA to thrive cannot be overstated.\n\nInternational collaboration is another key area. Drug trafficking is a global problem that requires a coordinated international response. Strengthening partnerships with international law enforcement agencies and participating in global initiatives against drug trafficking can enhance the NDLEA's capabilities and ensure that Nigeria is not isolated in its efforts.\n\nIn evaluating President Tinubu's first year in office, the NDLEA stands out as a beacon of effective governance and exemplary performance. The agency's remarkable achievements in drug law enforcement, capacity building, and infrastructure development are a direct result of the steadfast leadership of Brigadier-General Marwa and the unwavering support from President Tinubu. The NDLEA's success story underscores the importance of continuity, strategic vision, and robust support in achieving national objectives.\n\nAs Nigeria continues to grapple with the multifaceted challenges of drug abuse and trafficking, the NDLEA's model of operation provides valuable lessons for other sectors. By fostering a culture of excellence, accountability, and innovation, the NDLEA has set a high standard for what can be achieved with the right leadership and support. Moving forward, the agency's gains must be consolidated and expanded, ensuring that the fight against drugs remains a top priority on the national agenda.\n\nOnwubiko is head of the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) and was a commissioner in the National Human Rights Commission of Nigeria.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Drug_Law_Enforcement_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Drug Law Enforcement Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition of drugs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug-related_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug-related crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_lord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug lord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply and demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_cartel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug cartel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Human_Rights_Commission_(Mexico)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Human Rights Commission (Mexico)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Cannabis", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Cannabis", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Marwa-640x360.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629854", "eventUri": "eng-9629854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

General Mohamed Buba Marwa, said the agency will continue to track, trace and apprehend those using pilgrimage as cover for drug trafficking.\n\nEarlier, the NDLEA reported via its official website that it successfully intercepted significant quantities of codeine-based syrup and a synthetic strain of cannabis known as Loud.\n\nThese illicit substances, with a street value of over Two Billion One Hundred and Eighty-Five Million Naira (N2,185,000,000.00), were seized at the Port Harcourt seaports, Onne, and the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, MMIA Ikeja.\n\nAt the MMIA Ikeja, NDLEA officers, in collaboration with other security agencies, intercepted a large consignment of Loud. The psychoactive substance was concealed in eight suitcases, comprising 320 parcels, weighing a total of 164.50kg.\n\nThe consignment, estimated to be worth N960,000,000.00, originated from Canada and arrived on a KLM flight via Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n\nThe consignment was discovered at the airport's E-arrival hall during a joint search operation conducted by NDLEA, Customs, and other security operatives.\n\nThe suspect, Ughenu Nnaife Francis, who attempted to smuggle the suitcases out of the hall, was apprehended. Preliminary investigations revealed that the suspect, a resident of Germany, had travelled to Toronto, Canada, to transport the drugs to Nigeria.\n\nHe claimed to have been recruited as a mule and was promised a fee of Six Million Naira for his involvement.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Port Harcourt Ports Complex, NDLEA operatives intercepted a container imported from India.\n\nThe container marked TEMU 6807401, was en route to the C to C bonded terminal in Enugu.\n\nA joint examination of the container by NDLEA, Customs, and other security agencies led to the discovery of 1,750 cartons of codeine weighing 26,250kg. These cartons contained 175,000 bottles of the opioid, valued at N1,225,000,000.00 in street value.\n\nThese successful interceptions demonstrate the commitment and effectiveness of the NDLEA in combating drug trafficking and abuse. The agency will continue to work tirelessly to ensure the safety and well-being of our society by preventing the circulation of illicit substances.", "source": {"uri": "naijanews.com", "dataType":

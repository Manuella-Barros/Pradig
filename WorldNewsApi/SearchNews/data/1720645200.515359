Do you share that same sentiment?\"\"It is absolutely stunning,\" Vance replied before explaining, \"We see amicus briefs used pretty heavily in front of the Supreme Court and in the courts of appeal \u2014 very rarely in the district courts. I think it is actually unprecedented to give them time to argue in the district court.\" 'Even in the Supreme Court that usually involves the government coming in in a case between private parties when they have a stake,\" she continued, This is like Judge Aileen Cannon, the judge on the case, going out on the streets and saying to just random people, 'Hey come on in, tell me what you think about this issue.'\"\"These are nonparties, they do not have a stake in the outcome of this case, it is unusual,\" she added.

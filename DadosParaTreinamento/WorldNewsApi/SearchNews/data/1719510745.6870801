Keep getting your three percent every four years.\u201d The twice-impeached former president was jeered at almost every turn. At least one person was visibly dangling a rubber chicken with \u201cDebate Bobby\u201d on it, a message taunting Trump for ignoring a request earlier this month by independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to debate him at the libertarian gathering. There were pockets of Trump supporters at the event, and they tried to drown out all the boos with \u201cWe want Trump!\u201d chants. But they were outnumbered. And there was already drama brewing between them and libertarians before Trump\u2019s event began. Organizers asked Trump\u2019s supporters to clear the front rows for libertarian delegates, who will decide Sunday which candidate to endorse. This reshuffling infuriated Trump loyalists, who declared the situation \u201can ambush.\u201d It was never a great idea for Trump to speak at this event. Libertarians have been skeptical of him, if not outright hostile toward him, and those tensions were on full display in Saturday\u2019s speech. The reason he spoke at this event at all is because the election is shaping up to be tight, and he, like President Joe Biden, wants to woo voters who may otherwise be considering supporting Kennedy. Even if Kennedy were to get just a couple of percentage points, it could potentially decide whether Biden or Trump gets a second term in the White House. Amid the drama, Trump plowed ahead with his remarks, with promises of rewards for libertarians who help him get elected. He vowed to put libertarians in his cabinet and in top White House posts. He threw out policy ideas he figured would appeal to libertarians, like denying federal money to schools with mask mandates and barring the creation of a central bank digital currency. He even quoted Patrick Henry, because why not: \u201cGive me liberty or give me death.\u201d But the Republican presidential hopeful kept drifting back to insulting the group of people he was supposedly trying to win over. \u201cI\u2019m asking for the Libertarian Party\u2019s endorsement, or at least for your votes,\u201d Trump said later to loud boos. \u201cLots and lots of libertarian votes.\u201d \u201cOr you can keep going the way you have for the last long decades and get your three percent, and then meet again, get another three percent,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s time to be winners.\u201d After Trump\u2019s speech, William Redpath, a former chair and three-time treasurer of the Libertarian Party, wondered why Trump spoke to the group at all. \u201cWhen I heard on May 1 that Donald Trump was actually going to speak at the Libertarian Party convention, it hit me like a ton of bricks,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough for a [Libertarian Party] national convention to allow a rival presidential candidate to promote his candidacy,\u201d Redpath said. \u201cBut, to invite Donald Trump to speak is beyond the pale. This is where the \u2018any publicity is good publicity\u2019 philosophy takes you.\u201d", "summary": "<script>!function(n){if(!window.cnx){window.cnx={},window.cnx.cmd=[];var t=n.createElement('iframe');t.display='none',t.onload=function(){var n=t.contentWindow.document,c=n.createElement('script');c.src='//cd.connatix.com/connatix.player.js',c.setAttribute('async','1'),c.setAttribute('type','text/javascript'),n.body.appendChild(c)},n.head.appendChild(t)}}(document);</script><script id=\"6653292ee4b0f35da189fbf4\">(new Image()).src = 'https://capi.connatix.com/tr/si?token=ff7fdddc-5441-4253-abc4-f12a33fad58b';cnx.cmd.push(function(){cnx({\"playerId\":\"ff7fdddc-5441-4253-abc4-f12a33fad58b\",\"mediaId\":\"9b1ebbb9-e327-4a91-b33d-b81e9daece44\"}).render(\"6653292ee4b0f35da189fbf4\");});</script><div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">WASHINGTON \u2013 In a speech that began and ended with overwhelming boos, Donald Trump on Saturday tried to court libertarian voters at their party\u2019s national convention by telling them to support him or keep being losers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/keep-getting-your-3-trump-mocks-libertarians-in-bid-to-win-their-votes_uk_6653292ee4b0f35da189fbf3", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/66529e2b2200003100e76bbf.jpeg?cache=ojzsnlvQZm&ops=1778_1000", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:21:14", "author": "Jennifer Bendery", "authors": ["Jennifer Bendery"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.478}

(Picture: Getty) Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has revealed that 18-year-olds will be forced to carry out a mandatory form of National Service if the Conservative Party is voted back in at the upcoming General Election. As part of the policy, 18-year-olds would be given a choice between a full-time placement in the armed forces for a year, or spending one weekend a month for 12 months volunteering in their community. The party would aim to have the the scheme be open for applications by September 2025, and the programme would cost around \u00a32.5billion a year, with plans to fund \u00a31 billion through a \u2018crack down on tax avoidance and evasion\u2019. Many mums and dads have been quick to voice their unhappiness over this, taking to social media and parenting forums like Mumsnet to share their thoughts. \u2018This feels like a threat, not an election promise,\u2019 wrote a Mumsnet user named catchlock, while a poster known as cavernclub said: \u2018It would create a generation of teenagers who would then just want rebel against authority \u2014 being \u201cforced\u201d to something against your will at that age is very counterproductive. It\u2019s very different times and culture now to what it was after WWII.\u2019 To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Up Next A few branded the idea \u2018ridiculous\u2019, while some parents merely felt concerned about their children being forced to do something they didn\u2019t want. \u2018I have a 14 year old son with autism and learning issues. He can\u2019t even tie his own shoelaces or ride a bike. I\u2019m scared to death about an idea like this,\u2019 confessed one mum. Another replied: \u2018My 17-year-old has plenty to do with her paid part-time job as well as her A levels. She doesn\u2019t need to be an unpaid volunteer care worker as well.\u2019 However, not everyone was opposed to National Service, with some claiming it would be \u2018beneficial\u2019 for young people as a learning experience. A Mumsnet user named MaryMaryVeryContrary wrote: \u2018I think National Service is a great idea in theory and would massively benefit today\u2019s teens, but I don\u2019t think they would implement it effectively at all. It would probably end up a huge waste of money.\u2019 And PurpleChrayn added: \u2018I am clearly in the minority but I\u2019m for it. I have experience of two countries with mandatory service \u2014 Singapore and Israel \u2014 and the kids it turns out are on the whole mature, responsible, and hardworking thanks to their military training.\u2019 But what do experts think of the idea? Parenting expert Kirsty Ketley told Metro.co.uk that she\u2019s concerned for the mental health of teenagers if they are forced into National Service, as she claims it could be \u2018catastrophic\u2019 for them. \u2018Currently, our teens are in a huge mental health crisis, with a lack of services to help them and so making them sign up to do National Service, I feel, would contribute to their mental health struggles and could be catastrophic,\u2019 she said. \u2018Even doing voluntary work, will cause anxiety for those who already struggle and the military is only really for those who absolutely want to do it \u2014 it really isn\u2019t for everyone.\u2019 Kirsty continued: \u2018Another issue is for those who already know the career they want to do, who are hoping to go to university to study. They would have to fit in volunteering amongst their studies and it could make fitting work to help fund university a struggle. \u2018Then there are the teens who are doing apprenticeships, where they are gaining qualifications while working. Do they have to then fit in volunteering or take a year out to do the military? Parenting experts are concerned about the mental health of their teenagers if National Service becomes mandatory. (Picture: Getty Images) \u2018I think having these things as an option would be a better idea, as there would likely be a good uptake, but forcing teens to do it. No.\u2019 She added: \u2018Many teens already volunteer in their local communities as part of the Duke of Edinburgh Award and organisations such as Scouts and Girl Guiding. St John\u2019s ambulance also has a cadet core, as do the RAF (Air cadets) and Army and Navy \u2014 maybe that \u00a32million would be better spent on helping those organisations and improving mental healthcare for our kids instead?\u2019 Natalie Costa, a former teacher who now works as a parenting and children\u2019s confidence coach at Power Thoughts, was also worried about the impact National Service would have on young people\u2019s mental health \u2014 though she wasn\u2019t completely against the idea. She told Metro: \u2018I think that in some cases it can definitely be a benefit for many teenagers, however, I am also concerned about the impact this will have on mental health. Young people are struggling now more than ever and there has been a huge lack of funding and support in mental health, SEND services etc. \u2018Overall the emotional resilience of children and teens has drastically changed since the pandemic and I worry what this compulsory decision would do to teenagers who are forced to take part, yet are struggling with their mental health. \u2018Teens have faced an immense amount of uncertainty and change over the past few years which only adds to the increasing numbers of mental health challenges that we\u2019ve seen. Expecting 18-year-olds (who are at such a vulnerable stage of their development in these years) to be part of national service isn\u2019t going to be in their best interest.\u2019 Do you have a story to share?

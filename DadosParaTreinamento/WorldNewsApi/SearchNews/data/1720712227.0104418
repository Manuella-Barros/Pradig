Birmingham City released Neil Etheridge, Marc Roberts, Gary Gardner, Ivan Sunjic and Scott Hogan. While Blues will be in League One next season following relegation, some players released by Championship clubs will certainly be of interest to the club\u2019s recruitment team. Andre Dozzell has been made available, although Blues' interest in the midfielder was driven by Tony Mowbray who won't be returning to his managerial post. Queens Park Rangers opted not to extend Dozzell\u2019s contract following his Blues loan spell. It is worth noting that Sheffield Wednesday have released midfielder George Byers, who has already been linked with a switch to Blues this month. There are players who haven\u2019t officially been released but are available on free transfers. Preston North End captain Alan Browne hasn\u2019t yet signed a new contract at Deepdale and can be acquired from July 1.

Included in EBITDA was a positive plantation fair value price adjustment of US$3 million. A modest recovery in global paper markets was also observed following the extended destocking cycle in 2023.\n\nLooking forward to Sappi's third quarter, Binnie stated: \"While we expect a gradual improvement in paper markets there will be a reduction in output due to a number of planned maintenance shuts in the quarter. We therefore anticipate that EBITDA (excluding a slightly negative fair value price adjustment) for the third quarter of FY2024 will be below that of the second quarter but substantially above last year.\"\n\nDissolving pulp (DP) demand was strong throughout the quarter boosted by a tight supply landscape, low downstream inventory levels and high viscose staple fibre (VSF) operating rates following the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations. Sales volumes for the pulp segment increased by 2% year-on-year and hardwood DP spot prices closed the quarter higher at US$940/ton. Profitability for the segment was further supported by significant cost savings, particularly for wood and chemicals.\n\nPackaging and speciality papers demand rebounded during the quarter. Sales volumes improved by 9% compared to the prior year with a mixed performance across the regions. Selling prices came under significant pressure in the second half of FY2023 and were 13% below the prior year. Cost savings were insufficient to offset the negative impact of lower selling prices and profitability for the segment declined compared to last year.\n\nThe gradual recovery of graphic papers demand continued throughout the quarter as downstream value chain inventories normalised causing sales volumes to increase by 7% compared to the prior year. However, there has been a structural decline in demand from the highs of 2022. The combination of increased sales volumes and cost savings facilitated a year-on-year improvement in profitability for the segment.\n\nProfitability of the European business continued to recover slowly from the lows of the second half of FY2023. The improvement was driven by increased year-on-year sales volumes and cost savings, offset to some extent by selling price reductions across all product categories. A notable increase in capacity utilisation was achieved due to the successful transfer of Stockstadt and Lanaken sales volumes to our other assets following the termination of production at both mills in the prior quarter. Variable costs were 16% below last year driven by lower purchased pulp and wood costs. However, variable costs increased from the prior quarter on the back of rising pulp prices which were boosted by supply disruptions in Europe due to the Finnish port strikes and mechanical failures at a number of European pulp mills. Fixed costs were 17% below the prior year due to the strategic restructuring of the European business.\n\nThe North American business delivered a good performance despite a slower than expected recovery in demand for graphic paper. A strong increase in paperboard sales volumes combined with cost savings offset lower selling prices for packaging. Variable costs were 9% below last year with savings achieved for all major input categories. Fixed costs were 5% above the prior year primarily due to higher personnel costs.\n\nThe South African business delivered a solid performance with profitability benefiting from significant cost savings and a ZAR56 million forestry fair value price adjustment. Variable costs were 7% below the prior year due to lower wood, chemical and delivery costs. Fixed costs were well managed with a year-on-year increase of 6%.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe third quarter is seasonally the weakest in terms of demand for our products. However, market sentiment is generally improving across all of our product segments and Sappi is well positioned with healthy cash reserves and liquidity to manage current market uncertainties.\n\nDissolving pulp demand remains healthy, buoyed by low inventory levels across the VSF value chain. VSF pricing has faced downward pressure in recent weeks, which could be a risk for DP pricing in the third quarter. However, the high operating rates through the VSF value chain and relatively constrained DP supply landscape continue to offering some support for DP prices.\n\nGraphic papers demand is expected to continue its slow recovery in the third quarter, but the market fundamentally remains in oversupply and industry operating rates remain below historical levels. Our European restructuring programme has significantly increased our capacity utilisation which, combined with the fixed costs savings, is expected to improve our competitive position. We continue to diligently adapt our product and market mix to match demand in North America ahead of the Somerset PM2 conversion and expansion in 2025. The sale of the Stockstadt Mill site is on track to be concluded in the third quarter.\n\nPackaging and specialty paper markets continue to improve across all regions, and we expect good demand in North America and South Africa. However, market conditions in Europe generally remain subdued due to the persistently weak economy and low consumer confidence.\n\nVariable costs have reduced substantially from the peak in 2023 but have plateaued in the second quarter and remain above historical levels for many of our input categories. Globally, pulp market prices have started rising which could negatively impact the profitability of our paper businesses, particularly in Europe where proactive margin management will be required. In the third quarter, the Saiccor and Somerset Mills will take scheduled maintenance shuts, which will have an estimated impact of US$30 million on group profitability.\n\nCapital expenditure for FY2024 is expected to be in the region of US$500 million and as previously communicated includes approximately US$154 million for the Somerset PM2 conversion and expansion project. We remain committed to disciplined capital allocation as we execute our strategy to reduce exposure to graphic paper markets while investing for growth in renewable packaging, dissolving pulp and biomaterials.\n\nThe plantation fair value price adjustment for the third quarter is expected to be slightly negative due to higher fuel costs and discount rates.\n\nThe full results announcement is available at www.sappi.com\n\nThere will be a conference call to which investors are invited.

Reports First Quarter 2024 Results and Announces Quarterly Cash Dividend Of $0.075", "body": "In the first quarter of 2024, net loss was $16.7 million (or $0.25 per share), which included a non-cash loss on disposal of $23.6 million (or $0.35 per share) relating to the dissolution of the Cariboo Pulp and Paper (\"CPP\") joint venture, compared to a net loss of $30.6 million (or $0.46 per share) in the first quarter of 2023 and a net loss of $87.2 million (or $1.31 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2023, which included a non-cash impairment charge of $33.7 million (or $0.51 per share) relating to the classification of our sandalwood business as held for sale.\n\nMr. Juan Carlos Bueno, Chief Executive Officer, stated: \"In the first quarter, our operating results were positively impacted by an improved pulp and lumber pricing environment, lower fiber and other production costs and no planned maintenance downtime.\n\nNBSK pulp prices in Europe and North America continued to improve in the first quarter, driven by stronger demand, lower customer inventory levels and global supply disruptions. In China, third party industry quoted NBSK net prices were flat, with weaker demand around the Chinese New Year offset by stronger demand towards the end of the quarter. We believe this positive pricing momentum will continue and expect modest price increases in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nLumber pricing in both the U.S. and Europe also improved in the first quarter of 2024 as a result of a modest increase in demand. However, we currently expect lumber prices to be generally flat in the second quarter as demand continues to be impacted by high interest rates and economic uncertainty.\n\nIn the first quarter, we continued our focus on our strategic priorities. To this end, in April 2024, we announced the dissolution of the CPP joint venture, which will allow us to direct resources to areas aligned with our long-term focus.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, all our pulp mills ran very efficiently with no scheduled maintenance downtime. We are currently planning for a total of 35 days of maintenance downtime (approximately 60,800 ADMTs) at our pulp mills in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nOverall per unit fiber costs for our pulp segment decreased in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 due to stable supply. Per unit fiber costs for our solid wood segment increased compared to the prior quarter due to strong demand for sawlogs.\n\nWe continue to maintain a healthy order book for our growing mass timber business and commenced work on certain large-scale projects in the second quarter.\"\n\nMr. Bueno concluded: \"Overall, conditions continued to improve in the first quarter, including better pricing and lower production costs for our pulp segment. While we expect this momentum to continue in the second quarter of 2024, we remain steadfast in managing our costs and liquidity prudently. As a result of our strong liquidity, we believe we are well positioned to execute our business plan through the business cycle.\"\n\nCurrent Market Environment\n\nWe currently expect pulp pricing to continue to improve in the second quarter of 2024, led by Europe and North America as a result of stronger demand and global supply constraints. In China, we currently expect stable prices in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nIn our solid wood segment, we currently expect stable U.S. and European lumber prices in the second quarter of 2024 as demand remains weak due to continued high interest rates and economic uncertainty. We currently expect mass timber prices to remain generally stable in the second quarter of 2024 as a result of steady demand.\n\n_________________\n\nConsolidated Financial Results\n\nConsolidated - Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2023\n\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2024 increased by approximately 6% to $553.4 million from $522.7 million in the same quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher pulp sales volumes partially offset by lower pulp sales realizations.\n\nCosts and expenses in the first quarter of 2024 modestly increased to $553.9 million from $542.8 million in the same quarter of 2023 primarily as a result of higher pulp sales volumes and the non-cash loss on disposal of the CPP joint venture investment partially offset by lower per unit fiber, chemical, energy and freight costs.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Operating EBITDA increased to $63.6 million from $27.5 million in the same quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower per unit fiber and other production costs, lower freight costs and higher pulp sales volumes partially offset by lower pulp sales realizations.\n\nSegment Results\n\nPulp\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, our pulp segment operating income increased by approximately 36% to $17.4 million from $12.8 million in the same quarter of 2023 primarily as a result of lower per unit fiber and other production costs, lower freight costs and higher sales volumes partially offset by lower sales realizations and the non-cash loss on disposal of the CPP joint venture investment.\n\nPulp segment revenues, which includes pulp, energy and chemical revenues, in the first quarter of 2024 increased by approximately 8% to $432.4 million from $400.4 million in the same quarter of 2023 due to higher sales volumes partially offset by lower sales realizations.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, third party industry quoted average list prices for NBSK pulp modestly increased in Europe and decreased in North America from the same quarter of 2023. Third party industry quoted average net prices for NBSK pulp in China decreased from the same quarter of 2023. Our average NBSK pulp sales realizations in the first quarter of 2024 decreased by approximately 14% to $732 per ADMT from $849 per ADMT in the same quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, average NBHK pulp sales realizations decreased by approximately 22% to $631 per ADMT from $809 per ADMT in the same quarter of 2023.\n\nTotal pulp sales volumes in the first quarter of 2024 increased by approximately 30% to 565,664 ADMTs from 435,973 ADMTs in the same quarter of 2023 primarily because of the sales timing and higher production.\n\nEnergy and chemical revenues in the first quarter of 2024 decreased by approximately 21% to $24.1 million from $30.7 million in the same quarter of 2023 due to lower sales realizations partially offset by higher sales volumes.\n\nCosts and expenses in the first quarter of 2024 increased by approximately 7% to $416.5 million from $388.0 million in the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher pulp sales volumes and the non-cash loss on disposal of the CPP joint venture investment partially offset by lower per unit fiber, chemical, energy and freight costs.\n\nOn average, in the first quarter of 2024, overall per unit fiber costs decreased by approximately 16% from the same quarter of 2023 due to lower per unit fiber costs at all our pulp mills as a result of stable supply. We currently expect per unit fiber costs to decrease in the second quarter of 2024 as a result of continued stable supply.\n\nSolid Wood\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, our solid wood segment had an operating loss of $13.7 million compared to $27.1 million in the same quarter of 2023 primarily because of lower per unit energy, fiber and freight costs partially offset by lower pallet sales realizations.\n\nSolid wood segment revenues in the first quarter of 2024 modestly decreased to $119.0 million from $121.0 million in the same quarter of 2023 as higher manufactured products and biofuel revenues were more than offset by lower revenues from other products.\n\nLumber revenues in the first quarter of 2024 decreased by approximately 7% to $55.9 million from $60.0 million in the same quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower sales volumes partially offset by higher sales realizations. Average lumber sales realizations in the first quarter of 2024 increased by approximately 7% to $460 per Mfbm from $429 per Mfbm in the same quarter of 2023 driven by stronger demand in the U.S. market. The U.S. market accounted for approximately 53% of our lumber revenues and approximately 43% of our lumber sales volumes in the first quarter of 2024. The majority of the balance of our lumber sales were to Europe.\n\nLumber sales volumes in the first quarter of 2024 decreased by approximately 13% to 121.4 MMfbm from 139.9 MMfbm in the same quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower production and sales timing.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, our mass timber business continued to ramp up operations and manufactured products revenues more than doubled to $16.7 million from $5.8 million in the same quarter of 2023. Manufactured products sales realizations increased to $3,644 per cubic meters in the first quarter of 2024 from $666 per cubic meters in the same quarter of 2023 as a result of higher CLT and glulam sales volumes, which generate higher sales realizations relative to other manufactured products.\n\nEnergy, biofuels and wood residuals revenues in the first quarter of 2024 modestly decreased to $18.4 million from $19.0 million in the same quarter of 2023 as a result of lower sales realizations partially offset by higher biofuel sales volumes.\n\nPallet revenues in the first quarter of 2024 decreased by approximately 23% to $28.0 million from $36.2 million in the same quarter of 2023 due to lower sales realizations and sales volumes as weak economic conditions in Europe negatively impacted demand.\n\nLumber production in the first quarter of 2024 decreased by approximately 5% to 127.0 MMfbm from 134.0 MMfbm in the same quarter of 2023 due to weak demand.\n\nFiber costs were approximately 75% of our lumber cash production costs in the first quarter of 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, per unit fiber costs for lumber production decreased by approximately 11% compared to the same quarter of 2023 because of continued stable supply. We currently expect modestly higher per unit fiber costs in the second quarter of 2024 driven by continued strong demand.\n\nLiquidity\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $274.3 million, approximately $280.6 million available under our revolving credit facilities and aggregate liquidity of about $554.9 million.\n\nThe following table is a summary of selected financial information as of the dates indicated:\n\nQuarterly Dividend\n\nA quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share will be paid on July 3, 2024 to all shareholders of record on June 26, 2024. Future dividends will be subject to Board approval and may be adjusted as business and industry conditions warrant.\n\nEarnings Release Call\n\nIn conjunction with this release, Mercer International Inc. will host a conference call, which will be simultaneously broadcast live over the Internet. Management will host the call, which is scheduled for May 10, 2024 at 10:00 AM ET. Listeners can access the conference call live and archived for 30 days over the Internet at https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/tdezetkf or through a link on the company's home page at https://www.mercerint.com. Please allow 15 minutes prior to the call to visit the website and download and install any necessary audio software.\n\nMercer International Inc. is a global forest products company with operations in Germany, USA and Canada with consolidated annual production capacity of 2.1 million tonnes of pulp, 960 million board feet of lumber, 210 thousand cubic meters of CLT, 45 thousand cubic meters of glulam, 17 million pallets and 230,000 metric tonnes of biofuels. To obtain further information on the company, please visit its website at https://www.mercerint.com.\n\nThe preceding includes forward looking statements which involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. Words such as \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"are optimistic that\", \"projects\", \"intends\", \"designed\", \"will\", \"believes\", \"estimates\", \"may\", \"could\" and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Among those factors which could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: the highly cyclical nature of our business, raw material costs, our level of indebtedness, competition, foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations, our use of derivatives, expenditures for capital projects, environmental regulation and compliance, disruptions to our production, market conditions and other risk factors listed from time to time in our SEC reports.\n\nOperating EBITDA is defined as operating loss plus depreciation and amortization and non-recurring capital asset impairment charges. Management uses Operating EBITDA as a benchmark measurement of its own operating results, and as a benchmark relative to its competitors. Management considers it to be a meaningful supplement to operating loss as a performance measure primarily because depreciation expense and non-recurring capital asset impairment charges are not an actual cash cost, and depreciation expense varies widely from company to company in a manner that management considers largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of our operating facilities. In addition, management believes Operating EBITDA is commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance.\n\nOperating EBITDA does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net loss, including financing costs and the effect of derivative instruments.

There was, however, a mixed performance across regions, with strong recoveries in North American demand and higher sales volumes in Europe, but lower sales volumes in South Africa owing to overstocked paper supply chains.\n\nSelling prices for packaging and speciality papers also came under pressure in the second half of the 2023 financial year and were 13% lower in the reporting quarter, compared with the same quarter of last year.\n\nBinnie says the group's cost savings were insufficient to offset the negative impact of lower selling prices in this segment, and therefore profitability declined.\n\nSappi's capital expenditure of $64-million in the reporting quarter was lower than that of the same quarter of last year owing to the phasing of capital spending for the Somerset PM2 conversion and expansion project, which will be completed by 2025.\n\nThe group's net debt increased by $150-million in the reporting quarter, compared with the prior comparable quarter, to $1.36-billion, owing to the cash used for the restructuring of the Stockstadt and Lanaken mills, but this was offset by a positive currency translation effect of $31-million - on the back of a stronger dollar on Sappi's euro-denominated debt.\n\nSappi had $392-million of cash on hand at the end of the quarter, as well as $662-million in committed unused revolving credit facilities in South Africa and Europe.\n\nThe group's Southern Africa division has subsequently refinanced a R1.5-billion public bond, which spreads the maturity profile of the division.\n\nThe bond has two sustainability key performance indicators, making it the first Sappi bond with such targets and successfully leveraging the benefits of its\n\nBinnie says the upcoming June quarter is generally the weakest in terms of seasonal demand for products; however, market sentiment continues to improve across all of Sappi's product segments.\n\nHe adds that the group is well positioned with cash and liquidity to manage the current market uncertainties.\n\nIn particular, Sappi expects a continued recovery in graphic paper demand in the next quarter, as well as strong demand for packaging and speciality paper in North America and South Africa. European market conditions, however, are expected to remain subdued owing to weak economic performance and low consumer confidence.\n\nBinnie warns that Sappi's profitability will suffer a $30-million impact in the next quarter, owing to scheduled maintenance shuts at the Saiccor and Somerset mills.\n\nThe group expects to spend $500-million in capital expenditure for the full 2024 financial year, including $154-million of spend on the Somerset PM2 project.\n\nEbitda in the coming quarter will likely be below that of the March quarter, but still higher than the June 2023 quarter.\n\nThe company remains committed to disciplined capital allocation as it works to reduce its exposure to graphic paper markets, while investing for growth in renewable packaging, DP and biomaterials.", "source":

(NASDAQ:MERC) experienced a 2.5% decline in its stock following the release of its first-quarter financial results, which revealed a larger-than-expected loss per share. The company reported a net loss of -$0.25 per share, falling short of the analyst consensus of -$0.12 per share. However, Mercer's revenue for the quarter exceeded expectations, coming in at $553 million compared to the projected $503 million.\n\nIn comparison to the first quarter of the previous year, Mercer's Operating EBITDA saw a substantial increase from $27.5 million to $63.6 million, driven by improving pulp markets and reduced costs. Despite the positive aspects of the report, the earnings miss prompted a negative response from investors, as reflected in the stock's downward movement.\n\nMercer's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Juan Carlos Bueno, commented on the quarter's performance, highlighting the influence of improved pulp and lumber pricing, as well as lower production costs, on the company's results. \"In the first quarter, our operating results were positively impacted by an improved pulp and lumber pricing environment, lower fiber and other production costs, and no planned maintenance downtime,\" Bueno stated.\n\nThe company's first-quarter revenue marked a 6% increase from the $522.7 million reported in the same period last year. This growth was primarily attributed to higher pulp sales volumes, which offset lower pulp sales realizations.\n\nMercer's pulp segment operating income rose by approximately 36% to $17.4 million from the same quarter last year, mainly due to lower per unit fiber and other production costs, higher sales volumes, and lower freight costs. These positive factors were partially offset by lower sales realizations and a non-cash loss on the disposal of the CPP joint venture investment.\n\nLooking ahead, Mercer anticipates pulp pricing to continue improving in the second quarter of 2024, led by Europe and North America, due to stronger demand and global supply constraints. However, the company expects lumber prices to remain generally flat in the second quarter as demand continues to be affected by high interest rates and economic uncertainty.\n\nThe company's liquidity remains strong, with cash and cash equivalents of $274.3 million and approximately $280.6 million available under its revolving credit facilities, totaling about $554.9 million in aggregate liquidity.\n\nMercer International Inc. is a global forest products company with a diverse product range, including pulp, lumber, and biofuels.

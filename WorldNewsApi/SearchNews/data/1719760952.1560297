{"id": 225034652, "title": "New Moseley pub will be 'cheaper than Wetherspoons' as boss says 'we're nothing fancy", "text": "A new pub is set to open in the heart of Moseley offering beer that's 'cheaper than Wetherspoons'. One of the bosses of the new Pub at Moseley, where Bohemian was on Alcester Road, says that he's passing the good prices he gets from the brewery to customers as his family-run brand expands from two pubs to three. Ollie Pearce and his two brothers opened The Pub at Kings Heath in June 2021 before opening their second location in Bearwood. The family says that the company will stick to its ethos of being family-friendly at the new branch, stating 'we're nothing fancy'. The pub plans to open on June 6 and hopes to launch its food menu in the summer. Then they'll serve 'good wholesome English fare, like Sunday roasts', director Ollie told us.

Our beer is always really good, the glassware is always clean, we just do the fundamentals really well. \"Because we're quite well established and have been for a number of years, we demand good prices from the brewery and we always pass that on to our customers, always.\" Ollie said that the pub brand planned to open up a branch in Harborne but that the closure of the Bohemian in Moseley offered an opportunity to move into the trendy village. The pub will be offering something that is a little bit harder to come by in the cool neighbourhood. \"We're going to have a dart board!\" Ollie said. \"Where else in Moseley has a dart board?\" He added: \"Our prices will be cheaper than Wetherspoons but we're not them, we'll have live entertainment on at weekends. We're not going to be a late night venue, we want it to be a family venue and it'll be child friendly. They can come in until 9pm, bring your family, we're happy to have you. We want to be closed by midnight, we don't want the trouble that comes with opening later. \"We're nothing fancy, we're just a nicely done-out family local pub and families are very much welcome. We're going to have singers and bands on, a bit of rock n roll or whatever people want. \"We already get people from Moseley coming to our Kings Heath site because they don't want to go in Wetherspoons as there's nothing there for them. They can't have the horse racing on the TV. \"We've already spoken to William Hill over the road and the old boys are welcome to come in and get betting slips and have a pint and a little bet. We just want to be a part of the community.\" As well as beers like Carling, Stella, Guinness, Strongbow, Madri and Greene King brands, The Pub at Moseley will serve its own blonde beer as well as its our own-brand lager.", "summary": "Pub at Moseley in Alcester Road will have big brand beers, live entertainment and a dart board", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/new-moseley-pub-cheaper-wetherspoons-29256630", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/article29258467.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_IMG-20240528-WA0000.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:33:39", "author": "Kirsty Bosley", "authors": ["Kirsty Bosley"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.171}

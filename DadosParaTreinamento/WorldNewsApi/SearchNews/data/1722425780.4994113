Bouchard was wrapped up in a viral bet in 2017 when she made a deal with a fan. If the Atlanta Falcons lost the Super Bowl to the New England Patriots, they would go out on a date. They did just that. Bouchard also leveraged her tennis career into an appearance in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.

We\u2019re wearing tank tops. It\u2019s fun to turn on the TV and watch that. \"Right away, I was able to get great marketing deals off the court. Being asked to be in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition a few times. Exploring that path was definitely on my to-do list. It\u2019s definitely part of who I am because I think it\u2019s great.\" PAIGE LORENZE, GIRLFRIEND OF TOMMY PAUL, DRAWS IRE FROM FANS AFTER TENNIS STAR'S TOURNAMENT WIN Bouchard added that she found herself increasingly enjoying that attention and began to explore the idea of coming out of her shell. \"Just increasing my fan base, my audience, which, in turn, helps me get better brand deals, better endorsements. Not just in a personal way for me, \u2018OK I can actually make more money out of this,\u2019 but in a general sense. \u2018OK, we have someone who is maybe a casual fan who is going to come to the Miami Open to watch me play.\u2019 That\u2019s good for tennis in general, for female tennis, for women\u2019s sports. That\u2019s good for everything.\" Bouchard, 30, is now ranked No. 522 in the WTA. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She recently reached the quarterfinals of the ITF/USTA W75.

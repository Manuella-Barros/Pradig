Image credit: ACC Media\n\nDefending champions India began their 2024 Women's Asia Cup T20 tournament campaign with a clinical seven-wicket win over arch-rivals Pakistan in a Group A match in Dambulla on Friday. After Pakistan won the toss and opted to bat, India saw off their rivals for 108 in 19.2 overs.\n\nIn reply, Shafali Verma (40) abnd Smriti Mandhana (45) played vital knocks to guide the Women in Blue home with 35 balls to spare.\n\nIt was an aggressive display of batting from both the Indian openers as they mostly dealt in fours and sixes. The duo of Mandhana and Shafali hit two fours and a six off Tuba Hassan to collect 15 runs in the sixth over.\n\nThe seventh over bowled by Hassan yielded 21 runs with Mandhana hitting the bowler for five boundaries. Pakistan finally tasted success in the 10th over in the form of Mandhana who was caught by Aliya Riaz at mid-wicket off the bowling of Syeda Aroob Shah.\n\nShafali departed in the 12th over, but by then, she and Mandhana had already done the damage. Dayalan Hemalatha (14) didn't last long, caught by Hassan off Nashra Sandhu.\n\nSkipper Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues then ensured a comfortable win for the title holders. Earlier, India dished out a fine effort led by experienced off-spinner Deepti Sharma (3/20).\n\nIndia tasted their first success in the second over itself when pacer Pooja Vastrakar (2/31) dismissed Gull Feroza, caught by skipper Harmanpreet at mid-on.\n\nVastrakar struck again, dismissing the other Pakistan opener Muneeba Ali with a short-pitched delivery, caught by Rodrigues at cover, reducing Pakistan to 26 for 2 after the fourth over. The Indians didn't allow Pakistani batters to settle down as off-spinner Shyreyanka Patil (2/14) packed off Riaz, caught by Rodrigues at mid-wicket.\n\nThe Pakistani batters struggled to score runs, let alone build partnerships as Indian bowlers continued to pick up wickets at regular intervals to derail their opponents.\n\nThe next to depart was Pakistan skipper Nida Dar who holed out to Hemalatha at long-on off the bowling of Deepti as the batter went for her customary heave over the straight boundary.\n\nIt was raining wickets for India as pacer Renuka Singh (2/14) struck twice in the last two deliveries of her spell. Renuka first accounted for Sidra Amin (25) and then trapped Iram Javed leg before in the next ball to reduce Pakistan to 61 for 6 in 13 overs.\n\nThereafter Tuba Hassan (22) and Fatima Sana (22 not out) stitched together a valuable 31-run stand for the seventh wicket to take Pakistan forward.\n\nBut their partnership came to an end in the 18th over when Hassan was caught by Radha Yadav at backward point off Deepti. The 18th over bowled by Deepti saw three dismissals -- Hassan, Syeda Aroob Shah and Nashra Sandhu.\n\nWhile Hassan and Sandhu fell to Deepti, Shah was run out, denying the India spinner a hat-trick. Sana hammered left-arm spinner Radha for two sixes in the 19th over to take Pakistan over the 100-run mark.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors":

Both batters were able to add on just 15 runs before Shefali was sent back to the dressing room in the 12th over after scoring 40 runs from 29 balls with the help of six fours and a six in her inning.\n\nAfter Shefali's wicket, India's score was 100/2 in 11.4 overs. Team skipper Harmanpreet came next to bat in the middle.\n\nThe third wicket fell at the score of 102, as Hemalatha was dismissed after scoring just 14 runs which included three fours in her innings.\n\nJemimah Rodrigues came next to the crease to bat along with the captain.\n\nJemimah and Harmanpreet remained unbeaten and guided India to victory with seven wickets in hand and 5.5 overs remaining in the innings.\n\nFor Women in Green, two wickets were snapped by Syeda Aroob Shah in her spell of three overs where she conceded just nine runs. One wicket was bagged by Nashra Sandhu in her spell of four overs where she conceded 20 runs.\n\nEarlier in the day, after electing to bat first, Pakistan was off to a poor start. Pacer Pooja Vastrakar struck in the second over, dismissing Gull Ferokha for five in five balls, with a fine running catch by skipper Harmanpreet Kaur. Pakistan was 9/1 in 1.4 overs.\n\nMuneeba Ali and Sidra Ameen tried to let their hands loose, smashing some boundaries against the Indian pace attack. But their hitting did not last for long, as Jemimah Rodrigues took a fine catch in the cover region to give Vastrakar her second scalp. Muneeba was gone for 11 in 11 balls, with two fours. Pakistan was 26/2 in 3.5 overs.\n\nAmeen and Aliya Riaz took Pakistan through the remainder of the powerplay unscathed, ending the six overs at 37/2, with Ameen (15*) and Riaz (5*) unbeaten.Spinner Shreyanka Patil put an end to their partnership before it could blossom, with Jemimah taking another great catch at mid-wicket to remove Riaz for six runs in 11 balls. Pakistan was 41/3 in 7.5 overs.\n\nA fine reverse sweep in short third region for four by Ameen helped Pakistan reach the 50-run mark in 9.2 overs.\n\nHalfway through the innings, Pakistan was at 53/3, with Ameen (24*) joined by skipper Nida Dar (4*). Indian bowlers had done a fine job containing the run flow.\n\nIn the second half, India continued to squeeze Pakistan's run-rate, with Deepti Sharma picking up skipper Nida for just eight runs in 11 balls, while Sidra's resistance was ended by pacer Renuka Singh, with Radha Yadav taking a catch at backward point to dismiss her for 25 in 35 balls, with three fours. In the same over, Renuka trapped leg-before wicket Iram Javed for a golden duck. Pakistan was 61/6 in 13 overs.\n\nFatima Sana and Tuba Hassan succeeded in stitching the first partnership of the game, which touched the 20-run mark at least. Tuba managed to get some boundaries, much-needed for his side.\n\nDeepti ended their promising partnership at 31 runs, removing Tuba for 22 in 19 balls, with three fours, with Radha getting the catch at backward point. Pakistan was 92/7 in 17.1 overs. In the same over, Radha ran out Syeda Aroob Shah for two runs. Pakistan was 94/8 in 17.4 overs.\n\nNashra Sandhu was caught behind by Richa Ghosh on the fifth ball of this highly productive over by Deepti for a golden duck. Pakistan was 94/9 in 17.5 overs. Deepti got her third wicket.\n\nPakistan reached the 100-run mark in 18.4 overs, with a six from Fatima Sana.\n\nShreyanka took the final wicket, removing Sadia Iqbal for a duck. Pakistan was all out for 108 in 19.2 overs. Fatima was unbeaten at 22* in 16 balls, with a four and two sixes.\n\nDeepti (3/20), Renuka (2/14), Shreyanka (2/14) and Pooja (2/31) were the top bowlers for India.\n\nBrief Score: India 109 for 3 (Mandhana 45, Shafali 40, Syeda 2-9) beat Pakistan 108 (Sidra 25, Deepti 3-20, Renuka 2-14, Shreyanka 2-14, Vastrakar 2-31) by seven wickets.

India started their Women's T20 Asia Cup title defence on a rousing note, demolishing arch-foes Pakistan by seven wickets here on Friday.\n\nIndia bundled out Pakistan for a below-par 108 after being asked to bowl and then chased down the target with as many as 35 balls remaining.\n\nAlso Read | India Beat Pakistan By 7 Wickets in Women's Asia Cup T20 2024; Bowlers Star as Harmanpreet Kaur and Co Get Off to Winning Start.\n\nChasing 109, Indian openers Shafali Verma (40) and Smriti Mandhana (45) was at their best as they toyed with the Pakistani attack from the word go.\n\nIt was an aggressive display of batting from both the Indian openers as they mostly dealt in fours and sixes.\n\nAlso Read | IND-W Win By Seven Wickets | India vs Pakistan Highlights of Women's Asia Cup T20 2024: Bowlers, Shafali Verma, Smriti Mandhana Shine As Women in Blue Achieve Dominant Start.\n\nThe duo of Mandhana and Shafali hit two fours and a six off Tuba Hassan to collect 15 runs in the sixth over.\n\nThe seventh over bowled by Hassan yielded 21 runs with Mandhana hitting the bowler for five boundaries.\n\nPakistan finally tasted success in the 10th over in the form of Mandhana who was caught by Aliya Riaz at mid-wicket off the bowling of Syeda Aroob Shah.\n\nShafali departed in the 12th over, but by then, she and Mandhana had already done the damage.\n\nDayalan Hemalatha (14) didn't last long, caught by Hassan off Nashra Sandhu.\n\nSkipper Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues then ensured a comfortable win for the title holders.\n\nEarlier, India dished out a fine effort led by experienced off-spinner Deepti Sharma (3/20).\n\nIndia, after being asked to bowl first, tasted their first success in the second over itself when pacer Pooja Vastrakar (2/31) dismissed Gull Feroza, caught by skipper Harmanpreet at mid-on.\n\nVastrakar struck again, dismissing the other Pakistan opener Muneeba Ali with a short-pitched delivery, caught by Rodrigues at cover, reducing Pakistan to 26 for 2 after the fourth over.\n\nThe Indians didn't allow Pakistani batters to settle down as off-spinner Shyreyanka Patil (2/14) packed off Riaz, caught by Rodrigues at mid-wicket.\n\nThe Pakistani batters struggled to score runs, let alone build partnerships as Indian bowlers continued to pick up wickets at regular intervals to derail their opponents.\n\nThe next to depart was Pakistan skipper Nida Dar who holed out to Hemalatha at long-on off the bowling of Deepti as the batter went for her customary heave over the straight boundary.\n\nIt was raining wickets for India as pacer Renuka Singh (2/14) struck twice in the last two deliveries of her spell.\n\nRenuka first accounted for Sidra Amin (25) and then trapped Iram Javed leg before in the next ball to reduce Pakistan to 61 for 6 in 13 overs.\n\nThereafter Tuba Hassan (22) and Fatima Sana (22 not out) stitched together a valuable 31-run stand for the seventh wicket to take Pakistan forward.\n\nBut their partnership came to an end in the 18th over when Hassan was caught by Radha Yadav at backward point off Deepti.\n\nThe 18th over bowled by Deepti saw three dismissals -- Hassan, Syeda Aroob Shah and Nashra Sandhu.\n\nWhile Hassan and Sandhu fell to Deepti, Shah was run out, denying the India spinner a hat-trick.\n\nSana hammered left-arm spinner Radha for two sixes in the 19th over to take Pakistan over the 100-run

Pacer Pooja Vastrakar struck in the second over, dismissing Gull Ferokha for five in five balls, with a fine running catch by skipper Harmanpreet Kaur. Pakistan was 9/1 in 1.4 overs.\n\nMuneeba Ali and Sidra Ameen tried to let their hands loose, smashing some boundaries against the Indian pace attack. But their hitting did not last for long, as Jemimah Rodrigues took a fine catch in the cover region to give Vastrakar her second scalp. Muneeba was gone for 11 in 11 balls, with two fours. Pakistan was 26/2 in 3.5 overs.\n\nAmeen and Aliya Riaz took Pakistan through the remainder of the powerplay unscathed, ending the six overs at 37/2, with Ameen (15*) and Riaz (5*) unbeaten.\n\nSpinner Shreyanka Patil put an end to their partnership before it could blossom, with Jemimah taking another great catch at mid-wicket to remove Riaz for six runs in 11 balls. Pakistan was 41/3 in 7.5 overs.\n\nA fine reverse sweep in short third region for four by Ameen helped Pakistan reach the 50-run mark in 9.2 overs.\n\nHalfway through the innings, Pakistan was at 53/3, with Ameen (24*) joined by skipper Nida Dar (4*). Indian bowlers had done a fine job containing the run flow.\n\nIn the second half, India continued to squeeze Pakistan's run-rate, with Deepti Sharma picking up skipper Nida for just eight runs in 11 balls, while Sidra's resistance was ended by pacer Renuka Singh, with Radha Yadav taking a catch at backward point to dismiss her for 25 in 35 balls, with three fours. In the same over, Renuka trapped leg-before wicket Iram Javed for a golden duck. Pakistan was 61/6 in 13 overs.\n\nFatima Sana and Tuba Hassan succeeded in stitching the first partnership of the game, which touched the 20-run mark at least. Tuba managed to get some boundaries, much-needed for his side.\n\nDeepti ended their promising partnership at 31 runs, removing Tuba for 22 in 19 balls, with three fours, with Radha getting the catch at backward point. Pakistan was 92/7 in 17.1 overs. In the same over, Radha ran out Syeda Aroob Shah for two runs. Pakistan was 94/8 in 17.4 overs.\n\nNashra Sandhu was caught behind by Richa Ghosh on the fifth ball of this highly productive over by Deepti for a golden duck. Pakistan was 94/9 in 17.5 overs. Deepti got her third wicket.\n\nPakistan reached the 100-run mark in 18.4 overs, with a six from Fatima Sana.\n\nShreyanka took the final wicket, removing Sadia Iqbal for a duck. Pakistan was all out for 108 in 19.2 overs. Fatima was unbeaten at 22* in 16 balls, with a four and two sixes.\n\nDeepti (3/20), Renuka (2/14), Shreyanka (2/14) and Pooja (2/31) were the top bowlers for India.

Both batters, Mandhana and Shafali, played their shorts, whether it was against the seamer or spinner.\n\nBoth players brought up the team's fifty in 5.2 overs as Mandhana slammed a boundary on the bowling of leg-spinner Tuba Hassan.\n\nThe Harmanpreet Kaur-led side lost the first wicket in the 10th over as Mandhana was sent back to the pavilion after scoring 45 runs off 31 balls, which was laced with nine boundaries.\n\nFollowing Mandhana's departure, right hand batter Dayalan Hemalatha came out to bat along with Shafali.

Pacer Pooja Vastrakar struck in the second over, dismissing Gull Ferokha for five in five balls, with a fine running catch by skipper Harmanpreet Kaur. Pakistan was 9/1 in 1.4 overs.\n\nMuneeba Ali and Sidra Ameen tried to let their hands loose, smashing some boundaries against the Indian pace attack.

Indian bowlers had done a fine job containing the run flow.\n\nIn the second half, India continued to squeeze Pakistan's run-rate, with Deepti Sharma picking up skipper Nida for just eight runs in 11 balls, while Sidra's resistance was ended by pacer Renuka Singh, with Radha Yadav taking a catch at backward point to dismiss her for 25 in 35 balls, with three fours.

"Blues chase down 109-run target in just 14.1 overs as Pakistan women see bad start\n\nIndia women's cricket team thrashed Pakistan by seven wickets in their first match of the Women's Asia Cup 2024, that took place at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, Sri Lanka on Friday.\n\nThe Indian team continued to remain at the top of their game with the bat as they chased down the 109-run target in just 14.1 overs without much trouble after dominance with the ball.\n\nShafali Verma (40 off 29) and Smriti Mandhana (45 off 31) put India on top as the two combined for 85 runs before the latter was dismissed by Aroob Shah.\n\nAfter losing the openers and Dayalan Hemalatha (14 off 11), skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues came to bat and completed the job for the team.\n\nOpting to bat first, Pakistan didn't have a great start as they had lost both of their openers -- Gull Feroza and Muneeba Ali -- after posting just five and 11 runs respectively, leaving their team at 26-2 in 3.5 overs.\n\nSidra Amin played valiantly but she got no support from the other hand as skipper Nida Dar (8 off 11) and Aliya Riaz (6 off 11) failed to contribute any valuable runs.\n\nAfter scoring 22 runs on 35 balls, Amin lost her wicket after which Tuba Hassan took charge of Pakistan's innings and played a quick 22-run knock on 19 balls with three boundaries.\n\nIndian bowlers' dominance made it nearly impossible for the Pakistani batters to score big runs and it looked that the Blues may restrict their opponents within the 100-run mark but Fatima Sana's late 16-ball 22-run knock helped the Green Shirts score 108 runs before being all out in 19.2 overs.\n\nFor India, Deepti Sharma picked three while Renuka Singh, Pooja Vastrakar and Shreyanka Patil bagged two wickets each.\n\nIndia:

"National women's team experiences bad start as Blues chase down 109-run target in just 14.1 overs\n\nIndia women's cricket team inflicted a humiliating 7-run defeat on Pakistan in their first match at the Women's Asia Cup 2024, played at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, Sri Lanka on Friday.\n\nWithout much trouble after dominance with the ball, the Indian team continued to remain at the top of their game with the bat as they chased down the 109-run target in just 14.1 overs.\n\nShafali Verma (40 off 29) and Smriti Mandhana (45 off 31) put India on top as the two combined for 85 runs before the latter was dismissed by Aroob Shah.\n\nAfter losing the openers and Dayalan Hemalatha (14 off 11), skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues came to bat and completed the job for the team.\n\nOpting to bat first, Pakistan didn't have a great start as they had lost both of their openers -- Gull Feroza and Muneeba Ali -- after posting just five and 11 runs respectively, leaving their team at 26-2 in 3.5 overs.\n\nSidra Amin played valiantly but she got no support from the other hand as skipper Nida Dar (8 off 11) and Aliya Riaz (6 off 11) failed to contribute any valuable runs.\n\nAfter scoring 22 runs on 35 balls, Amin lost her wicket after which Tuba Hassan took charge of Pakistan's innings and played a quick 22-run knock on 19 balls with three boundaries.\n\nIndian bowlers' dominance made it nearly impossible for the Pakistani batters to score big runs and it looked that the Blues may restrict their opponents within the 100-run mark but Fatima Sana's late 16-ball 22-run knock helped the Green Shirts score 108 runs before being all out in 19.2 overs.\n\nFor India, Deepti Sharma picked three while Renuka Singh, Pooja Vastrakar and Shreyanka Patil bagged two wickets each.\n\nIndia: Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Dayalan Hemalatha, Harmanpreet Kaur (c), Jemimah Rodrigues, Richa Ghosh (wk), Deepti Sharma, Pooja Vastrakar, Radha Yadav, Shreyanka Patil,

After bowling out Pakistan for just 108 runs, the defending champions chased down the total in just 14.1 overs by losing 3 wickets.\n\nPakistan captain Nida Dar won the toss and opted to bat first but she and her teammates failed to justify the decision. Pakistan were bowled out for just 108 runs in 19.2 overs. Not a single Pakistan batter could touch the 30-run mark while 7 of them could not even reach double digits.\n\nFast-bowler Pooja Vastrakar gave India a flying start by sending back both the Pakistan openers inside the powerplay. She first dismissed Gull Feroza for 5 before dismissing Muneeba Ali for 11 to reduce Pakistan to 26 for 2 in the fifth over.\n\nPakistan just kept losing wickets at regular intervals after the departure of the openers. At one stage, they were reeling at 61 for 6 and even the 100-run mark looked implausible. However, Tuba Hassan and Fatima Sana shared a 31-run stand to provide some respectability to the scoreboard.\n\nDeepti Sharma broke the stand by dismissing Hassan for 22. Sana, on the other hand, remained unbeaten on 22 to take her team to a 100-plus total. For India, Sharma starred with the ball, taking 3 wickets while Vastrakar, Renuka Singh, and Shreyanka Patil picked up 2 wickets each. Sidra Ameen top-scored for Pakistan, scoring 25 off 35 balls.\n\nIn reply, India chased down the total inside 15 overs to get off to a winning start. Pakistan's only chance of clawing their way back into the game was to take early wickets but their hopes were dashed by India openers Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma.\n\nThe duo gave India a solid start with the bat. At the end of the powerplay, India had raced away to 57 runs with Mandhana on 22 and Verma on 35. The partnership finally came to an end in the 10th over when Syeda Aroob Shah dismissed Mandhana for 45.\n\nLater in the 12th over, Shah dismissed Verma too for 40 before Dayalan Hemalathan departed as well. Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues then took India home in the 15th over.\n\nHere are some of the reactions to India's clinical victory over Pakistan:\n\nIndia will be taking on UAE in their next game while Pakistan will be locking horns against Nepal.

In reply, Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana shared an 85-run opening stand off just 57 balls and propelled India to chase down the total effortlessly. Shafali (45) and Smriti (40) feasted on loose bowling from Pakistan and hit boundaries aplenty to ensure India chased down the total with seven wickets in hand and 35 balls remaining. The Power-play phase summed up the result: Pakistan lost three wickets, while India didn't lose any.\n\nChasing 109, Shafali began by whipping Sadia Iqbal for a four through a deep backward square leg fence, while Smriti started with an easy flick off Fatima Sana for a boundary. Shafali pulled and cut Sadia for two easy boundaries, before welcoming Nida Dar with a sweep through square-leg for four.\n\nSmriti went on the backfoot to punch wide of cover-point and pick a boundary, followed by Shafali lofting and leaning forward to unleash a copybook straight drive off Fatima for a brace of fours. Smriti welcomed Tuba Hassan with a punch and pull to take two fours, followed by Shafali sweeping powerfully for a six as India ended the Power-play at 57/0. Tuba came under further attack in the eighth over as Smriti swept her for four more, followed by her lofting twice, paddling and flicking with immaculate ease to take four more boundaries as 21 runs came off the over. From there, the lone academic interest in the game was who would reach their half-century first.\n\nBut Smriti fell five runs short of her fifty when she didn't get the elevation on a lofted shot and was caught by mid-wicket taking the catch in front of her face. Dayalan Hemalatha, back at number three, hit a hat-trick of boundaries off Nashra Sandhu.\n\nLike Smriti, Shafali didn't reach her fifty as Syeda Aroob Shah castled her through the gate for 40. Nashra came back to have Hemalatha mistime her loft and be caught at cover-point. Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues knocked off the remaining runs to get India's campaign off to a winning start.\n\nEarlier, Deepti bowled well in the middle overs to be the pick of India's bowlers. For Pakistan, it was a disappointing batting performance where they struggled to get and maintain a steady tempo in their innings, resulting in only four batters touching double figures. The lack of partnerships and being unable to rotate strike often meant they were unable to break free from the pressure imposed by the Indian bowlers, as Pakistan lost their last six wickets for 47 runs.\n\nElecting to bat first, Pakistan suffered an early jolt when Gull Feroza's top edge on the pull was caught by mid-on off Pooja. The all-rounder returned in the fourth over to claim Muneeba Ali with another short ball which she miscued to cover.\n\nPost the Power-play, there was no end to Pakistan's woes as Shreyanka got a loopy off-break to dip in and take the leading edge off Aliya Riaz's flick to mid-wicket. After Nida Dar holed out to long-on off Deepti, things went from bad to worse for Pakistan as Renuka had Sidra Amin slicing to backward point and Iram Javed trapped lbw on consecutive deliveries.\n\nTuba stepped up to hit three boundaries in her 19-ball 22, before slicing off Deepti to backward point in the 18th over, followed by the off-spinner having Nashra nicking behind after Aroob was run out.\n\nFatima took Pakistan past the 100-run mark by slog-sweeping Radha Yadav for a brace of sixes. But Shreyanka ended Pakistan's innings by castling Sadia as they folded up for 108 with four balls left unused.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nPakistan 108 all out in 19.2 overs (Sidra Amin 25; Deepti Sharma 3-20, Renuka Singh Thakur 2-14) lost to India 112/3 in 14.1 overs (Smriti Mandhana 45, Shafali Verma 40; Syeda Aroob Shah 2-9, Nashra Sandhu 1-20) by seven wickets", "source": {"uri":

For Pakistan, it was a disappointing batting performance where they struggled to get a steady tempo in their innings. The lack of partnerships and being unable to rotate strike often meant they were unable to break free from the pressure imposed by the Indian bowlers, as Pakistan lost their last six wickets for 47 runs. It meant that only four Pakistan batters were able to touch double figures.\n\nElecting to bat first, Pakistan suffered an early jolt when Gull Feroza's top edge on the pull was caught by mid-on off Pooja Vastrakar. The all-rounder returned in the fourth over to claim Muneeba Ali with another short ball which she miscued to cover.\n\nPost the Power-play, there was no end to Pakistan's woes as Shreyanka got a loopy off-break to dip in and take the leading edge off Aliya Riaz's flick to mid-wicket. After Nida Dar holed out to long-on off Deepti, things went from bad to worse for Pakistan as Renuka had Sidra Amin slicing to backward point and Iram Javed trapped lbw on consecutive deliveries.\n\nTuba Hassan stepped up to hit three boundaries in her 19-ball 22, before slicing off Deepti to backward point in the 18th over, followed by the off-spinner having Nashra Sandhu nicking behind after Syeda Aroob Shah was run out.\n\nFatima Sana took Pakistan past the 100-run mark by slog-sweeping Radha Yadav for a brace of sixes. But Shreyanka ended Pakistan's innings by castling Sadia Iqbal as they folded up for 108 with four balls left unused.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nPakistan 108 all out in 19.2 overs (Sidra Amin 25; Deepti Sharma 3-20, Renuka Singh Thakur 2-14) against India", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dambulla", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dambulla"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dambulla"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooja_Vastrakar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pooja Vastrakar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepti_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deepti Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull_Feroza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gull Feroza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renuka_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renuka Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muneeba_Ali", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muneeba Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuba_Hassan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuba Hassan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadia_Iqbal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sadia Iqbal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syeda_Aroob_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syeda Aroob Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima_Sana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatima Sana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iram_Javed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iram Javed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliya_Riaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliya Riaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashra_Sandhu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashra Sandhu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radha_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radha Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nida_Dar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nida Dar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/202407193190169.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747444", "eventUri": "eng-9747444", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 17}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Pakistan won the toss and chose to bat first, but their innings faltered early. Despite a resilient knock from Sidra Ameen, who scored 25 runs off 35 balls with 3 boundaries, Pakistan were bowled out for a modest total of 108 runs in 19.2 overs. Tuba Hassan and Sana Fatima chipped in with 22 runs each, adding some respectability to the total.\n\nIndia's bowlers put on an impressive show, with Deepti Sharma leading the charge. Deepti took 3 wickets for 20 runs in her 4 overs, ably supported by Renuka Thakur and Shreyanka Patil, who both picked up 2 wickets each. Renuka was particularly economical, conceding just 14 runs in her 4 overs, while Patil's 3.2 overs cost only 14 runs as well. Pooja Vastrakar also contributed with 2 wickets, despite being a bit expensive, conceding 31 runs in her 4 overs.\n\nChasing a target of 109, India Women got off to a flying start with their openers, Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana, laying a solid foundation. Shafali played an aggressive innings, scoring 40 runs off 29 balls with 6 fours and a six. Mandhana was equally impressive, crafting a well-paced 45 runs off 31 balls, hitting 9 boundaries. Their partnership set the tone for the chase, making it difficult for Pakistan's bowlers to contain the flow of runs.\n\nDespite a couple of quick wickets towards the end, including captain Harmanpreet Kaur for 5 runs and Jemimah Rodrigues for 3, India comfortably reached the target in 14.1 overs. Syeda Aroob Shah was the pick of the Pakistan bowlers, taking 2 wickets for just 9 runs in her 3 overs, but it wasn't enough to turn the tide.\n\nIndia's dominant performance, both with the ball and the bat, showcased their superiority and strategic execution. With this win, they have made a strong statement in the tournament, underlining their quest for the Women's Asia Cup T20 2024 title.", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "akshat_gaur@crickettimes.com", "name": "Akshat Gaur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_women's_national_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India women's national cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuba_Hassan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tuba Hassan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidra_Ameen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sidra Ameen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_women's_national_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan women's national cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Asia_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's Asia Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangiri_Dambulla_International_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafali_Verma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shafali Verma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooja_Vastrakar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pooja Vastrakar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smriti_Mandhana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smriti Mandhana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepti_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deepti Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Kaur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Kaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemimah_Rodrigues", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jemimah Rodrigues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/IWCC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/IWCC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/India-women-beat-Pakistan-women-in-Asia-Cup-2024.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747444", "eventUri": "eng-9747444", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Openers Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana tore apart the Pakistani bowling attack, putting their team on course for a comfortable win.\n\nScorecard\n\nBoth batters feasted on the loose deliveries, finding the boundary with regularity. It seemed a 10-wicket win was on the cards, but a late flurry of wickets - two for young leg-spinner Syeda Aroob Shah and one for Nashra Sandhu - prevented a complete clean sweep.\n\nAll three Indian dismissals were in pursuit of quick runs. The Pakistani bowlers struggled with their line and length on a good batting wicket, consistently offering width and short deliveries that the Indian openers happily dispatched.\n\nIMAGE: Jemimah Rodrigues celebrates after her catch which dismissed Muneeba Ali.

Photograph: ACC / X\n\nThe Indians didn't allow Pakistani batters to settle down as off-spinner Shyreyanka Patil (2/14) packed off Aliya Riaz, caught by Rodrigues at mid-wicket.\n\nThe Pakistani batters struggled to score runs, let alone building partnerships as Indian bowlers continued to pick up wickets at regular intervals to derail their opponents.\n\nThe next to depart was Pakistan skipper Nida Dar who was holed out to Dayalan Hemalatha at long-on off the bowling of Deepti as the batter went for her customary huge heave over the straight boundary.\n\nIt was raining wickets for India as pacer Renuka Singh (2/14) struck twice in the last two deliveries of her spell.\n\nRenuka first accounted for Sidra Amin (25) and then trapped Iram Javed leg before in the next ball to reduce Pakistan to 61 for 6 in 13 overs.\n\nThereafter Tuba Hassan (22) and Fatima Sana (22 not out) stitched together a valuable 31-run stand for the seventh wicket to take Pakistan forward.\n\nBut their partnership finally came to an end in the 18th over when Hassan was caught by Radha Yadav at backward point off Deepti.\n\nIMAGE: Pakistan batters underperformed and failed to build any lasting partnerships.

Pakistan batters with ease to cruise to a dominant 7-wicket win over Pakistan women in their campaign opener at the Women's Asia Cup 2024 on Friday.\n\nOpting to bat first, Pakistan were bowled out for 108 with experienced spinner Deepti Sharma (3/20) emerging as the most successful bowler.\n\nRenuka Singh (2/14) and Pooja Vastrakar (2/31) also chipped in with wickets at crucial juncture to keep Pakistan on a tight leash through their innings.\n\nVastrakar started off the proceedings, scalping two wickets in her first two overs, as Pakistan slumped to abysmal start.\n\nDespite the regular fall of wicket, a spirited effort from Sidra Ameen ensured that Pakistan stayed in the game, as the Women in Green were led to a fairly good position by 11 overs, standing at 57/3.\n\nBut, then disaster struck in the form of Renuka Singh, who removed Ameen and Iram Javed in back-to-back deliveries to push Pakistan on the backfoot.\n\nAn unlikely fight though ensued from the likes of Tuba Hassan next, who alongside Fatima Sana, put up a 31-ruin partnership to steer their side away from utter embarrassment.\n\nBut, in came Deepti Sharma to wreak havoc next, as three wickets fell in the 18th over, and eventually Shreyanka wrapped up the endeavour to bowl Pakistan out for just 108 runs.\n\nIn reply, the opening duo of Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma piled on misery, putting on 85 runs in 9.1 overs.\n\nBut then, a spirited fight from spinner Syeda Shah, accompanied by an effort from Nashra Sandhu, saw the Women in Green claim some redemption, as Syeda scalped both openers in her three-over spell of 2/9.\n\nBut, India got over the hurdle in due time, in the 15th over, with Jemimah Rodrigues sweeping away Sadia Iqbal for a boundary to seal the 7-wicket win.", "source":

Deepti Sharma picked up 3 wickets while Shreyanka Patil got 2 as the much changed Pakistan team were bundled out for 108 runs in their innings. Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana's 85-run stand off 57 balls set the tone for the win on Friday.\n\nPakistan had won the toss and made the decision to bat first on the day. The decision quickly seemed to be a poor one as Pakistan struggled to get going in the early goings of the match as Pooja Vastrakar struck twice in as many overs to dismiss both the openers with just 26 runs on the board from 4 overs.\n\nIND vs PAK, Women's Asia Cup 2024: Highlights\n\nSidra Ameen would show her resilience with the bat, but Aliya Riaz and captain Nida Dar failed to make any impact with the bat as Pakistan found themselves struggling. Renuka would return to dismiss Ameen and Javed off consecutive deliveries as Pakistan were reduced to 61 for 6 in 13 overs.\n\nTuba Hassan and Fatima Sana would steady the ship with a partnership of 31 runs but Deepti Sharma's golden arm would change things in the 18th over. The spinner picked up 2 wickets and a run out was also inflicted in the over as Pakistan were reduced to 94 for 9.\n\nSana ensured they got past the 100-run mark but Shreyanka would finish off the innings in the second ball of the final over as Pakistan were bundled out for 108 runs.\n\nThe chase started with India showing their full authority with Shafali and Smriti putting the bowlers to the sword. They were cautious at the beginning, but then quickly changed their gears as the duo decided to make the most of the powerplay overs.\n\nThe duo ensured boundaries kept on coming as they took apart Tuba Hassan for 15 runs in the last over of powerplay as India posted 57 runs in the powerplay. After a slow over, Smriti would explode into life with 5 boundaries off Tuba's second over as 21 runs came in it.\n\nSmriti's attempt to finish the game quickly would lead to her demise in the end as she was dismissed for 45 runs off 31 balls and missed out a well-deserved half-century. Hemalatha came in and after a bit of struggle hit 3 boundaries to get things back in order for India. Shafali would also get dismissed and Hemalatha would also follow her soon, but Harmanpreet and Jemimah ensured the game was finished with 35 balls to spare.\n\nIndia had started the tournament as favourites especially after their performance in the South Africa series. While the batting prowess of the Indian stars are well-known, it was the bowling that has been impressing everyone in recent time.\n\nVastrakar has started to become more consistent and be a frontline bowler for the team. Radha Yadav may have gone wicketless today, but she once again showed control with the ball. Deepti was once again consistent and Shreyanka continues to impress everyone with her bowling.\n\nIf India is to retain their crown, bowling will need to continue to maintain their consistency as the batters will be expected to do their work.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Asia_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's Asia Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepti_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deepti Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuba_Hassan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tuba Hassan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafali_Verma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shafali Verma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooja_Vastrakar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pooja Vastrakar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smriti_Mandhana", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smriti Mandhana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dambulla", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dambulla"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dambulla"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima_Sana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fatima Sana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliya_Riaz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliya Riaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidra_Ameen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sidra Ameen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nida_Dar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nida Dar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radha_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radha Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/india-vs-pakistan-195543252-16x9_0.jpeg?VersionId=0SLdTZGKl9UQ.bfvD0WMhpihj4z6v9C9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747444", "eventUri": "eng-9747444", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 263, "textEnd": 270}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

India were dominant throughout the game and the result reflected their dominance as the Women in Blue secured victory by 7 wickets. Pakistan Women's National Cricket Team won the toss and Nida Dar opted to bat first. Pakistan had a cautious but decent start to their innings despite losing two early wickets including that of opener Muneeba Ali. Sidra Ameen, Tuba Hassan and Fatima Sana combined to try and take their score to a respectable one but could only manage 108 runs on the board before getting bowled out. India completed the chase in just 14.1 overs.

Harmanpreet Kaur tactfully introduced the spinners and led by Deepti Sharma, they controlled the middle overs. Deepti scalped three wickets and was partnered by Shreyanka Patil who also picked two wickets. Renuka Singh was more effective not with the new ball but in her second spell when she joined the wickets tally with two quick wickets as well. Together, the bowling performance from India was pretty dominant and despite the cautiousness and resistance from Pakistan, India were able to wrap them up cheaply.

Openers Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma absolutely took apart the Pakistan bowlers as they raced to 57 runs in the powerplay, breaking the back of the chase. It was clear from their batting that the pitch was favouring the batters and that it was only good bowling from Indian bowlers coupled with poor batting from Nida Dar-led side that caused them to end up with such a small total. Smriti Mandhana got dismissed after a well-made 45 while Shafali scored 40 runs off 29 deliveries. Syeda Aroob Shah was the one to scalp the two wickets of the Indian openers. With majority of the contribution coming from the openers, it took little from Dayalan Hemalatha, Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues to take India over the finishing line.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Asia_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's Asia Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuba_Hassan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tuba Hassan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima_Sana", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatima Sana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidra_Ameen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sidra Ameen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muneeba_Ali", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muneeba Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_women's_national_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan women's national cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nida_Dar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nida Dar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renuka_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renuka Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooja_Vastrakar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pooja Vastrakar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Kaur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Kaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepti_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deepti Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syeda_Aroob_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syeda Aroob Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafali_Verma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shafali Verma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayalan_Hemalatha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dayalan Hemalatha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemimah_Rodrigues", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jemimah Rodrigues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smriti_Mandhana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smriti Mandhana"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/IWCC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/IWCC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Indian-womens-cricket-team-players-celebrate-a-wicket-2-784x441.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747444", "eventUri": "eng-9747444", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

A disciplined bowling performance, led by PoTM Deepti Sharma's 3-20, had restricted Pakistan to just 108 despite a late counterattack, before rapid 40s from openers Smriti Mandhana (45 in 31) and Shafali Verma (40 off 29) made short work of the chase as India launched their title defence with a statement win.\n\nThe difference: PowerPlay intent\n\nSeeing a dry, batting-friendly track, Nida Dar opted to put runs on the board first in a high-stakes game, but Pakistan's top-order went into a shell with the early strikes of Pooja Vastrakar. On the contrary, India's openers vindicated what two captains observed at toss. Verma and Mandhana went at 9.5 RPO in the first-six, whereas Pakistan had just one double-digits over in all of their PowerPlay as India's pacers exerted pressure from both ends in windy conditions.\n\nPakistan\n\nVastrakar removes openers cheaply\n\nPowerPlay: 37/2 [RR: 6.16, 4s:6]\n\nContinuing her rich vein of form, Vastrakar struck in both her powerPlay overs to get rid of Pakistan's openers before they could do much damage as she used the short ball to good effect. Despite being welcomed with a four by Gull Feroza, Vastrakar dug one short again a ball later to invite the pull again, only for the batter to drag it off her toe end to the mid-on straight. Mubeena Ali attempted to upper cut when she got a short one, and instead sent a top-edge over covers to perish for a run-a-ball 11. If not for the couple of boundaries each in the 3rd and the 6th over, by Renuka Thakur and Deepti Sharma, Pakistan would have fared rather poorly in the powerplay after having opting to bat first.\n\nSpinners, Renuka keep Pakistan in check\n\nMiddle overs: 44/4 [RR: 4.89 4s:4]\n\nSpinners were in operation from thereon and Patil struck in her first over to add to India's bright start with the ball. A tossed up offbreak had the big-hitting Aliya Riaz half-heartedly attempting a flick to feed a leading edge to the midwicket, where Rodrigues pouched her second. With Harmanpreet Kaur bowling spin in tandem, Pakistan could only crawl to 53/3 at the halfway mark. A miserly four-run over on Vastrakar's return added to the pressure and the Pakistan skipper caved. Dar gave Deepti the charge but mistimed her loft to give long-on a regulation catch. Thakur redeemed herself in her final over, dismissing the other set batter, Sidra Ameen, and trapping Iram Javed LBW first ball on successive deliveries.\n\nOffies curb late counterattack\n\nDeath overs: 27/4 [RR: 6.24, 4s/6s: 1/2]\n\nTuba Hassan (19-ball 22) and Fatima Sana (16-ball 22*) put on what was Pakistan's best partnership on the day, worth 31. Tuba was the aggressor in that stand, collecting boundaries off Deepti, Vastrakar and Shreyanka in succeeding overs before the former had her slicing an edge straight to backward point. Syeda Ayoob was run-out two balls later and Nashra Sandhu nicked behind for a first-ball duck as Pakistan slipped to 94/9 by the end of the 18th. Radha Yadav bore the brunt of Fatima's counter-attack as she hit the left-arm spinner for a couple of sixes to take Pakistan to triple figures. Patil, however, cleaned up her last-wicket partner at the other end to roll Pakistan out for 108 with four balls to spare.\n\nIndia\n\nVerma leads India's blistering start\n\nPowerPlay:57/0 [RR: 9.5, 4s/6s: 10/1]\n\nPakistan opened with spin but Shafali Verma was quick to punish Sadia Iqbal early. The one straying on the pads was flicked away, the short ones pulled away to midwicket and next expertly cut to pierce the two fielders in the covers. Dar brought herself on in an attempt to eke out a breakthrough but both Verma and Mandhana fetched a boundary each to keep India's scoring going at a brisk pace. With change of ends, Fatima Sana's away going delivery managed to beat Verma's push but on either side of it were overpitched deliveries that Verma sent to the fence with disdain. Dar brought more spin, in Tuba Hasan and Mandhana welcomed her with back to back boundaries before Verma slogswept one for a six as India raced to 57 in their PowerPlay.\n\nMandhana puts India on the brink\n\nMiddle overs: 52/3 [RR: 6.36, 4s:8]\n\nNashra Sandhu provided a momentary relief with a one-run opening over just as the fielding restrictions were limited but Mandhana's assault on Tuba more or less killed the chase, and Pakistan's hopes of a late comeback. Having scored 9 off her in the three balls in the previous over, the southpaw slammed five boundaries all over the park in Tuba's second to march into the 40s, overtaking Verma. Looking to close out the chase early, both openers did lose their wickets to Syeda Aroob. Mandhana holed out after a 31-ball 45 and Verma was bowled through the gate, but D Hemalatha did not let the tempo dip. The No. 3 picked a hat-trick of boundaries of an otherwise miserly Sandhu. Even though the spinner took the revenge in her final over, India were barely eight runs away and completed the formalities on the first ball of the 15th over.\n\nBrief scores: Pakistan 108 all out in 19.2 overs (Sidra Ameen 25, Tuba Hassan 22, Fatima Sana 22*; Deepti Sharma 3-20, Renuka Thakur 2-14) lost to India 109/3 in 14.1 overs (Smriti Mandhana 45, Shafali Verma 40; Syeda Aroob 2-9) by 7 wickets\n\nWhat's next for them?\n\nBoth teams will be in action next on Sunday. In the afternoon match India will look to extend their winning streak when they take on UAE, while Pakistan face a high-on-confidence Nepal later in the evening.", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com",

Chasing a paltry target of 109, the openers - Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma - provided a blistering start before captain Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues closed the deal for the Women in Blue.\n\nIndian captain Harmanpreet has lauded the team's effort after the win, stating that fearless cricket is the way to play for the team. She began her post-match presentation speech by highlighting the bowlers' effort before coming to the batters praising their intent-filled approach.\n\n\"Our bowlers and openers made it. First game is always a pressure game but we managed it well. Our entire unit played really well. When we are bowling we talk about early breakthroughs and in batting, we look to start well so credit to Smriti and Shafali. Playing fearless cricket, how we played today and we are really happy with the way we played. My knee is fine,\" Harmanpreet said after the win.\n\nIndia were asked to chase 109 after the bowlers bowled the Women in Green out in 19.2 overs. Mandhana and Shafali provided a strong start and raced India to 57 in the powerplay. Mandhana took five fours off Tuba Hassan in the 8th over as the defending champions looked for an early win.\n\nBut then Pakistan bowlers tried to bring some joy as Syeda Aroob Shah removed both the Indian openers short of their fifties. Nashra Sandhu removed Dayalan Hemalatha before Harmanpreet and Jemimah took India home with 35 balls to go.\n\nThe platform for the win was laid by the Indian bowlers. All-rounder Deepti Sharma was the pick of the bunch with three wickets while returning Renuka Singh, Pooja Vastrakar and Shreyanka Patil scalped two each. Sidra Ameen, Tuba Hassan and Fatima Sana were the only ones to get over 20. Ameen was the top-scorer with 25 runs but she took 35 balls to score those runs.\n\nIndia will next play against UAE on July 21 before setting-up a meet with Nepal on July 23.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "varun_malik@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Varun Malik", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Kaur", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Kaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafali_Verma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shafali Verma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Asia_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's Asia Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemimah_Rodrigues", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jemimah Rodrigues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smriti_Mandhana", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smriti Mandhana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuba_Hassan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuba Hassan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renuka_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renuka Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syeda_Aroob_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syeda Aroob Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima_Sana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatima Sana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayalan_Hemalatha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dayalan Hemalatha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidra_Ameen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sidra Ameen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashra_Sandhu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashra Sandhu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooja_Vastrakar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pooja Vastrakar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepti_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deepti Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/IWCC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/IWCC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/dravid-17-1721412957.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747444", "eventUri": "eng-9747444", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 100, "textEnd": 107}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 1974, "textEnd": 1981}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 2021, "textEnd": 2028}], "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Both the spinners and the pacers shared the load as Deepti Sharma starred with three wickets, which included scalping skipper Nida Dar.\n\nIndia openers Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma made it look easy as they posted a 85-run partnership before Syeda Arooba Shah scalped Smriti in the 10th over.\n\nThe Women in Green won the toss and chose to bat first. However, they were dealt with an early blow when opener Gull Feroza was caught at short mid-on by India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur off a Pooja Vastrakar delivery.\n\nJust two overs later, Pooja picked up her second scalp of the match after forcing Muneeba Ali to pull a short ball, but the Pakistani's shot landed safely in Jemimah Rodrigues's hands, who was positioned at mid-off.\n\nIt was India's spinners who were making sure that Pakistan's top-order continued to collapse.\n\nRadha Yadav and Shreyanka Patil were brought in after the powerplay, and this brought dividends soon enough. In the eighth over, Shreyanka took Aliya Riaz's wicket after the batter tried to flick it off her pads but instead, hit it towards a ready Jemimah at mid-wicket. Aliya scored just six off 11 balls.\n\nIt was Deepti who starred with the ball once again after she removed skipper Nida Dar to pick up her first wicket of the night. Nida walked back to the dugout with only eight runs on the board off 11 balls.\n\nDeepti, who was adjudged as the 'Player of the Match' also scalped a well-settled Tuba Hassan (22, 19b) and Nashra Sandhu, who went for a golden duck.\n\nThere were glimpses of hope from Pakistan's batting order, with Sidra Ameen and Tuba coming in with important knocks, but they too were removed before they could settle.\n\nAt the end, it was Fatima Sana who added some runs, including two sixes in the penultimate over, to get Pakistan over the 100-run mark. Shreyanka wrapped up the opponent's innings by bowling out Sadia Iqbal.\n\nThe Indian batters made quick work of the chase after openers Smriti (45, 31b) and Shafali (40, 29b) all but confirmed the Women in Blue's victory. Spinner Syeda was one of Pakistan's better performances as scalped both Smriti and Shafali.\n\nIndia next plays UAE on Sunday, while Pakistan faces Nepal.\n\nLatest on SportstarWomen's Asia Cup 2024: India beats Pakistan by seven wickets to kick off title defenceTeam SportstarIndia vs Pakistan Women's Asia Cup T20 2024 Highlights: Solid Shafali Verma, Smriti Mandhana seal seven-wicket winTeam SportstarParis 2024 Olympics Quiz - Set 4Team SportstarParis Olympics 2024: 'Biggest event of my life,' says Lakshya Sen talking about his preparation ahead of Olympic GamesY.

In reply, Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana shared an 85-run opening stand off just 57 balls, propelling India to chase down the target effortlessly. Shafali (45) and Smriti (40) feasted on loose bowling from Pakistan, hitting boundaries aplenty to ensure India chased down the total with seven wickets in hand and 35 balls remaining. The Power-play phase set the tone: Pakistan lost three wickets, while India didn't lose any.\n\nChasing 109, Shafali began by whipping Sadia Iqbal for a four through deep backward square leg, while Smriti started with an easy flick off Fatima Sana for a boundary. Shafali pulled and cut Sadia for two easy boundaries, before welcoming Nida Dar with a sweep through square leg for four.\n\nSmriti went on the backfoot to punch wide of cover-point for a boundary, followed by Shafali lofting and leaning forward to unleash a copybook straight drive off Fatima for a brace of fours. Smriti welcomed Tuba Hassan with a punch and pull for two more fours, while Shafali swept powerfully for a six as India ended the Power-play at 57/0. Tuba came under further attack in the eighth over as Smriti swept her for another four, followed by lofting twice, paddling, and flicking with ease to take four more boundaries, accumulating 21 runs off the over. From there, the only question was who would reach their half-century first.\n\nHowever, Smriti fell five runs short of her fifty when she didn't get the elevation on a lofted shot and was caught at mid-wicket. Dayalan Hemalatha, back at number three, hit a hat-trick of boundaries off Nashra Sandhu.\n\nLike Smriti, Shafali didn't reach her fifty as Syeda Aroob Shah bowled her through the gate for 45. Nashra returned to have Hemalatha mistime her loft and be caught at cover-point. Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues knocked off the remaining runs, getting India's campaign off to a winning start.\n\nEarlier, Deepti bowled exceptionally well in the middle overs to be the pick of India's bowlers. For Pakistan, it was a disappointing batting performance, struggling to maintain a steady tempo in their innings, resulting in only four batters reaching double figures. The lack of partnerships and inability to rotate strike meant they couldn't break free from the pressure imposed by the Indian bowlers, as Pakistan lost their last six wickets for 47 runs.\n\nElecting to bat first, Pakistan suffered an early jolt when Gull Feroza's top edge on a pull was caught by mid-on off Pooja. The all-rounder returned in the fourth over to claim Muneeba Ali with another short ball that she miscued to cover.\n\nPost the Power-play, Pakistan's woes continued as Shreyanka got a loopy off-break to dip in and take the leading edge off Aliya Riaz's flick to mid-wicket. After Nida Dar holed out to long-on off Deepti, things worsened for Pakistan as Renuka had Sidra Amin slicing to backward point and Iram Javed trapped lbw on consecutive deliveries.\n\nTuba Hassan stepped up to hit three boundaries in her 19-ball 22 before slicing off Deepti to backward point in the 18th over, followed by the off-spinner having Nashra nick behind after Aroob was run out.\n\nFatima Sana took Pakistan past the 100-run mark by slog-sweeping Radha Yadav for a brace of sixes. But Shreyanka ended Pakistan's innings by castling Sadia as they folded up for 108 with four balls left unused.", "source": {"uri": "india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadia_Iqbal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sadia Iqbal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafali_Verma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shafali Verma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smriti_Mandhana", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smriti Mandhana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuba_Hassan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tuba Hassan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syeda_Aroob_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syeda Aroob Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima_Sana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fatima Sana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayalan_Hemalatha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dayalan Hemalatha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashra_Sandhu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashra Sandhu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nida_Dar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nida Dar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Kaur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Kaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemimah_Rodrigues", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jemimah Rodrigues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull_Feroza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gull Feroza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iram_Javed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iram Javed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliya_Riaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliya Riaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muneeba_Ali", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muneeba Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radha_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radha Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FotoJet-20-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747444", "eventUri": "eng-9747444", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

It was an aggressive display of batting from both the Indian openers as they mostly dealt in fours and sixes.\n\nThe duo of Mandhana and Shafali hit two fours and a six off Tuba Hassan to collect 15 runs in the sixth over. The seventh over bowled by Hassan yielded 21 runs with Mandhana hitting the bowler for five boundaries.\n\nPakistan finally tasted success in the 10th over in the form of Mandhana who was caught by Aliya Riaz at mid-wicket off the bowling of Syeda Aroob Shah.\n\nShafali departed in the 12th over, but by then, she and Mandhana had already done the damage. Dayalan Hemalatha (14) didn't last long, caught by Hassan off Nashra Sandhu.\n\nSkipper Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues then ensured a comfortable win for the title holders. Earlier, India dished out a fine effort led by experienced off-spinner Deepti Sharma (3/20).\n\nIndia, after being asked to bowl first, tasted their first success in the second over itself when pacer Pooja Vastrakar (2/31) dismissed Gull Feroza, caught by skipper Harmanpreet at mid-on.

The match, which was being played at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Dambulla, saw the Women in Blue dominate in both the innings after they completed the chase in just 14.1 overs.\n\nThe Women in Blue rode on superlative efforts by their bowling brigade followed by a clinical batting display by Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana in the chase to start their campaign on a high. After winning the toss, Pakistan, who opted to bat first, were folded for just 108 runs in 19.2 overs in front aggressive Indian bowling line up.\n\nDeepti Sharma proved to be the most valuable of all as her superlative spell of 3/20 dented the opposition and pushed them against the wall. Pooja Vastrakar, who gave the Women in Blue early breakthroughs, claimed two wickets in her four-over spell. Apart from these two, Renuka Singh bowled an economical spell to 2/14 to keep the score in check and Shreyanka Patil gave as many runs in 3.2 overs claiming two wickets. Sidra Ameen top-scored for Pakistan with 25 runs while Tuba Hasan and Fatima Sana played knocks of 22 each.\n\nShafali and Smriti started off from word go as they completed rattled the Pakistan bowling attack for the first 10 overs, till the time Smriti departed. The batter played a lethal knock of 45 runs off just 31 deliveries which included nine boundaries. Shafali too was exquisite with her batting skills as she scored 40 runs in just 29 balls including 6 boundaries and a maximum.\n\nWhile both the batters did the bulk of the scoring, the left over was taken care of by Dayalan Hemalatha, who scored 14 runs.

The last time the teams met at the T20 World Cup last year, they had India under pressure in a run-chase. In their last meeting at the Asia Cup too, batting first helped Pakistan close out an impressive group-stage win against the eventual champions. But winning the toss was pretty much all the joy they would have until India lost a few cheap wickets towards the back-end of the chase.\n\nA total of 108 on a pitch that seemed pretty good to bat on was never going to be enough for Dar's side, though. Deepti Sharma was the pick of the bowlers with three wickets and walked off with the player of the match honours. But the match was decided in the two powerplays.\n\nPooja Vastrakar picked up from where she left off against South Africa in Chennai in the last match India played, packing off both the openers with her hard-length bowling, something she's become adept at. Pakistan's innings never really got going from there. And then in the run-chase Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma broke the Pakistan resolve nice and early, racing to 57/0 at the end of the powerplay.\n\nOne of the many positives for India on the night was seeing Renuka Singh Thakur back among the wickets. Even though she went wicketless in the powerplay (an aspect that must still make the management ponder her inclusion in the XI) the pacer bounced back well in the 13th over to finish with two wickets off her last two deliveries. Renuka admitted in the mid-innings interview that she had to work hard with Troy Cooley at the NCA to figure out how to bounce back from dull returns during the home season against South Africa. Perhaps now she'd be able to carry this momentum forward into the tournament.\n\nIndia's ground-fielding was sloppy at times once again, but their catching was mostly solid as they strive to add consistency in that department. Radha Yadav personified that in the 18th over. First she attempted a dive for a catch at backward point but as the ball was falling short of her, she would turn her palms upside down to stop it from going past her. Then, she quickly got back up to complete a direct hit to end Syeda Aroob Shah's innings. It is the sort of effort Harmanpreet would want to see more often and from more of her fielders.\n\nThe run-chase seemed like a formality once Shafali and Mandhana started off with good intent. After a blistering 85-run opening stand, India ended up losing three wickets to give Pakistan some solace. It wasn't to be back-to-back 10-wicket wins for India, and it wasn't to be back-to-back half-centuries for Mandhana. The elegant left-hander, however, did cross a significant milestone. She went past Harmanpreet to be the leading run-scorer for India in women's T20Is with 3365 runs to her name. And in the end, India reiterated the favourites tag to win their 8th Women's Asia Cup title.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nPakistan 108 in 19.2 overs (Sidra 25, Deepti 3/20, Renuka 2-14, Shreyanka 2/14, Vastrakar 2/31) lost to India 109/3 (Mandhana 45, Shafali, Syeda 2/9) beat by seven wickets.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors":

Notably, the off-spinner bowled a magnificent spell of 3/20 in four overs during Match 2 of the Women's Asia Cup 2024 to help India beat Pakistan by seven wickets.\n\nSharma dismissed Pakistan captain Nida Dar (8 off 11), Tuba Hassan (22 off 19) and Nashra Sandhu (0 off 1) to emerge as the best bowler of the game. Speaking on her match-winning performance, the 26-year-old said that she had a plan to bowl in the right areas and it worked out well. Sharma further expressed surprise at the fact that she has completed 250 wickets in international cricket.\n\nIND vs PAK Highlights\n\n\"Feeling great and it worked out according to the plan. Bowled in the right areas. As a unit we are doing very well, having camps helped us a lot. I worked on my bowling after the South Africa series which helped. [on getting Nida Dar] She is a good batter and it brings a lot of satisfaction when you get a batter like that. [if she knew she had reached 250 international wickets] No idea,\" said Sharma in the post-match presentation.\n\nSharma came in to bowl the last over of the powerplay and was hit for ten runs. She further made a comeback in the 12 over of the innings and got the prized scalp of Nida Dar who holed out to mid-on. She further gave away six run in her third over. The off-spinner once again returned to bowl the 18 over and ended up picking two more wickets to finish with figures of 3/20 in four overs.\n\nCourtesy of her magnificent spell, Pakistan were bundled out for 108 in 19.2 overs. In reply, India chased down the target in 14.1 overs with Smriti Mandhana (45 off 31) and Shafali Verma (40 off 29) annihilating the Pakistan bowlers.

Smriti Mandhana contributed a brisk 45 runs off 31 balls, while Shafali Verma scored 40 runs off 29 balls, leading the charge and scoring freely. Despite a few late wickets, India reached the target with ease.\n\nPakistan's young leg-spinner Syeda Aroob Shah managed to take two crucial wickets, and Nashra Sandhu added another, momentarily delaying India's triumph. However, India's top order capitalised on Pakistan's inconsistent bowling, frequently finding the boundary and maintaining a high run rate throughout the chase.\n\nEarlier in the match, Pakistan struggled with the bat, managing only 109 runs. They lost wickets at regular intervals and failed to build any significant partnerships.\n\nIndia's bowlers, particularly the spinners, kept the pressure on Pakistan's batswomen, ensuring they were unable to post a competitive total. Deepti Sharma (3/20) and Shreyanka Patil (2/14) were particularly effective, picking up crucial wickets and maintaining tight lines. Pacers Renuka Singh and Pooja Vastrakar each claimed two wickets.\n\nPakistan's batting woes were evident from the start, as they found it difficult to rotate the strike and score freely. Fatima Sana tried to anchor the innings with an unbeaten 22, but received little support from the other end. The Indian bowlers were relentless, with disciplined bowling and sharp fielding contributing to Pakistan's modest total.\n\nThis win marks a strong start for India in the tournament, showcasing their batting depth and bowling prowess. The team will look to build on this performance in the upcoming matches.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistan will need to regroup and address their batting issues. They have the talent and potential to bounce back but will need to learn from this match and make the necessary adjustments as the tournament progresses.\n\nUNI BDN GNK", "source": {"uri": "uniindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "http://www.uniindia.com/fadnavis-orders-probe-into-mumbai-pub-fire/states/news/1090400.html"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafali_Verma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shafali Verma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smriti_Mandhana", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smriti Mandhana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Asia_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's Asia Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangiri_Dambulla_International_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dambulla", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dambulla"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dambulla"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashra_Sandhu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashra Sandhu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renuka_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renuka Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima_Sana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatima Sana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooja_Vastrakar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pooja Vastrakar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepti_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deepti Sharma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.uniindia.com/cms/gall_content/2024/7/2024_7$largeimg19_Jul_2024_224812030.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747444", "eventUri": "eng-9747444", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dambulla"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 17}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

It was set up by a clinical bowling display, the defending champions bowling Pakistan out for 108. Shafali Verma's and Smriti Mandhana's breezy 85-run opening stand then ensured India chased the target down comfortably, in 14.1 overs.\n\nIndia now have a 6-1 win-loss record against Pakistan in this competition, and a 12-3 record in T20Is overall.\n\nWith Renuka Singh back in the XI after having missed the last two T20Is against South Africa leading into the Asia Cup, India bowled five overs of pace in the powerplay. It pegged Pakistan back early, mainly thanks to Pooja Vastrakar. She started her first over with a short ball and was hit for a boundary second delivery but persisted with this length and it worked. She first removed Gull Feroza - who opened instead of Sidra Amin - as she mistimed a pull towards mid-on for Harmanpreet Kaur to complete the catch. In her next over, fourth of the innings, Vastrakar dismissed Muneeba Ali for a run-a-ball 11 with another short one; the batter was on her toes to upper cut but top edged to Jemimah Rodrigues in the covers to leave Pakistan 26 for 2.\n\nIn stark contrast with Pakistan's innings, India's openers Shafali and Mandhana got them off to a flying start, scoring 57 in the powerplay. The same surface was used earlier in the day for the tournament opener, where Nepal beat UAE but the duo quickly adjusted to the slowness of it in the chase.\n\nPakistan toiled to get their line and length right and, as a result, gave away boundaries through both over-pitched and short deliveries. Shafali brought up the first of six fours with a flick to square leg in the first over. Short balls from left-arm spinner Sadia Iqbal were cut away through covers and pulled through midwicket. She also punished fast bowler Fatima Sana with two fours in her second over, the fifth overall, to race to 35 off 22 at the end of the powerplay.", "source": {"uri": "island.lk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooja_Vastrakar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pooja Vastrakar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafali_Verma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shafali Verma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Asia_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's Asia Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smriti_Mandhana", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smriti Mandhana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dambulla", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dambulla"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dambulla"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull_Feroza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gull Feroza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renuka_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renuka Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muneeba_Ali", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muneeba Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Kaur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Kaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadia_Iqbal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sadia Iqbal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima_Sana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatima Sana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-arm orthodox spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemimah_Rodrigues", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jemimah Rodrigues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Pooja-1000x600.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747444", "eventUri": "eng-9747444", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

That same track had facilitated Nepal Women, who were returning to the competition after having last played in 2016, to a memorable six-wicket victory over UAE Women a few hours back.\n\nIndia, having made three alterations to their lineup from the third and final T20I of the recently-concluded series against South Africa Women, wasted no time in setting the tone with the ball. Gull Feroza was dismissed for a run-a-ball five in the second over itself. Wicketkeeper-batter, Muneeba Ali, managed to score six runs more than Feroza, but she was dismissed in a similar fashion; striking at 100 and falling to a shortish delivery from the same bowler mentioned earlier.\n\nWith both openers back in the pavilion, it seemed as though India had firmly tightened their grip on Pakistan. Runs became increasingly difficult to obtain, a consequence of disciplined bowling and a conservative mindset among the batters. This was proven effective when Pakistan lost three wickets within the span of about eight deliveries, a collapse which included Renuka Singh taking two wickets on the final couple of deliveries of her spell to leave Pakistan in all sorts of bother at 61/6 in 13 overs.\n\nAlso Read: 'It took almost 10 years to get the trophy' - Sneh Rana takes cues from Indian men's team for ICC trophy\n\nHowever, identical scores of 22 from Tuba Hassan and Fatima Sana helped Pakistan reach a respectable total, though still subpar overall. Shreyanka Patil concluded the innings by dismissing Sadia Iqbal, resulting in Pakistan being all-out for 108 in 19.2 overs. Every other bowler claimed wickets, except for Radha Yadav, who was the only bowler to concede maximums.\n\nThe first two overs of the run-chase yielded only six runs each, but the seventh over was the next-most economical, conceding just one run. The four intervening overs, however, were a barrage of runs. Hassan's initial over, conceding 15 runs, was merely a precursor to her tumultuous second. She was subjected to a relentless onslaught from Smriti Mandhana, who finally found her tempo and struck four boundaries within that over.\n\nHowever, it was not destined for Mandhana to achieve her 25th T20I half-century. Syeda Aroob Shah secured Pakistan's first breakthrough in her first over. Mandhana advanced down the pitch but failed to achieve the necessary elevation, resulting in a sharp chance that was seized at short midwicket. By the conclusion of that over, India required a modest 23 runs to win from the remaining ten overs.\n\nA trio of consecutive fours by Dayalan Hemalatha off Nashra Sandhu propelled India nearer to their target. Despite a few tight overs that saw a wicket fall in each, it was evident that Pakistan's fate was sealed. Pakistan Women succumbed to their twelfth defeat in 15 T20I encounters against their arch-rivals, as India Women secured a comprehensive victory by seven wickets with 35 deliveries to spare.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull_Feroza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gull Feroza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muneeba_Ali", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muneeba Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_women's_national_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa women's national cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nida_Dar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nida Dar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dambulla", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dambulla"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dambulla"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuba_Hassan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tuba Hassan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renuka_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renuka Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadia_Iqbal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sadia Iqbal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneh_Rana_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneh Rana (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima_Sana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fatima Sana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syeda_Aroob_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syeda Aroob Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayalan_Hemalatha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dayalan Hemalatha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashra_Sandhu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashra Sandhu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radha_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radha Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_women's_national_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan women's national cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_women's_national_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India women's national cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smriti_Mandhana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smriti Mandhana"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/IWCC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/IWCC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1721407255416_Untitled-3.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747444", "eventUri": "eng-9747444", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

I worked on my bowling after the South Africa series which helped.

In the digital age, where social media is a barometer of sporting frenzy, there was hardly any talk of this being 'the contest' to look forward to. If anything, India vs Bangladesh, with it's feistiness, occasional ill temper, animated celebrations and, at times, furore over umpiring, has challenged this rivalry to become the rivalry in Asia.\n\nAsk Harmanpreet Kaur, who was at the centre of it only recently, slamming \"pathetic umpiring\", only for her opposite number, Nigar Sultana to suggest she \"should've shown better manners\".\n\nAs unfortunate as that incident may have been, it has without doubt contributed to the edge around the rivalry. There has been a sense of uneasy calm around the two teams ever since, and while subsequent matches haven't witnessed similar episodes, the competitive energy that was missing until even four years ago is now very much present.\n\nIn that sense, Friday was Pakistan's opportunity to prove that the broadcasters were right to build this match up for primetime viewing. Unfortunately, it fell flat right at the beginning, perhaps as soon as Nida Dar decided to bat on what she felt was a \"dry surface.\"\n\nHer decision may have perhaps been influenced by recent history. The last time they met India at the Asia Cup, Pakistan batted first, made 137, and then tied India into knots. Maybe it was the chance to bat freely without scoreboard pressure, but Pakistan quickly found themselves up against it when Pooja Vastrakar picked up two wickets inside the powerplay with the short ball.\n\nBatter after batter attempted big shots, none bigger than Nida's heave down long-on's throat at a time when she was Pakistan's biggest hope of getting close to 130. India's spinners gnawed at a scratchy middle order who dug themselves into a pit they couldn't get out of. Barring Muneeba Ali, who looked to break away early on, and Fatima Sana towards the end, most of the other batters adopted a safety-first approach, allowing India's bowlers to dictate terms.\n\nDeepti Sharma continued to show why she's a threat on subcontinent surfaces, with her guile and ability to lull batters out with her flight. Shreyanka Patil exhibited her variety - a carrom ball, traditional off spin, an outswinger and even a bouncer when challenged to defend a free-hit.\n\nRenuka Singh has often been prolific when there has been movement on offer, but has often struggled in conditions where there's no swing, especially in the middle and death overs. On Friday, she returned to deliver two key breakthroughs to boost her confidence, even as a new and improved Arundhati Reddy waits in the wings. Radha Yadav was largely accurate until one bad over in the end dented her analysis. Essentially, every India bowler got a decent workout.\n\nIn the end, 108 was hardly enough to challenge India's batting might. Their response to the total, fuelled by Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma's rampaging form, was not one bit surprising. Mandhana is coming off three hundreds against South Africa, and Shafali a barnstorming Test double.\n\nFor a while now, Amol Muzumdar, India's head coach, has stressed on developing a killer instinct. It's a quality India have seemed to lack in numerous crunch moments, none more famously than against Australia in the semi-finals of the 2023 T20 World Cup in South Africa. But with little pressure to contend with, Mandhana and Shafali dictated terms, attacked Pakistan's spinners from the get go, and raced to a powerplay score of 57 for no loss.\n\n\"Playing fearless cricket, it's something we've spoken about and something we want to keep doing,\" Harmanpreet said. \"It's important to set the tone and whoever got the opportunity did well. When we were bowling, we spoke of early breakthroughs [which Vastrakar gave then] and with the bat, credit to Smriti and Shafali.\"\n\nIndia would have liked to finish more clinically, without losing three quick wickets to big shots, but it's unlikely to cause them to fret too much. They looked every bit the tournament favourites, and Pakistan like they needed to play out of their skins to try and have another crack at igniting the 'greatest rivalry ever'.\n\nIf you have any

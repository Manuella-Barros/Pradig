It wasn't clear whether the system was at fault in the fatality.\n\nTesla has two partially automated driving systems, \"Full Self-Driving,\" which can take on many driving tasks even on city streets, and Autopilot, which can keep a car in its lane and away from objects in front of it. Sometimes the names are confused by Tesla owners and the public.\n\nTesla says at present neither system can drive itself and that human drivers must be ready to take control at any time.\n\n\"Full Self-Driving\" is being tested on public roads by selected Tesla owners. The company recently has been calling it FSD Supervised.\n\nMusk said last week that he did not think approval by government regulators would be a limiting factor in deploying robotaxis. \"If you've got billions of miles that show that in the future, unsupervised FSD is safer than humans, what regulator could really stand in the way of that?\" he asked.\n\nBut Phil Koopman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies autonomous vehicle safety, said he doesn't see Tesla running robotaxis without human drivers on nearly all roads for another decade.\n\nThe safety record Musk cites is based on having a human driver supervise the automated system, he said. \"Unless you have data showing that the driver never has to supervise the automation, then there's no basis for claiming they're going to be acceptably safe,\" he said.\n\nMusk has said Tesla will unveil a dedicated robotaxi vehicle at an event on Oct. 10. The event was delayed from Aug. 8 to make changes in the vehicle that Musk wanted.\n\nMusk has been telling investors that Tesla is less of a car company and more of a robotics and artificial intelligence company. Many investors have put money into the company based on long-term prospects for robotics technology.\n\nMusk has been touting self-driving vehicles as a growth catalyst for Tesla since \"Full Self Driving\" hardware went on sale late in 2015.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Lisa Baumann contributed to this report from Bellingham, Washington.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk",

Deion Glover was quoted by AP as saying on Tuesday.\n\n\"The investigation is still ongoing in this case,\" Glover said in an email to The Associated Press. The Snohomish County Prosecutor will determine if any charges are filed in the case, he said.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk had said last week that \"Full Self Driving\" should be able to run without human supervision by the end of this year. However Musk has also been promising a fleet of robotaxis for a number of years how (he reportedly plans to announce Tesla robotaxis on 10 October).\n\nAccording the Associated Press, the latest fatal Tesla crash took place in a suburban area about 15 miles (24 kilometres) north east of Seattle. The driver reportedly told a trooper that he was using Tesla's Autopilot system and looked at his mobile phone while the Tesla was moving.\n\nTesla does instruct drivers that neither of its self-driving systems can drive itself and that human drivers must be ready to take control at any time.\n\n\"The next thing he knew there was a bang and the vehicle lurched forward as it accelerated and collided with the motorcycle in front of him,\" the trooper wrote in a probable-cause document.\n\nThe 56-year-old driver was arrested for investigation of vehicular homicide \"based on the admitted inattention to driving, while on Autopilot mode, and the distraction of the cell phone while moving forward, putting trust in the machine to drive for him,\" the affidavit reportedly said.\n\nThe motorcyclist, Jeffrey Nissen, 28, of Stanwood, Washington, was under the car and pronounced dead at the scene, authorities reported.\n\nOther crashes\n\nThere have been a number of crashes and deaths involving Tesla and its self-driving technologies over the years.\n\nIndeed, Tesla vehicles have reportedly accounted for nearly 70 percent of reported crashes involving advanced driver-assistance systems since June 2021, according to federal figures, but officials warned against drawing any safety conclusions.\n\nThe US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened 38 special investigations into crashes involving Tesla vehicles that have resulted in 19 deaths, looking at whether the software was a factor.\n\nNissen's death is at least the second in the U.S. involving Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" system.\n\nThe Elon Musk firm is also facing a criminal probe by the US Department of Justice over claims its vehicles can drive themselves.\n\nTesla of course has two driver assistance programs. All new Tesla vehicles have the standard driver assistance system installed called Autopilot.\n\nBut Tesla also sells the more advanced FSD option for an upfront fee, as well as a monthly charge. This enables Tesla vehicles to change lanes and park autonomously.\n\nBonnet recall\n\nMeanwhile it has been reported that Tesla is recalling more than 1.8 million vehicles because of a bonnet or hood issue that could increase the risk of a crash.\n\nTesla is recalling some 2021-2024 Model 3, Model S, Model X, and 2020-2024 Model Y vehicles because the latch assembly may fail to detect it is unlatched after it has been opened.\n\nThe unlatched bonnet could therefore fully open when the vehicle is in motion, potentially obstructing the driver's view and increasing the likelihood of a crash.\n\nRead also : Tesla Production Lines 'Shut Down' By Global IT Outage", "source": {"uri": "silicon.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Silicon UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Investigators said the case is still ongoing and no charges have been filed.\n\nThe crash in question happened when Washington motorcyclist Jeffrey Nissen, 28, collided with the Tesla 15 miles outside of Seattle. According to the police, the 56-year-old driver of the Tesla was looking at his cellphone when his vehicle lurched forward and collided with Nissen.\n\nNissen was found underneath the Tesla and was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver was arrested for an investigation into vehicular homicide due to his admission of distracted driving.\n\nTesla's two automated driving modes, Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, require drivers to remain attentive while the vehicle is in motion. However, according to critics, confusion about the differences and capabilities of the two modes has led to collisions, injuries and death.\n\nNisson's death is the second recorded fatality involving Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology, though it's not clear if the technology was at fault in either case. Federal investigators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have found at least 14 deaths involving Tesla's Autopilot system as well as 54 injuries.\n\nTuesday's report comes as Tesla focuses on its automated driving systems and looks forward to launching its robotaxi program this year.

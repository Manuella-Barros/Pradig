With the initial release, Pittsburgh is keeping the older veteran as their QB1, listing Wilson over Fields, with Kyle Allen and John Rhys Plumlee to follow.\n\nThe Steelers have named George Pickens, Van Jefferson and Calvin Austin the top three receivers, with rookie Roman Wilson, and veterans Dez Fitzpatrick and Quez Watkins behind them. At tight end, Darnell Washington is the second-string with Connor Heyward behind him and Rodney Williams and MyCole Pruitt as the TE4's.\n\nFirst-round rookie Troy Fautanu is listed as the backup left tackle behind Dan Moore Jr. Second-round pick Zach Frazier is listed as the backup center behind Nate Herbig.\n\nOn defense, undrafted rookie Beanie Bishop has climbed his way into the starting nickel spot, with free agent signing Grayland Arnold behind him. Donte Jackson and Joey Porter Jr. line up alongside him, with second-year cornerbacks Cory Trice Jr. and Darius Rush listed as the backups on the outside.\n\nCordarrelle Patterson is listed as the kick returner with Calvin Austin as the punt returner.\n\nThe Steelers' depth chart will change throughout the preseason, with the possibility of the quarterback position having a new starter by Week 1. But the initial release does indicate where the team currently stands, and who still has some work to do to climb up the roster before the cut date.\n\nThe team will release a new depth chart with

Rumors are swirling about Brandon Aiyuk and a potential trade to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Steelers draft class filled a lot of holes and they enter 2024 without many true glaring voids in the roster. General Manager Omar Khan wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nA lackluster Steelers offense led to the hiring of Arthur Smith and the dismissal of the entire quarterback room from 2023. The defense returns nearly every key piece and adds inside linebacker Patrick Queen and some depth in the secondary. The arrow is pointing up for a team that squeaked into the playoffs by the skin of their teeth last season only to get quickly dismissed by the Buffalo Bills.\n\nLuckily for me, I get to run it back this season with Flavell's Five Thoughts. As always, I've got some so without further ado, let's talk Steelers.\n\nRuss Wilson Getting First Shot Isn't So Bad\n\nIt seems pretty clear a large portion of Steeler fans want to see Justin Fields under center when the Steelers open the season in Atlanta on September 8. I am excited for what he brings to the table too. There is no doubt his ceiling is higher than Wilson's. What the Steelers haven't had in the past handful of seasons is steady quarterback play. Wilson is going to provide that.\n\nThe Russ Wilson of old is not what the Steelers are getting. He isn't the MVP-caliber, Super Bowl winning quarterback that he once was. However, Wilson provides a baseline play that will far succeed what the Kenny Pickett/Mason Rudolph tandem provided. He still has a good, lively arm that will help stretch the field and use a weapon like George Pickens on the outside more frequently. The middle-of-the-field offense that was non-existent with Pickett throwing the ball will be of greater use going forward.\n\nWith Arthur Smith, the offense as a whole will be a real-NFL offense as opposed to Matt Canada's scheme - if we can even call it that - from last season. Wilson will provide stability under that.\n\nFields is dynamic and there is no doubt in my mind that there will be packages for him. If Wilson is worse than planned, I think Mike Tomlin would love to see Fields get the chance to run the Steelers' offense. There is a good chance that the Steelers have their quarterback of 2025, and hopefully beyond, with Fields.\n\nThe Rookie Wilsons Will be Steelers Rookies of the Year\n\nThe Steelers draft class served its purpose and the board fell almost as perfectly as it could've for them. Troy Fautanu was a top-tier pick. He played a lot of college football and started a lot of games on one of the best offensive lines in the country.\n\nThe Steelers went into the draft with no starting caliber centers on the roster. Zach Frazier fell to them and they pounced ever so quickly. Those aren't sexy picks but they're two guys who filled important holes on the Steelers' roster.\n\nHowever, it is the next two picks that the Steelers made that excite me the most.\n\nWide receiver Roman Wilson, the Steelers' first of two third round picks certainly has a chance to make a rookie season splash. As the depth chart currently stands, it is George Pickens and then a bunch of unproven and uncertain NFL talent. Wilson scored 12 touchdowns at Michigan last season and was a favorite target of first-round quarterback J.J. McCarthy.\n\nIf he makes a good impression in camp when he returns from injury, there is a chance he could play himself into a solid role within the Steelers' offense. A trade for a significant wide receiver challenge could hamper some of his opportunity but he'll still look to have a role regardless.\n\nPayton Wilson is as talented an inside linebacker as they come. He is a firecracker and the Steelers got him in a spot where they absolutely had to take him. There is a lot of uncertainty at the position behind Patrick Queen following the devastating injury to Cole Holcomb last season and Elandon Roberts ending the season hurt despite playing through the pain.\n\nWilson fills a nice need for the Steelers and does not have to be forced into every down playing time right away. If I had to bet, however, he will earn a big portion of it by the time the final whistle blows at Acrisure Stadium in January against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nHealthy Minkah Fitzpatrick in Right Role Will Be Huge\n\nMinkah Fitzpatrick is among the top 30 players in the NFL when healthy. I don't care what the NFL Top 100 players list has to say, especially when three players are listed higher than Patrick Mahomes but that is an issue for another time.\n\nFitapatrick is a ballhawk that also sails all over the field and oftentimes leads the Steelers in tackles. He's a human missile and the Steelers missed his production last season as he only played in 10 games before returning for the playoff game and making 10 tackles.\n\nHe's got 19 interceptions in six seasons with zero last season. Not only did he suffer his own injuries last season but the Steelers were forced to use Fitzpatrick in a way he shouldn't have to play. Instead of being able to sit over the top and play a true free safety roaming around trying to make plays on the ball, Fitzpatrick played a lot more in the box helping out stop the run because the Steelers didn't have the personnel to let him play his true spot.\n\nIt's no secret that a good pass rush will always lead to more turnovers because it forces quarterbacks to make plays quicker. With T.J. Watt and Co. rushing off the edge again this season, the Steelers will be getting a handful of interceptions from the former Alabama standout.\n\nNajee-Jaylen Dynamic\n\nSpeaking of Alabama standouts, Najee Harris' fifth-year option was declined leading to speculation that the Steelers will proceed beyond this season with the cheaper option at the position that has proven to be more explosive to this point.\n\nI tend to think that the Steelers will ride the hot hand as the season rolls on and there will be no true RB1. The depth chart will likely list Harris as the RB1 unless Warren completely overtakes the spot.\n\nArthur Smith's offense will cater more to the running game and using the tight ends in the passing game, a welcome sight for a team known for those two positions. I think this is the best chance Harris has to succeed after years in an offensive scheme that simply wasn't NFL-caliber. He is still a guy that has three 1,000 yard seasons under his belt so he isn't a bust by any means but it is clear many want more consistency out of Harris.\n\nWarren is the spark plug who handles the ball well in the passing game and also has the ability to turn a short gain into a long run by bowling would-be tacklers over.\n\nThe Steelers are best served by labeling Harris and Warren as RB1 A&B as there doesn't need to be any ego or pedigree in the way. If Harris starts the game and is rolling, ride him. If Harris isn't playing well and Warren provides the spark the team is looking for, he needs to stay in the game. It simply just has to be a game plan/game flow-type of tandem.\n\nWay-Too-Early Predictions\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers were a playoff team last season. The hill to climb seems larger this year with a handful of injured quarterbacks returning in the AFC including the likes of Joe Burrow, Aaron Rodgers, and Anthony Richardson. All three of their teams missed the playoffs last season and arguably had an even better shot than the Steelers to make it with their signal-callers at full health.\n\nThe Steelers have upgraded at the quarterback position as well with Wilson and Fields so they aren't necessarily bottom-feeders in the AFC either.\n\nMany people are making a big deal of the schedule this season for the Steelers as they play the \"easier\" portion of the schedule before their week nine bye. All of their division games will be played in the final eight weeks of the season with four straight AFC North divisional ball games in weeks 11-14.\n\nI am going to take the more optimistic approach and say the Steelers - with the appropriate amount of health, obviously - finish 11-6. They'll use the front part of their schedule to get off to a hot start at 6-2 with losses in the opening game at the Falcons and at the Colts a few weeks later.\n\nThey always play the AFC North slate well, finishing at worst 3-3 in that stretch. A win over the Commanders coming out of the bye week will be coupled with a win in the Kenny Pickett Bowl which equates to an 11-win season and the second wild card spot.\n\nThey will win a playoff game but lose in the Divisional Round. Nevertheless, it will be a huge step forward for a team that has won a playoff game less recently than the Pittsburgh Penguins have won a Stanley Cup.\n\nMake sure you bookmark Steelers OnSI for the

It might not count for anything, but Steelers players will be doing football things in a 60-minute setting. If you are reading this, then that definitely means something to you, and you will probably be watching.\n\nAnd if you are reading this, then you probably have some pretty strong opinions about a lot of new faces. There are many players new to the Steelers this year, either through free agency, the draft, or trade. All of them come in with something to prove, in one way or another, but who has the most riding on tonight's game?\n\nOne preseason game isn't going to make or break anybody, although, with only three games, it doesn't help to stink. Perhaps rookies have the most to gain, I think, in tonight's game, while veterans have the most to lose. If Justin Fields goes out there and bombs, for example, the Steelers will probably have some serious worries.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't think they will rake Beanie Bishop Jr. over the coals if he struggles in his first in-stadium action of his career. The Steelers have only seen him in a practice setting, and they understand stadium work might take some warming up to. He would have two more chances.\n\nBut there are rookies vying for starting roles, and I think that is where my focus is. Troy Fautanu and Zach Frazier will hopefully get some work with the Steelers' first-team offense. If they look like they belong, that could change the depth chart starting next week.\n\nThen again, nobody has more on the line than those who are on the actual roster fringe. There's a big difference between competing for a starting job and competing for a job. So, for the Steelers, guys like Ryan Watts, Logan Lee, and Jack Colletto can't afford to start off slow.\n\nThe Steelers' 2024 season is approaching, following another disappointing year that culminated in a first-round playoff loss. The only change-up in the annual formula lately is whether they exit early or miss the playoffs altogether. They have had a long offseason since the Buffalo Bills stamped them out of their misery back in January.\n\nThe biggest question hanging over the team is the quarterback question. Does Russell Wilson make them a Super Bowl-caliber team, or are they wasting a year? How will the team continue to address the depth chart?\n\nThe Steelers are in training camp and the preseason and the 2024 season is coming into focus. They made numerous moves through signings and trade -- and release. More than usual, they seemed comfortable creating holes, confident they can fill them. Some they managed to fill, others not so much. Now that we have so many pieces of the puzzle, however, we merely have a new set of questions to ask.\n\nRelated Items:Beanie Bishop Jr., Houston Texans, Justin Fields, Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you Study: Russell Wilson, Justin Fields Third And Longs (2023) Steelers Vs.

And while Mike Tomlin will caution not to read much into it, providing one only because the NFL mandates it, there are interesting takeaways.\n\nwr_steelers_Aug_9_2024_roster-depth-chart_4629574\n\nWe'll go through it position group by position group.\n\nQuarterback\n\nNo surprises here. Russell Wilson the starter with Justin Fields the backup. Kyle Allen is the No. 3 and rookie John Rhys Plumlee No. 4. Wilson is working his way back from a calf injury.\n\nRunning Back\n\nNo surprises here either. Najee Harris, Jaylen Warren, and Cordarrelle Patterson the top three. Patterson remains on NFI due to a hamstring injury suffered prior to training camp but has ramped up his side work the past two practices. He could return within a week. The group behind is clumped together but Jonathan Ward does appear to have the early edge in the depth chart and from the eye test at camp.\n\nWide Receiver\n\nVan Jefferson, George Pickens, and Calvin Austin the Steelers' starters, just as it's been throughout the first 11 camp practices. Of course, we'll see if the team lands Brandon Aiyuk, a would-be splash move that would shake things up.\n\nTight End\n\nStatus quo here, too. Pat Freiermuth is the starter. MyCole Pruitt and Rodney Williams are listed as co-fourth string, a camp battle that continues.\n\nOffensive Line\n\nAlong the offensive line, first round rookie Troy Fautanu is listed as the backup left tackle to Dan Moore Jr. A left tackle in college, Fautanu has exclusively been used at right tackle throughout training camp, including seeing first-team reps throughout Tuesday's practice. Dylan Cook, listed as the backup right tackle, has primarily worked as the second-string left tackle.\n\nBroderick Jones remains at right tackle, his primary spot this summer but not necessarily his spot come the fall. Nate Herbig also has the initial nod over Zach Frazier. Herbig has been the team's first-team center throughout camp.\n\nDefensive Line\n\nWorth noting DeMarvin Leal is listed over Isaiahh Loudermilk at defensive tackle though Loudermilk has worked as the starting base RDE on days Heyward has off. Dean Lowry, yet to practice and remaining on Active/PUP, is second-team DE behind Larry Ogunjobi. Lowry looks close to being activated from the injured list.\n\nLinebacker\n\nJeremiah Moon and Nick Herbig the second-team outside linebackers over the newly-signed Markus Golden. And Payton Wilson is listed ahead of third-year linebacker Mark Robinson. Cole Holcomb, coming off a serious 2023 knee injury, is listed as a third-stringer.\n\nSecondary\n\nBeanie Bishop Jr. the first-team slot corner, the position he's held throughout camp. Grayland Arnold is second-string while Cam Sutton, set to serve an eight-game suspension, is third-string. Darius Rush and Cory Trice Jr. are the backup outside corners behind Joey Porter Jr. and Donte Jackson.\n\nThe Steelers will host the Texans this Friday night.\n\nRelated Items:Pittsburgh Steelers,

It's a critical outing for players fighting for roster spots and roles to state their case. QB Russell Wilson won't play, while QB Justin Fields is expected to play a handful of series, per Mike Tomlin.\n\nBattles to watch for include the fourth running back spot, the third wide receiver slot, the ninth offensive lineman, the sixth/seventh defensive linemen, the fourth outside linebacker, the starting slot and backup outside corner slots, and a slew of special teams roles.\n\nWe'll be sharing analysis right after the game ends and have film rooms throughout the week. Pittsburgh still has three more training camp practices, too, and we'll be there to cover them all.\n\nOf course, the Brandon Aiyuk storyline continues, the biggest NFL topic right now with the Steelers in the running.\n\nBecause this post falls on gameday, we're running it earlier to give you more time to make your predictions.\n\nTop Read Posts Of The Week\n\n49ers Reporter Believes Steelers Would Give Up Pair Of Draft Picks For Aiyuk\n\nSteelers 'No Longer An Option' For Brandon Aiyuk (This Report Clearly Proved Untrue)\n\nJustin Fields The Top Steelers Camp Story\n\nThe Steelers Don't Have A Trade In Place With 49ers\n\nNFL Network Reporters: Aiyuk Will Eventually Be Traded To Steelers\n\nA reminder that the contest portion of our Friday Five is over. These questions are now just for fun. Congrats to our winner, and thanks to everyone who participated. The new contest will begin around the start of the regular season.\n\nPeace and love, peace and love!\n\n1 - Will the Steelers beat the Texans in the preseason opener?\n\n2 - How many scoring drives will Justin Fields lead (touchdowns and field goal drives)?\n\n3 - Will Pittsburgh return a kickoff past their own 40-yard line?\n\n4 - Which offensive lineman will log the most snaps?\n\n5 - Who has more total tackles - Payton Wilson, Mark Robinson, or will they tie?\n\nRecap of 2024 First Week of August Training Camp Weekend Friday Night Five Questions\n\nKeep responding through training camp!\n\nQuestion 1: Linebacker Payton Wilson, the Steelers third round pick is exciting Steelers Depot respondents. He was mentioned five times as the player that Depot respondents are most excited reading or hearing about during training camp. Defensive End DeMarvin Leal was the runner-up with four mentions.\n\nQuestion 2: The Steelers must sense some urgency for an outside wide receiver after trading Diontae Johnson and then rookie Roman Wilson out with an injury. The back-and-forth news on Brandon Aiyuk has Pittsburgh on the inside track to trade for him by the end of the week. His agent has done a masterful job. But most respondents did not feel the urgency with 10 of 15 respondents saying they did not feel additional urgency. Some suggested lower profile receivers for Omar Khan to target. Aiyuk just may be a Steeler by the time you read this. His salary demands alone demonstrate how urgent the Steelers front office felt. Then there is whatever they have to give up in draft picks and/or players just to gain permission to sign him. Yoi.\n\nQuestion 3: Markus Golden is more likely to make the Steelers 53-man roster than Jeremiah Moon by a 4 to 1 margin. 12 of 15 respondents gave the edge to Moon. Respondent Wes described the difficulty of this choice: \"This is a tough one. Moon is only 25, but the 33-year-old Golden has more experience, especially when it comes to playing in the Steelers' defense. That being said, we'll have to see what takes place during the preseason. I'm only choosing one here to answer this question, so I'll lean on the side of experience with the Steelers and go with Golden. But again, I'm far from sure on this one. It could just as easily be Moon.\"\n\nQuestion 4: Steelers Depot respondents are nowhere near ready to award the starting position to quarterback Justin Fields. While many appreciate what he is doing in camp with the number ones during Russell Wilson's injury, the respondents want to see him perform in game conditions before even considering it. This was a 14 to 1 vote.\n\nQuestion 5: Payton Wilson is the player people want to see perform on the field in the Steelers' first preseason game. He was the only player specifically mentioned more than once. And led with eight votes.\n\nHere are the consensus answers of Steelers Depot respondents compared to the correct answers:\n\nQuestions Camp Fav So Far More Urgent for Outside WR Moon or Golden Make 53 Start Fields Who to Watch Preseason Game SD Consensus Payton Wilson No Markus Golden No Payton Wilson Correct Answers Your Call Your Call TBD Your Call Your Call\n\nWe appreciate everyone responding to the Friday Night Five Questions!

We've already broken down the offense as well as the defense but let's talk about a few random things that really stood out.\n\nWe aren't shocked that Russell Wilson is still listed as first team despite his injury or how well Justin Fields has practiced. We do think the competition between them is real thanks to Wilson's injury but understand no matter how well Fields plays, he's got an uphill climb\n\nIt was great seeing an undrafted rookie as the starter. Cornerback Beanie Bishop Jr. has taken full advantage of Cameron Sutton's suspension and an injury to Grayland Anderson to seize the starting nickel cornerback spot.\n\nSpeaking of rookies, Bishop if the only one of the Steelers' who made the cut. That's not to say guys like offensive tackle Troy Fautanu and Zach Frazier won't eventually be there but as of now, it's all about working to win those spots.\n\nAnother spot we expect to change is at outside linebacker. Right now Jeremiah Moon is the backup to T.J. Watt while veteran Markus Golden is the third team behind Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig. The Steelers just re-signed Golden but he will end up being a primary rotational player at edge.\n\nStill having a fullback depth chart is so retro of the Steelers. The team even has two players listed. Connor Heyward should be a bigger part of the offense and some of that could come in the backfield. But a fullback? Would the Steelers consider using a roster spot on a guy like Jack Colletto?\n\n49ers receiver signing further fuels Steelers-Brandon Aiyuk trade speculation\n\nSteelers vs Texans: Houston plans to play starters against Pittsburgh\n\nSteelers beat writer rips Justin Fields, calls QB battle 'fictionalized'", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Sutton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Sutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Heyward", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connor Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Highsmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Highsmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullback_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fullback (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Watt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Though there weren't any huge surprises, there was still plenty worth noting from their first iteration of the depth chart.\n\nHere are some of the biggest takeaways on the Steelers' initial depth chart heading into their Week 1 preseason matchup.\n\nIf I had a nickel for every time I heard that Russell Wilson was in the \"pole position\" to be the Steelers' starting quarterback this offseason, I could retire early. That statement appears to still ring true to this point despite the success of Justin Fields and his work with the first team as Wilson makes his way back from a calf injury suffered early in camp.\n\nThe Steelers listed Wilson as the QB1 over Fields in their initial depth chart, and though that might upset fans who have been excited to see him take full advantage of his reps with the first team, it's probably what we'll see to start the season (and for a decent chunk of it, barring a truly disastrous start from Wilson or another injury).\n\nWhile it might feel silly to leave the upside of Fields on the bench for any amount of time, the Steelers value Wilson's veteran presence and experience. The organization values ball security and turnover-free, possession-down football, and Wilson best fits that bill... at least, for now, as this team looks to get Fields back on track after a tough start to his career in Chicago.\n\nThe Steelers have installed almost exactly the same starting offensive line that they finished the 2023 season with, including Dan Moore Jr. at LT, Isaac Seumalo at LG, James Daniels at RG and Broderick Jones at RT. The only adjustment is at center, where they've installed sixth-year player Nate Herbig, having played his first season with the team just last year, though his only starts came at right guard.\n\nBut... where are the rookies? As usual, Tomlin & Co. are bringing the very young and very green offensive line very slowly. Rookies don't start on Day 1 in the 'Burgh. They've got to earn their stripes.\n\nThey should have plenty of opportunity to earn those stripes in the preseason, however, with second-year offensive tackle slated to play on the left side of the line (his natural position) in the preseason, with rookie Troy Fautanu at right tackle. Then there's center Zach Frazier and OL Mason McCormick who will look to get plenty of snaps in the preseason in hopes of cracking the starting lineup come Week 1... even if it seems doubtful based on the team's history.\n\nRemember -- Broderick Jones didn't get his first start until Week 5 in his rookie season, only earning the opportunity due to Moore suffering a knee injury. Even then, he was relegated back to the bench once Moore was healthy, despite how poorly he'd been playing. Jones only returned to the lineup at right tackle once Chukwuma Okorafor was benched in Week 9. It's likely we'll require just as much patience with the 2024 rookie class.\n\nHelllooooo Beanie Bishop! The UDFA was signed immediately following the 2024 NFL Draft, and he's made a huge name for himself through training camp so far. You know how I just said that rookies have to earn their stripes? That apparently doesn't apply to Bishop, who was listed as the team's starting nickel corner.\n\nThough he's a bit undersized at 5-foot-9 and 182 pounds, he plays with a lot of twitch and the aggressive mindset that has undoubtedly won Tomlin and DC Teryl Austin over from the start.\n\nHis best day of training camp so far came in the team's sixth practice, where he shut down budding star WR George Pickens on two separate 1:1 reps. He's been a consistent namesake throughout camp, forcing incompletions and even managing a pick-six against Justin Fields in early August.\n\nJust as interesting as Bishop's spot atop the depth chart is the standing of veteran Cam Sutton as the team's third nickel CB, behind Bishop and Grayland Arnold. The team signed him to a veteran minimum deal back in June following his release from the Lions amidst domestic assault charges... but if Bishop continues to play this well, Sutton could lose a spot on the final 53-man roster, already slated for an eight-game suspension start the season.\n\nCole Holcomb's availability for the 2024 season remains very much up in the air at this point, but luckily for the Steelers, they've got plenty of options. ILBs Patrick Queen and Elandon Roberts can expected to start out of the gate, but having Payton Wilson working right behind him feels like a gift in depth at the position that the team hasn't enjoyed for awhile.\n\nLast year, the Steelers were decimated with injuries at inside linebacker, and it looks as though GM Omar Khan has done his best to ensure that depth will not be an issue in the 2024 season.", "source": {"uri": "behindthesteelcurtain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Behind the Steel Curtain"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kate_magdziuk@behindthesteelcurtain.com", "name": "Kate

After a disappointing exit in the Wild Card round in Buffalo last January, the Steelers have made several key moves to bolster their lineup, setting the stage for an intriguing preseason opener.\n\nThis offseason, the Steelers' roster underwent a substantial overhaul. Veteran quarterback Russell Wilson was signed to lead the offense, while Kenny Pickett was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles. The team also acquired quarterback Justin Fields from Chicago, providing additional depth at the position. On the defensive side, the Steelers strengthened their lineup by signing veteran linebacker Patrick Queen, adding experience and talent to their defense.\n\nTo address concerns on the offensive line, the Steelers used their first-round pick to select Troy Fautanu, an offensive lineman out of the University of Washington, with the 20th overall pick. In the second round, they added WVU center Zach Frazier, further solidifying their commitment to protecting the quarterback and improving their ground game.\n\nRelated: 'Mediocre!' Analyst Compares Steelers to Patriots in Rant\n\nHowever, several key players will not be suiting up for tonight's game. Notably, Russell Wilson, who is nursing a calf injury, will be sidelined along with Minkah Fitzpatrick, T.J. Watt, Cam Heyward, Alex Highsmith, Patrick Queen, and Isaac Seumalo. This opens the door for Justin Fields, who has been taking first-team reps in Wilson's absence, to showcase his abilities and make a case for himself in the quarterback competition.\n\nHead coach Mike Tomlin has emphasized that the starting quarterback position is still up for grabs, making tonight's game a critical opportunity for Fields to prove his worth. With Wilson's status uncertain, Fields could take a significant step toward securing a prominent role in the Steelers' offense as the preseason unfolds.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_givan@postandcourier.com", "name": "Austin Givan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acrisure Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Pickett", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Pickett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Queen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tomlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tomlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkah_Fitzpatrick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minkah Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Watt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

They are gearing up for their first preseason game, where they will host the Houston Texans. Sure, it may just be an exhibition game, but it is football nonetheless.\n\nFor the first time this season, the Steelers will take the field inside Acrisure Stadium and will do so with former first-round pick Justin Fields at quarterback. As announced Wednesday by Steelers' coach Mike Tomlin, Fields will get the start over the veteran Russell Wilson, who just returned from a calf injury that sidelined him for the first two weeks of training camp.\n\nThat is despite Wilson being listed as the starting quarterback in the Steelers' first unofficial depth chart. However, just because Wilson is currently listed as the starter doesn't mean the competition isn't over. Quite the opposite is true; as Tomlin said, \"everything is an audition.\"\n\n\"Very much is a competition,\" Tomlin said. \"What happens in stadium is weighted heavier than what happens in a practice.\"\n\nThis makes Friday a potential big audition for Fields, as he will face a Texans team that surprised many last season with an appearance in the AFC Divisional Round. They did end up losing to the Baltimore Ravens. However, their 10-7 season looked to be just the starting point of a bright future, led by quarterback C.J. Stroud, the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year.\n\nAfter sitting out the Texans' first preseason game last Thursday in the Hall of Fame game against the Chicago Bears, Stroud, the Ohio State product, will face his fellow former Buckeye, Fields.\n\n\"I truly believe that a guy needs to get reps in a preseason game, ...\" Texans coach DeMecco Ryans said about playing his starters. \"We try to keep guys up and be as safe as possible in practice, but I think everyone needs the opportunity to go to the ground a couple times in a game.\"\n\nWhile Friday will mark Stroud's first appearance since last season's playoff loss, it will also be his first time playing with his newest weapons, star receiver Stefon Diggs and running back Joe Mixon. Both of whom are familiar foes for the Steelers defense.\n\nObviously, Diggs and the Buffalo Bills knocked the Steelers out of the playoffs last season. Meanwhile, the Steelers know Mixon even better, having faced him and the Bengals twice a season in each of the past seven years.\n\nThe new pairing of Stroud and Diggs will provide an early test for the Steelers' secondary, which has a big question mark at cornerback. After not re-signing Patrick Peterson this offseason, the Steelers decided to roll with Joey Porter Jr. as their top corner, who will be paired with Donte Jackson, whom they acquired in the Diontae Johnson trade with the Carolina Panthers.\n\nJackson won't be the only new starter in the Steelers' secondary. Undrafted free agent rookie Beanie Bishop Jr. is set to make his debut as the starting nickel.\n\nRelated: Steelers QB Russell Wilson OUT Friday vs. Texans\n\nOn the flip side, the Steelers offense will face a respectable Texans defense that, while wasn't necessarily elite at anything, features the reigning Defensive Rookie of the Year, Will Anderson, who will undoubtedly present a litmus test for the Steelers' offensive tackles.\n\nKickoff is set for 7 p.m. EST inside Acrisure Stadium as the Steelers make their preseason debut.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news",

With the Steelers listed as 2.5-point home dogs and the total sitting at 37.5, what's the smart bet tonight in Pittsburgh?\n\nOur NFL Public Betting Information page indicates that 61% of public bettors are currently backing the Texans when it comes to the spread. This information is subject to change throughout the day, however, so be sure to check the link so you're receiving the most up-to-date public betting data.\n\nTexans head coach DeMeco Ryans told reporters that starters will play in preseason Week 1 against the Steelers. Speaking to reporters Monday, Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said that starters will see snaps against the Steelers in preseason Week 1. \"You just have to go through and play live reps of football before September. You'll see our ones go out and get reps this week against Pittsburgh.\" How long the starters will remain in the game remains to be seen, but it is now evident that we will see them on the field against the Steelers.\n\nThe Athletic's Dianna Russini reports the 49ers \"haven't been satisfied with the Steelers' offers\" for Brandon Aiyuk. According to Russini, the 49ers \"would like a receiver in return for Aiyuk\" but \"are open to players at other positions.\" As it stands right now, the Steelers seem like the most likely team to acquire the star receiver, especially with the Patriots now appearing out of the sweepstakes. However, this negotiation appears far from over for the time being.\n\nThe 49ers have little ground to negotiate a more favorable trade at this time. Their relationship with Aiyuk appears frayed beyond repair at this point, and the downside to keeping him on the roster this season could mean another year of trade/contract negotiations next offseason when they would have to franchise tag him to keep him on the roster. We'll likely know in the near future if the Steelers are willing to up their current offer or if they prefer to move on from trade discussions.\n\nSteelers are 14-2 SU in their last 16 games played in August.\n\nSteelers are 19-4 SU in their last 23 games played in August.\n\nTexans are 3-10 SU in their last 13 games against an opponent in the AFC North division.\n\nThe total has gone UNDER in 9 of Houston's last 12 games played in August.\n\nTake Pittsburgh. It's tempting to back Houston after Ryans stated that the starters will play, but we don't know how long they'll stay in the game. We do know that the Steelers are breaking in a new offense and that means both Russell Wilson and Justin Fields could see time. Fields might not be a reliable starter, but he's better than most of the backups in the NFL.

Fields is expected to start Friday's preseason opener at Acrisure Stadium.\n\nMany will say they don't find much value in preseason games.\n\nBut rest assured, there are dozens in the Pittsburgh Steelers locker room who view Friday's 7 p.m. game in a completely opposite way. To those on the roster bubble fighting for their football lives, Friday is one of only three opportunities they have to build up game film for their vocational r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nMike Tomlin said that \"every year\" he's been Steelers coach, a player who has otherwise was on track to be among roster cuts makes enough of his preseason action to make the team.\n\n\"You know, there's a component of in-stadium play that you can't anticipate,\" Tomlin said Wednesday. \"Somebody always surprises you in a positive way. Somebody always surprises you in a negative way.\n\n\"I'm always open-minded and excited about seeing who they are under those circumstances. And I'm, quite frankly, never surprised when someone runs their way onto this football team with their efforts in preseason.\"\n\nIf parsing through the battles for the second backup interior offensive lineman spot, No. 4 inside linebacker and reserve subpackage defensive back/special-teamer don't move the needle for you, here are five other things to watch in the Steelers' preseason opener:\n\n1. To the heart of Art\n\nFriday is the public game debut of Arthur Smith as the Steelers' offensive coordinator. A recent former NFL head coach who just three years ago was one of those highly-regarded, up-and-coming offensive minds, Smith need a reputation reboot after three consecutive 7-10 seasons running the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nWhile preseason games aren't the time for a play-caller to show all of his proverbial cards, it will be interesting to watch how Smith utilizes his mobile quarterbacks, cadre of tight ends, pair of quality running backs and even the fullback.\n\nThe Steelers have made no secret of their desire to establish a physical identity. The hiring of Smith seeks to enhance that, and fans on Friday will get their first chance to see the stamp Smith put on the team.\n\n2. Fields-ing questions\n\nSpeaking of a chance of rehabbing a once-promising career, the same year Smith was a \"hot\" head coaching candidate (2021), Justin Fields was the 11 overall draft pick. But just like Smith, three middling seasons later he ended up with the Steelers via a demotion in his job title.\n\nThe starter for the Chicago Bears most of 2021-2023, Fields sits at No. 2 on the Steelers' depth chart. But because Russell Wilson (calf) has missed the majority of training camp, Fields has taken the vast majority of first-team reps.\n\nThe results have been mixed. Friday, the uber-talented Fields has an opportunity to show he's grown into more of a complete, all-around quarterback. Still only 25 and with Wilson on a one-year deal, Fields can begin to stake his claim to be the Steelers' quarterback of the future.\n\n3. Rookie review\n\nIt's very early, of course, but for the second consecutive year all indications are the Steelers have a strong rookie class. As many as eight rookies are on track to make the season-opening 53-man roster, and five or six are in the running to play a significant role on offense or defense.\n\nBut, as Tomlin said, what is shown on Chuck Noll Field is not the same as what the group does at Acrisure Stadium. The eyes of coaches and fans alike will be on tackle Troy Fautanu, center Zach Frazier, nickelback Beanie Bishop, linebacker Payton Wilson and guard Mason McCormick. Sixth-round pick Logan Lee (a defensive lineman) and seventh-round safety Ryan Watts also have shown promise they can make the team as rookies. (Third-round receiver Roman Wilson almost assuredly will not play because of injury).\n\n4. On the line\n\nThree of those rookies - all taken in the top half of April's draft - are offensive linemen, adding plenty of intrigue to how that unit plays against the Texans. Though it's more likely than not that none of the three start the game, rest assured that first-round pick Fautanu, second-rounder Fraizer and fourth-rounder McCormick will play plenty of snaps together.\n\nAnd perhaps that trio will at some point Friday be joined by tackle Broderick Jones and guard Spencer Anderson, giving the Steelers a possible glimpse of their future line. All five players were drafted over the past two years.\n\nAside from that, how much - and how quickly - will Fautanu enter right tackle? He's been playing with the first team there over recent practices. Will Jones take reps on the left or right side, or both? Will Frazier perform to a level that forces coaches' hands in promoting him over Nate Herbig as the starting center? Can Herbig, in game play, perform well enough to show why that hasn't yet happened in practice?\n\n5. Kicking things off\n\nArguably the biggest league-wide storyline this preseason that affects all teams is the radical new kickoff rule. One of the most significant NFL rule changes in years, the league intends to increase the volume - and excitement level - of kickoff returns while simultaneously doing its best to avoid injuries.\n\nThe 32 teams and their special-teams coordinators are largely going into this blind. The only test case so far was the Hall of Fame Game last week (which coincidentally featured the Texans).\n\nWhether or not it works over the longterm, during the first preseason games the kickoffs are one play that no one will want to miss.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_adamski@triblive.com", "name": "Chris Adamski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tomlin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tomlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acrisure Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_College", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent College"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Smith_(American_football,_born_1982)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Smith (American football, born 1982)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullback_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fullback (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Noll", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Noll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kickoff (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Logan, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2024/08/7613291_web1_gtr-Steelers16-080824.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797065", "eventUri": "eng-9797065", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The team will be without several key veterans like Russell Wilson, T.J. Watt, and Cam Heyward, but there are plenty of exciting players to look out for. Here are five players to watch as the Steelers take on the Texans.\n\nDeMarvin Leal, DT\n\nThis is a huge year for Leal. The 24 year old is entering his third season in the NFL and is still trying to earn a role with the Steelers. The team is trying him at outside linebacker and defensive end to see if that unlocks something in the team's 2022 third-round pick. He figures to get a large number of snaps against the Texans and needs a solid showing.\n\nVan Jefferson, WR\n\nBrought in to provide a veteran presence, Van Jefferson is vying for the number two wide receiver spot. He's been solid in training camp, but he's putting in the work consistently. Connecting for some receptions with Justin Fields or the next player to watch will go a long way in his pursuit of the WR2 spot.\n\nKyle Allen, QB\n\nThe Steelers' quarterback competition is between Justin Fields and Russell Wilson, but Kyle Allen is an overlooked piece of this puzzle. The veteran QB is a valuable depth piece and injury insurance for the team. With Russ ruled out for this game, Allen should play a bulk of the snaps along with rookie John Rhys Plumlee, and it will give Steelers' fans their first chance to see how deep the QB room is in Pittsburgh.\n\nPayton Wilson, LB\n\nEveryone is chatting about Payton Wilson and his potential impacts for the Steelers. The team's third-round pick this past draft is expected to be a contributor on the team's defense as a rookie. Starter Patrick Queen is one of the veterans set to watch this game, which means Wilson will have ample opportunity to show where his game is at.\n\nBeanie Bishop, CB\n\nAnother rookie playing his way into a role on this team, Beanie Bishop is competing for the slot cornerback position and has a chance to take it. Currently listed as the top slot cornerback on the team's depth chart, he's far from locked in to that. This is his first NFL game action, and as impressive as he's been in training camp he needs to show it against the Texans.\n\nMake sure you bookmark Steelers OnSI for the latest news, exclusive interviews, film breakdowns and so much more", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_punturi@si.com", "name": "Jacob Punturi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4888,h_2749,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_steelers/01j4w0mhb40qgxed97a4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797065", "eventUri": "eng-9797065", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Watt, Cameron Heyward and Minkah Fitzpatrick won't play for the Steelers, we will still get the first look at Justin Fields in a Steelers uniform at Acrisure Stadium, not to mention members of the 2024 rookie class making their NFL debuts.\n\nOn top of that, we'll get a look at the new Arthur Smith offense for the Steelers. Though it's just the preseason, it will still be exciting to see Smith's offense -- albeit limited -- in action.\n\nOutside of those storylines, Friday night's preseason opener will be key for a number of roster bubble players as they continue to battle for a potential spot on the 53-man roster.\n\nBelow are my five key roster bubble players to watch Friday night against the Texans.\n\n1. OLB Kyron Johnson\n\nAfter spending much of the 2023 season with the Steelers on the practice squad, seeing action in six games on the year and playing 100 special teams snaps, Johnson entered training camp with a real opportunity in front of him at the outside linebacker position, where the OLB4 role was there for the taking.\n\nJohnson got off to a strong start but then suffered a hamstring injury and missed a few days. In the timeframe in which he was , the Steelers signed veteran Markus Golden at the position, creating an even bigger logjam. Johnson has the special teams abilities going for him, but never got a chance defensively for the Steelers.\n\nHe should see plenty of playing time in the preseason defensively, now that he's recovered from his hamstring injury to get back on the practice field at training camp. He does a good job of shedding blocks and plays with a high motor, which should help him make some splash plays defensively in the preseason.\n\nThe former Kansas standout is behind Jeremiah Moon right now in the pecking order at OLB, but with his special teams abilities and the familiarity with the Steelers overall, he is still in the mix. He needs a big preseason to force his way onto the roster, starting Friday night against the Texans.\n\n2. ILB Mark Robinson\n\nDue to injuries last season, Mark Robinson had to take on a larger role defensively, which was much faster than anticipated. Robinson played 151 snaps for the Steelers and finished with 30 tackles, one tackle for loss and one sack on the year. He played much better late in the season, especially in the regular-season finale against the Baltimore Ravens on the road, recording a sack and helping force a fumble in a sloppy game.\n\nBut, he was a mess in coverage and really only profiles as a two-down linebacker and a special teams piece. He was fine on special teams last season, but with the new kickoff rules, the Steelers upgraded depth at the position, bringing in Tyler Matakevich a week before training camp.\n\nThat put Robinson behind the 8-ball at inside linebacker, where the Steelers could keep four or five linebackers, depending on the health of Cole Holcomb. Robinson needs a big preseason, and needs to get off to a fast start against the Texans, or he could be moved on from in a roster numbers crunch.\n\nExpect to see a handful of hard hits and loud pops from Robinson on Friday night, but he needs to show more splash overall and an ability to handle himself in coverage.\n\n3. RB Jonathan Ward\n\nWith veteran running back/kick returner Cordarrelle Patterson still shelved due to a hamstring injury, the door of opportunity is open for a player like Jonathan Ward at the running back position. Obviously, Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren are set in stone a the running back position for the 2024 season. Behind them though? Major unknowns.\n\nThat's where Ward could come into play. He earned a contract during rookie minicamp as a tryout player, and has impressed in his short time. He's received a ton of work in training camp so far, with Steelers Depot's Alex Kozora charting him for 18 carries for 63 yards, adding another three receptions for 27 yards and a touchdown through the air.\n\nHe's a guy that has plenty of experience in the NFL, too, playing in 42 games to date, though he has just 17 carries. He has return abilities and special teams reps under his belt in his career, too, which could have him being a viable option to replace Patterson, at least early in the season.\n\nWard has worked with the kickoff return unit early in training camp, too, so he should see plenty of opportunities on special teams and in the backfield against the Texans.\n\n4. FB Jack Colletto\n\nEverybody's favorite fullback, Jack Colletto, has a chance to really impress in the preseason, not only as a true fullback in Arthur Smith's offense, but on special teams as well under coordinator Danny Smith.\n\nSo far in training camp Colletto has made an impact as a leader blocker, earning praise from running back Jaylen Warren. He's also turned some heads in 1v1 receiving drills, hauling in some passes down the field in impressive fashion. He has great versatility dating back to his time in college at Oregon State, where he won the Paul Hornung Award, so wearing multiple hats in the NFL shouldn't be too tall of a task for him.\n\nHe's going to need to have an impact in the run game as a lead blocker, and is going to need to make some plays on special teams when given the opportunity. There's a lot of buzz around him as the FB answer for the Steelers so far in training camp. He needs to prove it on the big stage now.\n\n5. OT Dylan Cook/OL Spencer Anderson\n\nI cheated here with the last one, going with two players, but they are both offensive linemen that are largely on the roster bubble right now, right or wrong.\n\nBoth Dylan Cook and Spencer Anderson stuck on the 53-man roster all year last year for the Steelers after strong training camps and impressive preseasons. But, the Steelers added to the trenches this offseason with the addition of three rookie linemen, all three of whom will make the roster.\n\nTherefore, it could be a significant roster crunch in the trenches offensively.\n\nRight now, Cook profiles as the fourth offensive tackle, while Anderson is in a battle with rookie Mason McCormick to remain that versatile swing interior offensive lineman. In my last 53-man roster prediction I found a way to keep both, giving the Steelers 10 offensive linemen, but I did that without keeping a fullback, sticking with just three running backs and only five receivers.\n\nIt was tough, but doable.\n\nFor that to happen for the Steelers at the end of the preseason, Cook and Anderson need to put together strong preseasons once again. Both have been quiet, but fine in training camp. We need to see some flashes from both of them in the preseason.\n\nRelated Items:Dylan Cook, Jack Colletto, Jonathan Ward, Kyron Johnson, Mark Robinson, Pittsburgh Steelers, Spencer Anderson Recommended for you Steelers Place OLB Markus Golden On Reserve/Retired List First Steelers Preseason Game Weekend: Steelers Friday Night Five Questions Russini: Mike Tomlin Sticking With Russell Wilson No Matter What Is 'Worst Thing He Could Possibly Do'", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_carney@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Josh Carney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acrisure Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullback_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fullback (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kickoff (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkah_Fitzpatrick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minkah Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Watt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T.

He's also been inconsistent.\n\nThis job is Wilson's until he proves he can't handle it.\n\nGeorge Pickens, Van Jefferson and Calvin Austin III are the three top receivers.\n\nPat Freiermuth is the No. 1, Darnell Washington is the No. 2 and Connor Heyward is the No. 3.\n\nCordarrelle Patterson and La'Mical Perine are co-listed as the third-string RBs. That's fine for now.\n\nBut Patterson is a return specialist. And I'm interested to see who wins out when it comes to the third RB job between Perine and Daijun Edwards.\n\nPerine is a 26-year-old veteran with well-formed NFL practice habits, but let's see what the rookie Edwards looks like in games.\n\n* First Call: Christian McCaffrey's 'former teammate' slip about Brandon Aiyuk; former Steeler DL has new AFC home\n\n* Mark Madden: Brandon Aiyuk fills a desperate need for Steelers. Go get him\n\n* Top pick Troy Fautanu gets 1st-team reps at right tackle as Steelers build toward preseason opener\n\nOffensive line\n\nFirst-round pick Troy Fautanu is slotted as the backup at left tackle to Dan Moore Jr. instead of right tackle. That's despite the fact that Fautanu has played more on the right side than the left side since rookie mini-camp. Dylan Cook is listed as the top replacement behind Broderick Jones on the right side.\n\nAll I know is that the Steelers have spent their last two No. 1 picks on Jones and Fautanu. They were both primarily left tackles in college. Neither of them are currently the starting left tackle.\n\nThat's odd. Especially given that Moore Jr. is a former fourth-rounder with 49 starts, but not much pedigree beyond that.\n\nThen again, 2024 second-rounder Zach Frazier is still listed as the backup center to Nate Herbig. Yet, Herbig has just 48 NFL snaps at center.\n\nSo, let's see how long it takes for that issue to correct itself before we get to the tackle conundrum.\n\nCameron Heyward, Keeanu Benton and Larry Ogunjobi are the starters. Dean Lowry and DeMarvin Leal flanking Montravius Adams in the second wave is fine. Isaiahh Loudermilk, Breiden Fehoko and Logan Lee are after that.\n\nGiven that Lowry was slowed down by an injury at the start of camp, I may slide Loudermilk in front of him. But that's splitting hairs.\n\nOutside linebackers\n\nT.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith are the starters. Nick Herbig and Jeremiah Moon are the top backups.\n\nMarkus Golden just resigned over the weekend. Don't be surprised if he overtakes Moon. However, defensive coordinator Teryl Austin has already said he likes what Moon could offer.\n\nPatrick Queen and Elandon Roberts are atop the depth chart as expected. But rookie Payton Wilson may warrant close to as many snaps as Roberts before too long.\n\nTyler Matakevich is still a valuable special teams asset, and I like Mark Robinson. I hope they both make the club.\n\nDeShon Elliott has been very impressive in camp thus far and is listed as the other starter at safety. But he and Damontae Kazee will see the field together quite a bit.\n\nBeanie Bishop is atop the depth chart as the nickelback. He and Kazee and Elliott will all be interchangeable at times.\n\nCory Trice and Darius Rush as the second-level outside corners is what I wanted to see. Ryan Watts is intriguing as a future piece, and Anthony Averett made plays once the ball was snapped.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Despite being able to boast 20 straight non-losing seasons the Steelers have found that consistently not being bad isn't very satisfying.\n\nWith the most eventful off-season the Steelers have had in years the franchise is starting to show that things need to change. Kenny Pickett came to the Steelers as a much hyped first round draft pick that tugged the heartstrings of the locals after being successful at Pitt. The Steelers showed their patient strategy of keeping head coaches doesn't apply to Quarterbacks. After just two years of subpar play from Pickett, the Steelers traded him across the state to the Eagles.\n\nThe Steelers replaced Pickett with two big names in the NFL. Russell Wilson coming to Pittsburgh is exciting regardless of how good he is in 2024. Having a Super Bowl winning QB, and one of the best at the position of the last decade should give the rest of the team a boost.\n\nWilson's best years are behind him, but his 2023 season in Denver showed that he still has plenty of quality in him to provide an upgrade over Pickett. Wilson had a touchdown to interception ratio of 26-8 in 2023. That stat looks fantastic next to the 13-13 ratio that Pickett had the last two seasons. Yes, Wilson threw for twice as many touchdown passes in one season than Pickett did in two seasons.\n\nThe other big name coming to the Steelers this year is former Bears first round pick and Ohio St star Justin Fields. Fields is often ridiculed for being just a running QB and some don't expect him to become a long-term starter in Pittsburgh. However, Fields is a great athlete with potential to become a star if Pittsburgh can use him correctly. At 25 years of age, Fields is the closest thing the Steelers have had to a long-term answer at QB since Big Ben.\n\nBoth players give the Steelers solid options at a position they haven't been comfortable in since 2018. Wilson and Fields have also come cheaply. The Steelers are only paying Wilson two million in 2024 as the Broncos are paying the other 38 million owed to him. Fields only cost the Steelers a sixth-round pick in a trade with the Bears, a bargain for a young former first round QB.\n\nThe old-school Pittsburgh Steelers fans that saw Franco Harris and Rocky Blier run behind a Mike Webster led O-line should love the 2024 Steelers offense. \"We just want to roll people man, to be honest with you guys,\" Steelers Head Coach Mike Tomlin said in April via SteelersWire.com. \"We have some backs that we like. We have a good offensive line.\"\n\nFormer Falcons Head Coach Arthur Smith joins the Steelers this year as their new offensive coordinator. Smith is known for his success running the ball. The last four drafts the Steelers have used first round picks on a running back and two offensive linemen. The Steelers need to see the fruit from those investments. With Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren being one of the best RB duos in the NFL, as well as having new additions to the offensive line, there is no excuse for failure in the run game in 2024.\n\nThe Steelers have always been strong at the WR position since Tomlin arrived in Pittsburgh. However, this might be the weakest the position has been in his tenure. George Pickens is a boom or bust receiver who either has monster games or fails to even get 40 yards receiving depending on the day.\n\nAfter trading away Diontae Johnson, the Steelers are left with questions behind what hopefully will be a pro-bowler in Pickens. Rookie Roman Wilson from Michigan has the speed and quickness to be very productive. Other receiving options are Calvin Austin III and recently acquired Van Jefferson. TE Pat Freiermuth had a disappointing 2023 with injuries and lack of production. He needs to get back to being a reliable tight end to give the Steelers a playmaker downfield and in the red zone.\n\nThe Steelers might not even be set at the WR position for 2024. All offseason there has been attention directed towards disgruntled 49ers All-Pro WR Brandon Aiyuk. Aiyuk recently requested a trade, and the Steelers are apparently in the mix alongside several other NFL teams for his services. If the Steelers can land Aiyuk, they may have a chance to become a top 10 offense in the NFL.\n\nAll signs point to a much more enticing offense than years past. The hope is that there will be enough scoring to complement a tough defense that will eliminate stress over possibly getting a playoff spot come week 18.\n\nWith preseason football beginning, it's time to get excited about what the Steelers could look like in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "bradfordera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Bradford Era"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

All the ingredients point to a dominant Houston performance and the over hitting at 37.5 points.\n\nNFL football is back, and with it, the return of NFL betting. Well, NFL preseason football betting is back at least.\n\nWhile the number of available markets for each matchup is not nearly as extensive as it is during the regular and postseasons, there is still money to be made, and we're going to help you make it.\n\nOn Friday night, the Pittsburgh Steelers open their preseason slate by hosting the Houston Texans , who have already had the pleasure of playing (most of) a preseason game last week in the Hall of Fame Game, which they dropped 21-17 before weather forced the game to an early end.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers vs. Houston Texans Game Info\n\nWhen\n\nFriday, August 9\n\nWhere\n\nAcrisure Stadium\n\nTime\n\n7:00PM\n\nLocation\n\nPittsburgh, PA\n\nTV\n\nFOX/NFL Network\n\nStream\n\nGame Pass\n\nWe'll break down which team has the edge in this exhibition contest, and while there are no player props to bet on at the time of writing, we've got you covered with point total over/under and point spread picks.\n\nAll odds courtesy of Bet365 sportsbook.\n\nRelated\n\nNFL Trade Rumors: Steelers' Mike Tomlin All But Confirms Brandon Aiyuk Negotiations\n\nThe Brandon Aiyuk sweepstakes are heating up, and Tomlin's Steelers are one of the only teams left standing.\n\nSteelers vs. Texans Offseason Moves & Recent News\n\nThese two teams made a lot of moves in the spring and summer\n\nThe biggest change to the Steelers' roster came in the form of a completely revamped QB room, trading the trio of Kenny Pickett, Mitch Trubisky, and Mason Rudolph for the much more experienced and exciting triumvirate of Russell Wilson, Justin Fields, and Kyle Allen.\n\nElsewhere, the Steelers traded wide receiver Diontae Johnson, and have been in need of a WR2 ever since, which has led to much trade speculation. The most potent rumors surround San Francisco 49ers wideout Brandon Aiyuk, who has requested a trade and publicly said he'd like to play in Pittsburgh. However, Pittsburgh's lack of assets to send the other way may make that deal tough.\n\nHouston was also being aggressive in free agency and the trade market, adding big names like Stefon Diggs, Joe Mixon, and Danielle Hunter to an already burgeoning roster of young talent.\n\nThe team now has arguably the best receiving corps in the league with Diggs, Nico Collins, and Tank Dell, while their pass rush has been restocked with Hunter playing next to 2023 Defensive Rookie of the Year Will Anderson Jr.\n\nConsidering they were already a 10-win team last year and are playing in the worst division in football, those big moves have made them the popular pick around the league as the new top challengers to take down the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC.\n\nSteelers vs. Texans Preseason Picks\n\nGIVEMESPORT makes our picks and backs them up\n\nPoint Spread/Moneyline\n\nUsually, this is where we'd break down all the relevant betting trends for each team, but considering this is the first preseason game for Pittsburgh and the second for Houston (though they didn't complete that one), there isn't much to go on but previous preseason performances (and there are no archival records for preseason spreads, unsurprisingly). They're not a great indicator anyway, but here they are, in all their glory:\n\nPittsburgh is 9-1 SU in the preseason over the last three years Houston is 7-3 SU in the preseason over the last three years, including this year's HOF game Pittsburgh is 4-0 SU at home in the preseason over the last three years Houston is 5-0 SU on the road in the preseason over the last three years\n\nSteelers vs. Texans\n\nTeam\n\nMoneyline\n\nSpread\n\nTotal\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n\n+110\n\n+2.5 (-110)\n\nO37.5 (-110)\n\nHouston Texans\n\n-130\n\n-2.5 (-110)\n\nU137.5 (-110)\n\nWhile Wilson is currently slated to be QB1 for Pittsburgh, he will not play against the Texans as he deals with a calf issue, so Fields will get his best chance yet to make his claim for the top spot. Fans can expect to see the former Buckeye play significant snaps on Friday night considering his situation on the depth chart.\n\nPittsburgh also strengthened their offensive line, secondary, and linebacking corps through the draft and free agency, though, as usual, Tomlin has been tight-lipped about how much most of those new additions will play against Houston.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: Pittsburgh has not lost in the preseason since August 2021, when they fell 34-9 in their final game of that preseason. That was their only loss, however, as they finished the 2021 exhibition slate 3-1.\n\nWhat we do know, is that Pittsburgh's defense will be without most of its stars. T.J. Watt, Cameron Heyward, Minkah Fitzpatrick, Alex Highsmith, and Patrick Queen will not play, and on the offensive side veteran guard Isaac Seumalo is getting the night off as well.\n\nConversely, Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said that his first-stringers will get a couple of drives to loosen up at Acrisure on Friday, which gives them an instant advantage, especially on defense, where the Steelers are sidelining half their starting lineup, at least. Diggs, however, did suffer what seemed to be a minor injury at practice this week, so he might be held out.\n\nHouston has already played a preseason game to boot, which means the players that will be getting the lion's share of the snaps are more fresh than their backup counterparts from Pittsburgh.\n\nNot to mention that last year when these two teams met, it was an absolute debacle for the Steelers, who fell 30-6 to Stroud and company in an embarrassing effort. It's also worth noting that Fields will be operating in his first semi-competitive game in Arthur Smith's new system, while Stroud is more than familiar with Bobby Slowik's scheme on the other side. This one could be over early.\n\nPrediction: Texans ML (-130) and Texans -2.5 Point Spread (-110)\n\nPoint Total Over/Under\n\nPreseason totals are notoriously low, and this matchup is no different, set at a 37.5 mark that would usually be the lowest across the league during most regular season weeks. However, with Houston expected to play their starters for a couple of drives against the Steelers' backup defense, this one feels like it should be higher.\n\n6 of Pittsburgh's last 10 preseason games have gone over 37.5 points 3 of Houston's last 10 preseason games have gone over 37.5 points\n\nHouston's backup QBs, Case Keenum and Davis Mills, already proved their preseason mettle with dual near-perfect performances in nearly three quarters during the Hall of Fame Game. They scored 17 in that one with a quarter-plus still to go.\n\nWith Fields under center and Najee Harris expected to be very limited, Pittsburgh's offense may be a hindrance to the over, but once Houston's backup defenders come in they should be able to put up a couple of scores to get us there.\n\nPrediction: Over 37.5 Total Points\n\nSteelers vs. Texans Final Betting Picks\n\nTexans ML (-130) Texans -2.5 Point Spread (-110) Over 37.5 Total Points\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.\n\nRelated\n\nCan Cam Akers Bounce Back From Torn

He's missed a little more than a week with an apparent ankle injury, robbing him of valuable practice and preseason playing time. Following his injury, there were no specifics given regarding Wilson's injury but it was believed to be something that could keep him out a few weeks.\n\nLuckily for the Steelers, Wilson's recovery seems to be going well. Hopefully, they will be able to get him back onto the field very soon. That would be a huge boost for the team, who are still trying to figure out how exactly their receiver depth chart will shake out.\n\nWhile he is still not participating in practice, Wilson made visible strides. He was previously wearing a walking boot, but he was spotted at the Steelers' most recent practice without it. This a huge step for Wilson's progress and sign that his ankle is responding well. ESPN's Brooke Pryor shared a picture of Wilson in tennis shoes at Steelers' practice via her X account.\n\nThe Steelers selected Roman Wilson in the third round of the 2024 NFL Draft out of the University of Michigan. He was a standout receiver at Michigan, collecting over 1,700 yards and 20 touchdowns during his college career.\n\nThe 6'0, shifty receiver is poised to play a large role in the Steelers offense as a rookie due to being one of the most NFL ready receivers to come out of the NCAA.

According to Texans' reporter Aaron Wilson, more than two dozen names will sit out, including several starting offensive linemen.\n\nTunsil is the team's anchor at left tackle but has battled knee injuries dating back to last season. Houston is in no need to rush him ahead of their regular season opener. Howard is a former first round pick at right tackle, meaning the team will start backups to protect QB C.J. Stroud's 2024 debut.\n\nPer Wilson, the Texans will turn to Blake Fisher and Nick Broeker as their bookend tackles tonight.\n\nFisher is the team's second round pick of the 2024 draft. Blocked by Joe Alt at Notre Dame, Fisher primarily played right tackle but is receiving work at left tackle to begin his NFL career. Broeker is a former seventh round pick who has played guard and tackle. They're matchups the Steelers could take advantage of, though T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith won't play in the Steelers' opener. Instead, Nick Herbig figures to be one of the starting outside linebackers while it's unclear who could start opposite of him. Veteran Markus Golden missed the last two days of practice, potentially opening the door for Jeremiah Moon or Kyron Johnson to get the nod.\n\nElsewhere, Anderson is one of the teams top pass rushers, a top-five selection a year ago and last year's Defensive Rookie of the Year. Houston signed former Minnesota Vikings DE Danielle Hunter in free agency, giving them one of football's top pass rush tandems.\n\nKing briefly played for the Steelers last year, seeing work as a return man and playing all of one defensive snap where defensive miscommunication gave up a touchdown in Week 5 to the Baltimore Ravens. After being cut by Pittsburgh the following week, King rejoined the Texans and played a key defensive role late in the regular season and during the team's pair of playoff games.\n\nPittsburgh is expected to play most of their starters tonight though at least seven players, including QB Russell Wilson, DE Cam Heyward, and LB Patrick Queen, will sit out. Kickoff is set for 7 PM/EST tonight. The game will be shown locally and on NFL Network.\n\nRelated Items:Aaron Wilson, Houston Texans, Laremy Tunsil, Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you Despite Concussion History, Pat Freiermuth Says He Won't Wear Guardian Caps 'In Any Type Of Game' Steelers Vs.

Golden expressed an appreciation to return after playing for Pittsburgh last season, notching four sacks in backup action. Speaking to reporters after being re-signed, Golden said he momentarily felt retired after spending the offseason as a free agent and enjoyed spending time with his family.\n\nGolden only participated in a few practices after being signed.

Clearly, that was related to his decision to retire.\n\nA second round pick of the Arizona Cardinals in 2015, Markus Golden appeared in 127 career games. He recorded 51 career sacks, including a season-high 12.5 as a sophomore in 2016. He had a late-career resurgence with the Cardinals in 2021, picking up 11 sacks.\n\nFor the Steelers, he appeared in 16 games last season, recording 20 tackles and four sacks. He was competing for a backup spot this year but wasn't going to chart higher than No. 4 on the depth chart behind T.J. Watt, Alex Highsmith, and Nick Herbig.\n\nWith Golden's designation, the Steelers have an open roster spot on their 91-man roster.\n\nRelated Items:Markus Golden, Pittsburgh Steelers, Trending, weekly Recommended for you Carney: Five Key Roster Bubble Players To Watch In Steelers' Preseason Opener First Steelers Preseason Game Weekend: Steelers Friday Night Five Questions Russini: Mike Tomlin Sticking With Russell Wilson No Matter What Is 'Worst Thing He Could Possibly Do'", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_kozora@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Alex Kozora", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Golden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Markus Golden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tomlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tomlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Watt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

It will be the second preseason game for the Texans who lost the Hall of Fame game to the Chicago Bears due to inclement weather. The Steelers will take the field for the first time in exhibition. After observations from training camp at St. Vincent College, we selected five Steelers players to watch in the upcoming game. And, truthfully, everyone on the team will be worth watching now that football is back.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nDue to a tight hamstring, Russell Wilson has been slowly working into the revamped Steelers offense under Arthur Smith. That has left the door open for Fields to get the majority of snaps.\n\nFields has received mostly positive evaluation from camp reports, but in-game situations should provide fans with an opportunity to gauge how much of an asset the young quarterback will be to Pittsburgh. He's likely to open the game and play at least one quarter before Kyle Allen and John Rhys Plumlee - battling for the QB3 spot - are given opportunities.\n\n\"When (Fields) breaks the pocket he is dangerous and he can turn a bad play into a really good play really fast.\" - defensive coordinator Teryl Austin\n\nThere's really no reason to rush Wilson in to play in this week's preseason game, so expectations are very low that he'll dress.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nYes, we're talking about a group here instead of a player, but that's because there was an impetus in the off-season to build a formidable, determined offensive line. Tackle Troy Fautanu, center Zach Frazier, and guard Mason McCormick are likely to get their opportunities to show what they've developed through camp so far. That doesn't mean they'll play the entirety of the game as the coaching staff want to see how different personnel work together in this group.\n\n\"O-line wise, it's always five-wheel drive. You really need about seven, eight, nine guys that everybody can trust and are accountable.\" - guard Isaac Seumalo\n\nNate Herbig, who has taken the most snaps at center during camp, is likely to start things off on the line, but shuffling will be a big part of testing this group in a real game situation.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThere's plenty of competition in a deep wide receivers group for the coveted WR2 spot. George Pickens is the presumptive WR1 among this group, but the Steelers need playmakers (at a minimum four starters) at the position.\n\nJefferson last played with the Atlanta Falcons and Los Angeles Rams but brought with him experience. Friday should provide an opportunity for him to move up from an already good camp. If he fails to impress, there are others - like Calvin Austin and Dez Fitzpatrick - looking for their shot to solidify a spot on the regular season roster.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nGranted, Lee is a rookie and probably not the first player you'd put on your list of Steelers to watch. Here's why you should:\n\nWith coaches resting Larry Ogunjobi and Keeanu Benton recently, the Steelers have asked more from Isaiahh Loudermilk and Lee on the defensive line. In a post-practice meeting with the media, Tomlin said, \"It's always good when guys get an opportunity to (pit their skills against more established guys) and to have some success. I thought some of those defensive linemen up front really represented themselves well.\"\n\nPittsburgh wants to field a defense that is strong up front and able to stuff runs. Lee will get an opportunity to showcase the ability he showed in college, at Iowa, to be around the ball and hitting gaps with decisiveness.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe Steelers are invested in better field position, and Johnston will get an opportunity to show why Pittsburgh desired his punting skills. No, punter usually isn't on the list of players to watch, but against his former team... Johnston will give fans a better view of skill than Pressley Harvin did.", "source": {"uri": "steelcityunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steel City Underground"}, "authors": [],

Watt and Alex Highsmith. Golden was the top veteran backup in 2023 when he totaled four sacks and 20 tackles in 6 games.\n\nGolden spent most of his 10 NFL seasons with the Arizona Cardinals.

He totaled 51 sacks in his career.\n\nGolden's retirement leaves former Baltimore Ravens outside linebacker Jeremiah Moon and former practice squad player Kyron Johnson as the Steelers' top options behind Herbig. Jacoby Windmon and Julius Welschof also are on the initial depth chart that coach Mike Tomlin released earlier in the week.\n\nGolden didn't rejoin the Steelers until Aug. 1, and he said he spent the spring and first two months of summer at home with his two young children.\n\n\"I was starting to feel like I was a little retired,\" Golden said, laughing, \"but it was cool to hang out with my kids.\"\n\nGolden indicated that he had a verbal agreement to return to the Steelers when they were ready to bring him to camp.\n\n\"The older you get in this league, this is year 10. ...

Don't expect the Steelers to do anything all that crazy though, as head coach Mike Tomlin said he just wants the team to get familiar with the rule, and as a result, they're going to \"hit it right down the fairway.\"\n\n\"More than anything, I'm not trying to get too much accomplished. We're going to hit it right down the fairway, if you will. This is our first exposure to it. I want to make sure first that the guys understand the play, the rules of the play, the things that are significant in terms of the design of the play. Those are the things that really have my attention. Less about strategy, what we intend to do as we move into the fall, or what the Joneses are up to, we just want to dip our toe in the water initially,\" Tomlin told Bob Labriola of Steelers.com.\n\nFor one, the Steelers likely don't want to give up any intel or a sneak peek of anything they might do if they do have something up their sleeve. Additionally, it's a new rule and something new for every player, so during their first in-game action, it makes sense for the team to keep things basic. The last thing Pittsburgh wants to make a habit is penalties on the kickoff or kick return, so giving the players time to know what to do and what the rules are involved will help minimize the risk of a potential penalty.\n\nThroughout the league, most teams are taking the route of just kicking the ball off like they normally would and not experimenting with anything different, and that will likely be the case for much of the preseason. The Texans will be playing their second preseason game as they already played in the Hall of Fame game last week, so they'll be much more familiar with the new kickoff rule given they already have in-season experience with it.\n\nThere are a number of ways the Steelers can look to kick the ball off and try to get creative on that side, and they can also look to get creative on the blocking side. As Tomlin said, the preseason is less about what the Steelers might actually plan to do, and tonight, especially, it is more about familiarity with the rule. So just because it might be a bit of a boring play tonight from Pittsburgh's side doesn't mean it'll be that way all season, although don't expect the Steelers to be ok with a touchback this year.\n\nRelated Items:", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_clark@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Joe Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tomlin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tomlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_specialist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Return specialist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Chris-Boswell-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797065", "eventUri": "eng-9797065", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Texans Preseason Game 1 Preview: 2024 Draft Picks", "body": "In anticipation to the Pittsburgh Steelers' first preseason game on Friday, I wanted to look at a few things before I can dive into information after the game. In the preseason, we get an opportunity to see more action from younger players generally, so I wanted to put a table together of how the 2024 draft played out for Pittsburgh and the Houston Texans heading into the game:\n\nOther than getting a reminder of how the draft went for both teams, I also saw some fun takeaways. The Steelers made seven selections, while Houston came away with nine players.\n\nPittsburgh invested more picks and earlier draft slots on offense, while the Texans did so on defense. Houston also lacked a first-round pick, but did have two selections in the second. Neither team picked in the fifth round, and the Texans had a slew of five picks in the final two rounds.\n\nHouston appeared in the Hall of Fame game last Thursday night, so we also have the benefit of seeing who played and how they fared in that game action.\n\nLet's zoom in on Houston's draft further. Their first selection was at pick #42 in the second round, Georgia CB Kamari Lassiter. Reports have seemed positive on his offseason and what he could bring to their secondary as a rookie. Unfortunately though, a soft-tissue injury has delayed his first NFL game action, and seems unlikely to go against Pittsburgh.\n\nDouble dipping in the second round, Notre Dame OT Blake Fisher was made a Texan at pick #59. This is likely a familiar name for draft followers, considering the heavy OL scouting and investments Pittsburgh's 2024 draft entailed. The versatile lineman has seen elevated reps in training camp with star OT Laremy Tunsil missing time, tying for a team lead in snaps in the Hall of Fame Game last week, when he seemingly had a stronger day as a run blocker.\n\nThen at pick 78 in the third-round, Houston selected USC Safety Calen Bullock. He's reportedly been making plays in training camp, and started the Hall of Fame game, playing 19 snaps. Tackling ability has seemingly been a positive in camp and showed in the game last week.\n\nAfter a bit of a wait, the Texans went back to offense with Ohio State TE Cade Stover at pick #123. It's seemingly been a good offseason, drawing praise from his head coach, reportedly showing toughness and meeting their expectations thus far. He played quite a bit in the HOF game, catching two of his three targets for 26 yards.\n\nFollowing no fifth-round pick, Houston made two selections in the sixth. First was Oregon LB Jamal Hill. The former safety shifted to linebacker later in his college career, where he's continuing his journey so far as a Texan. Hill really seemed to struggle in his preseason debut last week and will be interesting to see him against Pittsburgh.\n\nThe following sixth-round pick was Louisville RB Jawhar Jordan (pick # 205). He had three rushing attempts for minimal yardage, and a kick return for 15 yards in the Hall of Fame Game last week.\n\nThen, Houston stockpiled three picks in the seventh round to complete their 2024 draft. The men were USC DL Solomon Byrd, Auburn DL Marcus Harris, and Michigan OL LaDarius Henderson. Byrd and Harris got their first NFL action last week, with the former getting slightly more opportunity and seemingly a better game as well, while Henderson was waived earlier in the offseason (non-football injury).\n\nOf course, I'm even more excited to see the Pittsburgh Steelers rookie class.\n\nFor the second draft in a row, the Steelers selected an offensive tackle in the first round: Washington's OT Troy Fautanu at pick #20. He has impressed overall in camp this offseason, including a recent extended look as first team right tackle. That would obviously be huge if Fautanu demonstrates readiness to start right away come the regular season.\n\nSimilarly, West Virginia C Zach Frazier was expected to become the starting center once he was selected at 51st overall in the second round. He has been stout in the middle per new OC Arthur Smith, but veteran teammate Nate Herbig has also had a strong camp at the position.\n\nThat will be interesting to watch unfold, along with how the high draft investments on the offensive line begin their NFL journey.\n\nWith two selections in the third round, the Steelers chose Michigan WR Roman Wilson at #84 overall. With depth lacking in Pittsburgh's WR room, substantial opportunities for meaningful roles are up for grabs this season. Wilson was showing promise, but unfortunately sustained an ankle injury that has him sidelined. Encouragingly, he recently shed his ankle brace, inching closer to return.\n\nThen, Pittsburgh stuck with another Wilson at 98th overall: NC State LB Payton Wilson. He has showcased his first-round talent in training camp, standing out on defense during practice. Those abilities were available to the Steelers namely due to injury history, which knock-on-wood pays off for Pittsburgh, considering the position being riddled with injuries last season.\n\nOn day three of the draft, the Steelers triple dipped along the offensive line, this time with South Dakota State OL Mason McCormick at 119th in the fourth round. Namely a guard in college, a concern is the level of competition he faced. Head coach Mike Tomlin stated that McCormick has gotten better in a hurry transitioning to the NFL. Can't wait to see the youthful o-linemen in-stadium.\n\nAfter a lull with no fifth-round pick, Iowa DL Logan Lee was the first of two sixth-round picks, remaining in the Black and Gold in Pittsburgh. Encouragingly, our own Alex Kozora mentioned him in one of his excellent Steelers training camp diaries as Mr. Versatile, spending time at defensive end, nose tackle, kick returns, kick coverage, long snapping, and blocker on field goals. Should be easy to spot on Friday night.\n\nPittsburgh's final draft selection was Texas DB Ryan Watts, pick 195 in the sixth round. The big story is a position change, a CB in college that is making the switch to safety. Watts stated that teammate DeShon Elliott took me under his wing to learn the safety position, and can't wait to see what that looks like in stadiums.\n\nNFL games are finally back (albeit pre-season), and I can't wait to see how the 2024 draft class looks to open the gates.\n\nWhich rookies are you most excited to see? Who are your favorites to perform well (if they play)? How about non-rookies? Thanks for reading and let me know your thoughts in the comments.\n\nRelated Items:2024 NFL Draft, 2024 Preseason, Houston Texans, Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you Six Steelers Who Need Strong

So far in training camp, he's been able to show off that power and that edge, earning some praise from his coaches and teammates for his strength and feistiness.\n\nNow, outside of training camp, we'll get to see him against opponents on the field, where we can really, truly evaluate play in the trenches. He's not going to get any run with the first-team offense, but he has a real chance to open some eyes with the second unit and help the Steelers run the football in offensive coordinator Arthur Smith's scheme.\n\nC ZACH FRAZIER -- HANDLING BULL RUSHES\n\nAt times so far in training camp, Frazier has had some issues with power from pass rushers. He's been pushed around at times, particularly with bull rushes.\n\nIt's been a problem dating back to his time at West Virginia, and it has shown up again early in training camp. Frazier's problem against power rushes has been his tendency to catch rushers. He did that quite a bit in college, but in Pittsburgh, he has had to adjust to offensive line coach Pat Meyer's scheme, where linemen are asked to take the fight to pass rushers in pass protection.\n\nSo far, Frazier has been on a learning curve. Add in the concerns with length, and it's understandable why he struggled early on with power. He's improved in recent days in training camp, though. Now, it's time to see if that improvement translates to the game, where he should see reps against powerful defensive tackles McTelvin Agim, Tim Settle Jr., Kurt Hinish, and Khalil Davis at times.\n\nLB PAYTON WILSON -- ABILITY TO BEAT BLOCKS AGAINST THE RUN\n\nComing out of North Carolina State, Payton Wilson's testing numbers and production were jaw-dropping. He should have been a fringe first-round pick if not for his medical concerns, considering his size, speed, and tape. Fortunately for the Steelers, he fell to them in the third round at No. 98 overall and looks like quite the steal.\n\nEarly on in training camp Wilson has flashed quite a bit, flying around all over the field, drawing attention and praise from coaches and teammates. He certainly looks the part so far in training camp. Now, he should get plenty of run against the Texans, which will have a ton of eyes on him.\n\nI want to see how Wilson can beat blocks against the run and let that speed and athleticism play. He had issues with that in college at times and didn't play up to his size and length when taking on blockers on occasion. He hasn't really had that problem in training camp, but in-game is much different from a training camp setting.\n\nThe arrow is putting straight up for Wilson. Let's see him do it in-game at the NFL level.\n\nIOL MASON MCCORMICK -- SNAP COUNT AND USAGE\n\nNo rookie in the class has generated more buzz in recent days than McCormick, who has seen some starting reps at left guard at times, with veteran Isaac Seumalo getting veteran days off. Head coach Mike Tomlin praised McCormick for \"getting better in a hurry\" moving from the FCS level to the NFL, so there is obviously plenty to be pleased with so far with McCormick.\n\nI'll be watching how much he plays and where on Friday night. We know that his toughness and nastiness translate to the NFL, considering he started the first fight of camp going after Patrick Queen and Elandon Roberts after a late hit on Justin Fields.\n\nNow, I want to see him handle extended reps in-stadium while also moving around the interior of the offensive line. Currently, he's listed as the backup to James Daniels at right guard, but he should see some time at both left and right guard Friday night, similar to how the Steelers utilized Spencer Anderson one season ago.\n\nDE LOGAN LEE -- HAND USAGE RUSHING THE PASSER\n\nOne of Logan Lee's calling cards coming out of Iowa was his impressive hand usage and ability to stay clean and win quickly at the point of attack. He did that throughout his career at Iowa, and it really stood out at the East-West Shrine Bowl.\n\nSo far in training camp, he hasn't really shown that. Though he's done a nice job at times defending the run and setting the edge, he hasn't really shown much as a pass rusher and is buried on the depth chart at defensive end.\n\nWith Cameron Heyward sitting out and Dean Lowry still on Active/PUP, Lee should get plenty of run Friday night, which will be a huge opportunity for him. On the field, Lee needs to show something as a pass rusher. He needs to create some splash if he wants to earn a roster spot.\n\nDoing so as a pass rusher Friday night against the Texans should give him an early boost.\n\nS RYAN WATTS -- PLAYING IN A TRUE BOX SAFETY ROLE\n\nAt Texas, Ryan Watts was primarily a cornerback who had great size for the position and physicality. He struggled in coverage at times, though, especially with long speed, which led to his transition to safety. So far in training camp, Watts has handled the move well and has made some plays in recent days, picking off two passes so far at training camp.\n\nNow, he needs to carry over his play in training camp to the preseason opener against the Texans, where he is likely going to see a bunch of snaps in that box safety role. He has the physicality, tackles very well, and has shown a nose for play-making so far in his time with the Steelers in training camp.\n\nBut, as is common so far in this article, in-stadium is so much different from a practice setting. Watts should see a bunch of snaps Friday night against Houston as a young player fighting for a roster spot. I want to see how he handles the box role, defending the run and handling some coverage snaps against tight ends and slot receivers.\n\nHe's handled that role well in training camp so far, so I want to keep a close eye on how he does against a new opponent. It would not shock me if he makes a splash play or two, building off of a strong week in Latrobe.\n\nRelated Items:2024 NFL Draft, Houston Texans, Logan Lee, Mason McCormick, Payton Wilson, Pittsburgh

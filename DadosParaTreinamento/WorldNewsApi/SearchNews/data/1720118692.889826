Doubles from Mallory Swanson and Tierna Davidson secured victory for former Chelsea boss Hayes in front of a sold-out crowd of 19,010 in Colorado. Four-time Olympic champions the US are building towards this summer\u2019s Paris Games, which begin late next month. \u201cI think you can see we\u2019re building something,\u201d Hayes was quoted as saying by ESPN. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of work to do. There\u2019s lots of holes in our play, no question, but it was a good start. Everybody did what I asked of them.\u201d A fortnight on from guiding Chelsea to a fifth consecutive Women\u2019s Super League title \u2013 and seventh of her 12-year tenure \u2013 Hayes took her first steps in international management. Forward Swanson opened the scoring in the 34th minute at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City before defender Davidson headed home to double the advantage just four minutes later. Colorado-born Swanson provided the assist for Davidson to double her tally early in the second period before rounding off a memorable debut for Hayes 16 minutes from time. \u201cIn terms of what I had asked from the group, what we prepared for, the execution of that, we\u2019ve made steps in the right direction,\u201d added Hayes. \u201cI felt for the first 30 minutes, it was technical execution where we struggled. We scored in our first three chances, so we were efficient, we were clinical.\u201d The US face South Korea again on Tuesday at Allianz Field in St Paul, Minnesota.", "summary": "<p>USA downed South Korea 4-0 as they build towards the Olympic Games in Paris later this summer </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/emma-hayes-usa-south-korea-olympics-b2555202.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/02/13/SEI207029642.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:11:14", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.019}

England manager Gareth Southgate took a \"calculated risk\" in including Shaw in the squad, knowing the Manchester United defender had not played since February and only featured in 15 games across all competitions this past season due to injury.

And now we're seeing the results of that.\" Gordon missed Newcastle's last game of the Premier League season with an ankle injury. After Tuesday's 0-0 draw with Slovenia, Shaw was asked whether he was fit, and he said \"next game\".

Kieran Trippier started each game at left back but because he is right-footed and so tends to look inside, play down the left flank stalled. Shaw enjoys playing attacking football, while Trippier has played much deeper with England. At the 2022 Qatar World Cup, the 28-year-old Shaw was one of six England players who spent most of each game in the opponents' half.

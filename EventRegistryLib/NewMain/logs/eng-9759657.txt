As a result, the 21-year-old has become a major doubt for the Blaugrana's pre-season tour in the United States.\n\nAfter a trophyless 2023-24 season, Barcelona are looking to return to winning ways under the tutelage of new manager Hansi Flick. The former Bayern Munich boss has been closely monitoring his squad in training but can only fully evaluate them during pre-season matches against top teams.\n\nAs has become the norm over the last few years, the Blaugrana will pack their bags and jet off to the United States for their three-match pre-season tour. This phase is important for both players and the manager, as it would help the Catalans finalize their for the upcoming season.\n\nBarcelona were already going to be without most of the players who participated in the 2024 European Championship and Copa America 2024. Now, another member of the squad has become a major doubt for the tour.\n\nThrough an official statement, Barcelona confirmed a fresh setback for their No. 10 Fati.\n\nThe club revealed:\n\n\"In training today (July 24), first-team player Ansu Fati suffered a foot injury. He will undergo conservative treatment in Barcelona and his return to training will be determined by his recovery time.\"\n\nThis injury comes as a massive blow for Fati, who has fallen down the pecking order at Barcelona. The left-winger, who was once one of the first names on the team sheet, has seen his development stunned after enduring a series of setbacks.\n\nFormer Barcelona manager Xavi approved his loan to Brighton & Hove Albion last summer, hoping a fresh challenge would revive him. However, the move ultimately turned out to be a disaster, as he failed to win the trust of Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi. Throughout the 2023-24 season, Fati only played 27 matches for the club in all competitions, scoring four times. The left-winger also suffered a calf injury during his time in England, which caused him to miss 13 matches.\n\nMany expected Barcelona to sell Fati in the summer transfer window. However, as per reports, he impressed Flick and his staff in pre-season training, compelling them to give him another shot. A string of convincing performances in the pre-season tour could have helped Fati regain his place in the team. But the fresh leg injury has thrown a spanner in the works.\n\nBarcelona begin their pre-season tour in the US with a clash against Manchester City on July 30. They will then take on Real Madrid (August 3) before finishing the tour with a clash against AC Milan (August 6).", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sushan_chakraborty@sportslens.com", "name": "Sushan Chakraborty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansu_Fati", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ansu Fati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansi_Flick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hansi Flick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_De_Zerbi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roberto De Zerbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

The young forward, who has struggled with injuries since his breakthrough at Camp Nou, has picked up a new foot injury during pre-season training. This latest issue comes after a disappointing loan spell at Brighton, where Fati's potential remained largely untapped due to persistent fitness problems.\n\nFati's career has been a rollercoaster since he first dazzled fans at 16 in 2019. His early performances were marked by exceptional talent and promise, quickly earning him a spot in Barcelona's first team. However, his rise was abruptly halted by a serious meniscus tear in his knee in 2020. The injury sidelined him for nearly a year, requiring surgery and extensive rehabilitation. Fati has struggled to regain his previous form despite his return, with recurring hamstring and muscle injuries further hampering his progress.\n\nBarcelona decided to loan Fati to Brighton last summer, hoping that a change of environment might reignite his career. Unfortunately, his time at the Premier League club was marred by yet another injury. A recurring hamstring problem saw him sidelined for three months, limiting his playing time to just over 1,000 minutes during his loan spell. The setback was frustrating for Fati, who had hoped to use the opportunity to build his fitness and showcase his skills in a competitive league.\n\nBarcelona's latest update on Ansu Fati\n\nAs Fati returned to Barcelona for pre-season training, he was determined to impress the new manager, Hansi Flick, and secure his place in the squad. However, his preparations were interrupted by a new injury. Barcelona released an official statement regarding Fati's condition: \"In Tuesday's training session, first-team player Ansu Fati injured the sole of his right foot. He will follow a conservative treatment plan in Barcelona, and his return to training will be decided by his recovery.\"\n\nThis fresh injury is particularly frustrating for Fati, as it comes at a crucial time. He had been looking forward to the pre-season as a chance to start afresh and demonstrate his readiness for the upcoming season. The injury delays his return to full fitness and casts uncertainty over his future at Barcelona.\n\nDespite Fati's expressed desire to stay and succeed with the Catalan giants, the club's management has reportedly informed him that he is not part of Hansi Flick's plans for the season. This has led to speculation that Barcelona might look to sell Fati this summer. Interest has been reported from several clubs, including Fenerbahce, where manager Jose Mourinho is considering a move for the forward. Mourinho's interest suggests that Fati's talent is still highly regarded despite his recent struggles.\n\nIf Fati's injury proves to be serious, he could face a prolonged period of uncertainty. The possibility of being stuck in limbo until the January transfer window opens could be a significant blow to his career ambitions. The young forward's journey has been marked by considerable highs and lows, and this latest setback is another challenge in his quest to live up to the expectations associated with Barcelona's iconic No. 10 jersey.\n\nAs Fati navigates this difficult period, he and Barcelona will hope for a swift recovery.

Lamine Yamal has achieved superstar status at only 17 years of age by leading Spain to Euro 2024 glory, while international teammate Nico Williams has been heavily touted for a move to Catalonia.\n\nWilliams has been warned against a move to Barcelona by a current Athletic Club teammate, while Dani Olmo's release clause at RB Leipzig recently expired.\n\nBarca have also said goodbye to Sergi Roberto and Marcos Alonso following the expirations of their contracts, while Joao Felix and Joao Cancelo left after their loans came to an end.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansu_Fati", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ansu Fati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansi_Flick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hansi Flick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sevilla FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_Alonso_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcos Alonso (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergi_Roberto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergi Roberto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_Bilbao", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athletic Bilbao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u00e3o_Cancelo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jo\u00e3o Cancelo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Shinty", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Shinty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3408,h_1917,x_934,y_220/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01j3jfkyaxzt0jk04nht.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759657", "eventUri": "eng-9759657", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Many Greeks want the summit scheduled for Monday in Ankara between Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to be canceled.\n\nCriticism of Greece focuses on the official opening of the Church of St. Savior in Chora as a Muslim place of worship, four years after its conversion. The ancient site was a museum before its conversion into a mosque and is a United Nations protected monument, revered for its mosaic masterpieces.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan presided over the opening ceremony remotely last Monday from the presidential palace in Ankara.\n\nWhile the decision to open the site as a mosque drew praise from Turkey's Muslim faithful, it angered many Greeks, including Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.\n\nHe said Erdogan's decision was unnecessary and an insult.\n\nSpeaking after his meeting Thursday with Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, Mitsotakis said the church's conversion is rather an affront, as he put it, to the rich cultural history that Istanbul has to show at the crossroads of many civilizations.\n\nThe Holy Savior Church in Chora is the latest ancient church converted by Erdogan since he ordered in 2020 that Istanbul's prized landmark Hagia Sophia be transformed into a Muslim house of prayer.\n\nAnalysts see the conversions as part of an attempt by Erdogan to consolidate his ruling party's conservative and religious support base amid an economic slowdown gripping Turkey.\n\nThe latest conversion has also drawn criticism from the United States, with the State Department calling on Turkey to preserve the historic diversity of the monuments and allow access to them for all visitors.\n\nIn Athens, many political leaders are urging Mitsotakis to cancel a meeting he planned with Erdogan next week as part of a previously agreed plan to ease relations between the longtime foes.\n\nNikos Androulakis, the head of the Greek Socialist Party, is among those calling for the negotiations to be canceled.\n\nThere's no chance I'll go there, Androulakis said, adding: \"It's a provocation.\"\n\nThe prospect of canceling the negotiations is ruled out, Mitsotakis said.\n\nIt is imperative to keep all communication channels open, Mitsotakis said.\n\nHe went on to say: \"It is better for me to confront President Erdogan in person and express my strong opposition to this latest conversion, rather than let this matter trigger a new crisis between the two countries.\"\n\nRelations between Greece and Turkey have long been strained. The two neighbors and NATO members nearly went to war in 2020 over disputed energy reserves in the Mediterranean. They also disagree over the divided island of Cyprus; it is divided between a Turkish Cypriot north and a Greek Cypriot south.\n\nSince 1974, several efforts by the United Nations and the United States to reunify the island have failed.\n\nIn recent remarks, Erdogan said all issues could be resolved between Greece and Turkey. In December, Erdogan made an official visit to Greece, where he met with Prime Minister Mitsotakis. They agreed on several measures aimed at easing tensions.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Te PM expressed that the visit ought not be postponed and that communication channels must remain open stating that he will express his utmost dissatisfaction; Mr. Mitsotakis went on to express that it's preferable to avoid a crisis adding, that the specific choice of the Turkish president is unnecessary and misguided.

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister made it clear that Greece will not provide S-300 or Patriot missiles to Ukraine, as they are essential to Greece's defense. He also emphasized support for Ukraine, which faced unprovoked invasion, stating Greece has surplus defensive equipment but will not provide Patriots or S-300s.\n\nIn his comprehensive interview, Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced the creation of a panic button for teenagers as another tool to address bullying and violence among minors, following the platform for reporting already in operation with significant response from victims of such situations. The panic button, as the Prime Minister stated, will be available from the new school year.\n\nSee Also\n\nTurkey - Erdogan ahead of Mitsotakis' visit: There is no problem we cannot solve\n\nBefore the interview, Mr. Mitsotakis took notes as his government spokesperson, Pavlos Marinakis, informed him of the latest developments. Mr. Mitsotakis noted that attempts to create an anti-government atmosphere in churches during the Easter days failed, emphasising that there was no conflict with the Church, just disagreement, which was expected. He mentioned his good relationship with Archbishop Ieronymos and open issues with the Church.\n\nThirty-one days before the European elections, jokingly referring to a countdown clock, Mr. Mitsotakis noted that it's a matter of how to convince people to participate, estimating that as the election approaches, interest will increase, stressing the importance of postal voting. He suggested the possibility of implementing a mixed electoral system from the next European elections, combining a party list and a preference vote adding, that it's the citizens' responsibility to research and choose the candidates they will vote for.\n\n\"I believe in the cross and the citizens' responsibility,\" he said and continued, \"now there are 42 candidates running, there is citizen mobilisation; unlike the list, only the electable would run.\" He noted that for the next European elections, a mixed system should be reconsidered with some candidates as dominant and the rest with a preference vote.\n\nMr. Mitsotakis reiterated that the benchmark for evaluating the election result is 33% of the previous European elections, but he made it clear that he \"accepts the challenge\" posed by the opposition, emphasizing that he doesn't want a bad outcome for ND or himself. He supported a stable electoral cycle; his government is implementing a bold reform program. Moreover, regarding criticism that the first months after the elections show \"stagnation,\" he argued that a significant part of its program, especially economic measures, has already been implemented with salary and pension increases, a second increase in the minimum wage, measures to address party violence, measures to address bullying and delinquency among teenagers, as well as infrastructure programs with new roads delivered.\n\nHowever, he admitted that, \"there is an elephant in the room, and that is accuracy. Greece is not a protagonist in accuracy.\" The Prime Minister stressed, referring to measures the government has already taken with fines and constant checks in the market. He also mentioned interventions he has made, such as in the energy sector, saying that \"electricity is no longer a problem.\" Responding firmly to the criticism his government faces regarding the tragedy in Tempi, Mr. Mitsotakis stated, \"It's a lie, there was no attempt at cover-up. We trust the justice system; it acted swiftly.\"\n\nAnswering the question about the possibility of seeking a third term, Mr. Mitsotakis pointed out that the next elections are in three years, noting that ND is a party of power. \"Who knows what will happen until 2027,\" Mr. Mitsotakis says and notes that as long as he feels creative and energetic, there is no arrogance, but \"retirement is not on my mind.\"", "source": {"uri": "en.protothema.gr", "dataType": "news", "title": "protothemanews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriakos_Mitsotakis", "type":

Many Greeks want a summit scheduled for Monday in Ankara between Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to be canceled.\n\nGreece's criticism centers on the formal opening of the Church of St. Saviour in Chora as a Muslim house of worship, four years after it was converted. The ancient site was a museum before its conversion to a mosque and is a United Nations-protected monument revered for its mosaic masterpieces.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan presided remotely over the opening ceremony this past Monday from the presidential palace in Ankara.\n\nWhile the move to open the site as a mosque has won praise from the Muslim faithful in Turkey, it has angered many Greeks, among them Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.\n\nHe said Erdogan's decision is \"unnecessary\" and an insult.\n\nSpeaking after talks Thursday with Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, Mitsotakis said if anything, the church's conversion is an affront to, as he put it, the rich cultural history that Istanbul has to show for... at the crossroads of many civilizations.\n\nThe Church of St. Saviour in Chora is the latest ancient church that Erdogan has converted since ordering Istanbul's prized landmark, the Hagia Sophia, to be transformed in 2020 to a Muslim house of prayer.\n\nAnalysts view the conversions as part of an attempt by Erdogan to consolidate the conservative and religious support base of his ruling party amid an economic downturn gripping Turkey.\n\nThe latest conversion has also drawn criticism from the United States, with the State Department calling on Turkey to preserve the monument's diverse history and allow access to all visitors.\n\nIn Athens, many political leaders are urging Mitsotakis to cancel a meeting he has scheduled with Erdogan for next week as part of a previously agreed plan to ease relations between the longtime foes.\n\nNikos Androulakis, the leader of Greece's socialist party, is among those calling for the talks to be called off.\n\n\"There is no way that I would go,\" Androulakis said, adding, \"This is a provocation.\"\n\nThe prospect of canceling the talks is a \"no-go,\" said Mitsotakis.\n\n\"It is imperative to keep all channels of communication open,\" said Mitsotakis.\n\nHe went on to say, \"It is much better that I face President Erdogan in person and express my strong opposition to this latest conversion, than allow this matter to spark another crisis between the two countries.\"\n\nRelations between Greece and Turkey have long been strained. The two neighbors and NATO members nearly went to war in 2020 over contested energy reserves in the Mediterranean. They have also been at odds over the divided island of Cyprus; it is split between a Turkish-Cypriot north and a Greek-Cypriot south.\n\nSince 1974, several efforts by the United Nations and the United States to reunite the island have failed.\n\nIn recent remarks, Erdogan said all problems can be resolved between Greece and Turkey. In December, Erdogan made an official visit to Greece, where he met with Prime Minister Mitsotakis. They agreed on several measures to ease tensions.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

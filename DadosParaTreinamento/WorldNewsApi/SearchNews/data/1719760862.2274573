{"id": 225026528, "title": "Liv Morgan-Dominik Mysterio's stunning kiss raises critical WWE creative question", "text": "The Post\u2019s Joseph Staszewski brings you around the world of professional wrestling in his weekly column, the Post Match Angle. Liv Morgan ending \u201cMonday Night Raw\u201d by planting a big old kiss on Dominik Mysterio runs deeper than waiting to see how Rhea Ripley will respond when she returns from injury. (Some fans in the U.S. missed it live as the USA Network broadcast ended before it, but WWE quickly posted the kiss to social media.) That is because sitting in the ring was an emotional Becky Lynch, after losing her championship cage match to Morgan. Her WWE contract is reportedly set to run out on Saturday and The Man looks ready for a long hiatus likely to focus on being a mom after two-plus years of in-ring work and building young talent that will impact the company for years to come. She posted a picture of her walking out of the building with the caption \u201cTo be continued.\u201d (No, I don\u2019t see her showing up on Collision on Saturday or jumping to AEW.) The juxtaposition of the two events was intriguing, though likely not related. But at this point in her career, Lynch is a member of the old guard \u2014 the Four Horsewomen of Wrestling \u2014 whose group did everything they could to push the women\u2019s division away from the type of love-triangle, teen-soap-opera angle WWE is about to run with Morgan, Ripley and Mysterio. It\u2019s something Lynch, Flair, Bayley and Sasha Banks (now Mercedes Mone in AEW) stayed away from \u2013 likely worrying that any little slippage would open the door for what they helped build to roll even the slightest backward to the Divas and Attitude Era. Lynch in interviews before WrestleMania 40 feared WWE promoting Ripley doing a Stink Face with her ass out at a live event was an example of just that. Lynch awkwardly tried to do the real-life couple angle with then-boyfriend Seth Rollins in 2019, but outside of that, those four have never sniffed anything close to being at the center of a romantic angle in WWE. The only things I can remember that were similar during the Women\u2019s Evolution Era were the Mandy Rose and Otis storyline, Braun Strowman\u2019s innocent admiration for Alexa Bliss as a Mixed Match Challenge team and the Bobby Lashley-Rusev-Lana wife-stealing angle with Lana being more manager than in-ring performer. Now we are about to have a Ripley-Morgan-Mysterio soap opera at the top of the card with the Women\u2019s World championship at stake. WWE is playing the right angle given how Ripley has changed how women can be portrayed in the company as she is the clear leader of the men in The Judgement Day faction when she is around. Morgan \u2014 given that Ripley injured her in storyline \u2014 would want to wreck her relationship with Mysterio. Mysterio at King and Queen of the Ring and Raw appeared to try to cost Morgan the championship, only to see those attempts backfire both times. Still, seeing the kiss was jarring because it feels like ages since the main event women\u2019s talent have had that type of sexual interaction with a male talent in WWE. You didn\u2019t need the kiss for the angle and the intrigue to work, but it felt like something Vince Ruso and Vince McMahon would have insisted on in the late 90s. And that was quite possibly the point. Remember, creative boss Triple H as a wrestler got to show a bent over Trish Stratus some holds backstage only to have Stephanie McMahon flip out in anger when she walked in as part of a storyline in 2000 and later that year was in the famous love-triangle story with his now wife and Kurt Angle. It will be interesting to see how far the Morgan-Ripley-Mysterio angle goes as Mysterio and Ripley, who are not a real-life couple, have never kissed on screen \u2014 only teasing a sensual relationship. Is this one-off based on the unique story circumstance or the opening of the door for WWE to normalize stories based on love, lust and on-screen couples even at the top of their women\u2019s division \u2014 especially with a move to Netflix coming? Hopefully, it\u2019s the former. If it not, Lynch could find herself returning to a different-looking creative landscape if and when she decides to come back. Doubling up The announcement that SummerSlam will be a two-day event in Minneapolis in 2026 likely means a few things. One, WWE is probably making up for choosing Las Vegas over Minneapolis for WrestleMania next year. Two, WWE is looking to continue to squeeze every last cent out of its PLEs and the potential government subsidies for them. Less certain would be does having a second two-night event make it easier to move SummerSlam or WrestleMania or the Royal Rumble outside the U.S. in the coming years. TKO President Mark Shapiro said last week the WWE is looking to expand its relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next six to 12 months as the company hosted its first SmackDown there this past weekend. Think about the site fee for the first non-U.S. WrestleMania. Anything feels possible now. The 10 Count Shayna Baszler has been booked in NXT \u2014 even to this current week \u2014 better than she was at any point on the main roster. Her being against Lola Vice\u2019s dance \u2014 which reminds me of AEW\u2019s Daniel Garcia dance angle \u2014 makes perfect sense. Baszler in an NXT Underground match is exactly where she belongs. I thought Swerve Strickland chasing Christian Cage into parking and Prince Nana returning to block his escape was very well done on Dynamite. My one tweak would have been trying to get a more fluid camera shot of Swerve chasing Cage through the back before they cut away. Also, Darby Allin went way too quickly from being let out of the car by Tony Khan to inside the arena \u2014 he must have taken the skateboard. The King and Queen of the Ring tournaments teased three outstanding matches and gave us none of them for now. Jade Cargill vs. Bianca Belair, Gunther vs.Ilja Dragunov and Cody Rhodes vs.Randy Orton at SummerSlam.

It appears we finally have a date teased \u2014 the June 17th Raw \u2014 for Taylor Rotunda to put the mask and hat back on and potentially debut a new Wyatt Family that is rumored to contain Alexa Bliss, Erik Rowan, Joe Gacey and Dexter Lumis. Roxanne Perez\u2019s transition from uber-babyface prodigy to cocky heel has been absolutely flawless and now she is defending her NXT Women\u2019s championship against TNA Knockouts champion Jordynne Grace at Battleground in a historic crossover. Would love to see Trick Williams or Oba Femi be the one to go over TNA for a crossover next. AEW packed a ton of stuff into Double or Nothing, so much so that the show ran more then four hours. The two things I would have saved for Dynamite was the extended portion of MJF\u2019s promo because people will tune in to hear him speak. The other was Kris Statlander turning on Willow Nightingale because I think it took the focus away from Mercedes Mone\u2019s championship win. Loved Iyo Sky flipping out in the Damage CTRL locker room after Kairi Sane\u2019s loss to Lyra Valkyria on Raw. Damage CTRL feels like a shell of itself and it\u2019s good to see someone in the group is upset about it. WWE made the right call allowing a little more time before Otis and Alpha Academy split from Chad Gable because it needs to be a PLE match. But what it is going to take for him to finally snap when Gable taking his belt out to spank Otis wasn\u2019t enough. Gable is giving Christian Cage a run for Father of the Year. With the Owen Hart Cup winners getting world championship matches at Wembley Stadium at All Out, the early favorites have to be Will Ospreay and a returning Jamie Hayter, don\u2019t they? Former AEW star Ethan Page got quite the debut in NXT, attacking Trick Williams to close the show. Hopefully, NXT gives him a chance to be more than just a heel of the month for their champion. Extra: Getting AEW championship belts on \u201cInside The NBA\u201d feels long overdue and just in time with the show and AEW\u2019s future with Warner Bros. Discovery still uncertain. Wrestler of the Week Darby Allin, AEW AEW has had a number of true MVP\u2019s during its five-year run and Darby Allin etched his name on that list. The former TNT champion had been dealing with a broken foot suffered in March, then broke his nose after being hit by a NYC bus in April. But there he was filling in for the injured Eddie Kingston for Anarchy in the Arena. He was a huge focal point of the match with a bus spot with Jack Perry, putting his flame thrower permit to entertaining use then letting himself get hog-tied and hung upside down above the ring.

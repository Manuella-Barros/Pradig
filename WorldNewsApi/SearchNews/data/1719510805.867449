Vieira, who spoke exclusively to Chronicle Sport following the wins contended that the plan is to continue the streak come today (Sunday). \u201cWe got two wins today and I will pick up two more wins tomorrow and I\u2019m going to push for that. I also want to congratulate my other Guyanese riders and drivers on the team, they all did exceptionally well.\u201d According to Vieira, it was a relief to be on track as they were unsure if they would have gotten the containers in time for the event. \u201cTwenty-four hours ago, I didn\u2019t even know if we would be racing because customs didn\u2019t release our bikes, so we had no practice nor qualifying on Friday while the other riders got practice.\u201d The containers were released after 8 PM with the Guyanese only gaining access later in the evening (11:00). From then, the participants were able to have an unofficial practice session, followed by an official five-lap session and then qualifying where the young Vieira took the top step. He converted the pole into two wins on the day with a dominant display of riding showcasing the ENET, Vieira 66 Logistics, Cyril\u2019s Transportation, KSM blocks, Castle Point and Weekend Boys sponsored bike Infront of the small Saturday crowd. Meanwhile, it was a mixed bag for the Guyanese cars on the Day. Mark Vieira scored a third-place finish in the second of two races on the day; the first race saw him retiring after a last-minute switch to rain tires cost him performance. Starting from the back of the grid, Vieira sliced his way through the pack with the passive aggression that he has become known for throughout the Caribbean, completing the podium behind Trinidad\u2019s Zachary Boodram (Lamborghini Huracan) and his father Franklyn Boodram (Renault RS01). He however played down tomorrow\u2019s feature event over forty laps, telling Chronicle Sport, that the only way he sees himself being competitive with the front runners, is if it rains. \u201cI think if we get the rainy condition [today], it is possible [for the race win]. It was fun to race today for the fans here in Trinidad. I always like coming here and I hope tomorrow is better for me,\u201d Vieira said. Elsewhere, it was a difficult day for the remaining Guyanese with Denzil Hopkinson and the Subaru Impreza suffering Mechanical trouble in the first race which caused him to miss the second race. Danny Persaud and his Mazda Miata also had mechanical issues which caused his retirement in the second race. Today\u2019s feature event for cars will be a forty-lap race shootout with a mandatory two-minute pit stop.", "summary": "Matthew Vieira flies Golden Arrowhead By Stephan Sookram in Trinidad compliments of the NSC, Darthan Investments, AJM, Unisource, YUDIFAT logistics Inc, Trini Auto Works, Source Auto Sales, Cyrils Transportation Services GUYANA\u2019S Matthew Vieira kept the Golden Arrowhead high at this weekend\u2019s SpeedJam Motorsport festival at the Frankie Boodram International Raceway, Wallerfield, Trinidad and Tobago.

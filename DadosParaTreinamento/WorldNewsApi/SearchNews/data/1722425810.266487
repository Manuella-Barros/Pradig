{"id": 243219704, "title": "Brandon Aiyuk speaks about &#8216;dirty&#8217; negotiations, options outside 49ers", "text": "Brandon Aiyuk has spoken. There remains no sign of a contract accord, but Aiyuk revealed that he envisions returning to the 49ers, who drafted him in the 2020 first round and who he\u2019s led with over 1,000 yards receiving the past two seasons. \u201cIf I were to take a guess, probably a Niner uniform (in 2024). Probably a Niner uniform,\u201d Aiyuk said on The Pivot podcast, which dropped Friday and was recorded prior to Monday\u2019s meeting he arranged with 49ers officials. \u201cIf not a Niners uniform, probably a Washington Commanders uniform. If not a Washington Commanders\u2019 uniform, probably a Steelers\u2019 uniform.\u201d The 49ers\u2019 heirarchy \u2014 coach Kyle Shanahan, general manager John Lynch and owner Jed York \u2014 have maintained all offseason they hope to retain Aiyuk. He claimed the contrary in a recent TikTok video, but, in the hour-long podcast, he basked in the attention created by this offseason\u2019s often-cryptic social media posts. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get our own footage, recording everything, just enjoying the process,\u201d Aiyuk said. \u201cJust have my lady record everything that\u2019s going on, so I can look back on it, because it\u2019s an exciting time. It\u2019s stressful, but it\u2019s exciting. I want to have these memories.\u201d ESPN\u2019s Ryan Clark, who co-hosts The Pivot podcast with fellow NFL alumni Channing Crowder and Fred Taylor, outright questioned Aiyuk\u2019s claim that the 49ers don\u2019t want him back. \u201cThey told me that they didn\u2019t think that we were on the same page and that they didn\u2019t believe that we were going to,\u201d Aiyuk said. \u201cAnd that was about it at that time. But it\u2019s part of it. It\u2019s part of the contract negotiations, trying to sway stuff in either direction. So whether that\u2019s 100% true or not, I guess that\u2019s still to find out.\u201d The 49ers report to training camp July 23. If Aiyuk does not report, he is subject to $50,000 in daily fines. Boycotting the mandatory minicamp could cost him $100,000. A year ago, Nick Bosa did not report to training camp and his fines were waived upon signing the largest contract for a non-quarterback, with that deal brokered just days before the season opener \u2014 for the then-reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year. Although the 49ers have rewarded a homegrown player with a market-setting contract extension annually the past four summers, Aiyuk has proven more anxious to get a deal done. And he\u2019s publicly been the most skeptical of anyone that it may not happen. \u201cThroughout this process, there were times we were super close, where I\u2019d tell people and my agent, \u2018Let me get my suit ready. I\u2019m headed back to the Bay. I\u2019ve got to get right to sign this contract,\u2019 \u201d Aiyuk recalled. \u201cThere were times in this past month or so, you could say we were pretty far apart.\u201d Neither the 49ers nor Aiyuk\u2019s agent, Ryan Williams, have publicly revealed any details about the negotiations, although veteran NFL reporter Mike Silver told KNBR 680-AM earlier this month that the 49ers offered Aiyuk about $26 million annually. Aiyuk is under contract for 2024, on a $14.1 million salary for his fifth-year option to his rookie deal. \u201cFor actual numbers and stuff to come out, I felt it was a little disrespectful and unfair to me,\u201d Aiyuk said. \u201cBut that\u2019s part of it it. It\u2019s a dirty game.\u201d Aiyuk said at one point this offseason, he\u2019d be on the phone for two hours with his agent, who\u2019d then talk for an hour with the 49ers, all before the wide receiver market exploded with bigger deals, such as Minnesota\u2019s $35 million annual extension for Justin Jefferson. \u201cThe market changed. The market is what it is,\u201d Aiyuk said. \u201c\u2026 We really haven\u2019t agreed this entire time.\u201d Here are other key parts from the podcast: ON THIS OFFSEASON\u2019S SPOTLIGHT \u201cI\u2019m having fun. For the past four years, I kind of took a backseat to this guy, or this guy or this guy and just did what I had to do. Now I\u2019m in a position where I wake up in the morning, turn on the TV and they\u2019re talking about me; I get on the phone and they\u2019re talking about me. My mom calling to say they\u2019re talking about me at work. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying the process. This is the time for me, before the season starts, to get paid and to maximize my value and continue to show who I am as a player. Right now it\u2019s about one thing. \u2026 Social media is a way for me and my team to leverage what I\u2019m trying to get. That\u2019s a way to get the message and the facts out there.\u201d ON HIS FUTURE WORTH \u201cI have so much more to give. When you talk about social media and there\u2019s I\u2019m thinking about what I can do with him. If the Niners don\u2019t want me back, I know what I could do.\u201d ON MONEY MOTIVATION \u201cIt\u2019s heavy for sure. For me playing football, it didn\u2019t start with the money. The money was what I got to see along the way. First-round draft pick, it fell into my lap. The situation we\u2019re in now it fell into my lap. I want a team to look at me and value me as a top receiver so I can continue to do what I do. \u201c\u2026 I want them to say, \u2018We overpaid this dude,\u2019 then I spin back around and, \u2018Nah.\u2019 \u201d Aiyuk said it is \u201cnot my business\u201d to consider how much other 49ers\u2019 stars are making. \u201cI\u2019m worried about me right now. I don\u2019t know about the financial what this person or that person has going on. \u2026 If you can\u2019t afford a Lamborghini, you can\u2019t have one.\u201d ON TAKING IT PERSONALLY \u201cAre you not supposed to? I\u2019m taking it personal. I have a vision for what I see myself as and you don\u2019t see me as that, or you do and can\u2019t financially do it. It\u2019s no hard feelings though if you don\u2019t want to do it or can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be somebody that will. \u201cWe ain\u2019t doing the hometown discount.\u201d ON THE SYSTEM\u2019S INFLUENCE \u201cI\u2019m a true \u2018X\u2019 (split end). People say \u2018system,\u2019 I\u2019m in Kyle Shanahan\u2019s system now. But if you watch any of my catches, I\u2019m beating the guys in front of me. I\u2019m beating man coverage to get my reception. I\u2019m not settling in zones \u2013 or, maybe sometimes \u2013 but I\u2019m not running across the field on crossing routes or shallow crosses. I\u2019m beating guys in front of me to get the football. Yeah I could sit in zone all day, run high crosses all day, beat guys all day long. I\u2019m not going to say I can go crazy in any offense, because there are some that aren\u2019t worth anything.\u201d ON HIS TOP-5 RECEIVERS His top-five NFL receivers of all-time, in the order listed by him: Randy Moss, Terrell Owens, Jerry Rice, Antonio Brown, Julio Jones. ON MOTHER MARTHA\u2019S WISHES \u201cShe loves it. Just the colors, the team itself. She was a huge fan and to see her son accomplish things in those same colors she was screaming about when I was younger, it\u2019s pretty cool. . \u2026 She\u2019s on my side right now. She doesn\u2019t care too much about colors right now. She\u2019s trying to make sure her son\u2019s straight.\u201d ON TRENT WILLIAMS\u2019 INFLUENCE \u201cThat\u2019s my dog. I don\u2019t like to throw around \u2018big bro\u2019 too much, but he taught me a bunch of stuff. There were times in my second year, I\u2019m in the doghouse and I\u2019m in the parking lot ready to blackout and go crazy. He tells me, \u2018Trust me, leave it alone, keep your head on straight.\u2019 He\u2019s a one-of-one type of player. He\u2019s somebody I appreciate a lot and I look to be that for somebody down the road.\u201d ON QUARTERBACK BROCK PURDY \u201cHim and (Jayden Daniels), it\u2019s, \u2018I\u2019m not going to say much, I\u2019m going to show you what I\u2019m about.\u2019 Guys can feel the confidence, the energy, the preparation. You could feel it\u2019s real and the talent is real. I can\u2019t say enough about that dude.\u201d ON THE RECEIVER MARKET \u201cI feel when you negotiate contracts, it\u2019s similar to (the NFL Draft) where it\u2019s slotted. Right now there\u2019s only a few slots left where I could fall. I hope we can come to an agreement, just as I have since the end of the season in February.", "summary": "Brandon Aiyuk envisions himself returning to the 49ers but he said on The Pivot podcast he could also see himself with the Washington Commanders or the Pittsburgh Steelers.", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/06/28/brandon-aiyuk-speaks-about-dirty-negotiations-options-outside-49ers/", "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/BNG-L-49ERS-0101-15.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:21:07", "author": "Cam Inman", "authors": ["Cam Inman"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.393}

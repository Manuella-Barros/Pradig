{"id": 232102594, "title": "See inside Maura Derrane\u2019s Waterford home she shared with husband John Deasy and son Cal", "text": "Maura Derrane invited cameras inside the home she once shared with her husband John Deasy and where they raised their beloved son Cal for the first five years of his life. In the new season of RTE\u2019s Keys to Your Life, Maura and host Brendan Courtney revisited the homes of Maura\u2019s lifetime including her childhood home in Inis M\u00f3r and, later, the home she lived in after marrying the politician. Maura and the then Waterford TD first met at a Fine Gael party in 2002. Three years later, the pair married in a star-studding Italian ceremony. Ten years later, after lots of fun and travel together, Maura and John eventually decided to start a family and their beloved son Cal arrived in dramatic fashion via emergency c-section in 2015. Walking into the home in Dungarvan, Waterford, Maura said she was overwhelmed with memories of their son as a \u201clittle baby\u201d. \u201cAt the top of the stairs was Cal\u2019s old room. It\u2019s only when I came in here I just got the feeling of this little tiny person here. I remember I\u2019d be struggling getting the pram in the door and all that stuff. \u201cHis first five years were here. It was so cute and lovely and I had a little cat and dog who lived with us\u201d. Walking into the kitchen, Maura said it was the location for many fun nights in: \u201cWe used to entertain a lot here in the olden days. We had a long oak table with six chairs. Brendan Courtney asked if they had had any \u201cinteresting\u201d dinner guests. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few interesting people here,\u201d Maura said coyly, but stopped short of elaborating on names, \u201cI couldn\u2019t say\u201d she laughed. \u201cWe used to sit on the balcony upstairs off the bedroom with a glass of wine and look at the view. But once a child arrives, everything changes\u201d. Maura said while she and John planned their pregnancy, they had prolonged having a baby for as long as they could to enjoy their youth. \u201cI had planned it but it was now or never. We were never really \u2018baby\u2019 people. I don\u2019t want to sound cold by saying this but I never had that urge as a woman, like I never looked at babies in prams when I was 20 or 30 and thought, \u2018oh I\u2019d love a baby\u2019. I never had that. \u201cReally, everything changed the minute I saw him,\u201d she added.", "summary": "Walking into the home in Dungarvan, Waterford, where she and John lived after they wed and for the first five years of Cal\u2019s life, Maura said she was overwhelmed with memories of their son", "url": "https://www.rsvplive.ie/news/celebs/gallery/see-inside-maura-derranes-waterford-32984037", "image": "https://i2-prod.rsvplive.ie/incoming/article32981781.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Maura.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:21:24", "author": "Megan Martin", "authors": ["Megan Martin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.083}

NANS described the action of the operatives of the anti-graft agency as infringing on the rights of the affected students. In a statement on Sunday by its Senate President, Comrade Akinteye Afeez, the students body said the June 7 raid, during which 127 students, males and females, were arrested, smacked of lack of regard for due process and justice. It said that it acknowledged the need for the EFCC to combat cybercrime and uphold the rule of law, but the breakdown of law and order witnessed during the raid is deeply concerning and unjust. According to NANS, despite their ongoing engagement with the EFCC Command, they continue to observe a high rate of abuse against their members. It added that the EFCC should operate with intelligence and precision, targeting only those for whom they have concrete evidence, not innocent citizens who are merely trying to find joy amidst the challenging circumstances in the country. \u201cThe primary duty of the EFCC is to investigate and prosecute economic and financial crimes, ensuring the integrity of our financial systems and protecting the public from fraud and corruption. \"However, this mandate must be carried out with the utmost professionalism and respect for human rights. The EFCC must operate as a law enforcement agency, not as thieves and burglars who use excessive force and violate the rights of innocent citizens. \u201cThe EFCC must employ more effective strategies to identify and apprehend suspects. They possess the necessary information to focus their efforts on genuine criminals, rather than exploiting these operations to mistreat and violate the rights of the general populace. They must adhere to the principles of justice, fairness, and respect for the dignity of every individual. \u201cWe are calling for immediate sanctions against the erring officers involved in the maltreatment of innocent ladies during this raid. We also demand a thorough review and adjustment of the EFCC\u2019s operational procedures to ensure such abuses do not recur. \u201cFurthermore, we urge the EFCC to engage in continuous training and development for their officers to enhance their investigative skills and ensure they conduct their operations in line with international human rights standards. The agency must build public trust by demonstrating a commitment to justice and human rights, not by instilling fear and perpetuating abuse. \u201cWe stand firmly against any form of human rights abuse and will continue to advocate for the protection and dignity of every Nigerian citizen,\" NANS stated.", "summary": "<img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NANS-2.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NANS-2.jpg 1200w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NANS-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NANS-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><p>The National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, has faulted the manner operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, brutalized some students of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, FUTA, during their raids on some student lounges in the town.

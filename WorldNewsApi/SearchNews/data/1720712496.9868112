{"id": 232035860, "title": "ANALYSIS: Mixed bag for Nigeria&#8217;s economy in Tinubu&#8217;s first year", "text": "In the twilight of his administration, former President Muhammadu Buhari hastily sought and got the National Assembly\u2019s approval to convert a N22.7 trillion ($49 billion at the time) borrowing from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) into bonds. Borrowing a sum that huge from the bank violated the law that limits the advance the Nigerian government could take from the CBN to five per cent of its previous year\u2019s revenue and requires the cash to be repaid within the same year. The move raised Nigeria\u2019s debt by half to N69 trillion as of that time. The Debt Management Office put Nigeria\u2019s debt service-to-revenue ratio at 73.5 per cent in June 2023 less than a month after Mr Buhari\u2019s successor Bola Tinubu took office. It suggests the latter had limited elbow room to borrow to fund the spending ambitions of his government. That debt level \u201cexceeds the recommended threshold of 50 per cent due to low revenue, which means that there is a need to significantly increase government,\u201d the debt office said in a report titled Market Access Country-Debt Sustainability Analysis 2022. \u201cThe baseline analysis projects total public debt-to-GDP ratio at 37.1 per cent for 2023, indicating a borrowing space of 2.9 per cent (equivalent of about N14.66 trillion) when compared to the self-imposed limit of 40 per cent,\u201d it added. With borrowing not offering a lot of prospects, the government\u2019s attention shifted to alternative means of growing the economy, including attracting foreign direct investments and expanding the tax revenue base. The government plans to strengthen the foreign exchange market and, by extension, the economy \u201cby raising revenue, by looking at other sources of investment funding, by attracting investment funds, equity funds, not debt from those around the world interested in investing in the Nigerian economy,\u201d Wale Edun, the minister of finance and coordinating minister of the economy, told lawmakers during his screening last August. \u201cIf you have fiscal and monetary tools, the one that works faster is monetary tools,\u201d Paul Alaje, chief economist at the economic development firm, SPM Professionals, told PREMIUM TIMES. \u201cMonetary authorities can quickly change MPR, change CRR, change liquidity ratio and adjust asymmetric corridor. All those are simple. You can do that and start seeing the impact in six months. Mr Alaje stressed that President Tinubu\u2019s administration will have at least run two budget cycles and overseen the economy for a minimum of eight quarters before a fair assessment of his performance can be conducted. Trade and Investment A flurry of deals reached with domestic and international investors, particularly in the first seven months, makes trade and investment one of the strongest points of achievement for the government in its first year. Following talks with various Indian investors in September, President Tinubu secured pledges of $14 billion investment in sectors including steel, petrochemicals, power generation and military equipment manufacturing. In November, President Tinubu inked a couple of investment deals with the Saudi Arabian government during the Saudi-Africa Summit in Riyadh. One involved providing a foreign exchange support to boost liquidity in the Nigerian currency market. Another was a commitment that would allow Saudi oil giant, Aramco, to provide part of the capital for the overhaul of Nigeria\u2019s four state-owned oil refineries. Later in the month, Nigerian and Germany companies struck two investment deals, including a renewable energy agreement and a gas export arrangement totalling $500 million, while the president was attending a G-20 conference in Berlin. Monetary Policy/Inflation In a mark of its strong resolve to tame bloated price levels, the CBN has hiked the benchmark interest rate by 775 basis points since the start of the Tinubu administration, with 600 of that delivered in the first quarter of 2024 alone. As interest rate raced to record 26.3 per cent from 18.5 per cent within the first 12 months of this administration, borrowing costs continued to strain the operating expenditure and, in some cases, the direct costs of businesses. Many had no option on that score but to pass the costs on to customers to keep their operations going. In turn, that has made finished goods pricier, further stoking inflationary pressures. Mr Cardoso has said the CBN under his watch would turn its gaze towards fighting inflation rather than money control, which was a massive distraction for his predecessor, considering that consumer price levels must be kept stable to achieve steady economic growth. An unbroken string of upward rate adjustments since the onset of the Tinubu administration, nevertheless, hasn\u2019t brought any month-on-month decline in inflation levels. It implies that consumer inflation in Nigeria, irrepressible for 16 months in a row now, touching its crest of 33.7 per cent in nearly three decades in April, requires much more than merely deploying monetary policy tools to tame. The drivers have been jumps in the costs of every day essentials like food, energy and transportation, which sharp reverberations from fuel subsidy removal and, to some extent, higher rates of exchanging the naira for the dollar, have turned into pain points for consumers. \u201cThe balance of risks suggests further tightening of policy to build on the benefits from previous hikes,\u201d Mr Cardoso said on 21 May at the end of a monetary policy meeting in Abuja, hinting that the pace of increase in price levels is not as high as it was. Perhaps, the weight of the cost of living crisis on households is most felt in the affordability of food after a fast-diminishing purchasing power steadily weakened disposable income, leaving families with less to spend on what to eat. According to April inflation data, food inflation rate for that month soared to 40.5 per cent relative to 24.6 per cent a year earlier. \u201cThe average annual rate of food inflation for the 12-month ending April 2024 over the previous 12-month average was 32.74 per cent, which was a 9.52 per cent points increase from the average annual rate of change recorded in April 2023 (23.22 per cent),\u201d the National Bureau of Statistics said. Exchange Rate One of the biggest policy shifts made by President Tinubu after taking office was to heed the long call by multilateral organisations and analysts for the unification of Nigeria\u2019s multiple exchange rates which, after several years of orthodoxy, had been left vulnerable to diverse pressures across multiple foreign exchange videos. Harmonising the foreign exchange rates was key to drawing foreign investors into the economy and boosting the supply of the dollar whose flow had started running dry since pre-pandemic days. In a bid to liberalise the currency market, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) collapsed the multiple exchange windows into one as it shifted away from a managed float regime to enable the naira to trade more freely and achieve price discovery. Since the start date of the administration, the local currency has endured two devaluation rounds and countless other pressures. Barely a fortnight after the government was inaugurated, the central bank allowed the naira to weaken by 36 per cent against the US dollar on the official market. As of 14 June, naira exchange rate had crashed to N750 to a dollar compared to N460.72 on 29 May. The local unit ended 2023 at 1,041 to a dollar, making it the world\u2019s third worst-performing currency, only better than the Lebanese pound and Argentina\u2019s peso of the 151 currencies tracked by Bloomberg for the year. The impact of a fast-depreciating naira was sweeping on multinationals and local businesses that depend on imports for the bulk of their operations all through the year. On account of the perennial dollar crunch, Procter & Gamble, GlaxoSmithKline Consumers, Bayer AG and Sanofi AG exited the economy last year. The likes of Nestle, PZ Cussons and MTN Nigeria incurred losses so overwhelming that threw their balance sheets into the red at year-end. In January 2024, the naira underwent a second devaluation in seven months, causing it to fall by 31 per cent, with the local currency exchanging at 1,413 to a dollar on 30 January. One big feat by the CBN in the first quarter of the year was clearing a backlog of overdue foreign exchange obligations initially estimated at $7 billion before an audit found that $2.4 billion of that amount were invalid claims. The overhang, the central bank said, had left the naira vulnerable to exchange rate pressures for quite a long time. To attract dollar inflows, the CBN issued one-year treasury bills in February, which were more than twice oversubscribed, helping bring more than $1 billion into the economy. As of 8 March, foreign portfolio investment so far in 2024 stood at $2.3 billion, according to the apex bank, compared to the $3.9 billion reported for the whole of the preceding year. Closing the gap between the monetary policy rate and yields on short-term securities made short-term sovereign debt attractive to foreign investors, boosting inflows. Inflows were also partially strengthened by a rise in remittances from diasporan Nigerians, which climbed to $1.3 billion in February from $300 million the previous month. Such supplies bolstered liquidity in the market, and the grounds gained by currency against the dollar afterwards, notably from the middle of March till about a month after, were as significant as 34 per cent, making it the world\u2019s best-performing currency by Bloomberg\u2019s rating. Those gains were soon to be eroded. With the availability of dollar beginning to dwindle, the CBN was impelled to intervene in the market but that support was itself limited at best. The CBN\u2019s extent of intervention in the open market continues to arouse analysts\u2019 scepticism as to how committed it is to running a willing buyer, willing seller market where activities are driven by the forces of demand and supply rather than stepping in to intervene with funds from external reserves. \u201cThe central bank is not supposed to appoint someone to sell dollar to them in the case of BDCs. It\u2019s an aberration in a free-float economy,\u201d Mr Alaje said. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to raise my dollar and say I want to sell it for N2,000. It\u2019s either you want it or not. That\u2019s free float. So managed float means we are deliberately creating benchmark in order to achieve some targets. It\u2019s actually a targeted exchange rate we are practising.\u201d By 17 May, the local unit had slid to its near-two-month low of 1,534 against the dollar.

Pension funds and institutional investors were the biggest drivers of activities, as trade recorded volumes and values last seen during pre-pandemic days.

The survivors are charged with smuggling, aggravated by the deaths of passengers, causing a shipwreck, irregular entry, and forming and membership of a criminal organization, and could face multiple life sentences if convicted. A parallel investigation into the potential liability of the Greek authorities for the shipwreck is at the preliminary stage, meaning the criminal court will have incomplete information in assessing the culpability of the defendants. The criminal trial is due to begin in Kalamata, Greece, on May 21, 2024.\n\n\"There's a real risk that these nine survivors could be found 'guilty' on the basis of incomplete and questionable evidence given that the official investigation into the role of the Coast Guard has not yet been completed,\" said Judith Sunderland, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \"Credible and meaningful accountability for one of the worst shipwrecks in the Mediterranean needs to include a determination of any liabilities of Greek authorities.\"\n\nThe severely overcrowded fishing trawler capsized on June 14, 2023, leading to the death of more than 600 of its estimated 750 passengers, mainly from Syria, Pakistan and Egypt. Research by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International and numerous investigative journalists and organizations points to several failures by the Greek authorities in the hours leading up to the shipwreck, as well as serious allegations that a Hellenic Coast Guard patrol boat caused the boat to capsize while attempting to tow it.\n\nThe case against the nine Egyptian survivors, referred to as the \"Pylos 9\" appears to be based on the theory that the poor and overcrowded state of the boat caused the shipwreck and that the defendants were smugglers in charge of the boat and its passengers, and therefore responsible for the deaths of those on board. The accused deny the charges. It is unclear whether and how the criminal court will examine the behavior of the Hellenic Coast Guard or the allegation that the attempt to tow the boat was the direct, material cause of the shipwreck.\n\nA separate Naval Court investigation into the potential liability of the Hellenic Coast Guard, opened in June 2023, remains at the preliminary stages. Legal nongovernmental organizations joined the case filing a complaint on behalf of 53 survivors alleging that Greek authorities were responsible for the shipwreck, and many of them have been summoned to testify. The Naval Court prosecutor's request for forensic analysis of coast guard officers' phones - only seized by authorities in late September 2023, over two months after the events - is still pending.\n\nThe Pylos 9 were arrested on June 15, 2023, apparently on the basis of testimonies from nine other survivors taken by Hellenic Coast Guard officers in the immediate aftermath of the traumatic shipwreck, between June 14 and 15. It is unclear whether or how many other survivors gave their accounts and whether these were evaluated before the accused were arrested and subsequently sent into pretrial custody, on June 20.\n\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International have previously said that the fact that Coast Guard officials conducted the interviews raised concerns for the independence and integrity of the investigation, especially considering that allegations about the Coast Guard's actions emerged soon after the shipwreck.\n\nThere are real concerns regarding the respect of fair trial standards based on questions about the integrity of the investigation and evidence, the organizations said. The speed at which the investigation against survivors was concluded, and the Pylos 9 defense lawyers' lack of access to the Naval Court case file compound these concerns.\n\nIn separate investigations, Lighthouse Reports, Solomon, and others found that various survivors' statements to the Coast Guard, admitted as evidence, described the shipwreck in identical terms and did not include allegations about the towing attempt, suggesting that those taking the first statements may have written official pro forma accounts rather than the actual accounts provided by survivors. However, in later testimony to the Kalamata prosecutor, several of those same survivors made the allegation of the towing attempt. One survivor also told Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that his statement to the prosecutor that the Coast Guard had caused the fishing boat to capsize was changed to say that the boat sank due to other reasons.\n\nMembers of the Pylos 9 defense team told the organizations that the investigating judge in the Kalamata court rejected defendants' requests to secure further evidence, including evidence pertaining to the potential liability of the Hellenic Coast Guard, on the grounds that it falls within the jurisdiction of the Naval Court. The defendants' lawyers have been unable to gain access to the investigation file before the Naval Court despite its clear relevance to preparing the defense.\n\nThe judge rejected the request for analysis of any data from survivors' mobile phones which were confiscated by Greek authorities under unclear circumstances, then reportedly discovered on the coast guard boat and seized as part of the Kalamata investigation only in July 2023. The judge also rejected motions by defense lawyers to take testimony from additional survivors, and to acquire the communications between the Hellenic Coast Guard, Frontex and the Greek Joint Rescue Coordination Center, and aerial photos of the boat prior to the shipwreck.\n\nThe separate investigation into the Hellenic Coast Guard's potential liability should not impede the defendants' access to crucial, and potentially exculpatory, evidence on the causes of the shipwreck, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said. The Kalamata and Naval courts should cooperate in the interests of justice, with the goal of achieving as full and credible an account of how the shipwreck occurred and identifying those responsible and any alleged fatal shortcomings in the rescue efforts.\n\nInternational and European human rights law guarantees a defendant's right to an effective defense when facing a criminal charge. Among other things, this means the defendants have the right to \"adequate facilities\" for preparing their defense, including \"all materials that the prosecution plans to offer in court against the accused or that are exculpatory.\"\n\nThe Kalamata court should guarantee that the Pylos 9 receive a fair and impartial trial, and that their full due process rights are upheld and respected. The Naval Court should advance investigations promptly, effectively and impartially and ensure the safe and effective participation of the largest possible number of survivors and relatives of victims and full collection of evidence.\n\n\"Time and again, in Greece and in other countries, racialised people who are seeking to travel to Europe end up being the only ones facing accountability in the context of migration movements,\" said Adriana Tidona, Migration researcher at Amnesty International. \"The Pylos investigations and trials must serve as a turning point for this dangerous trajectory.\"\n\nAfter examining 81 trials in Greece, the nongovernmental group Borderline Europe found that \"smuggled people themselves, including asylum seekers, are systematically convicted of smuggling because they (allegedly) drove or assisted in driving the boat or car\" and denounced serious shortcomings and abuses in the context of arrests and preliminary investigations. According to the study, as of February 2023, 2,154 people were detained in Greece on suspicion of smuggling, and 90 percent of them were third country nationals. Meanwhile, serious and persistent human rights violations committed by the authorities against refugees and migrants at Greek borders - including pushbacks, arbitrary detention and torture - remain unpunished.", "source": {"uri": "hrw.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Human Rights Watch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki",

Only 104 people were rescued from the overcrowded fishing trawler -- all men, the vast majority from Syria, Pakistan and Egypt -- and 82 bodies were recovered.\n\nProsecutors accused the defendants, most in their 20s, of being part of the trawler's crew -- something the defense denied -- and therefore being responsible for the mistreatment of passengers and the massively overcrowded conditions which authorities argued led to the boat capsizing and sinking on June 14 2023. The nine men faced up to life in prison had they been convicted of the multiple criminal charges against them, including people smuggling and causing a deadly shipwreck.\n\nAlso read | Greece scours shipwreck site; hundreds feared drowned in hold\n\nThe judge's ruling followed a recommendation by public prosecutor Ekaterini Tsironi for the case to be dismissed because the trawler sank outside Greek territorial waters.\n\n\"The shipwreck clearly occurred in international waters and ... the jurisdiction of the Greek courts cannot be established,\" she said. \"I propose that they be declared innocent.\"\n\nThe case had faced criticism from international human rights groups, who argued the defendants' right to a fair trial was compromised because they faced judgment while a separate Naval Court investigation into the sinking and the Greek coast guard's actions is still under way.\n\nThe trawler was sailing in international waters but within Greece's search and rescue area of operations when it capsized and sank. A coast guard patrol boat and passing merchant ships were near the vessel for hours but did not manage to prevent the massive loss of life.\n\nSeveral survivors have said the capsizing happened after the Greek coast guard attempted to tow the ship, an accusation Greek authorities deny. The exact circumstances of the sinking remain unclear.\n\nThe indictments against the nine were based on testimonies from another nine survivors. Defense lawyers argued that testimony had been coerced, and that their clients had been paying passengers who were scapegoated by authorities eager to put the blame for the sinking on overcrowded conditions.\n\nDimitris Choulis, one of the lawyers in the defense team, said attention should now turn to how the Adriana sank.\n\nAlso Read | At least 78 migrants dead and dozens feared missing after fishing vessel sinks off Greece\n\n\"The court today had to be very brave to issue this decision, and to say that these people are not the smugglers,\" Choulis said. \"So now the narrative of the bad smugglers (does not) exist any more, so we need to find who caused the shipwreck.\"\n\nChoulis blamed the tragedy on the Greek coast guard and Europe's migration policies, and said it was essential to \"make sure that nothing like that would happen again.\"\n\nHis comments were echoed by Judith Sunderland, an associate director for Europe and Central Asia at Human Rights Watch.\n\n\"Now that the survivors' ordeal is over, we need to see the Naval Court conclude its investigation to determine the responsibilities of the Greek Coast Guard for the tremendous loss of life in the Pylos shipwreck,\" she said. Pylos is the Greek town that was closest to where the trawler sank, and the shipwreck has become known by that name.\n\nThe nine, who have been in pre-trial detention since the shipwreck, were expected to be released from jail on Wednesday after processing procedures were complete.\n\nThe Kalamata court \"delivered justice today,\" said another defense lawyer, Spyros Pantazis. \"This case needed a lot of work and a lot of effort. After such a long time, the whole defense team is really happy.\"\n\nDalia Abdel-Magid, the aunt defendant Mohammed Emad Abdel-Magid, reacted emotionally to the news that her nephew had been acquitted.\n\nAlso read | 'One side went up, people fell into the sea': Survivors recount the Greek boat disaster that killed over 80\n\n\"I'm so happy that I just want to hug him and take him with me,\" she said. \"I hope that everything gets better for him now.\"\n\nEarlier, a small group of protesters clashed with riot police outside the courthouse. There were no reports of serious injuries but two people were detained. Officers from the special police forces maintained order in the courtroom.\n\n\"Justice prevailed. These people stayed in jail for a year even though they were innocent, and this must not happen again,\" said Stelios Kouloglou, a Greek member of the European Parliament. \"There are 2,000 innocent people in Greek jails, accused of or convicted of smuggling. The vast majority are innocent.\"\n\nAs the trial started, Kontaratou questioned all nine defendants through an interpreter. The accused said their intention had been to travel to Italy, not Greece, and several declared their innocence.\n\nShe acknowledged that on the ship there \"were no Greeks on board, it was not under a Greek flag and all the documents refer to the (vessel being) 47 nautical miles away.\"\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres last year described the shipwreck as \"horrific.\"\n\nThe sinking renewed pressure on European governments to protect the lives of migrants and asylum seekers trying to reach the continent, as the number of people traveling illegally across the Mediterranean

Shortly after the trial opened in the southern Greek city of Kalamata, public prosecutor Ekaterini Tsironi recommended that the charges be dismissed, saying that Greek jurisdiction could be established because the overcrowded trawler sank outside Greek territorial waters. More than 500 people are believed to have gone down with the fishing trawler, which had been traveling from Libya to Italy. Following the sinking, 104 people were rescued - mostly migrants from Syria, Pakistan and Egypt - and 82 bodies were recovered. Supporters clapped and cheered as the judge announced the dismissal of a case that had faced criticism from international human rights groups, who argued that the accuseds' right to a fair trial was compromised because they faced judgment while an investigation into the Greek coast guard's rescue attempt is still under way. Earlier, a small group of protesters clashed with riot police outside the courthouse. There were no reports of serious injuries but two people were detained. Officers from the special police forces maintained order in the courtroom. The defendants, most in their 20s, faced up to life in prison if convicted on multiple criminal charges over the sinking of the \"Adriana\"\u009d fishing trawler on June 14 last year off the southern coast of Greece. Defense lawyer Spyros Pantazis had earlier asked the court to declare itself incompetent to try the case, arguing that the sinking occurred outside Greek territorial waters. \"The court should not be turned into an international punisher,\"\u009d Pantazis told the panel of three judges. Kontaratou questioned all nine defendants through an interpreter. The accused said their intention was to travel to Italy, not Greece, and several declared their innocence. Kontaratou acknowledged that there \"were no Greeks on board, it was not under a Greek flag and all the documents refer to the (vessel being) 47 nautical miles away.\"\u009d United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres last year described the shipwreck as \"horrific.\" The sinking renewed pressure on European governments to protect the lives of migrants and asylum seekers trying to reach the continent, as the number of people traveling illegally across the Mediterranean continues to rise every year. Lawyers from Greek human rights groups are representing the nine Egyptians, who deny the smuggling charges. \"There's a real risk that these nine survivors could be found \"~guilty' on the basis of incomplete and questionable evidence, given that the official investigation into the role of the coast guard has not yet been completed,\"\u009d said Judith Sunderland, an associate director for Europe and Central Asia at Human Rights Watch. Authorities say the defendants were identified by other survivors and the indictments are based on their testimonies.

They deny the charges.\n\nIn a statement, HRW and Amnesty said: \"There are real concerns regarding the respect of fair trial standards based on questions about the integrity of the investigation and evidence.\n\n\"The speed at which the investigation against survivors was concluded, and the Pylos 9 defense lawyers' lack of access to the Naval Court case file compound these concerns.\"\n\nInvestigations by Lighthouse Reports and Solomon also found eyewitness testimony compiled by the Coast Guard contained identical accounts of the accident, which omitted details about the patrol boat later submitted to a public prosecutor in Kalamata.\n\nAnother witness told HRW and Amnesty their testimony had been altered by the Coast Guard to omit the claim that the patrol boat caused the disaster.\n\nThe defense team for the nine Egyptians has also claimed requests for evidence for the criminal trial, including data from survivors' mobile phones confiscated by Greek authorities, have been denied over questions into the jurisdiction of the Naval Court investigation.\n\n\"The defendants' lawyers have been unable to gain access to the investigation file before the Naval Court despite its clear relevance to preparing the defense,\" Amnesty and HRW said.\n\n\"The judge also rejected motions by defense lawyers to take testimony from additional survivors, and to acquire the communications between the Hellenic Coast Guard, Frontex and the Greek Joint Rescue Coordination Center, and aerial photos of the boat prior to the shipwreck.\n\n\"The Kalamata court should guarantee that the Pylos 9 receive a fair and impartial trial, and that their full due process rights are upheld and respected. The Naval Court should advance investigations promptly, effectively and impartially and ensure the safe and effective participation of the largest possible number of survivors and relatives of victims and full collection of evidence,\" they added.\n\nThe groups also highlighted the tendency for Greek authorities to blame people from ethnic minorities for smuggling and people trafficking, citing a study that said that as of February 2023, 90 percent of the 2,154 people detained in Greece on smuggling charges were \"third country\" nationals.\n\n\"Time and again, in Greece and in other countries, racialized people who are seeking to travel to Europe end up being the only ones facing accountability in the context of migration movements,\" said Adriana Tidona, migration researcher at Amnesty International.\n\n\"The Pylos investigations and trials must serve as a turning point for this dangerous trajectory.\"", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab

Only 104 people were rescued from the overcrowded fishing trawler -- all men, the vast majority from Syria, Pakistan and Egypt -- and 82 bodies were recovered.\n\nProsecutors accused the defendants, most in their 20s, of being part of the trawler's crew -- something the defense denied -- and therefore being responsible for the mistreatment of passengers and the massively overcrowded conditions which authorities argued led to the boat capsizing and sinking on June 14 2023. The nine men faced up to life in prison had they been convicted of the multiple criminal charges against them, including people smuggling and causing a deadly shipwreck.\n\nAlso read | Greece scours shipwreck site; hundreds feared drowned in hold\n\nThe judge's ruling followed a recommendation by public prosecutor Ekaterini Tsironi for the case to be dismissed because the trawler sank outside Greek territorial waters.\n\n\"The shipwreck clearly occurred in international waters and ... the jurisdiction of the Greek courts cannot be established,\" she said. \"I propose that they be declared innocent.\"\n\nThe case had faced criticism from international human rights groups, who argued the defendants' right to a fair trial was compromised because they faced judgment while a separate Naval Court investigation into the sinking and the Greek coast guard's actions is still under way.\n\nThe trawler was sailing in international waters but within Greece's search and rescue area of operations when it capsized and sank. A coast guard patrol boat and passing merchant ships were near the vessel for hours but did not manage to prevent the massive loss of life.\n\nSeveral survivors have said the capsizing happened after the Greek coast guard attempted to tow the ship, an accusation Greek authorities deny. The exact circumstances of the sinking remain unclear.\n\nThe indictments against the nine were based on testimonies from another nine survivors. Defense lawyers argued that testimony had been coerced, and that their clients had been paying passengers who were scapegoated by authorities eager to put the blame for the sinking on overcrowded conditions.\n\nDimitris Choulis, one of the lawyers in the defense team, said attention should now turn to how the Adriana sank.\n\nAlso Read | At least 78 migrants dead and dozens feared missing after fishing vessel sinks off Greece\n\n\"The court today had to be very brave to issue this decision, and to say that these people are not the smugglers,\" Choulis said. \"So now the narrative of the bad smugglers (does not) exist any more, so we need to find who caused the shipwreck.\"\n\nChoulis blamed the tragedy on the Greek coast guard and Europe's migration policies, and said it was essential to \"make sure that nothing like that would happen again.\"\n\nHis comments were echoed by Judith Sunderland, an associate director for Europe and Central Asia at Human Rights Watch.\n\n\"Now that the survivors' ordeal is over, we need to see the Naval Court conclude its investigation to determine the responsibilities of the Greek Coast Guard for the tremendous loss of life in the Pylos shipwreck,\" she said. Pylos is the Greek town that was closest to where the trawler sank, and the shipwreck has become known by that name.\n\nSeveral survivors have said the capsizing happened after the Greek coast guard attempted to tow the ship, an accusation Greek authorities deny. The exact circumstances of the sinking remain unclear. (AP Photo)\n\nThe nine, who have been in pre-trial detention since the shipwreck, were expected to be released from jail on Wednesday after processing procedures were complete.\n\nThe Kalamata court \"delivered justice today,\" said another defense lawyer, Spyros Pantazis. \"This case needed a lot of work and a lot of effort. After such a long time, the whole defense team is really happy.\"\n\nDalia Abdel-Magid, the aunt defendant Mohammed Emad Abdel-Magid, reacted emotionally to the news that her nephew had been acquitted.\n\nAlso read | 'One side went up, people fell into the sea': Survivors recount the Greek boat disaster that killed over 80\n\n\"I'm so happy that I just want to hug him and take him with me,\" she said. \"I hope that everything gets better for him now.\"\n\nEarlier, a small group of protesters clashed with riot police outside the courthouse. There were no reports of serious injuries but two people were detained. Officers from the special police forces maintained order in the courtroom.\n\n\"Justice prevailed. These people stayed in jail for a year even though they were innocent, and this must not happen again,\" said Stelios Kouloglou, a Greek member of the European Parliament. \"There are 2,000 innocent people in Greek jails, accused of or convicted of smuggling. The vast majority are innocent.\"\n\nAs the trial started, Kontaratou questioned all nine defendants through an interpreter. The accused said their intention had been to travel to Italy, not Greece, and several declared their innocence.\n\nTwo of nine Egyptians, who were on trial for migrant smuggling, wave to the media

refer to the (vessel being) 47 nautical miles away.\"\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres last year described the shipwreck as \"horrific.\"\n\nThe sinking renewed pressure on European governments to protect the lives of migrants and asylum seekers trying to reach the continent, as the number of people traveling illegally across the Mediterranean continues to rise every

The trial's dismissal, citing lack of jurisdiction, sparked celebrations among supporters and highlighted questions about the European Union's border protection and asylum operations.\n\nA Greek judge dismissed a case Tuesday against nine Egyptian men accused of causing a shipwreck that killed hundreds of migrants last year and sent shockwaves through the European Union's border protection and asylum operations, after a prosecutor told the court Greece lacked jurisdiction.\n\nThe decision by Presiding Judge Eftichia Kontaratou came shortly after the trial opened in the southern Greek city of Kalamata, and was greeted with cheers and applause from supporters of the defendants at the courthouse.\n\nMore than 500 people are believed to have gone down with the overcrowded fishing trawler, which had been travelling from Libya to Italy. Only 104 people were rescued from the Adriana -- all men, the vast majority from Syria, Pakistan and Egypt -- and 82 bodies were recovered. Prosecutors accused the defendants, most in their 20s, of being part of the trawler's crew -- something the defence denied -- and therefore being responsible for the mistreatment of the passengers and the massively overcrowded conditions which authorities argued led to the boat capsizing and sinking on June 14 last year. The nine men faced up to life in prison had they been convicted of the multiple criminal charges against them, including people smuggling and causing a deadly shipwreck. The judge's ruling followed a recommendation by public prosecutor Ekaterini Tsironi for the case to be dismissed because the trawler sank outside Greek territorial waters.\n\n\"Clearly the shipwreck clearly occurred in international waters and ... the jurisdiction of the Greek courts cannot be established,'' she said. ''I propose that they be declared innocent.\" The case had faced criticism from international human rights groups, who argued that the defendants' right to a fair trial was compromised because they faced judgment while a separate Naval Court investigation into the sinking and the Greek coast guard's actions is still under way.\n\nSpyros Pantazis, one of the lawyers in the defence team, said the court had \"delivered justice today.\" \"This case needed a lot of work and a lot of effort. After such a long time, the whole defence team is really happy,\" he said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when the nine, who have been in pre-trial detention since being rescued last year, would be released. After the verdict was read, they were taken away to be processed.\n\nDalia Abdel-Magid, the aunt of defendant Mohammed Emad Abdel-Magid, reacted emotionally to the news that her nephew had been acquitted.\n\n\"I'm so happy that I just want to hug him and take him with me,'' she said. ''I hope that everything gets better for him now.\" Earlier, a small group of protesters clashed with riot police outside the courthouse. There were no reports of serious injuries but two people were detained. Officers from the special police forces maintained order in the courtroom.\n\n\"Justice prevailed. These people stayed in jail for a year even though they were innocent, and this must not happen again,'' said Stelios Kouloglou, a Greek member of the European Parliament. \"There are 2,000 innocent people in Greek jails, accused of or convicted of smuggling. The vast majority are innocent.\" As the trial started, Kontaratou questioned all nine defendants through an interpreter. The accused said their intention had been to travel to Italy, not Greece, and several declared their innocence. She acknowledged that on the ship there \"were no Greeks on board, it was not under a Greek flag and all the documents refer to the (vessel being) 47 nautical miles away.\" United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres last year described the shipwreck as \"horrific.'' The sinking renewed pressure on European governments to protect the lives of migrants and asylum seekers trying to reach the continent, as the number of people traveling illegally across the Mediterranean continues to rise every year.\n\nThe indictments against the nine were based on testimonies from another nine survivors. Defense lawyers had argued the witness testimonies had been coerced, and that their clients had been paying passengers who were scapegoated by authorities eager to put the blame for the sinking on overcrowded conditions. Several survivors have said the capsizing happened after the Greek coast guard attempted to tow the ship. The exact circumstances of the sinking remain unclear. The European border protection agency Frontex says illegal border detections at EU frontiers increased for three consecutive years through 2023, reaching the highest level since the 2015-2016 migration crisis, driven largely by arrivals at the sea borders.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

The Greek coastguard, notified by NGOs, the Italian coastguard, and Europe's border agency Frontex of the location of the ship, reached Adriana late on June 14 night.\n\nIn the first hours of June 15, the Adriana capsized.\n\nSurvivor testimonies allege that the Hellenic coastguard attempted to tow the boat, causing it to flip over, and that it did not sufficiently act to save the lives of those in the water.\n\nThe Hellenic coastguard has denied both of these allegations.\n\nThere were 104 survivors.\n\n\"Our argument, following the testimonies of the survivors, is that these nine people are not responsible for the sinking at the very least. The coastguard is responsible for the sinking,\" said Stefanos Levidis, one of the lead researchers in an investigation into the shipwreck, who will testify as an expert witness for the defence.\n\nLevidis's group, Forensis, which cross-referenced testimonies from 26 survivors with videos and photographs of the ship, vessel tracking and flight path data, satellite imagery, as well as the logs and testimonies of the captain of the coastguard vessel - concluded that the coastguard was responsible for the sinking as it did not properly mobilise other nearby ships, towed the Adriana, retreated causing waves, and then left those who had been thrown overboard as the ship capsized alone at sea for at least 20 minutes.\n\nA joint Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch report, based on testimonies from representatives of the Hellenic coastguard, the Greek police, and nongovernmental organisations, similarly concluded that the coastguard did not respond to distress calls properly and that allegations about its role in the sinking merited a full investigation.\n\nAn investigation in Greece's naval court into the Hellenic coastguard's role in the shipwreck has yet to be concluded. The defence team has not been given access to the evidence collected.\n\nThe Hellenic coastguard has repeatedly stated that those on board refused assistance before the boat capsized, denying any responsibility for the sinking as it maintains it fulfilled its life-saving duties.\n\nBeyond this, Levidis noted that there are questions about the evidence collected by the Hellenic coastguard after the sinking.\n\n\"The process of evidence collection coming from the authorities was lacking, at the very least, if not tampered with,\" he said.\n\nThe Hellenic coastguard ship PPLS920 was not transmitting data regarding its movements that day.\n\nThe optical and thermal cameras on board the ship did not record anything \"even though it's a state-of-the-art, brand-new, very expensive vessel\", said Levidis.\n\nThe phones of the survivors that were confiscated after the sinking were lost. They were later found inexplicably more than a month later on a different Hellenic coastguard vessel on the Greek island of Kythira, but were ultimately not examined.\n\nThe phones of the coastguard crew were confiscated two months after the incident, and there are several inconsistencies in the bridge logs of the PPLS920 and the captain's testimony.\n\n\"There's a real risk that these nine survivors could be found guilty on the basis of incomplete and questionable evidence given that the official investigation into the role of the coastguard has not yet been completed,\" said Judith Sunderland, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \"Credible and meaningful accountability for one of the worst shipwrecks in the Mediterranean needs to include a determination of any liabilities of Greek authorities.\"\n\nThe prosecution charges are based largely on testimonies taken from nine survivors.\n\nAccording to the defence lawyers, these testimonies appear to be \"widely copy-pasted from each other\".\n\n\"These testimonies not only largely resemble each other but were also taken in questionable circumstances, while the survivors were detained in a warehouse in Kalamata, immediately following their rescue from the deadly shipwreck. All these elements raise serious concern about their reliability and even authenticity,\" said Bouchetel of Lesvos Legal Centre.\n\nThe Legal Centre Lesvos argues the investigation should have also included communications from the Hellenic coastguard boat, data from nearby planes, and the examination of the mobile phones which the coastguard confiscated from the survivors.\n\nThe defence's request for further evidence to be included in the case was rejected by the interrogator judge, and the case file was closed after six months.\n\n\"Despite the mounting evidence of Greece's responsibility in this tragedy, blame was immediately put on the survivors themselves,\" said Bouchetel.\n\n\"This reversal of situation is typical of the troubling criminalisation pattern happening in Greece: migrants are unjustly convicted of smuggling offences, often based on limited and questionable evidence, in order to cover up state crimes, violence, and non-rescue by the border authorities.\"", "source": {"uri": "defenddemocracy.press", "dataType": "news", "title": "defenddemocracy.press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwreck", "type":

Only 104 people were rescued from the Adriana -- all men, the vast majority from Syria, Pakistan and Egypt -- and 82 bodies were recovered.\n\nProsecutors accused the defendants, most in their 20s, of being part of the trawler's crew -- something the defense denied -- and therefore being responsible for the mistreatment of the passengers and the massively overcrowded conditions which authorities argued led to the boat capsizing and sinking on June 14 last year. The nine men faced up to life in prison had they been convicted of the multiple criminal charges against them, including people smuggling and causing a deadly shipwreck.\n\nThe judge's ruling followed a recommendation by public prosecutor Ekaterini Tsironi for the case to be dismissed because the trawler sank outside Greek territorial waters.\n\n\"Clearly the shipwreck clearly occurred in international waters and ... the jurisdiction of the Greek courts cannot be established,\" she said. \"I propose that they be declared innocent.\"\n\nThe case had faced criticism from international human rights groups, who argued that the defendants' right to a fair trial was compromised because they faced judgment while a separate Naval Court investigation into the sinking and the Greek coast guard's actions is still under way.\n\nRead More: An Interview With Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis\n\nSpyros Pantazis, one of the lawyers in the defense team, said the court had \"delivered justice today.\"\n\n\"This case needed a lot of work and a lot of effort. After such a long time, the whole defense team is really happy,\" he said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when the nine, who have been in pre-trial detention since being rescued last year, would be released.

There were no reports of serious injuries but two people were detained. Officers from the special police forces maintained order in the courtroom.\n\n\"Justice prevailed. These people stayed in jail for a year even though they were innocent, and this must not happen again,\" said Stelios Kouloglou, a Greek member of the European Parliament. \"There are 2,000 innocent people in Greek jails, accused of or convicted of smuggling. The vast majority are innocent.\"\n\nAs the trial started, Kontaratou questioned all nine defendants through an interpreter. The accused said their intention had been to travel to Italy, not Greece, and several declared their innocence.\n\nShe acknowledged that on the ship there \"were no Greeks on board, it was not under a Greek flag and all the documents refer to the (vessel being) 47 nautical miles away.\"\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres last year described the shipwreck as \"horrific.\"\n\nThe sinking renewed pressure on European governments to protect the lives of migrants and asylum seekers trying to reach the continent, as the number of people traveling illegally across the Mediterranean continues to rise every year.\n\nThe indictments against the nine were based on testimonies from another nine survivors.

It soon emerged that women and children - of the 104 survivors, all were adult males and boys - had been locked in the hold of the boat. The ship sank in one of the deepest areas of the Mediterranean. To date, only 82 bodies have been recovered.\n\nBut almost a year on, there are concerns as to whether the accused, who were among the survivors, will be given a fair trial. The nine, aged between 20 and 40, stand accused of migrant smuggling, participating in a criminal organisation, endangering human lives and provoking a shipwreck - charges that, if convicted, carry multiple life sentences. All have categorically denied being involved in the smuggling operation.\n\nDefence lawyers have already signalled that when the trial opens on Tuesday they would try to have the case dismissed, arguing that as the shipwreck occurred in international waters, Greek courts lacked the jurisdiction to try it.\n\nRelated: 'The real smugglers are rarely on the boat': activists in Greece question jailing asylum seekers\n\nVicky Aggelidou, a lawyer representing two of the men, said the evidence of prosecution witnesses was not only insufficient but simply did not stack up.\n\n\"The witnesses were compelled to give testimony under duress. There's not the slightest bit of proof against the defendants and that's because they were paying customers just like the rest,\" she said. \"Real smugglers never get on a ship. We're talking about big business. They're very professional.\"\n\nNatasha Dailiani, another defence lawyer, said it was clear the suspects were \"scapegoats to cover up the responsibilities of the [Greek] coastguard\". \"There must be a fair trial and a search for the real causes,\" she added.\n\nGreek government officials insist that authorities were unable to take action earlier because the trawler was in international waters. Although a parallel investigation into the conduct of the Hellenic coastguard is also under way, maritime officials have likewise rebuffed allegations that they deliberately failed to intervene for fear of such a large group of asylum seekers being brought ashore. They have claimed that, while a vessel was dispatched to the area, the stricken boat's crew members repeatedly turned down offers of help, saying: \"No help ... [we] go to Italy.\"\n\nGroups supporting the rights of survivors and migrants dispute that version of events. In a report released in December, the EU border agency, Frontex, which had spotted the boat from the air before the coastguard, also alluded to dereliction of duty, saying the Greek authorities had failed to reply to follow-up calls and its offers of assistance. In a lawsuit filed last September, survivors not only accused Greek authorities of deliberately failing to intervene to rescue those on board, but argued that a doomed attempt to tow the trawler caused the vessel to sink.\n\n\"There's a real risk that these nine survivors could be found 'guilty' on the basis of incomplete and questionable evidence, given that the official investigation into the role of the coastguard has not been completed,\" said Judith Sunderland, the associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \"Credible and meaningful accountability for one of the worst shipwrecks in the Mediterranean needs to include a determination of any liability of Greek authorities.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News

Only 82 bodies were found while according to the U.N., more than 750 people were on board, including Syrians, Palestinians and nearly 350 Pakistanis, according to the Pakistani government.\n\nAhead of the trial, Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted that a parallel investigation into the Greek authorities' actions is still at a preliminary stage -- meaning the court will have incomplete information in assessing the culpability of the defendants.\n\n\"There's a real risk that these nine survivors could be found 'guilty' on the basis of incomplete and questionable evidence,\" Judith Sunderland, HRW associate Europe and Central Asia director said in a statement.\n\n\"Credible and meaningful accountability for one of the worst shipwrecks in the Mediterranean needs to include a determination of any liabilities of Greek authorities,\" she added.\n\nThe NGO Alarm Phone and the EU's border agency Frontex had both reported the trawler's presence to Greek authorities while it was in the Greek search and rescue zone.\n\nThe coastguard has insisted that it communicated with people on board who \"refused any help\".\n\n\"You cannot divert a boat with so many people on board by force unless there is cooperation,\" coastguard spokesman Nikolaos Alexiou had said at the time.\n\nBut survivors said the coastguard had wanted to tow the overloaded trawler.\n\nPrime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose country is accused by rights groups of practising illegal pushbacks at its border with T\u00fcrkiye, later dismissed claims against the port authorities as \"very unfair\".\n\nAn investigation by a naval court into the possible responsibilities of the coastguards is underway. But requests for access to the file have all been refused, the defence lawyers said.\n\nIn September, around fifty survivors filed a group lawsuit against the coastguard.\n\nFor migrant rights proponents, the trial is part of a longstanding practice of criminalising asylum seekers.\n\nAccording to the NGO Borderline Europe, Greek prisons hold around 2,000 migrants accused of being

of Greek shipwreck accused", "body": "ATHENS -- As nine men face trial in Greece accused of causing the worst migrant shipwreck in the Mediterranean Sea for a decade, the BBC revealed key discrepancies in the case against them.\n\nThe accused face life in prison if convicted of people-smuggling and causing the sinking of the fishing boat last June in which as many as 600 people are feared to have drowned.\n\nThe indictment obtained by the BBC shows the defendants are being prosecuted on evidence which has already been contradicted by at least six survivors who told us the coastguard had caused their boat to capsize and then pressured them to frame the Egyptians.\n\nHuman rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have said they have strong reservations about the integrity of the Greek investigation and evidence and are asking whether the defendants will receive a fair trial.\n\nThe Greek coastguard has constantly denied their actions brought about the disaster and the authorities have rejected all claims of wrongdoing or of a cover-up.\n\nThe nine defendants, who are Egyptian and aged between 20 and 41, are listed to stand trial on Tuesday in the southern Greek coastal city of Kalamata.\n\nThe men were all on board the \"Adriana\" fishing boat that sank in international waters, but in Greece's demarcated rescue area, in one of the deepest parts of the Mediterranean on 14 June last year.\n\nEighty-two bodies were recovered, but the United Nations believes an additional 500 people -- including 100 women and children who were in the hold of the boat -- may have died.\n\nIt's estimated the boat was carrying up to 750 migrants when it set off nearly a week earlier from the port of Tobruk in Libya.\n\nThe Greek coastguard had been following the boat for at least seven hours before the sinking happened but later said it did not attempt a rescue because the vessel was traveling safely at a \"steady speed\" and on a \"steady course\" to Italy and that passengers were not in danger.\n\nA previous BBC investigation cast serious doubt on these claims.\n\nWhen the BBC put our allegations to Greece's prime minister last November, Kyriakos Mitsotakis said they were being investigated but that culpability rested with the smugglers.\n\n\"Our coastguard has saved tens of thousands of people at sea and we should be grateful for the work they do,\" Mitsotakis said.\n\nThe indictment obtained by the BBC reveals that Greek prosecutors accuse the nine Egyptians of causing the disaster by skippering an extremely overcrowded vessel which they knew posed an obvious danger to life.\n\nIt reads: \"The fishing vessel was not seaworthy as it was old and badly maintained and not fit to transfer such a large number of people, especially for such a huge distance while there were no life jackets.\"\n\nThe prosecution says each of the defendants took turns to steer the vessel and were all aware the severe overcrowding on both the deck and in the hold was badly affecting stability.\n\nLast summer the Greek coastguard responded to heavy criticism of its failure to do more to help the vessel by insisting the migrant boat was safe and travelling steadily towards Italy and therefore and did not need to be rescued.\n\nNow though, nearly a year after the disaster, the Greek prosecution case will be based on an argument that directly contradicts the coastguard's official account.\n\nThe indictment also says that the nine Egyptian men were part of a smuggling gang and charged each passenger between $4,000 and $8,000 (\u00a33,100-\u00a36,300) for a spot on the boat.\n\nThe prosecution's charges are based on interviews, conducted by the coastguards themselves, of nine other survivors in the days after the disaster.\n\nNo evidence from the other 95 survivors appears to have been submitted to the court.\n\nOur team previously heard claims that some of the 104 survivors were pressured into identifying the nine Egyptian men as traffickers.\n\nTwo Syrian men, who we called Ahmad and Musaab to protect their identity, told us the coastguard had instructed them to keep quiet about other factors in the disaster and instead to blame these nine men.\n\n\"They were imprisoned and were wrongly accused by the Greek authorities as an attempt to cover their crime,\" said Musaab.\n\nIn separate interviews in Athens, four other survivors told us they believed the Egyptians were paying passengers like them and had been framed.\n\nBut other survivors are said to have stated they were indeed mistreated by some of the accused -- who have been referred to as the Pylos Nine, drawing on the name of the Greek town of Pylos near the location of the sinking.\n\nIn the weeks after the disaster, multiple survivors claimed that a Greek patrol vessel had in fact caused the migrant boat to capsize in a last-ditch, botched attempt to tow it.\n\nThis allegation is not mentioned anywhere in the court indictment even though the United Nations say the claims merit an independent investigation.\n\nThe Naval Court in Greece is investigating possible wrongdoing on the part of the coastguard, which has consistently denied all allegations.\n\nAhmad and Musaab, whom we interviewed last year, claimed they were silenced and intimidated by Greek authorities after suggesting the patrol vessel caused the sinking.\n\n\"They attached a rope from the left. Everyone moved to the right side of our boat to balance it,\" said Musaab. \"The Greek vessel moved off quickly causing our boat to flip. They kept dragging it for quite a distance.\"\n\nIn total, six survivors described independently to the BBC, in near identical detail, how coastguards caused their boat to capsize.\n\nNo video from onboard the Adriana has ever emerged, let alone the moment of sinking.\n\nThe coastguard said their own high-specification cameras were not recording.\n\nSome survivors said they at times had been filming while onboard but that coastguards confiscated their mobiles shortly after they were rescued.\n\nThese phones were apparently then lost before being found almost a month later in a bag onboard the one coastguard vessel that had been present at the sinking.\n\nDefense lawyers had requested that some phones be examined for potentially useful evidence, but court documents obtained by the BBC show the investigating magistrate ruled last year that this would be a futile exercise as a \"self-evident consequence\" of the migrant falling into the sea was that their phones would have all been irreversibly damaged:\n\n\"The sea water has entered the confiscated phones which resulted in the inability to extract any kind of stored digital data from them and as such [attempting to extract data] is pointless.\"\n\nThe separate Naval Court investigation into the potential liability of the coastguard opened in the weeks after the disaster, but it remains at the preliminary stages.\n\nHuman rights groups believe that this should be concluded before any criminal trial of the Egyptian defendants.\n\nChristos Dimopoulos, director of Amnesty International Greece said: \"The criminal court will probably have incomplete information in assessing the culpability of the defendants. There is a real risk for the trial to be based on incomplete and/or questionable evidence.\"\n\nThe Greek government, which has vowed to hold smugglers to account and to crack down on illegal crossings, has said justice will be done.\n\nJudith Sunderland, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch said:\n\n\"Credible and meaningful accountability for one of the worst shipwrecks in the Mediterranean needs to include a determination of any liabilities of Greek authorities.\" -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi

But requests for access to the file have all been refused, the defence lawyers said.\n\nIn September, around fifty survivors filed a group lawsuit against the coastguard.\n\nFor migrant rights proponents, the trial is part of a longstanding practice of criminalising asylum seekers.\n\nAccording to the NGO Borderline Europe, Greek prisons hold around 2,000 migrants accused of being smugglers, constituting the second largest group in Greece's prison population.", "source": {"uri": "arynews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "ARY NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The defendants, most of whom are in their 20s, face multiple criminal charges and could be sentenced to life imprisonment if convicted. The shipwreck of the \"Adriana\" fishing trawler on June 14, 2023, sent shockwaves throughout Europe, raising serious questions about the European Union's border protection and asylum policies.\n\nThe Adriana, carrying around 750 people primarily from Egypt, Pakistan, Syria, and Palestine, embarked on its ill-fated journey from Libya on June 9, 2023, aiming for Italy. Distress calls were sent out four days later when the trawler stopped moving. Despite being alerted by NGOs, the Italian coastguard, and Frontex, the Greek coastguard reached the vessel late on June 14. In the early hours of June 15, the Adriana capsized, resulting in the death of over 500 passengers. A total of 104 people were rescued, and 82 bodies were recovered.\n\nRead More: New revelations contradict Greece's claims on migrant shipwreck\n\nThe nine defendants are accused of being members of a criminal organization, facilitating illegal entry into Greece, and intentionally causing the shipwreck. However, they vehemently deny these charges, claiming they were merely attempting to reach Europe like the other passengers. Lawyers from Greek human rights groups argue that the trial is unfair, noting that the investigation into the Greek coastguard's possible mishandling of the rescue operation is still incomplete.\n\nInternational human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have criticized the trial proceedings as rushed and improper. Judith Sunderland, an associate director for Europe and Central Asia at Human Rights Watch, expressed concerns about the incomplete and questionable evidence against the defendants. Similarly, Marion Bouchetel from the Legal Centre Lesvos highlighted that the testimonies used to indict the men were taken under dubious circumstances and appear to be largely copied from one another.\n\nA significant point of contention in this case is the role of the Greek coastguard during the rescue operation. Survivor testimonies allege that the coastguard's attempt to tow the Adriana caused it to flip over and that they did not adequately act to save those thrown into the water. These allegations have been consistently denied by the Greek coastguard, which maintains that those on board refused assistance. An investigation into the coastguard's actions has yet to be concluded, adding to the complexity and controversy surrounding the trial.\n\nCritics argue that the investigation into the shipwreck has been insufficient and biased. There are claims that crucial evidence, including communications from the coastguard and data from nearby planes, was not included in the case file. The defense's request for this evidence was denied, raising questions about the thoroughness and fairness of the investigation. Additionally, inconsistencies in the coastguard's logs and testimonies, along with the questionable handling of survivors' confiscated phones, further undermine confidence in the official narrative.\n\nRead More: Pakistan observes day of mourning for citizens who died in Greece shipwreck\n\nThis trial has far-reaching implications, not only for the nine defendants but also for the broader issue of migrant treatment and border protection in Europe. The shipwreck has intensified scrutiny on how European countries manage and protect the lives of migrants and asylum seekers. With illegal border crossings on the rise, the European Union faces mounting pressure to address these humanitarian crises more effectively and humanely.", "source": {"uri": "globalvillagespace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global Village Space"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwreck", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shipwreck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coast guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_trawler", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fishing trawler"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Border_and_Coast_Guard_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Border and Coast Guard Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Libya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Libya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Border control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbos", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lesbos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lesbos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.globalvillagespace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/shipwreck.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9582901", "eventUri": "eng-9582901", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 904, "textEnd": 911}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 935, "textEnd": 942}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-06-", "textStart": 393, "textEnd": 400}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The accused said their intention was to travel to Italy, not Greece, and several declared their innocence.\n\nKontaratou acknowledged that there \"were no Greeks on board, it was not under a Greek

Other (defendants) were on oxygen therapy. And all of a sudden, they were arrested without understanding why,\" Effie Doussi, a member of the defence legal team, told reporters last week.\n\nSome survivors subsequently claimed to have come under pressure from Greek police to \"designate\" suspects, based on blurry photographs, she added.\n\nAmong the more than 750 people on board the trawler when it sank, were Syrians, Palestinians and nearly 350 Pakistanis.\n\nAhead of the trial, Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted that a parallel investigation into the Greek authorities' actions is still at a preliminary stage - meaning the court will have incomplete information in assessing the culpability of the defendants.\n\n\"There's a real risk that these nine survivors could be found 'guilty' on the basis of incomplete and questionable evidence,\" Judith Sunderland, HRW associate Europe and Central Asia director said in a statement.\n\n\"Credible and meaningful accountability for one of the worst shipwrecks in the Mediterranean needs to include a determination of any liabilities of Greek authorities,\" she added.\n\nThe NGO Alarm Phone and the EU's border agency Frontex had both reported the trawler's presence to Greek authorities while it was in the Greek search and rescue zone.\n\nThe coastguard has insisted that it communicated with people on board who \"refused any help\".\n\n\"You cannot divert a boat with so many people on board by force unless there is cooperation,\" coastguard spokesman Nikolaos Alexiou had said at the time.\n\nBut survivors said the coastguard had wanted to tow the overloaded trawler.\n\nPrime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose country is accused by rights groups of practising illegal pushbacks at its border with Turkey, later dismissed claims against the port authorities as \"very unfair\".\n\nAn investigation by a naval court into the possible responsibilities of the coastguards is under way. But requests for access to the file have all been refused, the defence lawyers said.\n\nIn September, around 50 survivors filed a group lawsuit against the coastguard.\n\nFor migrant rights proponents, the trial is part of a longstanding practice of criminalising asylum seekers.\n\nAccording to the NGO Borderline Europe, Greek prisons hold around 2,000 migrants accused of being smugglers, constituting the second largest group in Greece's prison population.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It soon emerged that women and children - of the 104 survivors, all were adult males and boys - had been locked in the hold of the boat. The ship sank in one of the deepest areas of the Mediterranean. To date, only 82 bodies have been recovered.\n\nBut almost a year on, there are concerns as to whether the accused, who were among the survivors, will be given a fair trial. The nine, aged between 20 and 40, stand accused of migrant smuggling, participating in a criminal organisation, endangering human lives and provoking a shipwreck - charges that, if convicted, carry multiple life sentences. All have categorically denied being involved in the smuggling operation.\n\nDefence lawyers have already signalled that when the trial opens on Tuesday they would try to have the case dismissed, arguing that as the shipwreck occurred in international waters, Greek courts lacked the jurisdiction to try it.\n\nVicky Aggelidou, a lawyer representing two of the men, said the evidence of prosecution witnesses was not only insufficient but simply did not stack up.\n\n\"The witnesses were compelled to give testimony under duress. There's not the slightest bit of proof against the defendants and that's because they were paying customers just like the rest,\" she said. \"Real smugglers never get on a ship. We're talking about big business. They're very professional.\"\n\nNatasha Dailiani, another defence lawyer, said it was clear the suspects were \"scapegoats to cover up the responsibilities of the [Greek] coastguard\". \"There must be a fair trial and a search for the real causes,\" she added.\n\nGreek government officials insist that authorities were unable to take action earlier because the trawler was in international waters. Although a parallel investigation into the conduct of the Hellenic coastguard is also under way, maritime officials have likewise rebuffed allegations that they deliberately failed to intervene for fear of such a large group of asylum seekers being brought ashore. They have claimed that, while a vessel was dispatched to the area, the stricken boat's crew members repeatedly turned down offers of help, saying: \"No help ... [we] go to Italy.\"\n\nGroups supporting the rights of survivors and migrants dispute that version of events. In a report released in December, the EU border agency, Frontex, which had spotted the boat from the air before the coastguard, also alluded to dereliction of duty, saying the Greek authorities had failed to reply to follow-up calls and its offers of assistance. In a lawsuit filed last September, survivors not only accused Greek authorities of deliberately failing to intervene to rescue those on board, but argued that a doomed attempt to tow the trawler caused the vessel to sink.\n\n\"There's a real risk that these nine survivors could be found 'guilty' on the basis of incomplete and questionable evidence, given that the official investigation into the role of the coastguard has not been completed,\" said Judith Sunderland, the associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \"Credible and meaningful accountability for one of the worst shipwrecks in the Mediterranean needs to include a determination of any liability of Greek authorities.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

Other were on oxygen therapy. And all of a sudden, they were arrested without understanding why,\" Effie Doussi, a member of the defence legal team, told reporters last week.\n\nSome survivors subsequently claimed to have come under pressure from Greek police to \"designate\" suspects, based on blurry photographs, she added.\n\nThe sinking of the rusty and overloaded trawler Adriana on the night of June 13 to 14, 2023 off the coast of Greece, has left many unanswered questions as to whether the tragedy could have been averted.\n\nThe boat had set sail from Libya and was heading for Italy. Only 82 bodies were found while according to the UN, more than 750 people were on board, including Syrians, Palestinians and nearly 350 Pakistanis, according to the Pakistani government.\n\nAhead of the trial, Human Rights Watch has noted that a parallel investigation into the Greek authorities' actions is still at a preliminary stage meaning the court will have incomplete information in assessing the culpability of the defendants.\n\n\"There's a real risk that these nine survivors could be found 'guilty' on the basis of incomplete and questionable evidence,\" Judith Sunderland, HRW associate Europe and Central Asia director said in a statement.\n\n\"Credible and meaningful accountability for one of the worst shipwrecks in the Mediterranean needs to include a determination of any liabilities of Greek authorities,\" she added.\n\nSeveral migrant support groups and media outlets have said that the Greek coastguard was slow to intervene and then gave only a trickle of information on the circumstances of the tragedy.\n\nThe NGO Alarm Phone and the EU's border agency Frontex had both reported the trawler's presence to Greek authorities while it was in the Greek search and rescue zone.\n\nThe coastguard had insisted that it communicated with persons on board who \"refused any help\".\n\n\"You cannot divert a boat with so many people on board by force unless there is cooperation,\" coastguard spokesman Nikolaos Alexiou had said at the time.\n\nIn contrast, survivors said the coastguard had wanted to tow the overloaded trawler.\n\nPrime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose country is accused by rights groups of practising illegal pushbacks at its border with Turkey, later dismissed claims against the port authorities as \"very unfair\".\n\nAn investigation by a naval court into the possible responsibilities of the coastguards is underway. But requests for access to the file have all been refused, the defence lawyers said.\n\nIn September, around fifty survivors filed a group lawsuit against the coastguard.\n\nFor migrant rights proponents, the trial is part of a longstanding practice of criminalising asylum seekers.\n\nAccording to the NGO Borderline Europe, Greek prisons hold around 2,000 migrants accused of being smugglers, constituting the second largest group in Greece's prison population.\n\nmr/yap/jph/rox", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors":

Europe Correspondent and Kostas Kallergis - Senior Europe Producer\n\nAs nine men face trial in Greece accused of causing the worst migrant shipwreck in the Mediterranean Sea for a decade, the BBC can reveal key discrepancies in the case against them.\n\nThe accused face life in prison if convicted of people-smuggling and causing the sinking of the fishing boat last June in which as many as 600 people are feared to have drowned.\n\nThe indictment obtained by the BBC shows the defendants are being prosecuted on evidence which has already been contradicted by at least six survivors who told us the coastguard had caused their boat to capsize and then pressured them to frame the Egyptians.\n\nHuman rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have said they have strong reservations about the integrity of the Greek investigation and evidence and are asking whether the defendants will receive a fair trial.\n\nThe Greek coastguard has constantly denied their actions brought about the disaster and the authorities have rejected all claims of wrongdoing or of a cover-up.\n\nThe nine defendants, who are Egyptian and aged between 20 and 41, are listed to stand trial on Tuesday in the southern Greek coastal city of Kalamata.\n\nThe men were all on board the \"Adriana\" fishing boat that sank in international waters, but in Greece's demarcated rescue area, in one of the deepest parts of the Mediterranean on 14 June last year.\n\nEighty-two bodies were recovered, but the United Nations believes an additional 500 people - including 100 women and children who were in the hold of the boat - may have died.\n\nIt's estimated the boat was carrying up to 750 migrants when it set off nearly a week earlier from the port of Tobruk in Libya.\n\nThe Greek coastguard had been following the boat for at least seven hours before the sinking happened but later said it did not attempt a rescue because the vessel was travelling safely at a \"steady speed\" and on a \"steady course\" to Italy and that passengers were not in danger.\n\nA previous BBC investigation cast serious doubt on these claims.\n\nWhen the BBC put our allegations to Greece's prime minister last November, Kyriakos Mitsotakis said they were being investigated but that culpability rested with the smugglers.\n\n\"Our coastguard has saved tens of thousands of people at sea and we should be grateful for the work they do,\" Mr Mitsotakis said.\n\nThe indictment obtained by the BBC reveals that Greek prosecutors accuse the nine Egyptians of causing the disaster by skippering an extremely overcrowded vessel which they knew posed an obvious danger to life.\n\nIt reads: \"The fishing vessel was not seaworthy as it was old and badly maintained and not fit to transfer such a large number of people, especially for such a huge distance while there were no life jackets.\"\n\nThe prosecution says each of the defendants took turns to steer the vessel and were all aware the severe overcrowding on both the deck and in the hold was badly affecting stability.\n\nLast summer the Greek coastguard responded to heavy criticism of its failure to do more to help the vessel by insisting the migrant boat was safe and travelling steadily towards Italy and therefore and did not need to be rescued.\n\nNow though, nearly a year after the disaster, the Greek prosecution case will be based on an argument that directly contradicts the coastguard's official account.\n\nThe indictment also says that the nine Egyptian men were part of a smuggling gang and charged each passenger between $4,000 and $8,000 (\u00a33,100-\u00a36,300) for a spot on the boat.\n\nThe prosecution's charges are based on interviews, conducted by the coastguards themselves, of nine other survivors in the days after the disaster.\n\nNo evidence from the other 95 survivors appears to have been submitted to the court.\n\nOur team previously heard claims that some of the 104 survivors were pressured into identifying the nine Egyptian men as traffickers.\n\nTwo Syrian men, who we called Ahmad and Musaab to protect their identity, told us the coastguard had instructed them to keep quiet about other factors in the disaster and instead to blame these nine men.\n\n\"They were imprisoned and were wrongly accused by the Greek authorities as an attempt to cover their crime,\" said Musaab.\n\nIn separate interviews in Athens, four other survivors told us they believed the Egyptians were paying passengers like them and had been framed.\n\nBut other survivors are said to have stated they were indeed mistreated by some of the accused - who have been referred to as the Pylos Nine, drawing on the name of the Greek town of Pylos near the location of the sinking.\n\nIn the weeks after the disaster, multiple survivors claimed that a Greek patrol vessel had in fact caused the migrant boat to capsize in a last-ditch, botched attempt to tow it.\n\nThis allegation is not mentioned anywhere in the court indictment even though the United Nations say the claims merit an independent investigation.\n\nThe Naval Court in Greece is investigating possible wrongdoing on the part of the coastguard, which has consistently denied all allegations.\n\nAhmad and Musaab, whom we interviewed last year, claimed they were silenced and intimidated by Greek authorities after suggesting the patrol vessel caused the sinking.\n\n\"They attached a rope from the left. Everyone moved to the right side of our boat to balance it,\" said Musaab. \"The Greek vessel moved off quickly causing our boat to flip. They kept dragging it for quite a distance.\"\n\nIn total, six survivors described independently to the BBC, in near identical detail, how coastguards caused their boat to capsize.\n\nNo video from onboard the Adriana has ever emerged, let alone the moment of sinking.\n\nThe coastguard said their own high-specification cameras were not recording.\n\nSome survivors said they at times had been filming while onboard but that coastguards confiscated their mobiles shortly after they were rescued.\n\nThese phones were apparently then lost before being found almost a month later in a bag onboard the one coastguard vessel that had been present at the sinking.\n\nDefence lawyers had requested that some phones be examined for potentially useful evidence, but court documents obtained by the BBC show the investigating magistrate ruled last year that this would be a futile exercise as a \"self-evident consequence\" of the migrant falling into the sea was that their phones would have all been irreversibly damaged:\n\n\"The sea water has entered the confiscated phones which resulted in the inability to extract any kind of stored digital data from them and as such [attempting to extract data] is pointless.\"\n\nThe separate Naval Court investigation into the potential liability of the coastguard opened in the weeks after the disaster, but it remains at the preliminary stages.\n\nHuman rights groups believe that this should be concluded before any criminal trial of the Egyptian defendants.\n\nChristos Dimopoulos, director of Amnesty International Greece said: \"The criminal court will probably have incomplete information in assessing the culpability of the defendants. There is a real risk for the trial to be based on incomplete and/or questionable evidence.\"\n\nThe Greek government, which has vowed to hold smugglers to account and to crack down on illegal crossings, has said justice will be done.\n\nJudith Sunderland, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch said:\n\n\"Credible and meaningful accountability for one of the worst shipwrecks in the Mediterranean needs to include a determination of any liabilities of Greek authorities.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

The Greek coastguard, notified by NGOs, the Italian coastguard, and Europe's border agency Frontex of the location of the ship, reached Adriana late on June 14 night.\n\nIn the first hours of June 15, the Adriana capsized.\n\nSurvivor testimonies allege that the Hellenic coastguard attempted to tow the boat, causing it to flip over, and that it did not sufficiently act to save the lives of those in the water.\n\nThe Hellenic coastguard has denied both of these allegations.\n\nThere were 104 survivors.\n\n\"Our argument, following the testimonies of the survivors, is that these nine people are not responsible for the sinking at the very least. The coastguard is responsible for the sinking,\" said Stefanos Levidis, one of the lead researchers in an investigation into the shipwreck, who will testify as an expert witness for the defence.\n\nLevidis's group, Forensis, which cross-referenced testimonies from 26 survivors with videos and photographs of the ship, vessel tracking and flight path data, satellite imagery, as well as the logs and testimonies of the captain of the coastguard vessel - concluded that the coastguard was responsible for the sinking as it did not properly mobilise other nearby ships, towed the Adriana, retreated causing waves, and then left those who had been thrown overboard as the ship capsized alone at sea for at least 20 minutes.\n\nA joint Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch report, based on testimonies from representatives of the Hellenic coastguard, the Greek police, and nongovernmental organisations, similarly concluded that the coastguard did not respond to distress calls properly and that allegations about its role in the sinking merited a full investigation.\n\nAn investigation in Greece's naval court into the Hellenic coastguard's role in the shipwreck has yet to be concluded. The defence team has not been given access to the evidence collected.\n\nThe Hellenic coastguard has repeatedly stated that those on board refused assistance before the boat capsized, denying any responsibility for the sinking as it maintains it fulfilled its life-saving duties.\n\nBeyond this, Levidis noted that there are questions about the evidence collected by the Hellenic coastguard after the sinking.\n\n\"The process of evidence collection coming from the authorities was lacking, at the very least, if not tampered with,\" he said.\n\nThe Hellenic coastguard ship PPLS920 was not transmitting data regarding its movements that day.\n\nThe optical and thermal cameras on board the ship did not record anything \"even though it's a state-of-the-art, brand-new, very expensive vessel\", said Levidis.\n\nThe phones of the survivors that were confiscated after the sinking were lost. They were later found inexplicably more than a month later on a different Hellenic coastguard vessel on the Greek island of Kythira, but were ultimately not examined.\n\nThe phones of the coastguard crew were confiscated two months after the incident, and there are several inconsistencies in the bridge logs of the PPLS920 and the captain's testimony.\n\n\"There's a real risk that these nine survivors could be found guilty on the basis of incomplete and questionable evidence given that the official investigation into the role of the coastguard has not yet been completed,\" said Judith Sunderland, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \"Credible and meaningful accountability for one of the worst shipwrecks in the Mediterranean needs to include a determination of any liabilities of Greek authorities.\"\n\nThe prosecution charges are based largely on testimonies taken from nine survivors.\n\nAccording to the defence lawyers, these testimonies appear to be \"widely copy-pasted from each other\".\n\n\"These testimonies not only largely resemble each other but were also taken in questionable circumstances, while the survivors were detained in a warehouse in Kalamata, immediately following their rescue from the deadly shipwreck. All these elements raise serious concern about their reliability and even authenticity,\" said Bouchetel of Lesvos Legal Centre.\n\nThe Legal Centre Lesvos argues the investigation should have also included communications from the Hellenic coastguard boat, data from nearby planes, and the examination of the mobile phones which the coastguard confiscated from the survivors.\n\nThe defence's request for further evidence to be included in the case was rejected by the interrogator judge, and the case file was closed after six months.\n\n\"Despite the mounting evidence of Greece's responsibility in this tragedy, blame was immediately put on the survivors themselves,\" said Bouchetel.\n\n\"This reversal of situation is typical of the troubling criminalisation pattern happening in Greece: migrants are unjustly convicted of smuggling offences, often based on limited and questionable evidence, in order to cover up state crimes, violence, and non-rescue by the border authorities.\"", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "moira_lavelle@aljazeera.com", "name": "Moira Lavelle", "type": "author",

Some 104 survivors were rescued and only 82 bodies were recovered in one of the deadliest boat accidents in the Mediterranean. The Egyptian men, aged between 21 and 41, were arrested hours after the boat sank and have remained in police custody on charges of migrant smuggling, causing a shipwreck and participating in a criminal organisation. They deny wrongdoing.\n\nBut international rights groups, defence lawyers and witnesses dispute that the men were to blame. Many claim that the coastguard was at fault, which it denies. \"What is ... unbearable is to convict a person for acts that he never committed and to paint his hands with blood through your own acts,\" defence lawyer Efi Doussi told journalists last week.\n\nEarly on Tuesday, the men, some of them wearing shirts, were brought into a packed courtroom as relatives, witnesses and supporters watched from a distance. Outside the court, protesters in support of the defendants briefly scuffled with police who had cordoned off the area.\n\n\"This crime will not be forgotten,\" protesters chanted. \"We will become the voices of the dead.\" Survivors told Reuters last year that a disastrous attempt by the coastguard to tow the boat caused it to capsize in some of the deepest waters in the Mediterranean.\n\nDefence lawyers said the men were charged after a rushed investigation and on insufficient evidence. They accuse the coastguard of monitoring the vessel for hours before launching a rescue operation and that the coastguard tried to pull the boat into Italian waters.

nine survivors could be found 'guilty' on the basis of incomplete and questionable evidence given that the official investigation into the role of the coast guard has not yet been completed,\" said

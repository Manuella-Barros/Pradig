At any other time, that would be a review of Deco Drive, but tonight, we\u2019re showing our love for mangoes. \u2018Tis the season for that fabulous fruit, and we found some places that are making mango magic. You can go pretty far with mangoes. You can eat \u2019em, you can drink \u2019em, and at Juice Mafia in Hallandale Beach, you can sell \u2019em and get a great deal on all their great stuff. Sandra Veszi Einhorn, Juice Mafia: \u201cFor every ripe mango that you bring in, up to four, we give you 50% off, up to $2 off.\u201d Make sure your mangoes are in good condition before you bring them in. Sandra Veszi Einhorn: \u201cMangoes, especially now, when they\u2019re in season, they are super-duper ripe, and so for things like acai bowls, we need mangoes that are a little more firm, that are a little more aesthetically pleasing when you look at them in a bowl.\u201d The softer, sweeter ones will be used to make juices and puddings. It\u2019s Juice Mafia\u2019s mission to have more mangoes in their store and less on the ground. Sandra Veszi Einhorn: \u201cWe are hoping to bring more people in to be able to use those mangoes, so we don\u2019t have more mango waste.\u201d Michelle Hernandez: \u201cI love it. It\u2019s delicious. I have extra mangoes, and sometimes I don\u2019t like the mess of cutting the mangoes myself, so it\u2019s perfect.\u201d It\u2019s mango mayhem at Michael\u2019s Genuine Food and Drink in the Design District. Michael Schwartz: \u201cWe love mango season!\u201d And this season, the restaurant has crafted a menu tailored to the sweet fruit. Michael Schwartz: \u201cLike any other ingredient, when it\u2019s local and abundant, we try to incorporate it in as many iterations in the menu as possible.\u201d Like an entr\u00e9e. Michael Schwartz: \u201cWe love fish and mango. So there\u2019s a new Hamachi Crudo on the menu, with a crisp little rice cake on the top and beautiful mango acid.\u201d Or a classy cocktail. Michael Schwartz: \u201cThe bar team developed a great cocktail. It\u2019s called Old Man-Go. Get it? Old mango? And it\u2019s really like the pulsed-up mojito, eight? So really good quality. Mint syrup, mango pur\u00e9e, and then Havana a\u00f1ejo, and then, instead of sparkling water, we use some Brazilian sparkling wine.\u201d You didn\u2019t think they forgot about dessert, did you? Michael Schwartz: \u201cAnd additionally, there\u2019s a great mango pavlova, and super interesting way in the way our pastry chef designed that dish, and it eats really well.\u201d The restaurant also has a very interesting way of sourcing mangos. Michael Schwartz: \u201cWe have a really strict no non-local mango policy. We\u2019ll go around town and look for trees, and if we see fruit on the ground, we usually knock on those people\u2019s doors.\u201d FOR MORE INFO:Juice Mafia801 N Federal Highway, Suite 108Hallandale Beach, FL 33009 thejuicemafia.com Michael\u2019s Genuine Food and Drink130 NE 40th StMiami, FL, 33137michaelsgenuine.com Copyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

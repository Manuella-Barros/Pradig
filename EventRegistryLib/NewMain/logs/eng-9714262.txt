added.\n\nIntroducing the pilot project named 'CopenPay,' which will be in force as of July 15 until Aug. 11, the office said the rewarding will be done via this application.\n\nIt further mentioned: \"Based on the evaluation, we hope to reintroduce CopenPay as a year-round, green payment experience within the economy and broaden the concept to other parts of Denmark and the rest of the

city will reward tourists who take part in climate-friendly tasks.\n\nAs global tourism continues to grow, leading European tourism hubs such as Barcelona and Venice have started taking measures to tackle overtourism, including introducing entrance fees, visitor zones and tourist taxes.\n\nHowever, Copenhagen is moving with a different approach - rewarding visitors who act responsibly.\n\nThe tourism office of the Danish capital said that the city will reward tourists who participate in climate-friendly tasks. \"Copenhagen attractions reward climate-friendly actions,\" the office said in a statement.\n\n\"All our choices have an environmental impact, so why not make conscious decisions that benefit us all and be rewarded for them?\" it added.\n\nIntroducing the pilot project named \"CopenPay,\" which will be in force from July 15 until Aug. 11, the office said the reward will be done via this application.\n\nIt further mentioned, \"Based on the evaluation, we hope to reintroduce CopenPay as a year-round, green payment experience within the economy and broaden the concept to other parts of Denmark and the rest of the world.\"\n\n\"Earn rewards at Copenhagen attractions ranging from a free lunch or a cup of coffee to a kayak tour or even a free entrance to a museum,\" the statement said.\n\n\"All you need to do is, for instance, bike instead of drive, help maintain the city, work in an urban garden or pledge to sustainable behavior,\" it noted.\n\nExplaining the new application, the office said the purpose of CopenPay was \"to encourage sustainable

in Copenhagen and it is not intended to increase tourism,\" it stated.\n\n\"With CopenPay, we're empowering people to experience more of what Copenhagen offers while placing less burden on our

responsible,\" he said, according to the statement.\n\nAbout how the application will work, the office noted that to take part in it is a simple act.\n\n\"Tourists and residents can redeem rewards by

That means attractions won't be made to ask for proof that the green activity you say you've done has actually been completed.\n\n\"In some attractions, you might have to show a picture of you riding a bike, or of your public transportation ticket,\" Petersen says.\n\nSo far, some 24 organisations have signed up to the pilot scheme - but the government won't be reimbursing the companies behind the attractions.\n\nThe move comes following a release of data from 2023's Sustainability Index which suggests tourists are keen to make more green choices - 82 per cent of people - but have yet to do so - 22 per cent.\n\nCopenPay will reward a wide variety of actions taken by visitors such as cycling, participating in clean-up efforts, or volunteering at urban farms, with access to must-visit experiences.\n\nThey'll include offerings from complimentary guided museum tours to sports to free vegetarian lunches made from locally-grown crops.\n\nSome of the experiences will be exclusive to those taking part.\n\nFor instance, visitors at the National Gallery of Denmark who collect plastic waste will be invited to take part in a workshop to turn it into a piece of art.\n\nIf a tourist decides to take public transport or a bike to Copenhagen's iconic heating plant, they'll be given the unique experience of skiing down its slope, located on the building's roof.\n\nCopenhagen officials hope these incentives will prove fruitful for the future of the city's tourism - and its contribution to green tourism.\n\n\"We must turn tourism from being an environmental burden into a force for positive change - and one important step in this transformation is to change how we move around at the destination, what we consume, and how we interact with the locals,\" Mikkel Aar\u00f8-Hansen, CEO at Wonderful Copenhagen, says.\n\n\"With CopenPay, we want travellers -

More than two-thirds of the city's hotels have eco-certification.\n\nNow, the city officials want to build on this sustainable foundation and invite tourists to join Copenhagen's green lifestyle.\n\nA new pilot program, \"CopenPay,\" will reward actions like cycling in the city, participating in clean-up projects, or volunteering for green initiatives with various rewards and experiences, such as museum tours, kayak rentals, free coffee, or even a meal with local delicacies.\n\nEssentially, green actions become the currency for enjoying cultural experiences in Copenhagen.\n\nWith many European cities suffering from overtourism and actively introducing measures to limit visitor numbers, it's refreshing to see a city focusing on attracting a different kind of tourist who aligns more closely with the values of the local population.\n\nAs local sites mention: \"There is a need to change tourists' mindset and encourage green choices. Data shows a great willingness, as 82% of tourists state they want to act sustainably, but only 22% have changed their behavior.\"\n\nMikkel Aar\u00f8-Hansen, CEO of Wonderful Copenhagen, the city's tourism organization, stated that tourism must transform from an environmental burden into a force for positive change.\n\nHe said that a crucial step in such a transformation is \"to change the way we move in a destination, what we consume, and how we interact with locals.\"\n\n\"The project is unlikely to lead to significant changes on its own, as there is a big gap between visitors' desire to act sustainably and their actual behavior. CopenPay is a small, experimental step towards creating a new mindset among travelers.\"\n\nHow \"CopenPay\" Works\n\nThe simplicity of the system allows for easy participation: tourists can show a train ticket, arrive by bike, or present other simple proofs of green actions to redeem their rewards.\n\nFor example, visitors arriving at the National Gallery of Denmark with plastic waste are invited to a workshop to turn it into artwork. Similarly, using public transport or cycling to Copenhagen's iconic heating plant offers a unique skiing experience on the slope atop the building.\n\nThis summer, all tourists are invited to join CopenPay, with regular updates on available attractions and rewards at copenpay.com.\n\nStarting with over 20 attractions, CopenPay aims not only to enhance the local visitor experience but also to inspire other destinations.\n\nThe pilot program will run throughout Copenhagen's peak tourist season from July 15 to August 11.", "source": {"uri": "en.protothema.gr", "dataType": "news", "title": "protothemanews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christine_giannou@en.protothema.gr", "name": "Christine Giannou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alpine skiing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Organic food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kayak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Denmark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Gallery of Denmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plastic pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skiing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://en.protothema.gr/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-2.56.40-PM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714262", "eventUri": "eng-9714262", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "dateEnd": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 2909, "textEnd": 2929}], "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The map also describes the reward they can expect.\n\nFor instance, you can borrow a free kayak if you commit to picking up waste that you encounter in the harbour. You can feel great in the knowledge that even by visiting you've done your small part to keep Copenhagen waters pristine.\n\nAccording to the Global Destination Sustainability Index, Copenhagen is ranked the third most sustainable destination in the world. However, to keep it this way it shouldn't only be the priority of its residents but also of its visitors. After all, it's the latter who gets to enjoy the fact that it's a high-quality sustainable destination.\n\nIn that sense, the scheme borrows the concept of environmentally conscious free help in exchange for free perks from volunteering programmes, such as WWOOF, HelpX or WorkAway that encourage these kinds of exchanges between visitors and locals.\n\nThe aim of CopenPay is not to boost tourism to the Danish capital but to make it more self-aware and to show visitors from other countries practical things they could implement back home in order to make their cities sustainable destinations as well.", "source": {"uri": "themayor.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "themayor.eu"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@themayor.eu", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Denmark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Culture of Denmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kayak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWOOF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWOOF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harbor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.themayor.eu/web/files/articles/12630/main_image/thumb_1200x630_cph-segway-11zon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714262", "eventUri": "eng-9714262", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 805, "textEnd": 812}], "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

It's about creating meaningful and memorable experiences that are enjoyable and environmentally responsible,\" said Mikkel Aaro Hansen, CEO of the tourism company.\n\nDue to the project's \"trust-based\" nature, attractions are unlikely to request documentation attesting to the completion of the environmentally-conscious activity, as per BBC.\n\n\"After all,\" the tourism board said, \"the only one you would be cheating is yourself if you miss out on doing good for our planet.\"\n\nThere's an online map with over 20 participating sites.\n\nIf the pilot project is successful, it might be carried out all year round.\n\n\"Tourists are given a unique opportunity to explore Copenhagen in a way that benefits both the environment and the local community,\" NBC News quoted Mayor Sophie Andersen.\n\nA relief to tourists\n\nThe initiative might help ease travellers who perceive Denmark -- with its 25 per cent value-added tax rate -- as a costly destination.\n\nCopenhagen has the eighth-highest cost of living in the world, according to CNN which cited an Economist Intelligence Unit survey from the previous year.\n\n\"We must turn tourism from being an environmental burden in a force for positive change, and one important step in this transformation is to change how we move around on the destination, what we consume, and how we interact with the locals, the Wonderful Copenhagen press release said.\n\nThe city's green environment\n\nCopenhagen is favoured among tourists thanks to its exquisite architecture, delicious cuisine, and clean, green environs.\n\nAccording to the tourism board, Denmark reported 63 million overnight stays last year during the city's peak travel months of July and August.\n\nResidents of the city frequently swim in the pristine canals and bike to work.\n\nWith 602,000 residents and 750,000 bicycles, Copenhagen is the city with more bikes than people.\n\nTo lessen the \"environmental burden\" of tourism, the city encourages visitors to go by bicycle.\n\nImpact of tourism\n\nThe program's introduction coincides with growing public concern over the negative social and environmental effects of tourism.\n\nTourism's footprint, attributed to travel (autos, aircraft, and cruises), hotels, and tourism-related activities, encompasses the environmental, economic, and societal impacts of its activities. This footprint accounts for eight per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, according to News18.\n\nAdditionally, tourism has a major impact on the use of resources, including trash creation and excessive water use in hotels and resorts, which degrades marine and natural environments.\n\nAccording to Litterbins.co.uk, the European Journal of Tourism, Hospitality and Recreation (EJTHR) conducted a study which revealed that suppliers, who frequently do not have any connections to the local economy, plan the purchase of products and services at the time the package is purchased.\n\nAs the study demonstrates, this has a negative impact on the local economy and culture. Frequently, the resort \"overtakes and replaces the destination itself.\"\n\nUNEPTIE's 2011 report on the negative economic impacts of tourism reveals, \"About 80 per cent of travellers' expenditures go to the airlines, hotels and other international companies (who often have their headquarters where the travellers come from, and certainly not at the location they are travelling to), and it does not go to local businesses or workers.\"\n\nEco-friendly tourism: The way forward\n\nThe International Eco-tourism Society defines eco-tourism as \"responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being of the local people, and involves interpretation and education.\"\n\nThis type of tourism has a major focus on protecting natural ecosystems, produces no pollution, leaves a small carbon footprint, and works to protect and maintain biodiversity.\n\nAccording to the Times of India, along with fostering local communities' growth and celebrating their art, culture, and customs, it also aims to give people job possibilities without damaging or changing their long-standing customs.\n\nUtilising eco-friendly items, such as glass water bottles, bamboo toothbrushes, wooden combs, and dental tablets, is another important component of this.\n\nAs environmentally conscious travel becomes more popular, so does the number of eco-friendly hotels that offer a rich experience without sacrificing environmental security and safety.\n\nCountries that support responsible tourism\n\nCosta Rica is one of the most well-known examples of ecotourism. The country boasts 25 per cent of national parks, wildlife reserves and protected lands, as per WorldPackers.com.\n\nKenya's government promotes sustainable tourism and has even created an organisation called 'Ecotourism Kenya'. Their work involves promoting sustainable tourism that will conserve Kenya's natural environment and improve the livelihoods of local communities. In line with their aim, the government also stopped illegal poaching, banned single-use plastics and plastic bags.\n\nSince 1991, Bhutan has been charging visitors a daily Sustainable Development Fee. Initially, it was $65 per day, it jumped to $200 per day in 2022. The collected money is used on projects such as offsetting the country's carbon footprint from tourism, supporting community education, organic farming and upskilling workers in the tourism industry.\n\nThe initiative has also led to Bhutan being the first carbon-negative country in 2017. The country takes in more carbon dioxide than it produces!", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vibhuti_sanchala@firstpost.com", "name":

The monthlong trial offers incentives such as free museum entry for green deeds like cycling. The aim is to reduce the environmental burden of tourism on Denmark's capital.\n\nCopenhagen may have figured out how to get tourists to behave.\n\nThe Danish capital is launching an initiative this month to reward climate-conscious visitors with incentives such as free meals, wine, kayaking tours, and complimentary entry to museums.\n\nTourists and locals will be rewarded for their green deeds, such as arriving at a tourist attraction on a bike or picking up litter.\n\nFor instance, those who take a train or ride a bike to Copenhagen's heating plant can then ski down its sloped roof.\n\nMeanwhile, visitors who show up with a piece of plastic waste at the National Gallery of Denmark can get involved in workshops that turn that waste into art.\n\nThe city tourism board said that while proof of these green deeds is desirable, the CopenPay scheme will operate mainly on trust. A report from the Pew Research Center has shown that Denmark has the highest levels of personal trust in the world.\n\nTourism generates a huge amount of money for Denmark. Official statistics from the Danish government show that the country welcomed an estimated 15 million tourists in 2023. According to Statista, revenue from tourism in 2021 was around 118.2 billion Danish kroner or about $17.5 billion.\n\n\"With CopenPay, we're empowering people to experience more of what Copenhagen offers while placing less burden on our planet. It's about creating meaningful and memorable experiences that are enjoyable and environmentally responsible,\" said Mikkel Aar\u00f8 Hansen, CEO of Wonderful Copenhagen.\n\nAccording to Copenhagen's tourism board, the initiative aims to reduce tourism's environmental burden rather than attract more tourists to the region.\n\nThe disclaimer comes in the wake of anti-tourist protests in Barcelona, where visitors were sprayed by locals with water guns in a bid to deter overtourism in the country.\n\nOther cities, such as Venice, have implemented a daily tourist fee to deter visitors from arriving on certain days.\n\nThe CopenPay scheme will begin on a trial basis on July 15 and run for one month.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_abraham@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Hannah Abraham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kayaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Denmark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Gallery of Denmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourist_attraction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourist attraction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Litter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pew Research Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_krone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danish krone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Italy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regions of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Jukeboxes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Jukeboxes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Legoland", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Legoland", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/By_Ethnic_Group", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/By Ethnic Group", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6493240565b9ce0018a44f56?format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714262", "eventUri": "eng-9714262", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 2245, "textEnd": 2252}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

More than two-thirds of city hotels hold an eco-certificate.\n\nNow, city bosses want to build on that sustainable base and invite tourists to participate in the green lifestyle of Copenhagen.\n\nA new pilot project, CopenPay, will reward actions such as cycling around the city, joining in cleanup projects, or volunteering in green projects with a variety of rewards and experiences.\n\nThese include museum tours, kayak rentals, free coffee, or even a vegetarian lunch made from locally-sourced food. Essentially, green actions become a currency to enjoy cultural experiences in Copenhagen.\n\nWith many European cities suffering from overtourism and actively introducing measures to restrict tourism, it's refreshing to see a city focus on attracting a different kind of tourist that's more in line with the values of the local population.\n\nMikkel Aar\u00f8-Hansen, CEO at Wonderful Copenhagen, said that tourism must change from being an environmental burden \"into a force for positive change.\" He said that an important step in such a transformation is \"to change how we move around a destination, what we consume, and how we interact with the locals.\"\n\nThe project is unlikely to lead to major change in itself, but Aar\u00f8-Hansen explained there is a large gap between visitors' desires to act sustainably and their actual behavior. He said that CopenPay \"is a small, experimental step towards creating a new mindset among travelers.\"\n\nDuring the pilot project this summer, there are a total of 24 cultural venues, culinary experiences, and urban activities running special offers for visitors making more sustainable choices.\n\nWhile there are several free coffees and ice creams available for taking public transit, the most eye-catching experiences are ideal for visitors keen to immerse themselves in Danish design and culture while seeing a bit of the city.\n\nFor example, visitors arriving at the National Gallery of Denmark with plastic waste can join a workshop to turn it into a piece of art. Although held in the children's area, the workshop is open to all.\n\nVisitors who help tend the beautiful gardens at the Karen Blixen Museum get to learn more about the famous Danish author and storyteller with free admission to her former home turned museum.\n\nAt Cisternerne, the city's former water reservoirs turned atmospheric underground art hall, visitors get a free introductory tour just for arriving on foot or by bike. As with some CopenPay offers, the introductions are only held at specific times, so some planning is required to get the most out of the initiative.\n\nOther highlights include free kayak rental in exchange for collecting waste, and a free vegetarian lunch in exchange for volunteering at an urban farm.\n\nMany of the activities that are part of CopenPay are only available over the summer, so act quickly if you want to join in the pilot project. Some also require advance registration.

Robin Utrecht / ABACA via Reuters\n\nIn a bid to improve on its already green reputation, the tourist board of Denmark's capital Copenhagen is offering tourists treats for trash.\n\nStarting July 15, the city is trialing a scheme under which tourist attractions across the Danish capital will offer free meals, train tickets and museum tours to visitors who participate in sustainable activities such as picking up trash or taking green transport options such as bikes.\n\nThe initiative, which the tourist board calls \"CopenPay,\" is a reward system that transforms \"green actions into currency for cultural experiences.\" It's the latest sustainability effort in a city that has long been considered one of the world's greenest -- Copenhagen residents of the city regularly bike to work and swim in its clean canals.\n\nThe scheme may also come as a relief to tourists who can find Denmark, with its 25% value added tax rate, an expensive place to visit. According to a 2023 poll from the Economist Intelligence Unit, Copenhagen is the city with the world's eighth highest cost of living.\n\n\"We want visitors to make conscious, green choices,\" Mikkel Aar\u00f8-Hansen, chief executive at Wonderful Copenhagen said in a statement Monday, \"and hopefully end up getting even better experiences.\"\n\nWith 602,000 people and 750,000 bicycles, Copenhagen has more bikes than people and the city wants to encourage visitors to travel on two wheels to offset the \"environmental burden\" of tourism.\n\nThe city's tourist high season runs from July to August and last year, Denmark recorded 63 million overnight stays in the country, the tourism board said.\n\nIn order to redeem some of the rewards, visitors may be asked to show a ticket, arrive by bicycle or take a picture of them performing the activities. Ultimately, though, it's an honor system and officials are trusting the visitors.\n\n\"After all,\" the tourism board said, \"the only one you would be cheating is yourself if you miss out on doing good for our planet.\"\n\nSome 24 attractions have signed up to the initiative's trial run, which will runs until August 11. If visitors to the Copenhagen Museum, for example, arrive on foot or by public transport, they can enjoy a free cup of coffee or glass of wine at a rooftop bar that overlooks the city.\n\nFor more active travelers, a free kayak rental is up for grabs in return for helping to cleaning the harbor and skiing enthusiasts at the CopenHill slope that sits on top of a waste-to-energy powerplant can redeem extra 20 minutes of slope time if arriving by public transport.\n\n\"Tourists are given a unique opportunity to explore Copenhagen in a way that benefits both the environment and the local community,\" said the city's mayor Sophie Andersen.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourist_attraction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourist attraction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayak", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kayak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utrecht"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utrecht"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Value-added tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hans Christian Andersen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste-to-energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waste-to-energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skiing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240709-copenhagen-mb-0901-3d83cf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714262", "eventUri": "eng-9714262", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 337, "textEnd": 344}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 2237, "textEnd": 2246}], "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

A looming ban on vacation rentals in Barcelona. Restrictions on the sale of alcohol in Majorca. At a time when overwhelmed European destinations are slapping tourists with restrictions and fees, Copenhagen is trying a different approach: rewarding visitors who act responsibly.\n\nBeginning July 15, tourists who demonstrate climate-friendly travel behavior by participating in the city's green initiatives -- including cycling, train travel and clean-up efforts -- will be granted access to museum tours, kayak rentals, free meals and more.\n\n\"We must turn tourism from being an environmental burden into a force for positive change,\" said Mikkel Aar\u00f8-Hansen, the chief executive of Wonderful Copenhagen, the tourism organization for the Capital Region of Denmark. An important step in this transformation, he said, \"is to change how we move around on the destination, what we consume, and how we interact with the locals.\"\n\nOn average, 81 percent of consumers say they want to act more sustainably, but only 22 percent have changed their behavior, according to a 2023 sustainable report by Kanter, a London-based market research group. Copenhagen's new initiative, CopenPay, aims to bridge the gap between the desire to act sustainably and actual behavior by making climate-friendly action a currency for cultural experiences.\n\nFor instance, those who arrive by bike or train at CopenHill, an artificial ski slope built on top of a new waste-management center, will be able to go down the rooftop hill for free. Other sites will allow visitors to volunteer in cleanup efforts. The National Gallery of Denmark will hold workshops to turn plastic waste into pieces of art, while the Copenhagen Surf School will offer a free lunch to surfers who take part in 30 minutes of beach cleaning after their surf course.

To tackle this, Copenhagen is launching a pilot program called CopenPay, offering tourists freebies to encourage \"climate-friendly\" behaviour.\n\n\"Earn rewards at Copenhagen attractions ranging from a free lunch or a cup of coffee to a kayak tour or even a free entrance to a museum,\" reads a statement on the city's tourism site.\n\nTo redeem rewards, you'll need to show proof that you took \"green actions,\" like taking the train or bus instead of driving.

However, the program emphasizes that it's based on a trust system.\n\n\"No matter if you ride a bike, use public transportation, or collect trash, you can spend your good energy to collect the listed rewards, and we trust you when you ask to pay with it,\" states the website. \"After all, the only one you would be cheating is yourself if you miss out on doing good for our planet.\"\n\nThrough these actions, the city hopes to reduce waste and carbon emissions.\n\nThe program will launch on July 15 and run until August 11, after which its effectiveness will be evaluated.

For instance, the Copenhagen Surf School will provide free lunch to surfers who help with 30 minutes of beach cleaning following their surf lesson.\n\n\"It is an experimental and a small step towards creating a new mindset amongst travelers,\" said Mikkel Aar\u00f8-Hansen, CEO of Wonderful Copenhagen, the city's official tourism organization, in a statement.\n\nThe group cited data that found that tourists were often very willing to act sustainably, but only a small fraction changed their actions, spurring Copenhagen to adopt a new approach \"built on trust.\"\n\nWonderful Copenhagen says the initiative is not meant to increase tourism but merely promotes a better way to go about it.\n\n\"With this specific project, our focus is on fostering sustainable practices and enhancing the travel experience for those who are already here, rather than attracting more tourists. And maybe, to inspire other cities to adopt Copenpay, if the pilot project turns out to be a success,\" Rikke Holm Petersen, Wonderful Copenhagen's communications and marketing director, told Fortune.\n\nThe tourism tug-of-war\n\nEurope has always been a destination for picturesque vacations. But recently, it has also become an example of the downsides of mass tourism.\n\nLocals often face the impact of overtourism, which can harm their overall quality of life and cost of living.\n\nIn Madrid, for instance, locals have been priced out of the housing market due to limited social housing, worsened by a growth in holiday rentals to cater to tourists. Meanwhile, Barcelona announced a ban on Airbnb-style short-lets from 2029 to free up the housing supply for locals.\n\nAmsterdam has also clamped down on overtourism by tightening rules around smoking weed and new hotel construction.\n\nIceland has also been on the receiving end of a visitor boom, and it plans to introduce a tourist tax on hotels, campsites, cruise ships and more.\n\nThese measures point to how popular European destinations have a delicate balance to strike between curbing visitor numbers without discouraging them entirely. Tourism is a key revenue generator and employer for many of their economies.\n\nIf Copenhagen's pilot project succeeds at turning tourism into a force for good, it could set an example for other cities to adopt.\n\n\"We must turn tourism from being an environmental burden into a force for positive change, and one important step in this transformation is to change how we move around on the destination, what we consume, and how we interact with the locals,\" Wonderful Copenhagen's Aar\u00f8-Hansen said.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

For instance, the Copenhagen Surf School will provide free lunch to surfers who help with 30 minutes of beach cleaning following their surf lesson.\n\n\"It is an experimental and a small step towards creating a new mindset amongst travelers,\" said Mikkel Aar\u00f8-Hansen, CEO of Wonderful Copenhagen, the city's official tourism organization, in a statement.\n\nThe group cited data that found that tourists were often very willing to act sustainably, but only a small fraction changed their actions, spurring Copenhagen to adopt a new approach \"built on trust.\"\n\nWonderful Copenhagen says the initiative is not meant to increase tourism but merely promotes a better way to go about it.\n\n\"We must turn tourism from being an environmental burden into a force for positive change, and one important step in this transformation is to change how we move around on the destination, what we consume, and how we interact with the locals,\" Aar\u00f8-Hansen said.\n\nWonderful Copenhagen didn't immediately return Fortune's request for comment.\n\nEurope has always been a destination for picturesque vacations. But recently, it has also become an example of the downsides of mass tourism.\n\nLocals often face the impact of overtourism, which can harm their overall quality of life and cost of living.\n\nIn Madrid, for instance, locals have been priced out of the housing market due to limited social housing, worsened by a growth in holiday rentals to cater to tourists. Meanwhile, Barcelona announced a ban on Airbnb-style short-lets from 2029 to free up the housing supply for locals.\n\nAmsterdam has also clamped down on overtourism by tightening rules around smoking weed and new hotel construction.\n\nIceland has also been on the receiving end of a visitor boom, and it plans to introduce a tourist tax on hotels, campsites, cruise ships and more.\n\nThese measures point to how popular European destinations have a delicate balance to strike between curbing visitor numbers without discouraging them entirely. Tourism is a key revenue generator and employer for many of their economies.\n\nIf Copenhagen's pilot project succeeds at turning tourism into a force for good, it could set an example for other cities to adopt.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prarthana_prakash@fortune.com", "name": "Prarthana Prakash", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_School_Lunch_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National School Lunch Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carrot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayak", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kayak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surfing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maritime pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Gallery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.amsterdam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": ".amsterdam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Frameandwork_bikes_-30-e1720695818665.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714262", "eventUri": "eng-9714262", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 727, "textEnd": 734}], "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

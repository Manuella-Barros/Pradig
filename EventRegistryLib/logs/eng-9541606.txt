Court documents said the bullet left a graze deep enough that her skull was visible, but the injury was not life-threatening.\n\nWhile waiting for emergency responders to arrive, a basketball coach at Dunbar provided aid to the injured student by applying pressure to the wound using her jacket.\n\nUsing witness interviews and surveillance footage, police were able to determine that the barrage of bullets originated from a group of about 15 individuals gathered at a basketball court across the street from the school.\n\nFootage shows two individuals in the group identified as a 17-year-old and 18-year-old Graves, both students at Dunbar, were seen holding handguns around the time of the shooting, according to court documents.\n\nBoth Graves and the 17-year-old, who is not being named because of his age, were arrested and charged with Assault with a Dangerous Weapon and Carrying a Pistol without A License.\n\nThere's no surveillance footage of Graves shooting his firearm.

A lawyer for Graves said the 18-year-old did not fire the shot that injured the student.\n\nA judge ordered Graves to be held without bond pending a preliminary hearing later this month.\n\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\n\u00a9 2024 WTOP.

Officials say Graves was in court over the weekend where he was ordered to be held without bond until his next preliminary hearing. The hearing for the 17-year-old is likely to happen sometime over the next few hours. According to court documents, both are Dunbar students. Both face charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a pistol without a license and endangerment with a firearm.\n\nFOX 5's Stephanie Ramirez says a heightened police presence could be seen around the school Monday morning. She says court documents released over the weekend said that a witness told investigators on Friday they saw a group of juveniles hanging out by an alleyway near the school. The documents said that the witness told police they heard someone in the group say something to the effect of, \"get ready, someone was coming around from another side.\" The witness also said the group is also known to smoke weed before going to school.\n\nRamirez says ANC Commissioner Joyce Robinson-Paul and neighbors in the area have also complained of students smoking weed in the alleyways near the building before school.\n\nREAD MORE: 2 teens arrested in shooting near Dunbar High School in DC\n\nSurveillance video shared with FOX 5 captured a barrage of gunfire and images police say showed a group running through an alley after the bullets were fired.

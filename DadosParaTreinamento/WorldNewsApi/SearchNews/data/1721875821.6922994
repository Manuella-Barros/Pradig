{"id": 239745492, "title": "NLC, TUC condemn call for emergency rule in Rivers", "text": "The Nigerian Labour Congress and the Trade Union Congress have called on the Inspector General of Police to order the immediate withdrawal of policemen from the 23 local government council secretariats of Rivers State. Recall that the police took over the council headquarters following the crisis over the tenure of local government chairmen in the state, which has claimed two lives. A policeman and member of a local vigilante outfit were shot dead during a protest in Eberi-Omuma in Omuma Local Government Area of the state last week Tuesday, with the police saying the decision to barricade the councils was to forestall further bloodbath. But rising from an emergency joint state administrative council meeting in Port Harcourt on Friday evening, the two unions frown on the directive of the Inspector General of Police for his men to remain at the LG secretariats until a court rules on the local government issue. The state NLC Chairman, Alex Agwanwor, and his TUC counterpart, Ikechukwu Onyefuru, in a joint statement after the meeting said workers had been denied access to the council for days causing loss of man-hour. The statement partly reads, \u201cThe councils-in-session frowns seriously on the sealing of the 23 local government council secretariats by men and officers of the Nigeria Police Force for the reason of maintaining law and order thereby locking out our members from performing their statutory duty. \u201cIn view of the actions of the Nigeria policemen, the quantum of man-hour loss since the occupation of the security agencies across the 23 local government councils is irrecoverable and the attendant consequences of putting people off their jobs with no alternative means of engagement in the society are far too weighty to contend with in instant case. \u201cConsequently, the councils of both NLC and TUC call on the Inspector General of Police to immediately direct the Commissioner of Police Rivers State Command to allow legitimate workers of the various Local Government Councils to access their offices. On the call for the declaration of a state of emergency in the state by the State Caretaker Committee Chairman of the All Progressives Congress in the state, Chief Tony Okocha due to the violence caused by the local government crisis, the union described it as self-seeking.", "summary": "<p>The Nigerian Labour Congress and the Trade Union Congress have called on the Inspector General of Police to order the immediate withdrawal of policemen from the 23 local government council secretariats of Rivers State.

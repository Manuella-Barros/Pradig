Deputy First Minister and Economy Secretary Kate Forbes welcomed the return to growth, \u201cdespite the challenging global economic conditions we continue to face\u201d. Her comments came after the latest figures from the Scottish Government showed Scotland had slightly outperformed the UK in terms of economic growth in the period January to March. GDP in Scotland grew by 0.7% over the period, after falling 0.5% between October and December 2023. Across the UK, GDP grew 0.6% in the first quarter of 2024, after declining 0.3% in the final three months of last year. The Scottish figures showed that while output in the construction sector fell 0.9% in the latest quarter, there was growth of 0.5% in the services sector \u2013 which makes up the majority of the country\u2019s economy. In addition, the production sector grew by 2.1%. Overall, the economy is estimated to have grown 0.2% over the course of the last year. Forbes said it is \u201cencouraging to see growth across the majority of services, particularly the retail sector, as well as the wholesale and motor trades, and health and social work sectors\u201d. She said experts at the Scottish Fiscal Commission and the Fraser of Allander Institute have projected overall growth of 0.6% and 0.7% respectively for Scotland in 2024 \u2013 with this then forecast to rise to 1.1% next year.

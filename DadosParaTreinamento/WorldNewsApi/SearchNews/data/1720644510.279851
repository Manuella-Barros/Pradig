Journalist and writer Anote Ajeluorou read from his acclaimed collection \u2018Libations for Africa\u2019, prompting discussions about Africa\u2019s rich cultural heritage and the challenges it faces. Ajeluorou\u2019s readings highlighted the dire state of local libraries in the region, urging for their revitalisation and stocking. He shared his own experiences with the defunct libraries in Oleh and Ozoro, emphasising their importance for fostering a love of learning. He donated three of his books to the Oleh library and called on the Delta State Government and the Ozoro Progress Union to collaborate on building a new library in Ozoro. Turning to the newly elected President-General of the Ozoro Progress Union, Chief Berkley Asiafa, Ajeluorou stressed the need to prioritise rebuilding the Ozoro branch of the Delta State Library Board. He pointed out the irony of a town hosting a university lacking a proper library facility. Ajeluorou also addressed the issue of \u2018school-is-a-scam\u2019 cynicism among some Isoko youths, attributing it partly to the lack of accessible learning resources like libraries. He emphasised the importance of making libraries available to counter this negativity and equip young people with knowledge. He suggested incorporating an e-library component to cater to modern preferences. Chief Asiafa responded positively, pledging to collaborate with educational partners to rebuild and revitalize the Ozoro library. He mentioned plans to include library rebuilding in next year\u2019s state budget. Ajeluorou\u2019s poetry collection, \u2018Libations for Africa\u2019, explores themes of African identity, leadership, and cultural preservation. He expressed concern about the erosion of Africa\u2019s rich heritage and the lack of lasting monuments being built by the current generation. He urged the audience to reflect on the achievements of past leaders and strive to emulate their greatness. He also addressed the fading tradition of storytelling in Isoko communities, lamenting the loss of this valuable cultural practice. Ajeluorou further challenged the audience to critically examine the Eseemo tradition, a local practice used to police infidelity. He argued for its modification to protect men from being targeted for their wives\u2019 actions. The event attracted a significant audience both physically and virtually, and the poet donated copies of his books to local schools before the event concluded.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"488\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Ajeluorou-left-presenting-copies-of-his-books-to-the-President-General-of-Ozoro-Progress-Union-OPU-Chief-Berkley-Asiafa-at-the-event.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Ajeluorou-left-presenting-copies-of-his-books-to-the-President-General-of-Ozoro-Progress-Union-OPU-Chief-Berkley-Asiafa-at-the-event.jpg 488w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Ajeluorou-left-presenting-copies-of-his-books-to-the-President-General-of-Ozoro-Progress-Union-OPU-Chief-Berkley-Asiafa-at-the-event-300x286.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\" /></div>&#160;On May 24, Ozoro, Delta State, came alive with a powerful evening of poetry and reflection at Berkley&#8217;s Lounge.

European qualification spots are almost settled, with Aston Villa likely joining Arsenal, City, and Liverpool in the Champions League. The race for Europa Conference League spots is tight, with Manchester United, Newcastle, and Chelsea vying for sixth and seventh places. The relegation battle involves Nottingham Forest, Luton, and Burnley, with two spots to avoid.The title race is down to two teams.\n\nThe relegation tussle still involves three.\n\nAnd the contest for the remaining European qualification positions contains as many as five.\n\nThe Premier League season is down to its last two weeks and there's still plenty at stake from top to bottom.\n\nMeanwhile, the second-tier Championship's regular season finishes on Saturday, with a second automatic promotion spot set to be secured.\n\nHere's a look at what's still to be decided:\n\nTitle\n\nThis time, Arsenal vs. Manchester City for the Premier League title looks like going down to the wire.\n\nCity took advantage of a late-season collapse by the Gunners to win the league with three matches to spare in the 2022-23 campaign, but an improved Arsenal might last the course this time round.\n\nArsenal leads by one point with three games to go - against Bournemouth at home on Saturday, Manchester United away and Everton at home. City has four games remaining - at home to Wolverhampton, away to Fulham and Tottenham, and at home to West Ham - and would capture an unprecedented fourth straight title by winning all of them.\n\nThe pressure is on the defending champions to do that because even just one draw could be fatal. Arsenal has a superior goal difference and, as it stands, would win on that tiebreaker if the teams are equal on points.\n\nAway to Tottenham looks to be the toughest match for City, which has yet to win - or even score - in four league games at Tottenham's new stadium that opened in 2019. Spurs fans will have mixed feelings about the May 14 game, because a win for their team could hand Arsenal, Tottenham's fierce north London rival, the title.\n\nA trip to Old Trafford is likely Arsenal's hardest remaining fixture. After all, Liverpool - until recently the other title contender - saw its season turned upside down after a loss at United in the FA Cup quarterfinals on March 17 was followed by a costly draw at Old Trafford in the league on April 7.\n\nThe Premier League is the only one of Europe's top five leagues where the title race is still bubbling. Germany's Bundesliga (champions Bayer Leverkusen), Italy's Serie A (Inter Milan) and France's Ligue 1 (Paris Saint-Germain) have been decided, while Real Madrid leads Barcelona by 11 points in Spain's La Liga.\n\nEuropean places\n\nArsenal, City and Liverpool are locks for Champions League qualification, with fourth-place Aston Villa likely to join them. Tottenham is isolated in fifth, the reward for which is Europa League qualification.\n\nThe remaining intrigue, then, revolves around which teams finishes in sixth and seventh to likely earn a berth in the Europa Conference League. Manchester United, Newcastle and Chelsea are the teams occupying sixth to eighth places and three points separate them with four games left for each. West Ham and Bournemouth have outside shots in ninth and 10th, respectively.\n\nChelsea is in the best form, having lost just one of its last 11 games - though that was 5-0 at Arsenal.\n\nIf United drops to eighth, the team has a last chance to get into Europe by winning the FA Cup final against Man City a week after the Premier League finishes.\n\nRelegation\n\nThe relegation battle looks like it will go to the final day of the season - and won't just be determined by what happens on the field.\n\nWith last-place Sheffield United already down, there are three teams fighting to avoid the two remaining relegation places: Nottingham Forest (26 points), Luton (25 points) and Burnley (24 points).\n\nEach team has three games left and, significantly, two of them meet in the final round when Burnley hosts Forest.\n\nForest's current points total is subject to change, however, because the club has appealed against a four-point deduction for breaching the league's financial rules. The result of that appeal should be known before the end of the season, meaning Forest could recover some points based on the views of an independent panel.\n\nIf Burnley and Luton are also relegated, it means the three teams that came up last year lasted just one season before going back down to the Championship.\n\nPromotion\n\nThere's one automatic promotion spot up for grabs heading into the final round of games in the second-tier Championship on Saturday.\n\nLeicester has already clinched promotion and an immediate return to the Premier League. The team will go up as champions.\n\nIpswich or Leeds will join them.\n\nIpswich, which last played in the top flight in 2002, is currently in second place and three points ahead of third-place Leeds, whose American ownership group includes major-winning golfers Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas.\n\nIpswich hosts next-to-last Huddersfield, and Leeds is at home to fourth-place Southampton.\n\nThe teams placed third to sixth will compete in the playoffs for the third promotion spot. The playoff final is at Wembley Stadium on May 26.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Where is the twist? City don't give you twists.\n\n'You always said in years gone by, there will be a twist and turn, something will happen, I'm not sure it is going to happen. What normally happens in these moments is if City win on the Saturday, Arsenal drop points on the Sunday and City win the title on the Tuesday.\n\n'That's what normally happens. It may go to the final day and if it does then it means Arsenal have beaten Man United at Old Trafford. If Arsenal go win at Old Trafford that's a hell of a win.\n\n'I have that fear the title race could be over a week on Tuesday. I want the title race to go to the final day, my fear is it won't if City win on Saturday against Fulham and United take points off Arsenal on the Sunday.\n\n'Arsenal have already proven they are a different side than last season but just feels like an inevitability City will be perfect until the end.'\n\nThe Gunners visit Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon before finishing their 2023-24 campaign at home to Everton.

That's enough for us to rally to something special.\"\n\nForest will hope to pull away from the danger zone when they travel to already relegated Sheffield United.\n\nFixtures", "source": {"uri": "herald.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zimbabwe Herald Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournemouth", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burnley F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emirates Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turf_Moor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turf Moor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Kompany", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vincent Kompany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/Man-City.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 2981, "textEnd": 2987}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Arsenal leads by a point with three games remaining, while Manchester City has four games left. The contest for the remaining European qualification positions involves Manchester United, Newcastle, and Chelsea. The Championship's regular season concludes Saturday, with Ipswich Town and Leeds United vying for the second automatic promotion spot. Sheffield United is already relegated, and the three teams that came up last year (Burnley, Luton, and Forest) face relegation concerns, with Forest's points subject to change due to a financial rule breach appeal.\n\nThe title race is down to two teams. The relegation tussle still involves three. And, the contest for the remaining European qualification positions contains as many as five.\n\nThe Premier League season is down to its last two weeks and there's still plenty at stake from top to bottom.\n\nMeanwhile, the second-tier Championship's regular season finishes on Saturday, with a second automatic promotion spot set to be secured.\n\nHere's a look at what's still to be decided: TITLE This time, Arsenal vs Manchester City for the Premier League title looks like going down to the wire.\n\nCity took advantage of a late-season collapse by the Gunners to win the league with three matches to spare in the 2022-23 campaign, but an improved Arsenal might last the course this time round.\n\nArsenal leads by a point with three games to go -- against Bournemouth at home on Saturday, Manchester United away and Everton at home.\n\nCity has four games remaining -- at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers, away to Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur, and at home to West Ham United -- and would capture an unprecedented fourth straight title by winning all of them.\n\nThe pressure is on the defending champion to do that because even just a draw could be fatal. Arsenal has a superior goal difference and, as it stands, would win on that tiebreaker if the teams are equal on points.\n\nAway to Tottenham looks to be the toughest match for City, which has yet to win -- or even score -- in four league games at Tottenham's new stadium that opened in 2019. Spurs fans will have mixed feelings about the May 14 game, because a win for their team could hand Arsenal, Tottenham's fierce north London rival, the title.\n\nA trip to Old Trafford is likely Arsenal's hardest remaining fixture. After all, Liverpool -- until recently the other title contender -- saw its season turned upside down after a loss at United in the FA Cup quarterfinals on March 17 was followed by a costly draw at Old Trafford in the league on April 7.\n\nThe Premier League is the only one of Europe's top five leagues where the title race is still bubbling. Germany's Bundesliga (champions Bayer Leverkusen), Italy's Serie A (Inter Milan) and France's Ligue 1 (Paris Saint-Germain) have been decided, while Real Madrid leads Barcelona by 11 points in Spain's La Liga.\n\nEUROPEAN PLACES Arsenal, City and Liverpool are locked for Champions League qualification, with fourth-place Aston Villa likely to join them. Tottenham is isolated in fifth, the reward for which is Europa League qualification. The remaining intrigue, then, revolves around which teams finish in sixth and seventh to likely earn a berth in the Europa Conference League.\n\nManchester United, Newcastle and Chelsea are the teams occupying sixth to eighth places and three points separate them with four games left for each. West Ham and Bournemouth have outside shots in ninth and 10th, respectively.\n\nChelsea is in the best form, having lost just one of its last 11 games -- though that was 5-0 at Arsenal.\n\nIf United drops to eighth, the team has a last chance to get into Europe by winning the FA Cup final against Man City a week after the Premier League finishes.\n\nRELEGATION The relegation battle looks like it will go to the final day of the season -- and won't just be determined by what happens on the field.\n\nWith last-place Sheffield United already down, three teams are fighting to avoid the two remaining relegation places: Nottingham Forest (26 points), Luton Town (25 points) and Burnley (24 points).\n\nEach team has three games left and, significantly, two of them meet in the final round when Burnley hosts Forest.\n\nForest's current points total is subject to change, however, because the club has appealed against a four-point deduction for breaching the league's financial rules. The result of that appeal should be known before the end of the season, meaning Forest could recover some points based on the views of an independent panel.\n\nIf Burnley and Luton are also relegated, it means the three teams that came up last year lasted just a season before going back down to the Championship.\n\nPROMOTION There's one automatic promotion spot up for grabs heading into the final round of games in the second-tier Championship on Saturday.\n\nLeicester City has already clinched promotion and an immediate return to the Premier League. The team will go up as champions. Ipswich Town or Leeds United will join them.\n\nIpswich, which last played in the top flight in 2002, is currently in second place and three points ahead of third-place Leeds, whose American ownership group includes major-winning golfers Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas.\n\nIpswich hosts next-to-last Huddersfield Town, and Leeds is at home to fourth-place Southampton.\n\nThe teams placed third to sixth will compete in the playoffs for the third promotion spot. The playoff final is at Wembley Stadium on May 26.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

It remains to be seem which club will come out on top in the next fortnight, with any slip-up likely to be punished.\n\nOffering their thoughts on the weekend's action and what it means for the title race, the thoughts of the national media can be found below.\n\nREAD MORE: What Phil Foden did after Pep Guardiola tantrum proves point in front of Man City legend David Silva\n\nREAD MORE: I fell out with Pep Guardiola and Erik ten Hag - but every Manchester United fan is talking about me\n\n'Pushed to the edge'\n\nMiguel Delaney of The Independent wrote:\n\n\"A scoreline that would have been predicted, but from a match that shredded nerves. Arsenal may not know if they will be Premier League champions, but they certainly know what it's like to be pushed to the edge in a run-in. Bournemouth more than did their bit in a 3-0 Arsenal win that, for the moment, puts them four points clear of Manchester City but with two more games played.\n\n\"The expectation that Pep Guardiola's team would go and win their four remaining matches hung over everything, especially Bukayo Saka's 45th-minute penalty. If you wanted a scene to capture the deepest tension in a stadium, this was it. Saka rolled it in to bring relief but not yet total release. Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth made Arsenal do much more.\n\n\"There was still that immersive tension about the occasion, Arsenal aware that any slip could bring back so many agonising memories from last season.\n\n\"As for the title, they're now in another nervously exciting situation. They have to watch two Manchester City matches before going to Old Trafford next week for a game that will be enlivened by so many narratives, and some high stakes.\n\n\"It might well come down to that. This season could yet end as everyone predicted but it already looks like it will shred every nerve until then.\"\n\n'Hard to back against the champions'\n\nJames Ducker of The Telegraph wrote:\n\n\"Arsenal have been good - oh so good this season - but they must worry City are simply not going to falter over the next fortnight. Liverpool know only too well how that feels and there were certainly no signs of City slipping up here against Wolves, not with Haaland in wrecking mode.\n\n\"And so, regardless of what Arsenal do over the next couple of weeks, the title will be headed back to the Etihad if City beat Fulham and Tottenham away and West Ham at home on the final day. It is hard to back against the champions, all the more so when Haaland is taking it upon himself to play like this.\"\n\n'It was ominous for Arsenal'\n\nJonathan Northcroft of The Times wrote:\n\n\"It still looks tight, still looks like a who-blinks-first affair where a single misstep is likely to cost the side who makes it. City's manager certainly wants his players to think in those terms. Three games, three wins and you're champions. Anything less, it is Arsenal's prize.\n\n\"You suspect he is correct. The lesson of a rare Saturday on which both contenders were playing is that neither look at all prone to faltering. Both scored handsome wins against decent and potentially awkward opponents. On this form, you would expect a City victory in their next game, away to Fulham.\n\n\"Perhaps it was ominous for Arsenal that Guardiola was not especially happy with his team's performance despite winning 5-1, and that Erling Haaland was not overjoyed about coming off after his four-goal haul.\n\n\"Both want more. It is why Haaland has a clear lead once again in the Golden Boot contest, and why Guardiola is pushing City towards something unprecedented -- the achievement of being the first team in history to win four consecutive English league titles.\n\n\"If anything can stop a City side that hasn't lost in the league since early December, it could be a visit to Tottenham. Then again, if any place can derail Arsenal, Old Trafford might. We're set for quite the last week.\"\n\n'Needing an unlikely snooker'\n\nJack Gaughan of The Daily Mail wrote:\n\n\"And City are in the mood, 24 goals in their last six league games since a drab draw against Arsenal that seemed to hand the title advantage over to both the Gunners and Liverpool. Now it's in City's hands and, given the way in which Wolves appeared beaten from the off, Arsenal will be praying that they are not relying on favours come the last day.\n\n\"So this title race - violently swinging from the best ever to boring in the court of public opinion once City clicked into gear - hinges on a couple of consecutive away matches for City.\n\n\"Fulham on Saturday before the dreaded trip to Tottenham three days later. Although winning there in the FA Cup four months ago broke their hoodoo, City have still yet to score a Premier League goal at the new stadium. Even a broken Spurs is a tricky Spurs for the champions.\n\n\"Guardiola is insistent that they must win all three games - which would mean nine straight victories, their longest run since this time last year - to clinch another crown. He is adamant Arsenal will not drop further points, predicting that they beat Manchester United and Everton.\n\n\"If that transpires then Spurs and Fulham are the games, they are the title race.\n\n\"The away record is improved this year, City chalking up 37 points from 17 games - one more than all of last season - but these are two grounds where they were made to work. Julian Alvarez dug out a wonder goal to seal a win at Craven Cottage in the run-in, while Spurs have always had something over them. It's by no means done but come out the other side of those and Arsenal will be left needing an unlikely snooker or two.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_cavilla@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Tom Cavilla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournemouth", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emirates Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Manchester_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "City of Manchester Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craven_Cottage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craven Cottage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29117919.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2151479360.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

(AP)\n\nAnd the contest for the remaining European qualification positions contains as many as five.\n\nThe Premier League season is down to its last two weeks and there's still plenty at stake from top to bottom.\n\nMeanwhile, the second-tier Championship's regular season finishes on Saturday, with a second automatic promotion spot set to be secured.\n\nThis time, Arsenal vs. Manchester City for the Premier League title looks like going down to the wire.\n\nCity took advantage of a late-season collapse by the Gunners to win the league with three matches to spare in the 2022-23 campaign, but an improved Arsenal might last the course this time round.\n\nArsenal leads by one point with three games to go -- against Bournemouth at home on Saturday, Manchester United away and Everton at home.\n\nCity has four games remaining -- at home to Wolverhampton, away to Fulham and Tottenham, and at home to West Ham -- and would capture an unprecedented fourth straight title by winning all of them.\n\nThe pressure is on the defending champions to do that because even just one draw could be fatal. Arsenal has a superior goal difference and, as it stands, would win on that tiebreaker if the teams are equal on points.\n\nAway to Tottenham looks to be the toughest match for City, which has yet to win -- or even score -- in four league games at Tottenham's new stadium that opened in 2019. Spurs fans will have mixed feelings about the May 14 game, because a win for their team could hand Arsenal, Tottenham's fierce north London rival, the title.\n\nA trip to Old Trafford is likely Arsenal's hardest remaining fixture. After all, Liverpool -- until recently the other title contender -- saw its season turned upside down after a loss at United in the FA Cup quarterfinals on March 17 was followed by a costly draw at Old Trafford in the league on April 7.\n\nThe Premier League is the only one of Europe's top five leagues where the title race is still bubbling. Germany's Bundesliga (champions Bayer Leverkusen), Italy's Serie A (Inter Milan) and France's Ligue 1 (Paris Saint-Germain) have been decided, while Real Madrid leads Barcelona by 11 points in Spain's La Liga.\n\nEUROPEAN PLACES\n\nArsenal, City and Liverpool are locks for Champions League qualification, with fourth-place Aston Villa likely to join them. Tottenham is isolated in fifth, the reward for which is Europa League qualification.\n\nThe remaining intrigue, then, revolves around which teams finishes in sixth and seventh to likely earn a berth in the Europa Conference League. Manchester United, Newcastle and Chelsea are the teams occupying sixth to eighth places and three points separate them with four games left for each. West Ham and Bournemouth have outside shots in ninth and 10th, respectively.\n\nChelsea is in the best form, having lost just one of its last 11 games -- though that was 5-0 at Arsenal.\n\nIf United drops to eighth, the team has a last chance to get into Europe by winning the FA Cup final against Man City a week after the Premier League finishes.\n\nRELEGATION\n\nThe relegation battle looks like it will go to the final day of the season -- and won't just be determined by what happens on the field.\n\nWith last-place Sheffield United already down, there are three teams fighting to avoid the two remaining relegation places: Nottingham Forest (26 points), Luton (25 points) and Burnley (24 points).\n\nEach team has three games left and, significantly, two of them meet in the final round when Burnley hosts Forest.\n\nForest's current points total is subject to change, however, because the club has appealed against a four-point deduction for breaching the league's financial rules. The result of that appeal should be known before the end of the season, meaning Forest could recover some points based on the views of an independent panel.\n\nIf Burnley and Luton are also relegated, it means the three teams that came up last year lasted just one season before going back down to the Championship.\n\nPROMOTION\n\nThere's one automatic promotion spot up for grabs heading into the final round of games in the second-tier Championship on Saturday.\n\nLeicester has already clinched promotion and an immediate return to the Premier League. The team will go up as champions.\n\nIpswich or Leeds will join them.\n\nIpswich, which last played in the top flight in 2002, is currently in second place and three points ahead of third-place Leeds, whose American ownership group includes major-winning golfers Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas.\n\nIpswich hosts next-to-last Huddersfield, and Leeds is at home to fourth-place Southampton.\n\nThe teams placed third to sixth will compete in the playoffs for the third promotion spot. The playoff final is at Wembley Stadium on May 26.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If City slip up, Arsenal could overtake them with two wins from their last two games, so the Blues will hope to get a favour from rivals Manchester United next Sunday when Arsenal visit Old Trafford.\n\nWhile Pep Guardiola's side are in a position of strength, they know what will happen if they drop their standards, with the margins as fine as any of their previous title races under the manager. They only need to look at an incredible weekend of WSL action to see how quickly things can change.\n\nALSO READ: How Arsenal are helping Man City in Premier League title race\n\nALSO READ: Roy Keane's latest attack shows Erling Haaland is doing something right at Man City\n\nGareth Taylor's City Women have been excellent this season, and looked like they had finally found a way to break Chelsea's hold on the Women's Super League title. With Emma Hayes' Chelsea losing to Liverpool last week, City knew that four points from their final two games would crown them champions, but a home clash with Arsenal on Sunday was not a simple fixture.\n\nIt was all going well, with the Blues leading 1-0 as injury time loomed, but an 89th-minute equaliser from Stina Blackstenius set up a nervy ending, and the Swede's 94th-minute winner turned the title race on its head. Chelsea, six points behind with an extra game to play, were suddenly back in the running. Of course it had to be Arsenal, as well.\n\nChelsea were still seven goals behind City when it came to goal difference, so they not only had to win on Sunday, win their game in hand, and win on the final day, but also better City's goal difference in the space of those three games. They went out and beat Bristol City 8-0 to complete a nightmare day for City.\n\nChelsea now just need to win their final two games, while matching City's goal difference at Aston Villa - who they historically struggle against - to retain their title. City have gone from one hand on the trophy to relying on help from Tottenham and United, who Chelsea play this week.\n\nSo just like in the Premier League, City will be hoping for United to slow down their title rivals in the final week. If United beat Chelsea in the WSL and Arsenal in the Premier League, both at Old Trafford, they could face a situation where they hand the Blues two titles in a matter of days.\n\n\"All the staff and the fans know it. One mistake and you will not win the Premier League,\" said Pep Guardiola after the Wolves game. \"The players know that if we don't win, ciao ciao, bye-bye.\n\n\"You see the level of consistency with Arsenal but you smell they are not going to lose the two games they have. It's going to be easy? No, but it's in our hands.\"\n\nCity Women have shown how easily that control can slip away in the space of five minutes, and the fact that it was Arsenal inflicting that blow will encourage the Gunners in the Premier League too. Guardiola's side should take note - and now everyone at City will be hoping for a double boost from United.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_bray@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Joe Bray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Super_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's Super League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stina_Blackstenius", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stina Blackstenius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emma Hayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Keane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roy Keane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bristol City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article27021216.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1246237242.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

For the fourth week in a row both sides were victorious, leaving things as they have been, a single point gap at the top.\n\nMikel Arteta's side once more went first, beating Bournemouth 3-0 in comfortable style, but were never truly given much belief that City would be unable to match their result. Erling Haaland scored four in a 5-1 win for Pep Guardiola's side just hours later to leave it as they were.\n\nNow, with just two games to go, three for City, Neville can't see a way that the champions drop points. Although they do travel to Tottenham next week in the toughest remaining match, four defeats in a row for Ange Postecoglou's side has left very little to play for.\n\nSpurs were beaten 4-2 by Liverpool on Sunday having gone 4-0 down shortly after half-time. Speaking on commentary Neville said he wasn't confident that Tottenham would be able to do their rivals a helping hand. \"I think Arsenal fans, coaches and players, if you were looking at this Tottenham team and thinking can they somehow raise their game for that game a week on Tuesday, it is looking doubtful as you see them now in front of you,\" he said.\n\nOn his Sky Sports podcast after the match he continued: \"That's the problem. A few weeks ago I said they [Arsenal] would have to be perfect and they have just had that one slip up didn't they, against Aston Villa. There's an inevitability to City isn't there at this stage of the season, getting the job done and doing what they need to do.\n\n\"They have got that difficult game at Spurs on paper in 10 days but the way that Spurs are at this moment in time I think it'll be difficult for them. A City that's playing for the title is a very different proposition and as I sit here this weekend, Arsenal played really well, did their job.\n\nREAD MORE: Triple Arsenal title boost hope remains as Man City face unlikely Premier League challenge\n\nREAD MORE: Gary Neville fires Arsenal brand new Premier League title message as new Man City truth clear\n\n\"City played really well and did their job but you're wondering where the title race is going to twist. City don't give you the twists. You always said in the years gone by that there will be a twist and a turn, that something happens. I'm not sure it is going to happen.\"\n\nCity play first next weekend and can move back to the top of the league, albeit briefly with Arsenal going to Manchester United one day later. Neville thinks that it could be all over by the time Arsenal get to welcoming Everton on the final day.\n\n\"What normally happens in these moments, normally happens, is that if City win on the Saturday [against Fulham], Arsenal drop points on the Sunday and City win the title on the Tuesday [against Tottenham]. That's what normally happens, in my experience of these title races.\n\n\"You think, it's going to go down to the final day,' it may go down to the final day and if it went down to the final day that means that Arsenal have gone and beaten Manchester United at Old Trafford. We can laugh and we can giggle about how Manchester United have been but Arsenal going to Old Trafford and winning, that's going to be a hell of a win.\n\n\"I have that fear that the title could be over a week on Tuesday when in terms of a neutral, I want the title to go to the final day obviously. My fear is it won't if City win at Fulham on Saturday and if United take points off Arsenal on the Sunday.\n\n\"If Arsenal go to the last day of the season having beaten Manchester United then this is a massive increase in performance level, it is anyway. Arsenal have already proven they have a different side to them from last season but I just think there's an inevitability that City will be perfect onto the end.\"", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_coley@football.london", "name": "Tom Coley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Bournemouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Bournemouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29120277.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_gary-neville.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

City has four games remaining - at home to Wolverhampton, away to Fulham and Tottenham, and at home to West Ham - and would capture an unprecedented fourth straight title by winning all of them.\n\nThe pressure is on the defending champions to do that because even just one draw could be fatal. Arsenal has a superior goal difference and, as it stands, would win on that tiebreaker if the teams are equal on points.\n\nAway to Tottenham looks to be the toughest match for City, which has yet to win - or even score - in four league games at Tottenham's new stadium that opened in 2019. Spurs fans will have mixed feelings about the May 14 game, because a win for their team could hand Arsenal, Tottenham's fierce north London rival, the title.\n\nA trip to Old Trafford is likely Arsenal's hardest remaining fixture. After all, Liverpool - until recently the other title contender - saw its season turned upside down after a loss at United in the FA Cup quarterfinals on March 17 was followed by a costly draw at Old Trafford in the league on April 7.\n\nThe Premier League is the only one of Europe's top five leagues where the title race is still bubbling. Germany's Bundesliga (champions Bayer Leverkusen), Italy's Serie A (Inter Milan) and France's Ligue 1 (Paris Saint-Germain) have been decided, while Real Madrid leads Barcelona by 11 points in Spain's La Liga.\n\nEUROPEAN PLACES\n\nArsenal, City and Liverpool are locks for Champions League qualification, with fourth-place Aston Villa likely to join them. Tottenham is isolated in fifth, the reward for which is Europa League qualification.\n\nThe remaining intrigue, then, revolves around which teams finishes in sixth and seventh to likely earn a berth in the Europa Conference League. Manchester United, Newcastle and Chelsea are the teams occupying sixth to eighth places and three points separate them with four games left for each. West Ham and Bournemouth have outside shots in ninth and 10th, respectively.\n\nChelsea is in the best form, having lost just one of its last 11 games - though that was 5-0 at Arsenal.\n\nIf United drops to eighth, the team has a last chance to get into Europe by winning the FA Cup final against Man City a week after the Premier League finishes.\n\nThe relegation battle looks like it will go to the final day of the season - and won't just be determined by what happens on the field. With last-place Sheffield United already down, there are three teams fighting to avoid the two remaining relegation places: Nottingham Forest (26 points), Luton (25 points) and Burnley (24 points).\n\nEach team has three games left and, significantly, two of them meet in the final round when Burnley hosts Forest.\n\nForest's current points total is subject to change, however, because the club has appealed against a four-point deduction for breaching the league's financial rules. The result of that appeal should be known before the end of the season, meaning Forest could recover some points based on the views of an independent panel.\n\nIf Burnley and Luton are also relegated, it means the three teams that came up last year lasted just one season before going back down to the Championship.\n\nPromotion\n\nThere's one automatic promotion spot up for grabs heading into the final round of games in the second-tier Championship on Saturday.\n\nLeicester has already clinched promotion and an immediate return to the Premier League. The team will go up as champions.\n\nIpswich or Leeds will join them. Ipswich, which last played in the top flight in 2002, is currently in second place and three points ahead of third-place Leeds, whose American ownership group includes major-winning golfers Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas.\n\nIpswich hosts next-to-last Huddersfield, and Leeds is at home to fourth-place Southampton. The teams placed third to sixth will compete in the playoffs for the third promotion spot. The playoff final is at Wembley Stadium on May 26.", "source": {"uri": "dailytimes.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sajid_salamat@dailytimes.com.pk", "name":

Another win for Manchester City in its bid to capture an unprecedented fourth straight Premier League crown.\n\nArsenal, though, isn't going away in the title race.\n\nNot this time.\n\nHaaland has now at least a hat trick in six of his 63 matches in England's top flight after converting two penalties, powering in a header and curling home a sublime finish in City's 5-1 victory over Wolverhampton on Saturday. Julian Alvarez added a late fifth, moments after coming on as a substitute for Haaland.\n\nThat's six straight wins for the defending champions in their five-month unbeaten streak in the league. Three more wins -- away to Fulham and Tottenham and then at home to West Ham -- and the title is theirs once again.\n\nCity might need to be perfect down the stretch to hold off Arsenal.\n\nThere's no sign of an end-of-season collapse by Mikel Arteta's team this time, with a 3-0 win over Bournemouth in the lunchtime kickoff keeping the pressure on City.\n\nArsenal has four straight wins itself and has retained its one-point lead. City, though, has three games left, one more than Arsenal.\n\nLast season, Arsenal's title challenge faded in the spring as a fast-finishing City clinched a third straight league championship with three games to spare.\n\nTwelve months on and the title race is heading into the final week of the season. Indeed, given the form of the top two, it is likely to be decided in the last round of games on May 19.\n\nBukayo Saka converted a penalty in the 45th minute before second-half goals by Leandro Trossard and Declan Rice gave Arsenal victory at Emirates Stadium.\n\nBURNLEY IN TROUBLE\n\nBurnley slipped closer to the drop thanks to its 4-1 loss at home to Newcastle combined with relegation rival Nottingham Forest's 3-1 win at last-place Sheffield United.\n\nIt left next-to-last Burnley five points adrift of Forest, which occupies the place directly above the relegation zone.\n\nBurnley has to win both of its remaining games -- away to Tottenham and then at home to Forest on the final day -- to stand a chance of staying up. Even that won't be enough if Forest avoids defeat at West Ham next weekend, given Burnley's goal difference is so much worse than Forest's.\n\nLuton, which drew 1-1 with Everton on Friday, is third from bottom and now three points behind Forest. As it stands, the three teams that were promoted last season are going straight back down to the Championship.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes and Alexander Isak all scored for Newcastle, which climbed above Manchester United and into sixth place in its bid to qualify for Europe. Newcastle could even catch Tottenham, which is four points further ahead in fifth ahead of its trip to Liverpool on Sunday.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nMan United visits Crystal Palace on Monday.\n\nSheffield United was already sure of being relegated before playing Forest, which came from behind through a double from Callum Hudson-Odoi that came either side of Ryan Yates' goal.\n\nIn the other match Saturday, Brentford and Fulham drew 0-0.\n\nTOP SCORER RACE\n\nHaaland's four goals have left him in sight of the Golden Boot -- awarded to the league's top scorer -- for the second straight season.\n\nThe Norway striker has 25 for the campaign, five more than Isak and Chelsea's Cole Palmer. Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa is one goal further back.\n\nHaaland scored 36 goals in the league last season.\n\nIPSWICH PROMOTED\n\nThere will be a refreshing name in the Premier League next season.\n\nIpswich sealed a return to England's top division for the first time in 22 years after finishing as runner-up on the last day of the second-tier Championship's regular season.\n\nA 2-0 win over Huddersfield saw Ipswich beat Leeds to the second automatic qualification spot, behind Leicester.\n\nLeeds joined Southampton, West Bromwich Albion and Norwich in the playoffs for the third promotion spot. Leeds will play Norwich over two legs and Southampton takes on West Brom.\n\nThe playoff final is at Wembley Stadium on May 26.\n\nSteve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nAP soccer:

City has four games remaining -- at home to Wolverhampton, away to Fulham and Tottenham, and at home to West Ham -- and would capture an unprecedented fourth straight title by winning all of them.\n\nThe pressure is on the defending champions to do that because even just one draw could be fatal. Arsenal has a superior goal difference and, as it stands, would win on that tiebreaker if the teams are equal on points.\n\nAway to Tottenham looks to be the toughest match for City, which has yet to win -- or even score -- in four league games at Tottenham's new stadium that opened in 2019. Spurs fans will have mixed feelings about the May 14 game, because a win for their team could hand Arsenal, Tottenham's fierce north London rival, the title.\n\nA trip to Old Trafford is likely Arsenal's hardest remaining fixture. After all, Liverpool -- until recently the other title contender -- saw its season turned upside down after a loss at United in the FA Cup quarterfinals on March 17 was followed by a costly draw at Old Trafford in the league on April 7.\n\nThe Premier League is the only one of Europe's top five leagues where the title race is still bubbling. Germany's Bundesliga (champions Bayer Leverkusen), Italy's Serie A (Inter Milan) and France's Ligue 1 (Paris Saint-Germain) have been decided, while Real Madrid leads Barcelona by 11 points in Spain's La Liga.\n\nEUROPEAN PLACES\n\nArsenal, City and Liverpool are locks for Champions League qualification, with fourth-place Aston Villa likely to join them. Tottenham is isolated in fifth, the reward for which is Europa League qualification.\n\nThe remaining intrigue, then, revolves around which teams finishes in sixth and seventh to likely earn a berth in the Europa Conference League. Manchester United, Newcastle and Chelsea are the teams occupying sixth to eighth places and three points separate them with four games left for each. West Ham and Bournemouth have outside shots in ninth and 10th, respectively.\n\nChelsea is in the best form, having lost just one of its last 11 games -- though that was 5-0 at Arsenal.\n\nIf United drops to eighth, the team has a last chance to get into Europe by winning the FA Cup final against Man City a week after the Premier League finishes.\n\nRELEGATION\n\nThe relegation battle looks like it will go to the final day of the season -- and won't just be determined by what happens on the field.\n\nWith last-place Sheffield United already down, there are three teams fighting to avoid the two remaining relegation places: Nottingham Forest (26 points), Luton (25 points) and Burnley (24 points).\n\nEach team has three games left and, significantly, two of them meet in the final round when Burnley hosts Forest.\n\nForest's current points total is subject to change, however, because the club has appealed against a four-point deduction for breaching the league's financial rules. The result of that appeal should be known before the end of the season, meaning Forest could recover some points based on the views of an independent panel.\n\nIf Burnley and Luton are also relegated, it means the three teams that came up last year lasted just one season before going back down to the Championship.\n\nPROMOTION\n\nThere's one automatic promotion spot up for grabs heading into the final round of games in the second-tier Championship on Saturday.\n\nLeicester has already clinched promotion and an immediate return to the Premier League. The team will go up as champions.\n\nIpswich or Leeds will join them.\n\nIpswich, which last played in the top flight in 2002, is currently in second place and three points ahead of third-place Leeds, whose American ownership group includes major-winning golfers Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas.\n\nIpswich hosts next-to-last Huddersfield, and Leeds is at home to fourth-place Southampton.\n\nThe teams placed third to sixth will compete in the playoffs for the third promotion spot. The playoff final is at Wembley Stadium on May 26.", "source": {"uri": "cbs17.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS17.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@cbs17.com", "name": "Associated

Nottingham Forest moved three points clear of the bottom three with a 3-1 win at Sheffield United, and Brentford and Fulham played a scoreless draw.\n\nHours before City's ruthless victory, Arsenal cleared another hurdle in their hunt for their first league title in 20 years.\n\nA penalty shortly before halftime converted by Bukayo Saka gave Arsenal the lead. Leandro Trossard eased the nerves inside the Emirates with a second goal on 70 minutes and Declan Rice added the third deep into stoppage time.\n\n\"We played probably the best first half we've played all season. We could have gone three, four, five easily. We scored one,\" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said.\n\n\"Then credit to Bournemouth they changed things and the game became more open which we wanted to avoid.\"\n\nArsenal next travel to Old Trafford to play Manchester United before hosting Everton on the final day.\n\nIf City felt pressure from Arsenal's win, it did not show as Haaland and the holders ran roughshod over Wolves at the Etihad.\n\n\"Nine (more) points, we will be champions. Seven points, six points, three points, Arsenal will win the Premier League,\" Guardiola said.\n\nHaaland -- who boosted his league scoring lead to 25 with the first four-goal haul of his career -- scored from the penalty spot in the 12th minute, then doubled City's lead in the 35th when he headed home at the far post from Rodri's cross.\n\nThe 23-year-old converted again from the spot just before halftime. Hwang Hee-chan pulled one back for Wolves in the 53rd but Haaland scored his fourth a minute later. Substitute Julian Alvarez completed City's scoring.\n\nGuardiola's team play away at Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur before closing the season at home to West Ham United.\n\nAlexander Isak scored his 20th league goal of the season to lead Newcastle in their romp over Burnley, keeping alive their hopes of playing European football next season.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff and Bruno Guimaraes also got on the scoresheet on a day soured only slightly by Isak's missed penalty.\n\n\"When we're really aggressive and running forward we are a really good team. It's been there in fits and starts this season, but a really good day and something to build on,\" Longstaff told the BBC.\n\nBurnley could have their relegation confirmed when they travel to Spurs next Saturday.\n\nBIG STEP FOR FOREST\n\nA brace by Callum Hudson-Odoi helped Forest breathe a little easier as they climbed three points above the drop zone, gaining a crucial lead over 18th-placed Luton Town with two games to go for both teams.\n\nSheffield, already relegated, remained bottom with 16 points.\n\n\"It was a big step for us but it's not over yet,\" Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo said. \"We've still got hard games to play.\"\n\nSheffield took the lead in the 16th minute on a penalty from Ben Brereton Diaz, but the visitors equalised 11 minutes later when Danilo found Hudson-Odoi in the box.\n\nRyan Yates gave Forest the lead with his first ever league goal shortly after the break before Hudson-Odoi fired into the near bottom corner to complete his brace in the 65th minute.\n\nSheffield became the first club to concede 100 goals in a 38-match Premier League season. Swindon Town, who also conceded 100 goals in 1993-94, did so over 42 games.\n\nFulham substitute Raul Jimenez missed a golden chance to settle the West London derby against Brentford in a game of missed chances.\n\nJimenez had been on the field for nine minutes when set up by Adama Traore's cross but, despite having time and space, he sent his 73rd-minute effort sailing over the crossbar.\n\nFulham are 12th in the table, while Brentford are 16th.

The Gunners have played with more vigor and maturity this season, claiming 83 points from 36 games so far. They are currently sitting at the top of the Premier League rankings, a point ahead of second-placed Manchester City.\n\nUnfortunately for the Gunners, however, the Cityzens have a game in hand, meaning the defending champions will retain their title if they win their remaining three matches.\n\nThanks to their experience in this stage of the competition, Manchester City are favorites to clinch their fourth Premier League title on the bounce this season. Guardiola, however, is refusing to be complacent and has urged all of his players to give their all to deny the Gunners their first Premier League title since 2003-04.\n\nSpeaking to the press after dispatching Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday (May 4), Guardiola emphasized how important it was for his team to win the next three games. He claimed Arsenal were in majestic form and would not drop points in their last two games of the season.\n\nThe Spanish tactician remarked (via Football.London):\n\n\"If we win the games we will be champions, so the players know it, feel it, and have the experience of doing it in the past. But they have to do it again. It's going to be easy? No. It's in our hands but everyone knows you cannot make one little mistake because you will lose the Premier League. They know it, we know it.\n\n\"You see their [Arsenal's] level of consistency since the winter break, the way they are playing. It's not the fact that they are winning, it's the way they play. You smell that they are not going to lose in the games they have left. They are not going to.\"\n\nArsenal will face Manchester United (Away, May 12) and Everton (Home, May 19) in their last two games of the season. Manchester City, meanwhile, have to get the better of Fulham (Away, May 11), Tottenham Hotspur (Away, May 14), and West Ham United (Home, May 19).", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sushan_chakraborty@sportslens.com", "name": "Sushan Chakraborty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://sportslens.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Man-City-manager-Pep-Guardiola-768x432-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 1160, "textEnd": 1165}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 2039, "textEnd": 2045}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 2066, "textEnd": 2072, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 2181, "textEnd": 2187}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 2215, "textEnd": 2221}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

However, City, set to host Wolves, holds a crucial game.\n\nMeanwhile, Newcastle seeks to escalate the pressure on Manchester United in the race for a Europa League spot as they face Burnley, who are striving for a miraculous escape from relegation.\n\nDespite Arsenal's resurgence following their recent defeat to Aston Villa, they face a formidable City side currently boasting an unbeaten streak of 31 games across all competitions.\n\nThe Gunners can apply pressure by securing a victory against Bournemouth in the Saturday early kick-off at the Emirates. Although Bournemouth has reached its highest-ever points tally in the Premier League season and currently sits in 10th place, it has only managed to beat Arsenal once in its history.\n\nWhile City's performance against Nottingham Forest last weekend may not have been their finest, they still clinched victory and remain strong contenders to secure an unprecedented fourth consecutive English title.\n\nArsenal remains optimistic, hoping for a slip-up from City, especially considering Wolves' previous victory against them earlier in the season. Guardiola, however, remains steadfast, emphasizing the importance of not dropping any points in the remaining fixtures.\n\n\"With four games left, it's like climbing a mountain,\" Guardiola remarked. \"They are very tough games...

Credits: Image - Getty Images; Video - Sky Sport\n\nManchester City remained on course for a fourth successive Premier League title with a ruthless 5-1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday (NZ time), hours after Arsenal's 3-0 win over Bournemouth kept them provisionally top of the standings.\n\nErling Haaland struck four times as Pep Guardiola's team pulled to within a point of Arsenal with a game in hand.\n\nNewcastle United moved into sixth place with a 4-1 victory at Burnley that left the hosts on the brink of relegation. Nottingham Forest moved three points clear of the bottom three with a 3-1 win at Sheffield United, and Brentford and Fulham played a scoreless draw.\n\nHours before City's ruthless victory, Arsenal cleared another hurdle in their hunt for their first league title in 20 years.\n\nA penalty shortly before halftime converted by Bukayo Saka gave Arsenal the lead. Leandro Trossard eased the nerves inside the Emirates with a second goal on 70 minutes and Declan Rice added the third deep into stoppage time.\n\n\"We played probably the best first half we've played all season. We could have gone three, four, five easily. We scored one,\" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said.\n\n\"Then credit to Bournemouth they changed things and the game became more open which we wanted to avoid.\"\n\nArsenal next travel to Old Trafford to play Manchester United before hosting Everton on the final day.\n\nIf City felt pressure from Arsenal's win, it did not show as Haaland and the holders ran roughshod over Wolves at the Etihad.\n\n\"Nine (more) points, we will be champions. Seven points, six points, three points, Arsenal will win the Premier League,\" Guardiola said.\n\nHaaland -- who boosted his league scoring lead to 25 with the first four-goal haul of his career -- scored from the penalty spot in the 12th minute, then doubled City's lead in the 35th when he headed home at the far post from Rodri's cross.\n\nThe 23-year-old converted again from the spot just before halftime. Hwang Hee-chan pulled one back for Wolves in the 53rd but Haaland scored his fourth a minute later. Substitute Julian Alvarez completed City's scoring.\n\nGuardiola's team play away at Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur before closing the season at home to West Ham United.\n\nAlexander Isak scored his 20th league goal of the season to lead Newcastle in their romp over Burnley, keeping alive their hopes of playing European football next season.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff and Bruno Guimaraes also got on the scoresheet on a day soured only slightly by Isak's missed penalty.\n\n\"When we're really aggressive and running forward we are a really good team. It's been there in fits and starts this season, but a really good day and something to build on,\" Longstaff told the BBC.\n\nBurnley could have their relegation confirmed when they travel to Spurs next Saturday.\n\nA brace by Callum Hudson-Odoi helped Forest breathe a little easier as they climbed three points above the drop zone, gaining a crucial lead over 18th-placed Luton Town with two games to go for both teams.\n\nSheffield, already relegated, remained bottom with 16 points.\n\n\"It was a big step for us but it's not over yet,\" Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo said. \"We've still got hard games to play.\"\n\nSheffield took the lead in the 16th minute on a penalty from Ben Brereton Diaz, but the visitors equalised 11 minutes later when Danilo found Hudson-Odoi in the box.\n\nRyan Yates gave Forest the lead with his first ever league goal shortly after the break before Hudson-Odoi fired into the near bottom corner to complete his brace in the 65th minute.\n\nSheffield became the first club to concede 100 goals in a 38-match Premier League season. Swindon Town, who also conceded 100 goals in 1993-94, did so over 42 games.\n\nFulham substitute Raul Jimenez missed a golden chance to settle the West London derby against Brentford in a game of missed chances.\n\nJimenez had been on the field for nine minutes when set up by Adama Traore's cross but, despite having time and space, he sent his 73rd-minute effort sailing over the crossbar.\n\nFulham are 12th in the table, while Brentford are 16th. Both teams have two matches remaining.\n\nReuters.", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@newshub.co.nz", "name": "Reuters", "type":

Another win for Manchester City in its bid to capture an unprecedented fourth straight Premier League crown.\n\nHaaland has now at least a hat trick in six of his 63 matches in England's top flight after converting two penalties either side of a towering header and curling home a sublime finish in City's 5-1 victory over Wolverhampton on Saturday. Julian Alvarez added a late fifth, moments after coming on as a substitute for Haaland.\n\n\"Erling is back to business,\" City manager Pep Guardiola said. \"Penalties are a guarantee but the second and fourth (goals) were unbelievable.\"\n\nThat's six straight wins for the defending champions in their five-month unbeaten streak in the league. Three more wins -- away to Fulham and Tottenham and then at home to West Ham -- and the title is theirs once again.\n\nCity might need to be perfect down the stretch to hold off Arsenal.\n\nThere's no sign of an end-of-season collapse by Mikel Arteta's team this time, with a 3-0 win over Bournemouth in the lunchtime kickoff keeping the pressure on City.\n\nArsenal has four straight wins itself and has retained its one-point lead. City, though, has three games left, one more than Arsenal.\n\nLast season, Arsenal's title challenge faded in the spring as a fast-finishing City clinched a third straight league championship with three games to spare.\n\nTwelve months on and the title race is heading into the final week of the season. Indeed, given the form of the top two, it is likely to be decided in the last round of games on May 19.\n\nBukayo Saka converted a penalty in the 45th minute before second-half goals by Leandro Trossard and Declan Rice gave Arsenal victory at Emirates Stadium.\n\nBURNLEY IN TROUBLE\n\nBurnley slipped closer to the drop thanks to its 4-1 loss at home to Newcastle combined with relegation rival Nottingham Forest's 3-1 win at last-place Sheffield United.\n\nIt left next-to-last Burnley five points adrift of Forest, which occupies the place directly above the relegation zone.\n\nBurnley has to win both of its remaining games -- away to Tottenham and then at home to Forest on the final day -- to stand a chance of staying up. Even that won't be enough if Forest avoids defeat at West Ham next weekend, given Burnley's goal difference is so much worse than Forest's.\n\nLuton, which drew 1-1 with Everton on Friday, is third from bottom and now three points behind Forest. As it stands, the three teams that were promoted last season are going straight back down to the Championship.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes and Alexander Isak all scored for Newcastle, which climbed above Manchester United and into sixth place in its bid to qualify for Europe. Newcastle could even catch Tottenham, which is four points further ahead in fifth ahead of its trip to Liverpool on Sunday.\n\nMan United visits Crystal Palace on Monday.\n\nSheffield United was already sure of being relegated before playing Forest, which came from behind through a double from Callum Hudson-Odoi that came either side of Ryan Yates' goal.\n\nIn the other match Saturday, Brentford and Fulham drew 0-0.\n\nTOP SCORER RACE\n\nHaaland's four goals have left him in sight of the Golden Boot -- awarded to the league's top scorer -- for the second straight season.\n\nThe Norway striker has 25 for the campaign, five more than Isak and Chelsea's Cole Palmer. Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa is one goal further back.\n\nThere will be a refreshing name in the Premier League next season.\n\nIpswich sealed a return to England's top division for the first time in 22 years after finishing as runner-up on the last day of the second-tier Championship's regular season.\n\nA 2-0 win over Huddersfield saw Ipswich beat Leeds to the second automatic qualification spot, behind Leicester.\n\nLeeds joined Southampton, West Bromwich Albion and Norwich in the playoffs for the third promotion spot. Leeds will play Norwich over two legs and Southampton takes on West Brom.", "source": {"uri": "independent.com.mt", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Malta Independent Online"}, "authors": [],

However, unsurprisingly, it wasn't to be and Manchester City scored five, closing the points gap again and the goal difference by one.\n\nThis has led to many suddenly panicking that the advantage in goals that Arsenal have has come into question with the two and three games each respective side has remaining in this Premier League season. City face Fulham (A) Tottenham (A) and West Ham (H) whilst Arsenal travel to Old Trafford before hosting Everton on the final day.\n\nAt present the goal difference is split by just six, which feels close when considering the capabilities of Man City to narrow that gap with an extra game, and looks far more realistic than the calm tone this article's intro might suggest. That said, goal difference will only be relevant should Man City draw one of their three games with them winning the other two, and Arsenal winning their final games also.\n\nTherefore it can be assumed for the goal difference to matter, both City and Arsenal have two games remaining in this context. Should Arsenal win both their remaining games, at the very minimum it will be achieved by a one-goal difference taking their gap over Manchester City to eight.\n\nTherefore, should City draw one of their three games and Arsenal win both of theirs by a maximum margin of one in each, City would need to score by a winning margin of nine goals in the other two clashes. Whilst sounding somewhat complicated the likelihood will be that Arsenal will win against Manchester United and Everton by more than just a one-goal margin meaning that City will need win by a combined double-figure margin to win the league on goal difference.\n\nIn short, fans need not worry too greatly about the goal difference with the chances of it winning City the league very slim. Fans should be worrying about the simple need for City to drop points.\n\nREAD MORE: Martin Odegaard has perfect Arsenal response to Erik ten Hag mind games ahead of Man United\n\nREAD MORE: Triple Arsenal title boost hope remains as Man City face unlikely Premier League challenge\n\nFulham's Marco Silva has failed to record a win or a draw against Pep Guardiola in 12 attempts. Tottenham are incredibly poor form having lost their last four matches, conceding 13 goals in the process, and West Ham were just battered 5-0 by Chelsea and are likely to have nothing to play for on the final day. The reality is Arsenal will not only need to beat both Man United and Everton but need something of a miracle to fall in their favour in City's remaining three games.\n\nSuggestions that Arsenal will have 'crumbled' or 'bottled it' should be held back too. Arsenal have so far secured 46 of the last available 51 points, City securing 45 of 51, and their 3-0 win over Bournemouth equalled the 26 league wins of the 2003/04 'Invincibles' season, while matching their record 88 league goal tally from last season.\n\nIf Arsenal don't win it, City have simply yet again been better.

Indeed, given the form of the top two, it is likely to be decided in the last round of games on May 19.\n\nBukayo Saka converted a penalty in the 45th minute before second-half goals by Leandro Trossard and Declan Rice gave Arsenal victory at Emirates Stadium.\n\nBURNLEY IN TROUBLE\n\nBurnley slipped closer to the drop thanks to its 4-1 loss at home to Newcastle combined with relegation rival Nottingham Forest's 3-1 win at last-place Sheffield United.\n\nIt left next-to-last Burnley five points adrift of Forest, which occupies the place directly above the relegation zone.\n\nBurnley has to win both of its remaining games -- away to Tottenham and then at home to Forest on the final day -- to stand a chance of staying up. Even that won't be enough if Forest avoids defeat at West Ham next weekend, given Burnley's goal difference is so much worse than Forest's.\n\nLuton, which drew 1-1 with Everton on Friday, is third from bottom and now three points behind Forest. As it stands, the three teams that were promoted last season are going straight back down to the Championship.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes and Alexander Isak all scored for Newcastle, which climbed above Manchester United and into sixth place in its bid to qualify for Europe. Newcastle could even catch Tottenham, which is four points further ahead in fifth ahead of its trip to Liverpool on Sunday.\n\nMan United visits Crystal Palace on Monday.\n\nSheffield United was already sure of being relegated before playing Forest, which came from behind through a double from Callum Hudson-Odoi that came either side of Ryan Yates' goal.\n\nIn the other match Saturday, Brentford and Fulham drew 0-0.\n\nTOP SCORER RACE\n\nHaaland's four goals have left him in sight of the Golden Boot -- awarded to the league's top scorer -- for the second straight season.\n\nThe Norway striker has 25 for the campaign, five more than Isak and Chelsea's Cole Palmer. Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa is one goal further back.\n\nHaaland scored 36 goals in the league last season.\n\nIPSWICH PROMOTED\n\nThere will be a refreshing name in the Premier League next season.\n\nIpswich sealed a return to England's top division for the first time in 22 years after finishing as runner-up on the last day of the second-tier Championship's regular season.\n\nA 2-0 win over Huddersfield saw Ipswich beat Leeds to the second automatic qualification spot, behind Leicester.\n\nLeeds joined Southampton, West Bromwich Albion and Norwich in the playoffs for the third promotion spot. Leeds will play Norwich over two legs and Southampton takes on West Brom.\n\nThe playoff final is at Wembley Stadium on May 26.\n\nSteve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nAP soccer:

Nine points and we will be champions. Seven, six or three points, Arsenal will win the Premier League.\"\n\nGuardiola is not placing much faith in Manchester United then, given he expects Arsenal to win every game and the Gunners visit Old Trafford on 12 May.\n\nBut, then, he doesn't have to.\n\nIf City win their final three games they will go into the history books as the first team to win the English title in four successive seasons.\n\nFour Erling Haaland goals against Wolves ensured City navigated their latest obstacle with ease. Now it is on to Craven Cottage and Fulham, a team they have beaten 15 times in a row.\n\nThey finish with West Ham at home. City have not dropped a point at Etihad Stadium against the Hammers since Guardiola arrived in 2016.\n\nIn between comes a trip to Tottenham. City have not scored a Premier League goal or taken a point at Spurs' new stadium. They did win there in the FA Cup this season, though, and Ange Postecoglou's team are in terrible form.\n\nAnd, as Wolves boss Gary O'Neil pointed out, this is the hardest time to play City.\n\n\"Manchester City, in May, when they are chasing down a fourth consecutive Premier League title, are fairly tough,\" he said.\n\n\"They have an incredible focus at this point. History tells you, at this point in the run-in, they are difficult to stop.\"\n\nThe one negative for City is that Arsenal's goal difference is better by six, which means they have to win to reach the top. A draw will not do.\n\n\"Goal difference is not possible,\" Guardiola said. \"We cannot draw. We have to take nine points.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with BBC Match of the Day, he added: \"Hopefully, we can come back here in a few days and have the chance against West Ham to come here and win the title.\"\n\nFor City to get to the West Ham game and not have a chance of the title, it would require Arsenal to beat Manchester United and for City to get no more than a point from the Fulham and Tottenham trips.\n\nThat feels unlikely for a team that has put an astonishing run together of 16 wins and four draws since they were beaten at Aston Villa on 6 December.\n\nNot that it should come as a surprise.\n\nLast season, City went on a 16-match unbeaten run, winning 14 times, to take the title before they lost at Brentford on the final day. The year before that, they won 23 times in a run of one defeat in 28. The season before that, they won 17 times in a 19-match unbeaten sequence.\n\n\"When you are coming towards the end of the season, you do think differently,\" former City defender Micah Richards told Sky Sports. \"These games are the most important and that's where City seem to thrive.\"\n\nAs Richards' fellow pundit Jamie Redknapp said, Arsenal's task is straightforward.\n\nThey must win at Old Trafford and then again against Everton on the final day. Anything else is completely out of their hands.\n\nGiven the run Mikel Arteta's side have been on, and the two seasons they have had, few would begrudge the Gunners a first title since 2004.\n\nBut, as Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool have found out, running City close and overhauling them are two different matters.\n\n\"They are an unbelievable team,\" said Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice. \"What I have learned in this title race is that you have to be nearly perfect. They have done that for three years in a row.\n\n\"I have massive respect for what they have done. But we have two games to go and we're praying for something to go our way.\"", "source": {"uri": "modernghana.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Modern Ghana Media Communication Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craven_Cottage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craven Cottage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_O'Neil", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary O'Neil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Manchester_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "City of Manchester Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_of_the_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Match of the Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Redknapp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Redknapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Micah Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentford_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brentford F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.modernghana.com/images/content/55202441455-1j041q5ccw-17e1ab80-0a58-11ef-9d76-ed63d3e9469f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 490, "textEnd": 496}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-06", "textStart": 2323, "textEnd": 2333}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The former United defender predicts that the Gunners will drop points at Old Trafford on Sunday (May 12), and City will defeat the Spurs to secure their fourth consecutive title.\n\n\"I have that fear the title race could be over a week on Tuesday. I want the title race to go to the final day, my fear is it won't if City win on Saturday against Fulham and United take points off Arsenal on the Sunday. Arsenal have already proven they are a different side than last season but just feels like an inevitability City will be perfect until the end,'\" Neville said.\n\nManchester City are 82 points strong in the second position in the league table, one point behind table leaders Arsenal. However, Pep Guardiola's side has a game in hand than the Gunners.\n\nThe Citizens are set to face Fulham (A), Tottenham Hotspur (A) and West Ham United (H) in their last three fixtures. Meanwhile, Mikel Arteta's side is gearing up to clash against Manchester United (A) and Everton (H) in their last two games.\n\nArsenal and Manchester City's title race explored\n\nWhile Gary Neville was bold to predict that the Premier League title race this season could be over before the final day of the season, it could also go down to the wire.\n\nThe title race was kept going after Manchester City defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers 5-1 on Saturday (May 4), with Erling Haaland scoring four goals in the match. Meanwhile, the Gunners defeated Bournemouth 3-0 on the same day, keeping themselves in the race.\n\nThe Gunners must win both of their upcoming games against United and Everton to compete with Manchester City. If they lose or draw even one game, their title hopes could be in serious jeopardy.\n\nMoreover, if Guardiola's side also wins all three of their remaining games, they will beat Arteta's side to win their fourth consecutive title this season, irrespective of how the Gunners perform.\n\nThe Gunners will stand on 89 points if they win both their remaining games, but City has three games in hand. If they win all three, they will be on 91 points, surpassing Arteta's squad by a narrow margin of two points.\n\nArsenal could win their first league title in 20 years only if Manchester City lose or draw one of their three remaining games.\n\nIf City draws in any of their remaining games and the Gunners win both of theirs, they will both have 89 points.

Nine points and we will be champions. Seven, six or three points, Arsenal will win the Premier League.\"\n\nGuardiola is not placing much faith in Manchester United then, given he expects Arsenal to win every game and the Gunners visit Old Trafford on 12 May.\n\nBut, then, he doesn't have to.\n\nIf City win their final three games they will go into the history books as the first team to win the English title in four successive seasons.\n\nFour Erling Haaland goals against Wolves ensured City navigated their latest obstacle with ease. Now it is on to Craven Cottage and Fulham, a team they have beaten 15 times in a row.\n\nThey finish with West Ham at home. City have not dropped a point at Etihad Stadium against the Hammers since Guardiola arrived in 2016.\n\nIn between comes a trip to Tottenham. City have not scored a Premier League goal or taken a point at Spurs' new stadium. They did win there in the FA Cup this season, though, and Ange Postecoglou's team are in terrible form.\n\nAnd, as Wolves boss Gary O'Neil pointed out, this is the hardest time to play City.\n\n\"Manchester City, in May, when they are chasing down a fourth consecutive Premier League title, are fairly tough,\" he said.\n\n\"They have an incredible focus at this point. History tells you, at this point in the run-in, they are difficult to stop.\"\n\nCity hit form at the right time again\n\nThe one negative for City is that Arsenal's goal difference is better by six, which means they have to win to reach the top. A draw will not do.\n\n\"Goal difference is not possible,\" Guardiola said. \"We cannot draw. We have to take nine points.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with BBC Match of the Day, he added: \"Hopefully, we can come back here in a few days and have the chance against West Ham to come here and win the title.\"\n\nFor City to get to the West Ham game and not have a chance of the title, it would require Arsenal to beat Manchester United and for City to get no more than a point from the Fulham and Tottenham trips.\n\nThat feels unlikely for a team that has put an astonishing run together of 16 wins and four draws since they were beaten at Aston Villa on 6 December.\n\nNot that it should come as a surprise.\n\nLast season, City went on a 16-match unbeaten run, winning 14 times, to take the title before they lost at Brentford on the final day. The year before that, they won 23 times in a run of one defeat in 28. The season before that, they won 17 times in a 19-match unbeaten sequence.\n\n\"When you are coming towards the end of the season, you do think differently,\" former City defender Micah Richards told Sky Sports. \"These games are the most important and that's where City seem to thrive.\"\n\nArsenal 'praying' for help\n\nAs Richards' fellow pundit Jamie Redknapp said, Arsenal's task is straightforward.\n\nThey must win at Old Trafford and then again against Everton on the final day. Anything else is completely out of their hands.\n\nGiven the run Mikel Arteta's side have been on, and the two seasons they have had, few would begrudge the Gunners a first title since 2004.\n\nBut, as Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool have found out, running City close and overhauling them are two different matters.\n\n\"They are an unbelievable team,\" said Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice. \"What I have learned in this title race is that you have to be nearly perfect. They have done that for three years in a row.\n\n\"I have massive respect for what they have done. But we have two games to go and we're praying for something to go our way.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_stone@sports.yahoo.com", "name": "Simon Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Manchester_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "City of Manchester Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craven_Cottage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craven Cottage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_O'Neil", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary O'Neil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_of_the_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Match of the Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Redknapp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Redknapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Micah Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentford_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brentford F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/W3XDKTOc52R8MN2uacKCAw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/bd6c1ad1da31e9d613fefe4ff321c2f3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 347, "textEnd": 353}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-06", "textStart": 2219, "textEnd": 2229}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Leandro Trossard eased the nerves inside the Emirates with a second goal on 70 minutes and Declan Rice added the third deep into stoppage time.\n\n\"We played probably the best first half we've played all season. We could have gone three, four, five easily.

Seven points, six points, three points, Arsenal will win the Premier League,\" Guardiola said.\n\nHaaland, who boosted his league scoring lead to 25 with the first four-goal haul of his career, scored from the penalty spot in the 12th minute, then doubled City's lead in the 35th when he headed home at the far post from Rodri's cross.\n\nThe 23-year-old converted again from the spot just before halftime. Hwang Hee-chan pulled one back for Wolves in the 53rd but Haaland scored his fourth a minute later. Substitute Julian Alvarez completed City's scoring.\n\nGuardiola's team play away at Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur before closing the season at home to West Ham United.\n\nAlexander Isak scored his 20th league goal of the season to lead Newcastle in their romp over Burnley, keeping alive their hopes of playing European football next season.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff and Bruno Guimaraes also got on the scoresheet on a day soured only slightly by Isak's missed penalty.\n\n\"When we're really aggressive and running forward we are a really good team. It's been there in fits and starts this season, but a really good day and something to build on,\" Longstaff told the BBC.\n\nBurnley could have their relegation confirmed when they travel to Spurs next weekend.\n\nA brace by Callum Hudson-Odoi helped Forest breathe a little easier as they climbed three points above the drop zone, gaining a crucial lead over 18th-placed Luton Town with two games to go for both teams.\n\nSheffield, already relegated, remained bottom with 16 points.\n\n\"It was a big step for us but it's not over yet,\" Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo said. \"We've still got hard games to play.\"\n\nSheffield took the lead in the 16th minute on a penalty from Ben Brereton Diaz, but the visitors equalised 11 minutes later when Danilo found Hudson-Odoi in the box.\n\nRyan Yates gave Forest the lead with his first ever league goal shortly after the break before Hudson-Odoi fired into the near bottom corner to complete his brace in the 65th minute.\n\nSheffield became the first club to concede 100 goals in a 38-match Premier League season.

City, though, has three games left, one more than Arsenal.\n\nLast season, Arsenal's title challenge faded in the spring as a fast-finishing City clinched a third straight league championship with three games to spare.\n\nTwelve months on and the title race is heading into the final week of the season. Indeed, given the form of the top two, it is likely to be decided in the last round of games on May 19.\n\nBukayo Saka converted a penalty in the 45th minute before second-half goals by Leandro Trossard and Declan Rice gave Arsenal victory at Emirates Stadium.\n\nIt left next-to-last Burnley five points adrift of Forest, which occupies the place directly above the relegation zone.\n\nBurnley has to win both of its remaining games -- away to Tottenham and then at home to Forest on the final day -- to stand a chance of staying up. Even that won't be enough if Forest avoids defeat at West Ham next weekend, given Burnley's goal difference is so much worse than Forest's.\n\nLuton, which drew 1-1 with Everton on Friday, is third from bottom and now three points behind Forest. As it stands, the three teams that were promoted last season are going straight back down to the Championship.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes and Alexander Isak all scored for Newcastle, which climbed above Manchester United and into sixth place in its bid to qualify for Europe. Newcastle could even catch Tottenham, which is four points further ahead in fifth ahead of its trip to Liverpool on Sunday.\n\nMan United visits Crystal Palace on Monday.\n\nSheffield United was already sure of being relegated before playing Forest, which came from behind through a double from Callum Hudson-Odoi that came either side of Ryan Yates' goal.\n\nHaaland's four goals have left him in sight of the Golden Boot -- awarded to the league's top scorer -- for the second straight season.\n\nThe Norway striker has 25 for the campaign, five more than Isak and Chelsea's Cole Palmer. Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa is one goal further back.\n\nThere will be a refreshing name in the Premier League next season.\n\nIpswich sealed a return to England's top division for the first time in 22 years after finishing as runner-up on the last day of the second-tier Championship's regular season.\n\nA 2-0 win over Huddersfield saw Ipswich beat Leeds to the second automatic qualification spot, behind Leicester.\n\nLeeds joined Southampton, West Bromwich Albion and Norwich in the playoffs for the third promotion spot.

Julian Alvarez added a late fifth, moments after coming on as a substitute for Haaland.\n\nThat's six straight wins for the defending champions in their five-month unbeaten streak in the league.

Even that won't be enough if Forest avoids defeat at West Ham next weekend, given Burnley's goal difference is so much worse than Forest's.\n\nLuton, which drew 1-1 with Everton on Friday, is third from bottom and now three points behind Forest. As it stands, the three teams that were promoted last season are going straight back down to the Championship.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes and Alexander Isak all scored for Newcastle, which climbed above Manchester United and into sixth place in its bid to qualify for Europe. Newcastle could even catch Tottenham, which is four points further ahead in fifth ahead of its trip to Liverpool on Sunday.\n\nMan United visits Crystal Palace on Monday.\n\nSheffield United was already sure of being relegated before playing Forest, which came from behind through a double from Callum Hudson-Odoi that came either side of Ryan Yates' goal.\n\nIn the other match Saturday, Brentford and Fulham drew 0-0.\n\nTOP SCORER RACE\n\nHaaland's four goals have left him in sight of the Golden Boot -- awarded to the league's top scorer -- for the second straight season.\n\nThe Norway striker has 25 for the campaign, five more than Isak and Chelsea's Cole Palmer. Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa is one goal further back.\n\nThere will be a refreshing name in the Premier League next season.\n\nIpswich sealed a return to England's top division for the first time in 22 years after finishing as runner-up on the last day of the second-tier Championship's regular season.\n\nA 2-0 win over Huddersfield saw Ipswich beat Leeds to the second automatic qualification spot, behind Leicester.\n\nLeeds joined Southampton, West Bromwich Albion and Norwich in the playoffs for the third promotion spot.

Leandro Trossard eased the nerves inside the Emirates with a second goal on 70 minutes and Declan Rice added the third deep into stoppage time.\n\n\"We played probably the best first half we've played all season.

Seven points, six points, three points, Arsenal will win the Premier League,\" Guardiola said.\n\nHaaland -- who boosted his league scoring lead to 25 with the first four-goal haul of his career -- scored from the penalty spot in the 12th minute, then doubled City's lead in the 35th when he headed home at the far post from Rodri's cross.\n\nThe 23-year-old converted again from the spot just before halftime. Hwang Hee-chan pulled one back for Wolves in the 53rd but Haaland scored his fourth a minute later.

What Guardiola and Arteta need to do", "body": "After wins for both Arsenal and Manchester City at the weekend, it's still all to play for in the Premier League title race with just two weekends remaining.\n\nMikel Arteta's side breezed past Bournemouth with a 3-0 home win early on Saturday to remain top of the table as the Gunners go in search of their first league title since the 2003/04 season.\n\nCity, however, kept pace with the league leaders later in the day, with Erling Haaland notching up four goals as Pep Guardiola's side romped to a 5-1 win over Wolves.\n\nThe emphatic result pulled City back within one point of Arsenal and, with a game in hand over the title rivals, the defending champions still have the advantage as they look to become the first side ever to win four consecutive league titles.\n\nWith a game in hand over Arsenal, the task is simple for City - win all three remaining games and they will be crowned champions for a historic fourth successive year.\n\nArsenal, meanwhile, need to win their remaining two games and hope that City slip up in one of their final three games.\n\nArteta's side, though, do have an important six-goal advantage when it comes to goal difference, meaning if City were to draw any of their final three games and Arsenal won their remaining two the trophy, in all likelihood, would head to north London.\n\nArsenal face a potentially tricky visit to Old Trafford next weekend. Erik ten Hag's side put a dagger through Liverpool's title hopes last month and may have another surprise up their sleeve as they look to keep their own European qualification hopes alive.\n\nOn the final day, Arteta's side will host Everton who have enjoyed a resurgent few weeks to steer themselves clear of the relegation zone.\n\nMan City, meanwhile, begin their final three games with an away trip to Fulham before their crunch midweek feature against Ange Posteoglou's Tottenham.\n\nSpurs have caused many an upset against Guardiola's side over the years and also have plenty to play for in the final few games as they hunt down a spot in the top four.\n\nOn the final day, the defending champions are at home for the visit of West Ham whose form - and hopes of another season in Europe - has taken a hit in recent weeks.\n\nShould City beat Fulham on Saturday, the pressure would be firmly on Arsenal to keep the title race alive.\n\nIf the Gunners slip up and lose against Manchester United on Sunday, City would have the chance to win the league against Tottenham in midweek.\n\nHowever, should both teams win their matches next weekend, the title race is guaranteed to go to the final weekend.\n\nWhile still mathematically possible, Liverpool's title hopes are essentially over after their derby-day defeat to Everton and a deflating draw against West Ham.\n\nShould Jurgen Klopp's side win their remaining two games they would reach 84 points, albeit with a far inferior goal difference.\n\nTo win the league, therefore, the Reds would require Arsenal to lose their two remaining games and City to pick up just one point from their final three games.\n\nMORE : Virgil van Dijk speaks out on Liverpool future amid Bayern Munich transfer speculation", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_fleming@metro.co.uk", "name": "Ben Fleming", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournemouth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2127745572_c7dd97.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C20px%2C1024px%2C538px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6392156862745098, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

There's no sign of an end-of-season collapse by Arsenal this time.\n\nKeeping the pressure on Manchester City, Arsenal beat Bournemouth 3-0 in the lunchtime kickoff Saturday for a fourth straight win in the league.\n\nIt pushed Arsenal four points clear of second-place City, which has two games in hand -- the first of which was against Wolverhampton later Saturday.\n\nLast season, Arsenal's title challenge faded in the spring as a fast-finishing City clinched a third straight league championship with three games to spare.\n\nTwelve months on and the title race is heading into the final week of the season. Indeed, given the form of the top two, it is likely to be decided in the last round of games on May 19.\n\nBukayo Saka converted a penalty in the 45th minute before second-half goals by Leandro Trossard and Declan Rice gave Arsenal victory at Emirates Stadium.\n\nBURNLEY IN TROUBLE\n\nBurnley slipped closer to the drop thanks to its 4-1 loss at home to Newcastle combined with relegation rival Nottingham Forest's 3-1 win at last-place Sheffield United.\n\nIt left next-to-last Burnley five points adrift of Forest, which occupies the place directly above the relegation zone.\n\nBurnley has to win both of its remaining games -- away to Tottenham and then at home to Forest on the final day -- to stand a chance of staying up. Even that won't be enough if Forest avoids defeat at West Ham next weekend, given Burnley's goal difference is so much worse than Forest's.\n\nLuton is third from bottom and now three points behind Forest. As it stands, the three teams that were promoted last season are going straight back down to the Championship.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes and Alexander Isak all scored for Newcastle, which climbed above Manchester United and into sixth place in its bid to qualify for Europe. Newcastle could even catch Tottenham, which is four points further ahead in fifth ahead of its trip to Liverpool on Sunday.\n\nMan United visits Crystal Palace on Monday.\n\nSheffield United was already sure of being relegated before playing Forest, which came from behind through a double from Callum Hudson-Odoi that came either side of Ryan Yates' goal.\n\nIn the other match Saturday, Brentford and Fulham drew 0-0.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Nottingham Forest moved three points clear of the bottom three with a 3-1 win at Sheffield United, and Brentford and Fulham played a scoreless draw.\n\nHours before City's ruthless victory, Arsenal cleared another hurdle in their hunt for their first league title in 20 years.\n\nA penalty shortly before halftime converted by Bukayo Saka gave Arsenal the lead. Leandro Trossard eased the nerves inside the Emirates with a second goal on 70 minutes and Declan Rice added the third deep into stoppage time.\n\n\"We played probably the best first half we've played all season. We could have gone three, four, five easily. We scored one,\" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said.\n\n\"Then credit to Bournemouth they changed things and the game became more open which we wanted to avoid.\"\n\nArsenal next travel to Old Trafford to play Manchester United before hosting Everton on the final day.\n\nIf City felt pressure from Arsenal's win, it did not show as Haaland and the holders ran roughshod over Wolves at the Etihad.\n\n\"Nine (more) points, we will be champions. Seven points, six points, three points, Arsenal will win the Premier League,\" Guardiola said.\n\nHaaland -- who boosted his league scoring lead to 25 with the first four-goal haul of his career -- scored from the penalty spot in the 12th minute, then doubled City's lead in the 35th when he headed home at the far post from Rodri's cross.\n\nThe 23-year-old converted again from the spot just before halftime. Hwang Hee-chan pulled one back for Wolves in the 53rd but Haaland scored his fourth a minute later. Substitute Julian Alvarez completed City's scoring.\n\nGuardiola's team play away at Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur before closing the season at home to West Ham United.\n\nAlexander Isak scored his 20th league goal of the season to lead Newcastle in their romp over Burnley, keeping alive their hopes of playing European football next season.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff and Bruno Guimaraes also got on the scoresheet on a day soured only slightly by Isak's missed penalty.\n\n\"When we're really aggressive and running forward we are a really good team. It's been there in fits and starts this season, but a really good day and something to build on,\" Longstaff told the BBC.\n\nBurnley could have their relegation confirmed when they travel to Spurs next Saturday.\n\nBIG STEP FOR FOREST\n\nA brace by Callum Hudson-Odoi helped Forest breathe a little easier as they climbed three points above the drop zone, gaining a crucial lead over 18th-placed Luton Town with two games to go for both teams.\n\nSheffield, already relegated, remained bottom with 16 points.\n\n\"It was a big step for us but it's not over yet,\" Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo said. \"We've still got hard games to play.\"\n\nSheffield took the lead in the 16th minute on a penalty from Ben Brereton Diaz, but the visitors equalised 11 minutes later when Danilo found Hudson-Odoi in the box.\n\nRyan Yates gave Forest the lead with his first ever league goal shortly after the break before Hudson-Odoi fired into the near bottom corner to complete his brace in the 65th minute.\n\nSheffield became the first club to concede 100 goals in a 38-match Premier League season. Swindon Town, who also conceded 100 goals in 1993-94, did so over 42 games.\n\nFulham substitute Raul Jimenez missed a golden chance to settle the West London derby against Brentford in a game of missed chances.\n\nJimenez had been on the field for nine minutes when set up by Adama Traore's cross but, despite having time and space, he sent his 73rd-minute effort sailing over the crossbar.\n\nFulham are 12th in the table, while Brentford are 16th. Both teams have two matches remaining.\n\n(Reporting by Lori Ewing; Editing by Christian Radnedge)", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [],

There's no sign of an end-of-season collapse by Arsenal this time.\n\nKeeping the pressure on Manchester City, Arsenal beat Bournemouth 3-0 in the lunchtime kickoff Saturday for a fourth straight win in the league.\n\nIt pushed Arsenal four points clear of second-place City, which has two games in hand -- the first of which was against Wolverhampton later Saturday.\n\nLast season, Arsenal's title challenge faded in the spring as a fast-finishing City clinched a third straight league championship with three games to spare.\n\nTwelve months on and the title race is heading into the final week of the season. Indeed, given the form of the top two, it is likely to be decided in the last round of games on May 19.\n\nBukayo Saka converted a penalty in the 45th minute before second-half goals by Leandro Trossard and Declan Rice gave Arsenal victory at Emirates Stadium.\n\nBURNLEY IN TROUBLE\n\nBurnley slipped closer to the drop thanks to its 4-1 loss at home to Newcastle combined with relegation rival Nottingham Forest's 3-1 win at last-place Sheffield United.\n\nIt left next-to-last Burnley five points adrift of Forest, which occupies the place directly above the relegation zone.\n\nBurnley has to win both of its remaining games -- away to Tottenham and then at home to Forest on the final day -- to stand a chance of staying up. Even that won't be enough if Forest avoids defeat at West Ham next weekend, given Burnley's goal difference is so much worse than Forest's.\n\nLuton is third from bottom and now three points behind Forest. As it stands, the three teams that were promoted last season are going straight back down to the Championship.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes and Alexander Isak all scored for Newcastle, which climbed above Manchester United and into sixth place in its bid to qualify for Europe. Newcastle could even catch Tottenham, which is four points further ahead in fifth ahead of its trip to Liverpool on Sunday.\n\nMan United visits Crystal Palace on Monday.\n\nSheffield United was already sure of being relegated before playing Forest, which came from behind through a double from Callum Hudson-Odoi that came either side of Ryan Yates' goal.\n\nIn the other match Saturday, Brentford and Fulham drew 0-0.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Gary O'Neil has done an excellent job with the Wolves this season, but their campaign looks to be ending in mid-table after a brief flirtation with European qualification.\n\nThe Wolves beat City 2-1 in September, but Pep Guardiola's side was without the suspended Rodri for that game, and he will be in the engine room on Saturday.\n\nWith just one point separating Arsenal and City going into the weekend, goal difference could be a deciding factor. Arsenal are currently seven better than their closest rivals, there will be no taking the foot off the gas even if a win has been sealed.\n\nLiverpool's title hopes look to have vanished amid poor recent results and stories of bad-feeling between Jurgen Klopp and Mohamed Salah. It has to hope the top two drop points and beat Tottenham, who travel to Anfield after three consecutive defeats look to have spoiled their chances of overtaking Aston Villa and climbing up to fourth.\n\nVilla travel to face Brighton, whose season is in freefall with no wins and only two goals scored in their last six matches, as rumours continue over possible future destinations for coach Roberto De Zerbi.\n\nAvoiding relegation and hopes of a place in Europe go head-to-head when Burnley entertain Newcastle United, with the home side now only two points behind 17th-placed Nottingham Forest after a run of just one defeat in eight games.\n\nConfidence is high at Burnley after drawing away to Manchester United, but Newcastle will be a tough rival as they look to move into sixth place, with top scorer Alexander Isak in frightening form with seven goals in his last six games.\n\nUnited have a difficult away game against a Crystal Palace side with ten points from the last 12 under new coach Oliver Glasner, and Palace's pacy attack could have fun against United's sometimes slapstick defending.\n\nChelsea's 2-0 win at home to Tottenham on Thursday gives them a slight chance of qualifying for Europe, but first, they have to navigate an always-feisty London derby at home to West Ham.\n\nLuton will move out of the bottom three if they win at home to Everton on Friday night. Everton have nearly ensured their survival after three consecutive wins, but off-pitch financial issues continue to cloud their future, with rumours of possible administration on the horizon.\n\nIf Luton win, that would lift them above Nottingham Forest ahead of Forest's must-win visit to already-relegated Sheffield United, with the home side captained by 20-year-old Oliver Arblaster, the only bright spot in an otherwise grim season for the Blades.\n\nThe remaining game this weekend is a southwest London derby between Brentford and Fulham, who have only local pride to play for.", "source":

Pep Guardiola has insisted that Arsenal \"will win\" the Premier League title if his Manchester City side drop points in any of their remaining three matches.\n\nThe Citizens extended their unbeaten run in the top flight to 20 games after putting Wolverhampton Wanderers to the sword 5-1 at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening.\n\nErling Haaland stole the headlines with four goals, including a first-half hat-trick, before substitute Julian Alvarez added a fifth in the closing stages to seal three important points for the reigning champions.\n\nGuardiola's side remain second in the Premier League table but have moved back to within one point of leaders Arsenal, who beat Bournemouth 3-0 on home soil earlier in the day.\n\nMan City crucially still have a game in hand and will be crowned champions for a record fourth successive season if they with their final three games, but Guardiola has claimed that Arsenal will come out on top if his side slip up at any stage heading down the home straight.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nPep Guardiola sends title message to Man City players\n\nGuardiola has suggested that Mikel Arteta's side have a slight advantage in the title race as they boast a superior goal difference - the Gunners' +60 goal difference is six clear of City's +54.\n\nThe Catalan boss has therefore urged his side to take advantage of their game in hand and win all of their remaining fixtures to get the job done.\n\n\"The biggest importance is just two weeks left. Three games. Nine points we will be champions,\" Guardiola told reporters after the victory over Wolves. \"[If we earn only] seven points, six points, three points, Arsenal will win the Premier League.\n\n\"Goal difference is not possible, we cannot draw. The way Arsenal have been playing has been so good and consistent. It's three games, hopefully we win the first and the second and arrive to the third with our Premier League destiny in our own hands.\n\n\"You see the result 5-1 [today] but I don't have the feeling that was really good,\" Guardiola added. \"We lost a lot of balls, simple ones. With teams that make high pressing we can run with Phil [Foden], Kevin [De Bruyne], Julian [Alvarez]. I give a lot of credit to Wolves, the patterns they have. Hwang [Hee-chan], [Matheus] Cunha were always dangerous.\"\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nWhere could Man City drop points in the title run-in?\n\nMan City have been formidable on home soil and their win over Wolves has seen them extend their unbeaten run at the Etihad to 43 games - a new club record surpassing the 42-match streak set between December 1919 and November 1921.\n\nHowever, the Citizens must now prepare for two away fixtures in London, starting off with a trip to Fulham next Saturday before locking horns with Tottenham Hotspur three days later.\n\nMan City will be confident of success against Fulham as they have won each of their last 12 Premier League meetings, including their last five at Craven Cottage.\n\nSuccess at Spurs has not been so easy for the Citizens, though, as they have only won one of their previous six visits to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, which opened in 2019.\n\nCity lost their first five games without scoring away against Spurs at their new stadium, but that miserable run came to an end in January when Nathan Ake scored the only goal in a 1-0 victory in the FA Cup fourth round.\n\nGuardiola and co will conclude the season at the Etihad with a clash against West Ham, whom they have beaten in each of their last seven home meetings by an aggregate score of 15-4.\n\nID:542941:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect5653:No Data Analysis info", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_thomas@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Oliver Thomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Manchester_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "City of Manchester Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournemouth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craven_Cottage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craven Cottage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/18/pep-guardiola.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Premier League 2023-24: Tottenham Hotspur's Champions League Hopes Hit Further by 2-0 Loss Against Chelsea.\n\nArsenal and Manchester City are the two favourites in the title race, with Liverpool five points behind Arsenal and four behind City, reported Xinhua. League leaders Arsenal are at home on Saturday lunchtime to Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth, who have already beaten their record for Premier League points tally. Bournemouth usually press high and like to attack in numbers, which could leave them exposed to Arsenal's mobility in attack, and with Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz in excellent form, a home win looks the most likely result. Three points for Arsenal would put pressure on Manchester City in their Saturday evening match at home to Wolverhampton Wolves.\n\nGary O'Neil has done an excellent job with the Wolves this season, but their campaign looks to be ending in mid-table after a brief flirtation with European qualification. The Wolves beat City 2-1 in September, but Pep Guardiola's side was without the suspended Rodri for that game, and he will be in the engine room on Saturday. With just one point separating Arsenal and City going into the weekend, goal difference could be a deciding factor. Arsenal are currently seven better than their closest rivals, there will be no taking the foot off the gas even if a win has been sealed.

It has to hope the top two drop points and beat Tottenham, who travel to Anfield after three consecutive defeats look to have spoiled their chances of overtaking Aston Villa and climbing up to fourth. Villa travel to face Brighton, whose season is in freefall with no wins and only two goals scored in their last six matches, as rumours continue over possible future destinations for coach Roberto De Zerbi.\n\nAvoiding relegation and hopes of a place in Europe go head-to-head when Burnley entertain Newcastle United, with the home side now only two points behind 17th-placed Nottingham Forest after a run of just one defeat in eight games. Confidence is high at Burnley after drawing away to Manchester United, but Newcastle will be a tough rival as they look to move into sixth place, with top scorer Alexander Isak in frightening form with seven goals in his last six games. Marco Reus to Leave Borussia Dortmund at the End of Bundesliga 2023-24 Season, German Footballer Shares Farewell Message For Fans (Watch Video).\n\nUnited have a difficult away game against a Crystal Palace side with ten points from the last 12 under new coach Oliver Glasner, and Palace's pacy attack could have fun against United's sometimes slapstick defending. Chelsea's 2-0 win at home to Tottenham on Thursday gives them a slight chance of qualifying for Europe, but first, they have to navigate an always-feisty London derby at home to West Ham. Luton will move out of the bottom three if they win at home to Everton on Friday night.\n\nEverton have nearly ensured their survival after three consecutive wins, but off-pitch financial issues continue to cloud their future, with rumours of possible administration on the horizon. If Luton win, that would lift them above Nottingham Forest ahead of Forest's must-win visit to already-relegated Sheffield United, with the home side captained by 20-year-old Oliver Arblaster, the only bright spot in an otherwise grim season for the Blades. The remaining game this weekend is a southwest London derby between Brentford and Fulham, who have only local pride to play for.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

And, the contest for the remaining European qualification positions contains as many as five.\n\nThe Premier League season is down to its last two weeks and there's still plenty at stake from top to bottom.\n\nAlso Read | RCB vs GT, Bengaluru Weather, Rain Forecast and Pitch Report: Here's How Weather Will Behave for Royal Challengers Bengaluru vs Gujarat Titans IPL 2024 Clash at M Chinnaswamy Stadium.\n\nMeanwhile, the second-tier Championship's regular season finishes on Saturday, with a second automatic promotion spot set to be secured.\n\nHere's a look at what's still to be decided:\n\nAlso Read | RCB vs GT IPL 2024 Preview: Likely Playing XIs, Key Battles, H2H and More About Royal Challengers Bengaluru vs Gujarat Titans Indian Premier League Season 17 Match 52 in Bengaluru.\n\nTITLE\n\nThis time, Arsenal vs Manchester City for the Premier League title looks like going down to the wire.\n\nCity took advantage of a late-season collapse by the Gunners to win the league with three matches to spare in the 2022-23 campaign, but an improved Arsenal might last the course this time round.\n\nArsenal leads by a point with three games to go -- against Bournemouth at home on Saturday, Manchester United away and Everton at home.\n\nCity has four games remaining -- at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers, away to Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur, and at home to West Ham United -- and would capture an unprecedented fourth straight title by winning all of them.\n\nThe pressure is on the defending champion to do that because even just a draw could be fatal. Arsenal has a superior goal difference and, as it stands, would win on that tiebreaker if the teams are equal on points.\n\nAway to Tottenham looks to be the toughest match for City, which has yet to win -- or even score -- in four league games at Tottenham's new stadium that opened in 2019. Spurs fans will have mixed feelings about the May 14 game, because a win for their team could hand Arsenal, Tottenham's fierce north London rival, the title.\n\nA trip to Old Trafford is likely Arsenal's hardest remaining fixture. After all, Liverpool -- until recently the other title contender -- saw its season turned upside down after a loss at United in the FA Cup quarterfinals on March 17 was followed by a costly draw at Old Trafford in the league on April 7.\n\nThe Premier League is the only one of Europe's top five leagues where the title race is still bubbling. Germany's Bundesliga (champions Bayer Leverkusen), Italy's Serie A (Inter Milan) and France's Ligue 1 (Paris Saint-Germain) have been decided, while Real Madrid leads Barcelona by 11 points in Spain's La Liga.\n\nEUROPEAN PLACES\n\nArsenal, City and Liverpool are locked for Champions League qualification, with fourth-place Aston Villa likely to join them. Tottenham is isolated in fifth, the reward for which is Europa League qualification.\n\nThe remaining intrigue, then, revolves around which teams finish in sixth and seventh to likely earn a berth in the Europa Conference League.\n\nManchester United, Newcastle and Chelsea are the teams occupying sixth to eighth places and three points separate them with four games left for each. West Ham and Bournemouth have outside shots in ninth and 10th, respectively.\n\nChelsea is in the best form, having lost just one of its last 11 games -- though that was 5-0 at Arsenal.\n\nIf United drops to eighth, the team has a last chance to get into Europe by winning the FA Cup final against Man City a week after the Premier League finishes.\n\nRELEGATION\n\nThe relegation battle looks like it will go to the final day of the season -- and won't just be determined by what happens on the field.\n\nWith last-place Sheffield United already down, three teams are fighting to avoid the two remaining relegation places: Nottingham Forest (26 points), Luton Town (25 points) and Burnley (24 points).\n\nEach team has three games left and, significantly, two of them meet in the final round when Burnley hosts Forest.\n\nForest's current points total is subject to change, however, because the club has appealed against a four-point deduction for breaching the league's financial rules. The result of that appeal should be known before the end of the season, meaning Forest could recover some points based on the views of an independent panel.\n\nIf Burnley and Luton are also relegated, it means the three teams that came up last year lasted just a season before going back down to the Championship.\n\nPROMOTION\n\nThere's one automatic promotion spot up for grabs heading into the final round of games in the second-tier Championship on Saturday.\n\nLeicester City has already clinched promotion and an immediate return to the Premier League. The team will go up as champions. Ipswich Town or Leeds United will join them.\n\nIpswich, which last played in the top flight in 2002, is currently in second place and three points ahead of third-place Leeds, whose American ownership group includes major-winning golfers Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas.\n\nIpswich hosts next-to-last Huddersfield Town, and Leeds is at home to fourth-place Southampton.\n\nThe teams placed third to sixth will compete in the playoffs for the third promotion spot. The playoff final is at Wembley Stadium on May 26.

Gary O'Neil has done an excellent job with Wolves this season, but their campaign looks to be ending in mid-table after a brief flirtation with European qualification.\n\nWolves beat City 2-1 in September, but Pep Guardiola's side was without the suspended Rodri for that game, and he will be in the engine room on Saturday.\n\nWith just one point separating Arsenal and City going into the weekend, goal difference could be a factor and with Arsenal's currently seven better than their closest rivals, there will be no taking the foot off the gas even if a win has been sealed.\n\nLiverpool's title hopes look to have vanished amid poor recent results and stories of bad-feeling between Jurgen Klopp and Mohamed Salah. It has to hope the top two drop points and beat Tottenham, who travel to Anfield after three consecutive defeats look to have spoiled their chances of overtaking Aston Villa and climbing up to fourth.\n\nVilla travel to face Brighton, whose season is in freefall with no wins and only two goals scored in their last six matches, as rumors continue over possible future destinations for coach Roberto De Zerbi.\n\nAvoiding relegation and hopes of a place in Europe go head-to-head when Burnley entertain Newcastle United, with the home side now only two points behind 17th-placed Nottingham Forest after a run of just one defeat in eight games.\n\nConfidence is high at Burnley after drawing away to Manchester United, but Newcastle will be a tough rival as they look to move into sixth place, with top scorer Alexander Isak in frightening form with seven goals in his last six games.\n\nUnited have a difficult away game against a Crystal Palace side with ten points from the last 12 under new coach Oliver Glasner, and Palace's pacy attack could have fun against United's sometimes slapstick defending.\n\nChelsea's 2-0 win at home to Tottenham on Thursday gives them a slight chance of qualifying for Europe, but first they have to navigate an always-feisty London derby at home to West Ham.\n\nLuton will move out of the bottom three if they win at home to Everton on Friday night. Everton have nearly ensured their survival after three consecutive wins, but off-pitch financial issues continue to cloud their future, with rumors of possible administration on the horizon.\n\nIf Luton win, that would lift them above Nottingham Forest ahead of Forest's must-win visit to already-relegated Sheffield United, with the home side captained by 20-year-old Oliver Arblaster, the only bright spot in an otherwise grim season for the Blades.\n\nThe remaining game this weekend is a southwest London derby between Brentford and Fulham, who have only local pride to play for. \u25a0",

There's no sign of an end-of-season collapse by Arsenal this time.\n\nKeeping the pressure on Manchester City, Arsenal beat Bournemouth 3-0 in the lunchtime kickoff Saturday for a fourth straight win in the league.\n\nIt pushed Arsenal four points clear of second-place City, which has two games in hand -- the first of which was against Wolverhampton later Saturday.\n\nLast season, Arsenal's title challenge faded in the spring as a fast-finishing City clinched a third straight league championship with three games to spare.\n\nTwelve months on and the title race is heading into the final week of the season. Indeed, given the form of the top two, it is likely to be decided in the last round of games on May 19.\n\nBukayo Saka converted a penalty in the 45th minute before second-half goals by Leandro Trossard and Declan Rice gave Arsenal victory at Emirates Stadium.\n\nBURNLEY IN TROUBLE\n\nBurnley slipped closer to the drop thanks to its 4-1 loss at home to Newcastle combined with relegation rival Nottingham Forest's 3-1 win at last-place Sheffield United.\n\nIt left next-to-last Burnley five points adrift of Forest, which occupies the place directly above the relegation zone.\n\nBurnley has to win both of its remaining games -- away to Tottenham and then at home to Forest on the final day -- to stand a chance of staying up. Even that won't be enough if Forest avoids defeat at West Ham next weekend, given Burnley's goal difference is so much worse than Forest's.\n\nLuton is third from bottom and now three points behind Forest. As it stands, the three teams that were promoted last season are going straight back down to the Championship.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes and Alexander Isak all scored for Newcastle, which climbed above Manchester United and into sixth place in its bid to qualify for Europe. Newcastle could even catch Tottenham, which is four points further ahead in fifth ahead of its trip to Liverpool on Sunday.\n\nMan United visits Crystal Palace on Monday.\n\nSheffield United was already sure of being relegated before playing Forest, which came from behind through a double from Callum Hudson-Odoi that came either side of Ryan Yates' goal.\n\nIn the other match Saturday, Brentford and Fulham drew 0-0.\n\nSteve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Nottingham Forest moved three points clear of the bottom three with a 3-1 win at Sheffield United, and Brentford and Fulham played a scoreless draw.\n\nHours before City's ruthless victory, Arsenal cleared another hurdle in their hunt for their first league title in 20 years.\n\nA penalty shortly before halftime converted by Bukayo Saka gave Arsenal the lead. Leandro Trossard eased the nerves inside the Emirates with a second goal on 70 minutes and Declan Rice added the third deep into stoppage time.\n\nHaaland -- who boosted his league scoring lead to 25 with the first four-goal haul of his career -- scored from the penalty spot in the 12th minute, then doubled City's lead in the 35th when he headed home at the far post from Rodri's cross\n\n\"We played probably the best first half we've played all season. We could have gone three, four, five easily. We scored one,\" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said.\n\n\"Then credit to Bournemouth they changed things and the game became more open which we wanted to avoid.\"\n\nArsenal next travel to Old Trafford to play Manchester United before hosting Everton on the final day.\n\nIf City felt pressure from Arsenal's win, it did not show as Haaland and the holders ran roughshod over Wolves at the Etihad.\n\n\"Nine (more) points, we will be champions. Seven points, six points, three points, Arsenal will win the Premier League,\" Guardiola said.\n\nHaaland -- who boosted his league scoring lead to 25 with the first four-goal haul of his career -- scored from the penalty spot in the 12th minute, then doubled City's lead in the 35th when he headed home at the far post from Rodri's cross.\n\nThe 23-year-old converted again from the spot just before halftime. Hwang Hee-chan pulled one back for Wolves in the 53rd but Haaland scored his fourth a minute later. Substitute Julian Alvarez completed City's scoring.\n\nGuardiola's team play away at Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur before closing the season at home to West Ham United.\n\nAlexander Isak scored his 20th league goal of the season to lead Newcastle in their romp over Burnley, keeping alive their hopes of playing European football next season.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff and Bruno Guimaraes also got on the scoresheet on a day soured only slightly by Isak's missed penalty.\n\n\"When we're really aggressive and running forward we are a really good team. It's been there in fits and starts this season, but a really good day and something to build on,\" Longstaff told the BBC.\n\nBurnley could have their relegation confirmed when they travel to Spurs next Saturday.\n\nBig step for forest\n\nA brace by Callum Hudson-Odoi helped Forest breathe a little easier as they climbed three points above the drop zone, gaining a crucial lead over 18th-placed Luton Town with two games to go for both teams.\n\nSheffield, already relegated, remained bottom with 16 points.\n\n\"It was a big step for us but it's not over yet,\" Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo said. \"We've still got hard games to play.\"\n\nSheffield took the lead in the 16th minute on a penalty from Ben Brereton Diaz, but the visitors equalised 11 minutes later when Danilo found Hudson-Odoi in the box.\n\nRyan Yates gave Forest the lead with his first ever league goal shortly after the break before Hudson-Odoi fired into the near bottom corner to complete his brace in the 65th minute.\n\nSheffield became the first club to concede 100 goals in a 38-match Premier League season. Swindon Town, who also conceded 100 goals in 1993-94, did so over 42 games.\n\nFulham substitute Raul Jimenez missed a golden chance to settle the West London derby against Brentford in a game of missed chances.\n\nJimenez had been on the field for nine minutes when set up by Adama Traore's cross but, despite having time and space, he sent his 73rd-minute effort sailing over the crossbar.\n\nFulham are 12th in the table, while Brentford are 16th.

City have a game in hand going into the final week, meaning that there will be five Premier League sides capable of having a decisive say in the title race.\n\nThey all have their own motivations in their final matches of the campaign, although some are stronger than others. Ahead of the climax of the season, here are what City and Arsenal's opponents have left to play for.\n\nALSO READ: City are still box office for Premier League despite unresolved charges\n\nALSO READ: I knew Man City wouldn't play me - but I couldn't turn them down\n\nSaturday, May 11, 12.30pm: FULHAM vs City\n\nIf you were picking a side that had less to play for than anyone else, nobody would grumble with Fulham. Marco Silva's side are 13th in the league, safe from relegation but also too far away from hopes of European qualification.\n\nThere is the potential for them to climb four places in the table if they win both of their remaining games (they finish at Luton), and in these PSR-obsessed times the \u00a33.1m per league place that was handed out last season is certainly attractive. However, that will rely on other teams and Fulham's goalless draw at home to Brentford at the weekend did little to suggest that the West London side are pushing for more.\n\nSunday, May 12, 4.30pm: UNITED vs Arsenal\n\nHaving effectively ended Jurgen Klopp's hopes in the FA Cup and Premier League, can United pave the way for City success? Erik ten Hag's side are more than capable of springing a surprise but it would register as that given how much better Arsenal have been in the league this season.\n\nUnited's inability to avoid injuries is continuing into the final weeks of the season with Harry Maguire the latest defender to be ruled out, but they are in the middle of a dogfight for the European qualification spots as Ten Hag looks to prove he is the man for the job. Ahead of their Monday game at Crystal Palace, United are eighth - outside the limit for either the Europa League or the Conference League.\n\nThat trip to Selhurst Park is their game in hand on Tottenham, Newcastle and Chelsea and they could yet catch all of them and finish fifth but, equally, eighth is a very real possibility with their other matches at home to rivals Newcastle and away to the dangerous Brighton.\n\nIn what could end up being Ten Hag's penultimate match at Old Trafford, they won't want to leave the prospect of European qualification resting on their FA Cup final against City.\n\nTuesday, May 14, 8pm: SPURS vs City\n\nSpurs have been in the thick of the top-four race all season but have slumped badly in the final months of the season. They have lost their last four league games in a row, conceding 13 goals in the process, to leave them clinging onto fifth rather than hoping for fourth.\n\nAnge Postecoglou's side can still catch Villa in fourth but even wins in their remaining three games wouldn't be enough if Villa win one of their last two. More realistically, two wins would guarantee fifth spot and four points may well be enough.\n\nSpurs will be looking at their home game with relegation-threatened Burnley on Saturday and trip to relegation-confirmed Sheffield United on the final day of the season for their points needed, although City have never scored a Premier League goal at their stadium since it opened in 2019 and the sooner they can box off European qualification the better. As hard as the players will be trying, some of the fans may not be too disappointed with a City win that hurts Arsenal's chances of silverware.\n\nSunday, May 19, 4pm: Arsenal vs EVERTON, City vs WEST HAM\n\nIf Arsenal can win at Old Trafford they will have full confidence for their final game of the season at home to Everton. They have won 14 of their 18 league matches at the Emirates this season and Sean Dyche's men have nothing left to prove after confirming their place in next season's Premier League.\n\nDyche's men are in good form with three wins and a draw from their last four games and Sheffield United are next up before they head to Arsenal; they will be more keen than most for the extra prize money that comes with finishing higher up the table. However, their position is not as critical as it recently was and won't be as significant as Arsenal's.\n\nWest Ham are in horrible form, with three defeats and a draw from their last four games that has included shipping five goals to both Chelsea and Crystal Palace. It is threatening to turn sour with no clarity on David Moyes's future with the club reportedly lining up his replacement.\n\nRecent form means they are all but out of the race for European football, even with a home game against Luton to come before the final day. Moyes will want to go out with a bang if the Etihad is to be his last match in charge, although he recently cited the absence of Declan Rice as the reason they have conceded so many goals away from home and Arsenal aren't able to loan him back for the last day.\n\nIf the title race goes to the final day, it is difficult to see the lead changing hands unless one of the contenders crumbles under the pressure.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_bajkowski@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name":

The division has already smashed the record for the most goals scored in a Premier League campaign. Last season actually held the previous accolade with 1084 goals, but there have already been 1,096 goals this term with 44 games still left to play. If this term continues with the same scoring rate we have seen so far for the run-in, it's on course for there to be well over 1,200 goals.\n\nWe have been treated to some sensational games of football. Chelsea 4-4 Manchester City, Brighton's 4-2 win against Tottenham, and Manchester United's 3-2 comeback victory against Aston Villa are just some of the enthralling encounters witnessed. There have been numerous games and storylines you simply can't take your eyes off. And the title race looks like it's going to be one of the most thrilling climactic battles in years.\n\nThere's three games to go (four for Man City) and everything to play for. Three teams, who all boast very different qualities will fight it out, although for one team it might be too little too late now. A new look Arsenal currently lead the way, and are vying to win their first title in 20 years under Mikel Arteta, who would become the first ever boss to win the Premier League in his first managerial job. Then come the trophy juggernauts Man City just one point behind with a game in hand. They have won the last three titles under Pep Guardiola, and would become the first ever team to win the English top flight four times in a row if they were to be victorious once again. The 2019/20 champions Liverpool are now five points behind the Gunners, and look all but our of the race, but will still be doing everything possible to help legendary manger J\u00fcrgen Klopp bow out with another Premier League title. Three different, but mesmeric stories could be written over the next few weeks.\n\nArsenal were top of the Premier League for 248 days last season, but ultimately a late capitulation meant they couldn't get over the line in a season where they had been massively overachieving under Arteta. This season they have largely been the chasers. Sloppy points dropped against West Ham and Fulham before the turn of the year left the Gunners behind. However, since the winter break they look right at the top of their game. Arsenal have scored 48 goals and conceded just eight in their 14 league games this calendar year.\n\nArsenal have the best defensive record in the entire Premier League, built around the axis of William Saliba, Gabriel and Declan Rice. They've conceded just 28 goals all season. In the first half of the campaign scoring was an issue, with many believing Arteta's team don't have the natural goalscorer to get them over the line. Although their chance conversion rate has increased drastically in recent months, and it will need to continue in that vein. The North London side also still have a tough away trip to Manchester United to navigate in their run-in, and know even winning all of their remaining fixtures won't be enough if Man City are faultless on their own run-in.\n\nIt's getting to that stage of the season, where everybody knows what to expect from Guardiola's City. Wins, wins and more wins. Last season, the Sky Blues went on a 12 game winning run to wrestle the title from Arsenal. A few years back it was the same story, as they made up a seven point deficit on Liverpool in the 2018/19 season, winning all of their last 10 matches. They are currently a point behind the leaders Arsenal, but with a game in hand are now firm favourites to retain the title. Four wins from four and they are champions again.\n\nTheir title rivals Arsenal and Liverpool (to a lesser extent) however, may take some hope in that Guardiola's team have the worst goals conceded per game rate this season that they have ever had under the Spaniard. That's including Guardiola's first term in charge where Man City finished third. Their recent defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League could also deflate the team. Nevertheless, having the duo of Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland back fit and firing, as well as the potent form of Phil Foden will be radiating fear to City's challengers.\n\nLiverpool have now lost four Premier League games this season - two in the last three games, and have won just one of their five matches. The defeat to Tottenham back in May was mired in controversy after a VAR error denied a Luis D\u00edaz goal. The other at Arsenal slightly more worrying for Liverpool as they were outclassed by the Gunners. However, on the whole, Liverpool have looked closer to their energetic best this season with a rejuvenated midfield after the additions of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai. They've already lifted the first domestic silverware of the season, winning the EFL Cup with a depleted squad.\n\nAfter the news emerged in January that manager Klopp would be stepping down at the end of the season after nine years at the helm, the motivation to win it for the German will be sky high from both the players and the fans. However, their recent implosion which has seen them lose to Atalanta in their Europa League quarter-final, and lose the Meryseyside derby may have some supporters only hoping now rather than expecting.\n\nMan City champions - how the title race would finish based on each managers ppg against remaining opponents\n\nWith the title race so close between three great teams going into the closing stages, there's been lots of talks of supercomputers and algorithms to try and work out who will be Premier League champion come May. And here at Transfermarkt we've decided to weigh in ourselves. Using stats from our database, we have calculated the average points per game ratio of each of the three managers against their seven remaining opponents in the Premier League. Those results leave Guardiola with 2.31ppg against Man City's remaining opponents, Klopp with 2.29ppg against Liverpool's remaining opponents, and Arteta with 2.03ppg against Arsenal's remaining opponents.\n\nWe have then multiplied those numbers by the remaining games each clubs has left (3 for Arsenal & Liverpool and 4 for Man City) and then rounded to the nearest point. It means Man City would take 9 points from the remaining 12 available, leaving them on 88 points. Arsenal would take 6 points from the remaining 9 available, leaving them on 86 points in second. Liverpool would then take 7 from a possible 9 points and finish third with 82 points. It's of course still if's and buts.

On paper, the Citizens and the Gunners should take the three points with relative ease, but any of the visitors could be a banana peel\n\nSeeking to remain within touching distance of Premier League leaders, Arsenal, reigning champions, Manchester City welcome Wolverhampton Wanderers to the Etihad Stadium this evening.\n\nThe Citizens will be out for revenge against the Old Gold after they suffered a 2-1 defeat in the reverse fixture at Molineux almost eight months ago.\n\nThree days after cruising to a statement 4-0 victory at Brighton & Hove Albion, Man City picked up maximum points in Pep Guardiola's 300th Premier League game when they secured a 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest at the City Ground last weekend.\n\nMan City could find themselves four points adrift of title rivals Arsenal at the summit if the Gunners beat Bournemouth in an earlier kickoff today, but the Citizens will then have two games in hand and can reduce the gap at the top to just one point with success over Wolves.\n\nAfter three consecutive away matches, Man City will welcome a return to the Etihad where they have put together an impressive 42-game unbeaten run across all competitions, matching a club record set between 1919 and 1921 - avoiding defeat today would see the Citizens break this record outright.\n\nGuardiola and co, who have also not lost home or away in their last 31 matches in all tournaments will be confident of success against a Wolves side whom they have beaten in seven of their last eight home league meetings, scoring 19 goals in the process.\n\nAfter seven games without a win in all competitions, Wolves edged past relegation-threatened Luton Town by a 2-1 scoreline at Molineux last weekend to boost their chances of securing a top-half finish in the Premier League.\n\nGary O'Neil, who will not be in the dugout after being handed a one-match touchline ban by the Football Association for his conduct after last month's defeat by West Ham United, now sees his side sitting 11th in the Premier League table.\n\nAfter beginning 2024 with a five-game unbeaten run away from home, Wolves have since failed to come out on top in any of their last four matches on the road and they will end the campaign with arguably the two toughest Premier League trips to Man City and Liverpool.\n\nThe Old Gold have lost 18 of their last 20 Premier League away matches against teams in the top two, but one of those victories during this run was at Man City (0-2) in October 2019. They are also one of only three top-flight teams to condemn the champions to defeat this season, so there is reason for O'Neil's men to be confident of pulling off an upset today.\n\nMeanwhile, bidding to temporarily go four points clear at the top of the Premier League standings, Arsenal kick off today's action with the visit of Bournemouth to the Emirates Stadium for the lunchtime kickoff.\n\nThe Gunners staved off a second-half Tottenham Hotspur fightback in an enthralling 3-2 North London derby win last weekend, while the Cherries hit Brighton & Hove Albion for three without reply.\n\nPainful flashbacks to the capitulations of 12 months ago crossed the minds of Gooners last Sunday, where after Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and a Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg own goal gave them a seemingly unassailable 3-0 lead over Tottenham, their bitter foes came roaring back.\n\nDavid Raya and Declan Rice's blunders allowed Cristian Romero and Son Heung-min to threaten an almighty turnaround, but the latter's penalty ultimately came too late for the Lilywhites to salvage anything from the heated derby, as Arsenal just about emerged unscathed from that five-goal classic.\n\nThanks to their latest victory in a game that Saka admitted his side may not have won last year, Arsenal have retained their vulnerable one-point advantage over Manchester City, but owing to the champions' game in hand, perfection may still not be enough to end their 20-year title drought.\n\nWith Liverpool more or less out of the race, though, it is a nerve-jangling straight shootout for glory between Mikel Arteta and his erstwhile employers, who do not play again until evening and will therefore fall further behind the Gunners if the Emirates giants make it four top-flight wins on the bounce this weekend.\n\nSix of Arsenal's seven Premier League home matches in 2024 so far have ended in triumph, the outlier being April's alarming 2-0 loss to Aston Villa, and on the back of being on the right end of a 3-2 scoreline versus Tottenham, it is only appropriate that Arsenal reunite with Bournemouth after last year's Emirates extravaganza.\n\nSafely marooned in mid-table as the campaign enters its dying embers, Bournemouth followed up their 1-0 beating of Wolves with an emphatic South Coast success against Brighton, where one of Andoni Iraola's attacking marksmen stole the show.\n\nLeaving the relegation dogfight well and truly behind, Iraola's men are smack-bang in the middle of the standings in 10th spot on account of gleaning 48 points - their highest-ever Premier League total and European qualification remains a mathematical possibility with just three games left to go.\n\nThe work of Iraola and his coaching staff will not go unnoticed either way, but Bournemouth were demolished 4-0 by Arsenal on home soil back in September and blew a 2-0 lead in this fixture last March, where Reiss Nelson's 97th-minute winner sparked perhaps the wildest celebrations the Emirates has ever seen.", "source": {"uri": "thisdaylive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THISDAYLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Even that won't be enough if Forest avoids defeat at West Ham next weekend, given Burnley's goal difference is so much worse than Forest's.\n\nLuton is third from bottom and now three points behind Forest. As it stands, the three teams that were promoted last season are going straight back down to the Championship.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes and Alexander Isak all scored for Newcastle, which climbed above Manchester United and into sixth place in its bid to qualify for Europe. Newcastle could even catch Tottenham, which is four points further ahead in fifth ahead of its trip to Liverpool on Sunday.\n\nMan United visits Crystal Palace on Monday.\n\nSheffield United was already sure of being relegated before playing Forest, which came from behind through a double from Callum Hudson-Odoi that came either side of Ryan Yates' goal.\n\nIn the other match Saturday, Brentford and Fulham drew 0-0.\n\nSteve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer\n\nArsenal's Bukayo Saka celebrates after scoring his side's opening goal during the English Premier League soccer match between Arsenal and Bournemouth at Emirates Stadium in London, England, Saturday, May 4, 2024.

Their win over the Cherries on Saturday handed them a six-goal cushion in terms of goal difference over City, but the Gunners will still need to 'win-out' and hope that Guardiola's men drop points in their final three matches of the season in order to have a chance at winning the title.\n\nAs for Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool, a torrid rut in form over the past few weeks has seen their title hopes all but dashed with just two wins in their last five - including a 2-0 Merseyside derby loss to Everton at Goodison Park - condemning them to an almost-guaranteed third-place finish in the German's final season in charge at Anfield.\n\nAhead of Arsenal's vital clash with a struggling Manchester United side on Sunday afternoon, Bettingexpert.com's supercomputer, BETSiE, ran it's algorithm to predict how the 2023-24 Premier League title race will pan out. The probability model - which takes into account all match results from last season (across all competitions), pre-season results and the current season - projects the title race based on both pre-season expectations and xG earned both for and against during the season.\n\nWith the supercomputer simulating the Premier League season 100,000 times, the Gunners were given a 44.9 percent chance to win the league title from this point on while Man City's winning probability stands at 55.1%. The final projected table sees Man City sat on an average of 88.7 points while Arsenal finished on an average of 87.8 points, meaning the title race went down to less than a single point.\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal title boost emerges after Manchester City goal difference reality eases fears\n\nREAD MORE: Mikel Arteta admits new Arsenal approach to referees amid Kai Havertz and Bukayo Saka verdicts\n\nThe supercomputer still has Arsenal finishing with a better goal difference than Man City, but in real life, the Gunners will need them to drop points for that to have an impact on how the title race finishes - a scenario which the supercomputer predicts won't happen.\n\nWith trips to Fulham and Tottenham before a home game against West Ham as their final match of the season, it's certainly possible for Guardiola's side to simply win all three and lift their fifth consecutive Premier League title but Arsenal boss Arteta is still insisting his side will be the ones to lift the trophy at the end of the season.\n\nWhen asked how he's feeling ahead of their final two matches of the season with the title race still in the balance, he admitted: \"Very excited. We've done it for nine and a half months now. There's two weeks to go, we really want to get it done.

From there, Arsenal did not look back and they added a second through Leandro Trossard with 20 minutes remaining on the clock.\n\nMan of the match Declan Rice completed the scoring deep into stoppage time with a close-range effort as Arsenal moved four points clear at the top of the Premier League. Following the early kick-off, football.london has taken a look at the remaining fixtures which shall decide the title race.\n\nArsenal's fixtures\n\nManchester United (A) - Sunday, May 12\n\nA trip to Old Trafford is never easy but the Gunners will fancy their chances considering how inconsistent Erik ten Hag's men have been this season. However, you only have to ask Liverpool fans to know that United could put up a staunch challenge to upset Mikel Arteta's men.\n\nEverton (H) - Sunday, May 19\n\nUltimately, if Arsenal need a result on the last day of the season they should get it against Everton. The Toffees are already safe and will have nothing left to play for other than pride at the Emirates Stadium that day.\n\nREAD MORE: Arteta's post-Bournemouth press conference\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal player ratings vs Bournemouth\n\nManchester City's fixtures\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers (H) - Saturday, May 4\n\nAfter the Arsenal victory today, City will have a little added pressure heading into this clash. However, you would still expect them to win considering Wolves' poor form recently.\n\nFulham (A) - Saturday, May 11\n\nOn paper, this also looks straightforward but don't be fooled. Marco Silva's side will be looking to put on a show for their fans in their last home match of the campaign and Pep Guardiola will no doubt be wary of this.\n\nTottenham Hotspur (A) - Tuesday, May 14\n\nThis will be earmarked as Arsenal's best chance of City slipping up. They have a terrible record away at Tottenham and while Ange Postecoglou's side won't want to hand out a favour to Arsenal, they may need to considering their Champions League hopes are fading.\n\nWest Ham United (H) - Sunday, May 19\n\nLike Arsenal, City will be confident that if they need to win on the last day of the season they will do so at home. West Ham could be out of European contention by then and the Blues very rarely slip up at the Etihad Stadium.", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_flintham@football.london", "name": "Jack Flintham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Bournemouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AFC Bournemouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Havertz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kai Havertz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leandro_Trossard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leandro Trossard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emirates Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Manchester_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City of Manchester Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29113860.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2151410610.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 895, "textEnd": 901}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 1202, "textEnd": 1208, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 1606, "textEnd": 1611}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 1818, "textEnd": 1824}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 2080, "textEnd": 2086}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Nottingham Forest moved three points clear of the bottom three with a 3-1 win at Sheffield United, and Brentford and Fulham played a scoreless draw.\n\nHours before City's ruthless victory, Arsenal cleared another hurdle in their hunt for their first league title in 20 years.\n\nA penalty shortly before halftime converted by Bukayo Saka gave Arsenal the lead. Leandro Trossard eased the nerves inside the Emirates with a second goal on 70 minutes and Declan Rice added the third deep into stoppage time.\n\n\"We played probably the best first half we've played all season. We could have gone three, four, five easily. We scored one,\" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said.\n\n\"Then credit to Bournemouth they changed things and the game became more open which we wanted to avoid.\"\n\nArsenal next travel to Old Trafford to play Manchester United before hosting Everton on the final day.\n\nIf City felt pressure from Arsenal's win, it did not show as Haaland and the holders ran roughshod over Wolves at the Etihad.\n\n\"Nine (more) points, we will be champions. Seven points, six points, three points, Arsenal will win the Premier League,\" Guardiola said.\n\nHaaland -- who boosted his league scoring lead to 25 with the first four-goal haul of his career -- scored from the penalty spot in the 12th minute, then doubled City's lead in the 35th when he headed home at the far post from Rodri's cross.\n\nThe 23-year-old converted again from the spot just before halftime. Hwang Hee-chan pulled one back for Wolves in the 53rd but Haaland scored his fourth a minute later. Substitute Julian Alvarez completed City's scoring.\n\nGuardiola's team play away at Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur before closing the season at home to West Ham United.\n\nAlexander Isak scored his 20th league goal of the season to lead Newcastle in their romp over Burnley, keeping alive their hopes of playing European football next season.\n\nCallum Wilson, Sean Longstaff and Bruno Guimaraes also got on the scoresheet on a day soured only slightly by Isak's missed penalty.\n\n\"When we're really aggressive and running forward we are a really good team. It's been there in fits and starts this season, but a really good day and something to build on,\" Longstaff told the BBC.\n\nBurnley could have their relegation confirmed when they travel to Spurs next Saturday.\n\nA brace by Callum Hudson-Odoi helped Forest breathe a little easier as they climbed three points above the drop zone, gaining a crucial lead over 18th-placed Luton Town with two games to go for both teams.\n\nSheffield, already relegated, remained bottom with 16 points.\n\n\"It was a big step for us but it's not over yet,\" Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo said. \"We've still got hard games to play.\"\n\nSheffield took the lead in the 16th minute on a penalty from Ben Brereton Diaz, but the visitors equalised 11 minutes later when Danilo found Hudson-Odoi in the box.\n\nRyan Yates gave Forest the lead with his first ever league goal shortly after the break before Hudson-Odoi fired into the near bottom corner to complete his brace in the 65th minute.\n\nSheffield became the first club to concede 100 goals in a 38-match Premier League season. Swindon Town, who also conceded 100 goals in 1993-94, did so over 42 games.\n\nFulham substitute Raul Jimenez missed a golden chance to settle the West London derby against Brentford in a game of missed chances.\n\nJimenez had been on the field for nine minutes when set up by Adama Traore's cross but, despite having time and space, he sent his 73rd-minute effort sailing over the crossbar.\n\nFulham are 12th in the table, while Brentford are 16th. Both teams have two matches remaining.\n\n(Reporting by Lori Ewing; Editing by Christian Radnedge)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They were 4-0 winners at the Vitality Stadium earlier in the season, and will now look to do the double.\n\nManchester City will host Wolves at the Etihad Stadium, as they aim to keep up their winning run of form.\n\nThe Citizens secured a 2-0 win at Nottingham Forest to stay within touching distance of Arsenal, and boasting a game in hand, will go on to lift a fourth straight league title should they prevail in their remaining league fixtures.\n\nStanding in their way is a Wolves side that they have beaten in six of the last seven meetings, though the one defeat came earlier in the season at the Molineux. However, with City at home and with much to play for, it will take an almighty effort for Gary O'Neill's side to derail their title charge.\n\nBurnley and Newcastle United clash at Turf Moor, with both teams eyeing the points for different reasons.\n\nBurnley are 19th on the table, two points from safety and picked up a crucial point in a 1-1 draw with Manchester United last time out.\n\nThey face a tough task against Newcastle though, who they have picked up just two wins in the last 14 games.\n\nThe Toon Army are firmly in the race for Europa League qualification, and having thumped Sheffield United 5-1 in the last game, with star man Alexander Isak netting twice, will now look to secure back to back wins.\n\nBrentford will hope to improve their 16th place standing in the league when they host Fulham at the Gtech Community Stadium.\n\nWith just a point keeping them out of the relegation zone, Nottingham Forest will head to Bramall Lane to face an already relegated Sheffield United outfit in a game that could have catastrophic results if they lose.\n\nOn Sunday, Liverpool will target a return to winning ways when Tottenham make the trip to Anfield.\n\nThe Reds' title push seems to have come to a halt after a poor run of results, with the latest being a 2-2 draw against West Ham. That has left them five points behind leaders Arsenal, with just three games left to play.\n\nThey will seek to end the season strong nevertheless, and what better way to start than beating a Spurs outfit who secured a win at Anfield earlier in the season in controversial circumstances.\n\nAnge Postecoglu's men have lost their last two league games, both London Derbies to Arsenal and Chelsea, shipping in five goals in the process. Prior to the win at Anfield earlier in the season, which ended the Reds' 12 game unbeaten in this fixture, the Lilywhites had not prevailed in the previous four. The odds are stacked against them going into this.\n\nBrighton will hope to end a dreadful run of form which has seen them go six games without a win when they tackle Aston Villa at the Amex Stadium. Villa lie fourth, seven points clear of Tottenham in the race for Champions League football, but come into this on the back of a disappointing 4-2 loss to Olympiakos in the Europa Conference League on Thursday. With the return leg due to come next week, the Lions will have to focus on picking up points here first.\n\nChelsea will take on West Ham at Stamford Bridge, as their push for a European spot gains momentum. The Blues are unbeaten in their last four home games and have won seven of their last 10 matches.\n\nA victory here will see them go level on points with sixth placed Man United, who are not in action until Monday.\n\nWest Ham are two points behind the Blues and were 3-1 winners when they faced off at the London Stadium earlier in the season.

(Danny Lawson/PA via AP)\n\nThe Premier League title race looks to be going to the wire. There's no sign of an end-of-season collapse by Arsenal this time.\n\nKeeping the pressure on Manchester City, Arsenal beat Bournemouth 3-0 in the lunchtime kickoff Saturday for a fourth straight win in the league.\n\nIt pushed Arsenal four points clear of second-place City, which has two games in hand -- the first of which was against Wolverhampton later Saturday.\n\nLast season, Arsenal's title challenge faded in the spring as a fast-finishing City clinched a third straight league championship with three games to spare.\n\nTwelve months on and the title race is heading into the final week of the season. Indeed, given the form of the top two, it is likely to be decided in the last round of games on May 19.\n\nBurnley slipped closer to the drop thanks to its 4-1 loss at home to Newcastle combined with relegation rival Nottingham Forest's 3-1 win at last-place Sheffield United.\n\nIt left next-to-last Burnley five points adrift of Forest, which occupies the place directly above the relegation zone.\n\nBurnley has to win both of its remaining games -- away to Tottenham and then at home to Forest on the final day -- to stand a chance of staying up. Even that won't be enough if Forest avoids defeat at West Ham next weekend, given Burnley's goal difference is so much worse than Forest's.\n\nLuton is third from bottom and now three points behind Forest. As it stands, the three teams that were promoted last season are going straight back down to the Championship.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bramall_Lane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bramall Lane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callum_Hudson-Odoi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Callum Hudson-Odoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burnley F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournemouth", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Luton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wsURVGIUr71oD8LIwUb0cQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/5331df7d18d9fe6ab2ff74642ab0a997", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 1051, "textEnd": 1057}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

The gap at the top therefore remains just one point with Mikel Arteta's side leading the way, but Pep Guardiola's men have the all-important game in hand.\n\nWith just two weeks left to go in the season it is still just the finest of margins separating master and apprentice once more. The attention therefore once again turns to the remaining few matches.\n\nArsenal travel to Manchester United next week in a huge game. Erik ten Hag's men are still trying to hold onto their spot in the top six, as well as eyeing up an unlikely chance of sneaking into fifth. There is still plenty to play for there, and United love nothing more than getting one of their rivals.\n\nManchester City face Fulham before then taking on Tottenham in the game in hand.

That's exactly what Manchester City did against Wolves but Liverpool fans might say, 'Get used to it!'\n\nAs the fourth and fifth goals went in at the Etihad Stadium the reality became glaringly clear and suddenly you look back on where points might have been accrued. Be it the injustice of Villa Park, whether the ball did indeed go out of play against Newcastle United and West Ham, or the flukiness of Chelsea's two goals at Stamford Bridge and Jorginho's gift against Tottenham.\n\nYet, when you realise Arsenal have taken 43 of a possible 48 points in 2024, you realise just how vast the challenge is to beat Pep Guardiola and his club. Taking the title race to the last day, which Arsenal will guarantee occurs should they beat Manchester United, would be a greater push for the league than they managed last year.\n\nThere remains reason for optimism in the final three matches that City have to play. First comes Fulham, which remains one of the arenas for the most disappointing Arsenal performance of the season.\n\nYet, the Cottagers still needed to come through on the day and Marco Silva's side have managed to take five points off the Gunners this season. This giant-humbling of course gives reason to believe they could indeed complete another against City in just under a week's time - that said it's probably best not to look up how Fulham faired the last time the two met if you'd like to maintain that said optimism.\n\nThen comes... Tottenham. Yes, Arsenal's title hopes could rest on their bitter North London rivals securing an unlikely result against City in North London.\n\nREAD MORE: What Ben White did at corners against Bournemouth as Arsenal advice takes effect\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal vs Bournemouth highlights: Rice, Trossard and Saka score after multiple VAR dramas\n\nHas there ever been a time when the red half of the City has wanted Spurs to avoid defeat more? Probably not, but equally has there ever been a time Tottenham have wanted to see their own side win less? Again, probably not.\n\nYet, Tottenham remains one of the historically trickiest tests that remains for City. They've managed to surrender many points to Spurs despite, prior to this season, having a far comfier time against the Gunners and the hope is they give up just two more.\n\nThe last chance is on the final day with West Ham United travelling to the Etihad Stadium. Striker Michail Antonio has already said that he expects the Gunners to win it if it does go all the way to the final fixture.\n\n\"If it goes down to the last day, I reckon Arsenal wins it,\" he said. \"Last game of the season, we [West Ham] have something to play for as well, we're trying to get into Europe, Man City away.\"\n\nHowever, the reality is that the Hammers might not have anything to play for as European qualification looks incredibly unlikely. Still, behind Arsenal, West Ham have taken the most points off 'Big Six' sides this season with Wolves, but less said about the latter the better.\n\nThey say it is the hope that kills you... but if Man City have taught us anything it is that they simply don't slip up. There remain reasons for optimism and for now, we shall cling to that.", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_canton@football.london", "name": "Tom Canton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tottenham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorginho_(footballer,_born_December_1991)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jorginho (footballer, born December 1991)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Manchester_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "City of Manchester Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villa Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_White_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben White (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North London derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournemouth", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leandro_Trossard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leandro Trossard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michail_Antonio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michail Antonio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29115176.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-vs-Manchester-City--Mikel-Arteta-Pep-Guardiola.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Arsenal beat Bournemouth 3-0 in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off before the Blues, a few hours later, responded with a 5-1 thumping of Wolves at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nErling Haaland casually helped himself to four goals, taking his tally of league goals for the season to 25, to ensure the Gunners' lead at the top was reduced to just one point. Both sides are refusing to ease off the gas as the finish line approaches.\n\nREAD MORE: City player ratings vs Wolves as Erling Haaland shines\n\nREAD MORE: Erling Haaland brutally cuts down Roy Keane with cutting 13 word response\n\nDespite Arsenal's one-point advantage, the elephant in the room remains City's game in hand. Whatever Arsenal do in their two remaining fixtures against Manchester United and Everton, City are guaranteed to win a fourth successive title if they win each of their three remaining matches.\n\nCity travel to Craven Cottage to face Fulham on Saturday lunchtime before returning to the capital for their game in hand against Tottenham Hotspur three days later. They will then bring their league campaign to a close at home to West Ham on May 19.\n\nOn current form, you would be brave to bet against City winning all of their last three games. Guardiola's side have won each of their last six league outings, plundering 24 goals in the process.\n\nAs part of that sequence, City have scored four goals or more in five of their last six, only taking a step back against Nottingham Forest at the City Ground just over a week ago to record a routine 2-0 win. Despite that, the Blues are now within one goal of matching Arsenal's goal tally of 88.\n\nFurthermore, City's hunger for goals in recent weeks has moved them to within six of matching Arsenal's goal difference; the Londoners currently boast a tally of plus 60 while City's currently stands at plus 54.\n\nThe highest points tally Arsenal can achieve is 89, provided they win their two remaining fixtures; City can reach a maximum of 91 with three wins from their last three games. However, there is a chance both sides could finish level pegging on 89 apiece, should City win two and draw one of their last three.\n\nIn that scenario, the winner of the title will be decided on goal difference, meaning City's recent glut of goals could prove decisive in their quest to retain their crown. The Blues have scored four goals or more on eight occasions in the Premier League this term, achieving that particular feat five times since the March international break.\n\nWith that particular statistic in mind, City have hit top gear at just the right time, threatening to blow just about everyone they come into contact with out of the water. And when you add Haaland's tally of seven goals in his last four league games to the mix, it strengthens City's case all the more.\n\nNothing can be guaranteed in football, not least at this stage of the season, but City are in an excellent position to add another Premier League title to their collection, even if Arsenal retain pole position for now.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_smith@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "George Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Manchester_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "City of Manchester Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Keane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roy Keane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournemouth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craven_Cottage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craven Cottage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Ground", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "City Ground"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29118036.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2151448908.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 1384, "textEnd": 1390}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

fourth bottom Nottingham Forest took a giant step towards survival with a 3-1 win against already-relegated Sheffield United.\n\nGonzalo Montiel brought down Ben Brereton Diaz and the Blades forward picked himself up to lash in the 17th minute penalty.\n\nBut Callum Hudson-Odoi grabbed Forest's equaliser in the 27th minute with a superb strike that curled into the far corner.\n\nRyan Yates slammed in Forest's second from close-range after 51 minutes and Hudson-Odoi curled home in the 65th minute.\n\nThat gave the Blades an unwanted record as the first club to concede 100 goals in a 38-match Premier League season.\n\nSwindon were relegated in 1993-94 after allowing 100 goals over 42 games.\n\nForest, awaiting the result of their appeal against a four-point deduction for financial

It was important win, obviously, and fantastic to score four goals.\n\n\"It was a difficult game. They can play football so it was not easy but we were solid and we're on a mission.\n\n\"Now focus on the next one. I'm confident but we have to keep going, we have to push and focus.\"\n\nHavertz won't rest in title chase\n\nKai Havertz insisted he will not rest in pursuit of Arsenal's first Premier League crown in 20 years.\n\nThe Gunners' 3-0 win over Bournemouth on Saturday was sealed by goals from Bukayo Saka, Leandro Trossard and Declan Rice.\n\nHavertz won the spot-kick which Saka slotted home to break the deadlock and the German forward is relishing the pressure of the run-in.\n\n\"I really enjoy every second,\" he said. \"Sometimes I feel like I don't even want to have a day off because you're just so excited for the weekend and really want to work with the team.\n\n\"You want to try to get everything out of us to be better prepared and we do that every single day.\"\n\nArsenal blew an eight-point lead over City to gift the title to the Manchester club last season.\n\nBut they have shown few signs of nerves this time, winning four in a row to keep City at bay for now.\n\n\"It's going to be two tough games. We have a lot to play for, we have to win those games and then see where we're going to go,\" Havertz said.\n\nTottenham defence destroys Champions League dream\n\nTottenham are still mathematically alive in the battle for a top-four finish thanks to Aston Villa's 1-0 defeat against Brighton, but a 4-2 defeat at Liverpool realistically ended their hopes of Champions League qualification.\n\nAnge Postecoglou's men have now conceded 13 goals in losing their last four matches and still have the might of Manchester City to face in one of their final three games.\n\nThe collapse is part of a wider worrying trend for the Australian manager after a brilliant start to his reign in north London.\n\nSpurs picked up 26 points in the first 10 games of the season. But since then, they have won just 32 more in the following 24 matches.\n\nPostecoglou has remained steadfast that he will not alter his attacking brand of football.\n\nBut his side have been easily picked off in recent weeks with the same defensive deficiencies exposed.\n\nA poor season for Chelsea, Newcastle and Manchester United had opened the door for Tottenham to return to the Champions League stage.\n\nInstead, it looks like Villa will snap up those riches despite suffering a late season stumble of their own with just two wins in their last six.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com",

Gunners supporters know all too well about that.\n\nSpurs have all but lost their chance of a top-four finish after a 13th goal in the last four matches was conceded at Anfield as Liverpool won 4-2. Of course, their match against Manchester City on the penultimate match of both club's respective seasons is the one which rightfully Arsenal will want to see their rivals come away with something.\n\nHowever, the build-up to this game has been about whether Spurs would have something to play for. With Villa nearly out of sight now in the Champions League race, that desire is clearly not one to hang on to.\n\nHowever, many who have been committing Arsenal football fan blasphemy with their want of a Tottenham victory or two can now look at the table gleefully. Their form combined with that of Newcastle United and Chelsea means that Europa League qualification is suddenly in peril.\n\nAll three clubs have played 35 games and have three remaining, with Newcastle within four points of Tottenham and Chelsea within six. Spurs are at home to Burnley this weekend, a side who are in desperate need of a win and have done well to stay in the race for survival by picking up some unlikely points along the way.\n\nChelsea meanwhile have Nottingham Forest and Newcastle have Brighton. After this weekend's games, should Spurs lose and their top six rivals win, they have a significant reason to win their own penultimate match.\n\nREAD MORE: Triple Arsenal title boost hope remains as Man City face unlikely Premier League challenge\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal title boost emerges after Manchester City goal difference reality eases fears\n\nThat game is against Manchester City. Suddenly Arsenal supporters have the wry smile back on their faces knowing their rivals have the incentive to beat their own title opponents in north London.\n\nSo fear not Arsenal supporters, your hope for the title and dislike for your bitter rivals can co-exist this weekend.

before hosting Everton in what they hope will be a potential title clincher on May 19.\n\nBurnley's hopes of avoiding relegation suffered a huge blow as Newcastle ran riot at Turf Moor.\n\nVincent Kompany's second bottom side are five points from safety, with only two games left to avoid an immediate return to the Championship after last season's promotion.\n\nCallum Wilson put Newcastle ahead with a 19th minute tap-in and Sean Longstaff doubled their advantage in the 35th minute, sliding in to finish off Jacob Murphy's pass.\n\nBruno Guimaraes made it three in the 40th minute with a

was involved again when his shirt was tugged by Josh Brownhill, earning a 50th minute penalty that Arijanet Muric saved to deny Alexander Isak.\n\nSweden striker Isak made amends five minutes later when he converted Murphy's pass for his 20th league goal this season.\n\nDara O'Shea's 86th minute header was no consolation for bedraggled Burnley.\n\nAt Bramall Lane, fourth bottom Nottingham Forest took a giant step towards survival with a 3-1 win against already-relegated Sheffield United.\n\nGonzalo Montiel brought down Ben Brereton Diaz and the Blades forward picked himself up to lash in the 17th minute penalty.\n\nBut Callum Hudson-Odoi grabbed Forest's equaliser in the 27th minute with a superb strike that curled into the far corner.\n\nRyan Yates slammed in Forest's second from close-range after 51 minutes and Hudson-Odoi curled home in the 65th minute.\n\nThat gave the Blades an unwanted record as the first club to concede 100 goals in a 38-match Premier League season.\n\nSwindon were relegated in 1993-94 after allowing 100 goals over 42 games.\n\nForest, awaiting the result of their appeal against a four-point deduction for financial breaches, are three

Conspiracy theorists will say that United would much prefer Arsenal to win it than Man City.\n\n'Tottenham are obviously not going to want to see Arsenal win the league. Then, you start to question footballers' integrity, are they actually going to try, and I've had so many people asking me, well Tottenham are not going to want to try too hard and hand the title to Arsenal.\n\n'I've been in that position as a player, on the last day of the season. But your integrity as a player is questioned all the time.\n\n'But you want to win!

City control their own destiny in the title race, even as they do not lead the standings, sitting a point behind Arsenal -- it's their game in hand which sees City given the advantage, as their maximum possible points are two higher than the Gunners.\n\nWith just four games remaining in the chase, City must win to keep Arsenal at bay, with the Gunners holding a significant goal differential advantage of seven. Any dropped points would allow Mikel Arteta's side a window in for a late triumph at City's expense.\n\nWolves sit 11th in the table and have little to play for, and it's shown, as their standards have slipped over the last month. They finally ended a seven-match winless run with a 2-1 victory over relegation-threatened Luton Town, but have overall been poor of late, with little natural motivation at hand.\n\nThey do sit as one of just four clubs to beat Man City outright this season, and playing spoiler in the title race would certainly be motivation enough, but it's tough to simply turn the switch back on after having been on the beach for so long.\n\nUSA: Click here to see the latest odds for Man City vs Wolves and bet Premier League matches\n\nMan City have been incredibly consistent down the stretch of seasons under Pep Guardiola, losing just four times in the final six matches of the season under the Spanish boss across his previous seven years in charge. In that time, they've won 33 matches and drawn five, giving him a fantastic 79 percent win rate.\n\nIf you narrow that even further to just the games across the final six fixtures in seasons which Man City won the title, but it was not yet mathematically clinched, Guardiola has won 18 games while drawing just one and losing two -- and in one of those defeats, the title was confirmed shortly after anyways thanks to outside results.\n\nThere's a feeling of inevitability about this title chase, and Wolves are just another club in the way of Guardola's Thanos-like grip on the Premier League. Add in the extra motivation for revenge from the reverse fixture, and this match can only end one way.\n\nOf the three title contenders, Arsenal have been strong in the first half, looking to build and hold a lead, while Liverpool have been second-half warriors, looking as if they've played with fire one too many times. The only side of the three to prove consistent across both halves is Man City, who have the most regular distribution of goals through the first and second 45 minutes of play.\n\nCity this season have scored 41 percent of their goals in the first half, which is right in the middle of the pack for Premier League clubs. Arsenal have scored 46 percent of their goals before the break, just two percentage points off the most in the league (Nottingham Forest, Chelsea, and Aston Villa all tied), while Liverpool have scored a whopping 66 percent of their goals after the break, the wildest second-half distribution in the English top flight.\n\nWolves, for their part, are wildly skewed towards the second half like Liverpool from a goal scoring perspective, but from a concession standpoint they are more evenly distributed, and should be ripe for the picking throughout the match. There's a bit of danger in this selection that one Wolves goal could ruin a half, but with Man City to score in both halves at -175, that would be better for a parlay, while there's far more value in this selection as a standalone pick.\n\nAnnoyingly, the betting market has finally caught up to Phil Foden, sporting minus goal scorer odds for the first time this season. The England star missed the last match against Nottingham Forest due to an illness, and has been in and out of the lineup in Premier League play thanks to Guardiola's decision to leave him largely to the Champions League until their elimination.\n\nBut when Foden is in, he's feasted upon Premier League opponents -- he's scored multiple goals in each of his last two appearances, bagging a hat-trick against Aston Villa and a brace against Brighton. In fact, expand it to all of 2024, and Foden has struck for multiple goals in four of the five Premier League games in which he's scored at all.\n\nThe 23-year-old scored against Wolves last year and has two goals against the club in five appearances. He was a creative force in the defeat earlier this season, but with Erling Haaland struggling for goals, Foden has put those duties aside and become a much more potent finisher towards the latter half of this season.\n\nThis important Premier League match in the larger picture of the title race will be televised in the United States on NBC, with the match also streamed on NBC's dedicated service Peacock. There is also a Spanish-language broadcast available on Telemundo.\n\nBoth NBC and Telemundo can be found streaming on Fubo, who are offering a FREE trial for new users.\n\nDomestically in the UK, this match will be televised on Sky Sports platforms.

It's three games, hopefully we win the first and the second and arrive to the third with our Premier League destiny in our own hands.\n\n\"You see the result 5-1 [today] but I don't have the feeling that was really good,\" Guardiola added. \"We lost a lot of balls, simple ones.....\"\n\nIt was nice of him to throw Arsenal fans a little crumb by saying City are not playing well (after winning 5-1!) but seriously folks, do we still harbour our slim hopes that City will slip up?\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans.

Forty-three home matches unbeaten now, the longest run ever produced by a Manchester City team. The previous best had stood for 123 years.\n\nDavid Silva watched on with his family, a first return to the Etihad Stadium since leaving without a proper farewell during the pandemic. He wasn't the only great to have sourced himself a ticket for the run-in, though, with Arjen Robben down in the City dressing room after this victory.\n\nRobben played under Guardiola at Bayern Munich, once laughing at how the manager called him at all hours to discuss work, and made sure he congratulated City's squad for dispatching Wolves and keeping the pressure on Arsenal.\n\nThe thought of prime Robben cutting in from the right in this City team is scary; how both he and Silva must wish they operated in behind Erling Haaland when he is in this kind of mood.\n\nAnd City are in the mood, 24 goals in their last six league games since a drab draw against Arsenal that seemed to hand the title advantage over to both the Gunners and Liverpool. Now it's in City's hands and, given the way in which Wolves appeared beaten from the off, Arsenal will be praying that they are not relying on favours come the last day.\n\nManchester City look in the mood in the Premier League run-in after battering Wolves 5-1\n\nCity legend David Silva was in the crowd for the game on his belated return to the Etihad\n\nPodcast All episodes EPISODE 83: Listen to the latest episode of 'It's All Kicking Off!'

Although winning there in the FA Cup four months ago broke their hoodoo, City have still yet to score a Premier League goal at the new stadium.

He is adamant Arsenal will not drop further points, predicting that they beat Manchester United and Everton.\n\nIf that transpires then Spurs and Fulham are the games, they are the title race.\n\nThe away record is improved this year, City chalking up 37 points from 17 games - one more than all of last season - but these are two grounds where they were made to work. Julian Alvarez dug out a wonder goal to seal a win at Craven Cottage in the run-in, while Spurs have always had something over them.\n\nIt's by no means done but come out the other side of those and Arsenal will be left needing an unlikely snooker or two.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjen_Robben", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arjen Robben"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Manchester_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "City of Manchester Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North London derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craven_Cottage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craven Cottage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentford_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brentford F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/05/11/84475145-0-image-m-93_1714905494896.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

season after Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.\n\nGordon was involved again when his shirt was tugged by Josh Brownhill, earning a 50th minute penalty that Arijanet Muric saved to deny Alexander Isak.\n\nSweden striker Isak made amends five minutes later when he converted Murphy's pass for his 20th league goal this season.\n\nDara O'Shea's 86th minute header was no consolation for bedraggled Burnley.\n\nAt Bramall Lane, fourth bottom Nottingham Forest took a giant step towards survival with a 3-1 win against already-relegated Sheffield United.\n\nGonzalo Montiel brought down Ben Brereton Diaz and the Blades forward picked himself up to lash in the 17th minute penalty.\n\nBut Callum Hudson-Odoi grabbed Forest's equaliser in the 27th minute with a superb strike that curled into the far corner.\n\nRyan Yates slammed in Forest's second from close-range after 51 minutes and Hudson-Odoi curled home in the 65th minute.\n\nThat gave the Blades an unwanted record as the first club to concede 100 goals in a 38-match Premier League season.\n\nSwindon were relegated in 1993-94 after allowing 100 goals over 42 games.\n\nForest, awaiting the result of their appeal against a four-point deduction for financial breaches, are three points ahead of third bottom Luton, who drew 1-1 with Everton on Friday.\n\nWest London rivals Brentford and Fulham shared a dour 0-0 draw.\n\nsmg/dj",

Erik Ten Hag's side have had a mixed campaign but caused Liverpool to drop four points this season and will still be fighting to secure Europa League football for next season when they host the Gunners.\n\nGuardiola is not counting on United getting a result though, making clear that nothing less than a perfect end to City's final three games will do: \" \"Nine points, we will be champions,\" he said. \"Seven, six, or three points [and] Arsenal will win the Premier League.\"\n\nALSO READ: Man City player ratings vs Wolves as Erling Haaland and Rodri\n\nALSO READ: What Erling Haaland did before and after fourth City goal should worry Arsenal\n\nDespite the big win over Wolves on Saturday evening, Guardiola saw plenty that could be improved from their performance in the 5-1 victory. However, he was delighted to see Erling Haaland look back to his best after a difficult season that has been significantly disrupted by injury.\n\n\"He was injured, an important one,\" said Guardiola. \"He's so tall.

Man City take on Wolves at the Etihad later in the day.\n\nLiverpool are now well and truly out of the running after only managing a 2-2 draw at West Ham last Sunday. And it's now a case of Arsenal hoping Manchester City slips up on the title run-in.\n\nGood luck there.\n\nAs for the race for fourth place, Spurs look to have blown it after their 2-0 away loss to Chelsea on Thursday.\n\nAt the bottom, Sheffield United are gone, and it's two from three out of Nottingham Forest, Luton Town and Burnley.\n\nNuno Esp\u00edrito Santo's Forest are favourites to beat the drop. But Burnley is the in-form team, statistically.\n\nHowever, Forest fans might feel they have some momentum after their impressive performance against Man City last Sunday.\n\nThis weekend, we've picked out a Saturday treble that returns \u00a367.01 from a \u00a310 bet. Add our two Sunday selections, and the five-fold pays \u00a3366.04.\n\nThe accumulator can be placed with any of our top football sites for Premier League betting.\n\nBurnley have had a real go at staying in the Premier League in recent weeks.\n\nVincent Kompany's team are now in with a real chance of claiming 17th place after a run that has seen them lose only once in their last eight.\n\nThe match against Newcastle on Saturday could be pivotal for the Clarets.\n\nNewcastle also have plenty to play for. A top-six finish could offer a route into Europe for Eddie Howe's team next season. So a win is vital for the Toon Army.\n\nDespite all the doom and gloom, Newcastle will travel to Turf Moor in good form, having won three of their last four. Their form isn't as bad as you would be led to believe.\n\nWe believe they will put a serious dent in Burnley's survival chances by leaving the northwest with all three points.\n\n\u26bd Back Newcastle to win at 19/20 with bet365 \u26bd\n\nThe inevitable happened last weekend, and relegation was confirmed for Sheffield United after another woeful performance. This time away at Newcastle, where they lost 5-1.\n\nUnited have scored in seven of their last eight games. They have also conceded in all eight.\n\nNottingham Forest managed 14 attempts on goal against Man City last Sunday. City only managed eleven.\n\nThe Reds may well be stronger at home. But this is a must-win match against hapless opposition.\n\nWe feel that with relegation now confirmed for the Blades, they may play with a bit more freedom. Which probably means more goals at both ends of the pitch.\n\n\u26bd Back both teams to score and over 2.5 goals at 10/11 with bet365 \u26bd\n\nMan City will likely have Phil Foden and Erling Haaland available to start this weekend.\n\nFoden missed last Sunday's 2-0 win over Forest, and Haaland made a goal-scoring appearance from the bench.\n\nAs for Wolves, their 2-1 win over Luton ended a run of six Premier League games without a win.\n\nIt looks set to be a short respite for Gary O'Neil's team.\n\nManchester City looks in the mood, and with 19 goals in their last five Premier League matches, we expect Pep's team to make light work of the Midlands club.\n\n\u26bd Back City (-2) to win on the handicap at 4/5 with bet365 \u26bd\n\nAdd the following two bets from Sunday's fixtures to make it a five-fold acca.\n\nVilla suffered a dismal result against Olympiacos at Villa Park on Thursday night.\n\nThey can't dwell on that. They now know that only a top-four finish will bring Champions League football next season, and with a match against Liverpool to follow, Unai Emery will be targeting three points on the south coast.\n\nWe were tempted to go with Villa to win at odds of 29/20.\n\nBut the Villans have conceded too many of late. So instead, we are going for the in-form Ollie Watkins to score at 13/10.\n\nWatkins was on the scoresheet against the Greeks on Thursday, and in the reverse fixture this season, the former Brentford striker scored a hat-trick.\n\n\u26bd Back Ollie Watkins to score anytime against Brighton at 13/10 with bet365 \u26bd\n\nJurgen Klopp's last season at the club is slowly fizzling out into a disappointing one.\n\nHis team now sits five points behind leaders Arsenal and four behind Man City, with the Blues having a game in hand.\n\nIn their last five in the Premier League, Liverpool have only won once. This run has killed off their title chances.\n\nSpurs are also out of form. They have only won one in five and are on a losing skid of three. Champions League football looks gone.\n\nNeither side looks to have much to play for now.\n\nMaybe Spurs might have one eye on the teams behind them. But their six-point gap should be big enough to confirm fifth place.\n\nWe expect to see both teams go for it on Sunday, and there could be plenty of goals on show. We're backing Liverpool to win and over 3.5 goals.\n\nFor help with a gambling problem, call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133 or go to www.gamstop.co.uk to be excluded from all

If both sides win all their remaining matches, it will be the Cityzens who claim a fourth top-flight championship in a row.\n\nGoal difference is currently in Arsenal's favour, boasting +60 in comparison to Man City's +54, meaning a draw from their rivals would be enough to put the north Londoners in the driving seat.\n\nLiverpool can still technically finish top of the pile but would require major implosions from the current top two to reduce the eight-point gap to the summit.\n\nArsenal's next Premier League fixture is a big one, coming away at Old Trafford when they battle Manchester United. The Gunners and the Red Devils were once fierce rivals at the top of the table but Erik ten Hag's side have endured a disappointing campaign and can only finish fifth at best.\n\nArteta's squad then have a week to prepare for their final game of the season at home against Everton, who have recently secured their place in the top flight despite suffering points deductions throughout the campaign.\n\nMan City, however, have three matches left to fulfil. They play a day before Arsenal when they visit Fulham at Craven Cottage in Gameweek 37 and are then in midweek action with a defining fixture away at Tottenham.

While the boys overcame a determined Nottingham Forest side to narrow the points gap on Arsenal, the girls moved six points clear with victory at Bristol City. And their dream of winning only their second WSL title moved a step closer in midweek when Chelsea Women, the only team that can stop our girls, lost 4-3 at Liverpool.\n\nThe reigning champions still have a game in hand, but, if they drop any more points, they will hand the crown to City. However, the blues need just four points to clinch the title, with Arsenal arriving at the Joie Stadium this weekend.\n\nThe boys are currently one point behind leaders Arsenal, but, crucially, have a game in on their North London rivals. The Blues will need to beat Wolves on Saturday afternoon if, as expected, the Gunners secure three points earlier in the day against Bournemouth.\n\nHowever, just like the girls, if the boys win all their remaining fixtures, it doesn't matter what their opponents do - the title is firmly in their own hands.\n\nGareth Taylor's City side have been a revelation this season. Many questioned whether the Blues had what it takes to launch a serious title bid, with Jill Roord the only signing over the summer.\n\nThe Dutch midfielder played an inspirational role for the Blues as they emerged as title contenders. When the star was ruled out for the remainder of the season in January, there was a general opinion that would end City's title aspirations.\n\nBut City have since gone from strength to strength, winning their following nine WSL matches, including a 1-0 victory in a hard-fought match at Chelsea. City have been able to adapt without Roord, something that Taylor's teams of the past were unable to do. usually, they would be left wanting without the influence from the middle of the park, but they have found a way to not only cope, but flourish.\n\nAnd the fact that City hit four last Sunday without Bunny Shaw shows a resilience that hasn't been seen since the days of Nick Cushing. And it's that resilience that has taken the Blues to the brink of the WSL title and victory against Arsenal on Sunday will all but secure a top-place finish.\n\nIt will be an unprecedented fourth straight Premier League title for Manchester City if they hold off the challenge from Arsenal. To do that, they need to overcome tough matches at home to Wolves and last day fixture against West Ham, with two trips to London sandwiched in between.\n\nFulham and Spurs are waiting to dent City's title hopes. Fulham, safe from any threat of relegation, have nothing to play for but a place as high up the table as possible, while Spurs are aiming for the Champions League.\n\nAnd the faithful will be more concerned about the match in North London than West. City scored their first goal at Spurs' new stadium in their FA Cup clash in January and no doubt Arsenal will be hoping their city rivals will keep another clean sheet against the Blues just when they need it.\n\nHowever, the Gunners need to go to Old Trafford in their final away match and, given how the Stretford Rangers denied Liverpool all three points, that could be the match that decides the season.\n\nBut, as we've said, all City need to do is to win their remaining games and, along with the girls, they will ensure that both league titles will be bound to the blue side of Manchester for the first time.\n\nDestiny is in their own hands.

Manchester City are hot on Arsenal's heels in the Premier League title race, while at the other end of the table, Burnley and Luton Town look resigned to their fate. After months of moaning about referees, Nottingham Forest have finally got their act together, with their survival all but guaranteed if they beat Chelsea next Saturday.\n\nSpeaking of the Blues, perhaps it's time for Todd Boehly to put his faith in Mauricio Pochettino. For all the chaos, they are starting to look like a team again, even if they only have an outside chance of qualifying for European football next season. It's just a shame that it has taken them this long to figure it out.\n\nAs for Ivan Toney, his goal drought continues after Brentford drew a blank at home to Fulham, but Thomas Frank probably isn't too bothered because they, like their west London neighbours, are already on the beach.\n\nScroll down for our verdict on every team (listed in table order).\n\nThe Premier League's latest VAR disasterclass may have hogged the limelight after Arsenal's win over Bournemouth, but as questionable as some of the decisions were it should not detract from what was another highly polished performance from Mikel Arteta's side.\n\nIt was a particularly good day for three of Arsenal's summer signings. Kai Havertz won a penalty (admittedly in controversial fashion) and dominated Bournemouth's centre-back pairing from the first minute until the last, Declan Rice boosted his tallies for both goals and assists in the second half, and David Raya claimed another clean sheet to secure the Golden Glove award.\n\nBetween them, that trio cost in the region of \u00a3200m and there was no shortage of accusations that Arsenal had overpaid for both Rice (\u00a3105m) and Havertz (\u00a365m).\n\nThe \u00a330m fee for Raya which will be triggered upon the completion of his loan deal at the end of this season was the least scrutinised deal with that price influenced by his contractual situation at Brentford.\n\nNobody is debating the value of those deals now. Rice was the game's best player despite having a mixed first half in which he failed to make the most of a counter-attack and missed a golden chance to open the scoring.\n\nHe made amends in the second half with a glorious eyes-in-the-back-of-his-head assist for Leandro Trossard (another inspired recent buy) and a goal that summed him up to a tee: a crisp finish following a lung-busting run into the box in the 97th minute of the game with Arsenal already 2-0 up.\n\n\"Declan Rice, we got him half price,\" might be pushing it, but he has justified that nine-figure fee during his debut season. By Oliver Young-Myles\n\nRead more: The \u00a3200m trio showing Arsenal have learnt from their Sven Mislintat mistake\n\nManchester City\n\nMissed penalties have already cost Manchester City dearly this season but, as Erling Haaland continued his mastery of the spot-kick art with two against Wolves, statistics suggested that will not happen again over the closing days of the title race.\n\nThe Norwegian, who missed the penalty shoot-out defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League last month, took his tally for the season to eight out of nine penalties, 16 of 18 for his City career, and a conversion rate of a super-elite 89 per cent.\n\nInterestingly, until Haaland's arrival, penalties had been a problem for Pep Guardiola's side - 27 misses in his seven seasons before this - with an average conversion rate ranging from a low of 62.5 per cent to a high of 78.5.\n\nConsidering the \"industry standard\" is 85 per cent, and the Premier League this season hitting 88.5, this is a rare area in which Guardiola's team has proved sub-par on his watch.\n\nNow? Not so much. City, as a team, have scored 12 of 13 this season - Haaland's miss against Sheffield United the only one - and a conversion rate of 92.3 per cent is, by a long way, the best ever by a Guardiola City team.\n\n\"Having mental strength is a skill as well,\" Guardiola said. \"And the people say 'oh the penalty shooting is down to luck.' No it's not.\n\n\"If you are a good taker you have a better chance, if you are a good keeper you have a better chance and Erling is, of course, going to miss penalties, but everyone know he is a good taker. He thinks I am going to take a penalty, I am going to score. It's his confidence. That's right.\"\n\nHaaland's unflappable nature extended off the field following the 5-1 win, with a post-match interviewer gamely trying to elicit a response when he suggested the recent quotes from Roy Keane, labelling him a \"League Two\" striker, must serve as an inspiration.\n\n\"I don't really care that much about that man, so that's all right,\" Haaland said. \"The boys have been through this many years -- the club also. I've got experience from last year, it's about focusing on game by game.\"\n\nGame by game is how City and Arsenal must take the concluding fortnight of the campaign, with five left in total - three for City, two for Arsenal.\n\nFor many weeks now, the two combatants, plus Liverpool, have had their kick-off times staggered by television demands, although Guardiola has cut through talk of mind games or advantages of going first or last with some very simple maths.\n\nArsenal, he says, will win their remaining two games which means City must do likewise.\n\n\"Today we arrived here and the players knew if we don't win, ciao, ciao, bye bye, next season we see each other! It's not complicated. It doesn't matter if it's before or after,\" Guardiola said.\n\n\"Since the winter break, the way they [Arsenal] are playing. It's not the fact that they are winning, it's the way they play, so you smell that they are not going to lose in the games they have left. They are not going to.\" By Ian Whittell\n\nLiverpool\n\nIn recent days Jurgen Klopp has seemed like a politician who has just conceded defeat in an election, suddenly more at ease with the world, more accepting of his fate. Summing up the slow fade of Liverpool's title challenge in his programme notes, Klopp remarked: \"We just need to be ourselves.\"\n\nIt has been a long while since Liverpool were themselves at Anfield. You would have to go back to the 4-1 rout of Chelsea at the end of January to find a game when Liverpool were last so often what they have been under Klopp; imperious, thrilling and inventive. It was the first Premier League game after Klopp's announcement he would be leaving Liverpool at the finish of the season. There are just two more matches left and, though it may not end with the league title, the long goodbye should finish with a flourish.\n\nIt matters not at all that Tottenham were terrible. They were a side challenging for the Champions League, a name, albeit one that had won a single league fixture at Anfield since 1993. Within an hour, Liverpool were four goals up and Mohamed Salah, who at West Ham last week had turned very publicly on his manager, was playing the kind of football he has not done since being injured in the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nThere are those who argue that Liverpool missed a trick by not shipping out a 31-year-old forward the moment Saudi Arabian clubs started offering \u00a3250m. However, Salah is central to Liverpool in a way that Steven Gerrard, Kenny Dalglish and Kevin Keegan once were. He is the only member of this Liverpool side to have his own banners on the Kop and the sublime touches and cushioned assist for Andrew Robertson's goal were indications that they will be fluttering for a while yet.\n\nAnd yet, 4-0 up, Liverpool relaxed. Salah managed to miss from a yard, Trent Alexander-Arnold tried to score from the halfway line and Spurs did score twice. The tension lifted to such an extent that it resembled a benefit game to the extent that you half expected Robbie Williams or the cast of Gavin and Stacey to come trotting on.\n\nIn September 1978 a freshly-promoted Spurs came to Anfield and were thrashed 7-0 in a way that Manchester City would have thrashed this Tottenham side, if only because goal difference might just decide this title. They will not get that close yet, as Klopp fist-pumped towards the Kop, it was in the knowledge that, just in time for the last hurrah, he has got his Liverpool back. By Tim Rich\n\nAston Villa\n\nCriticising Unai Emery's tactics this season feels a little churlish but the Aston Villa manager will surely be ruing his decision not to have made more than two changes to the side that suffered such a damaging defeat at home to Olympiakos on Thursday evening.\n\nAt Brighton, his team looked sluggish from the outset and barely threatened an out-of-form side throughout the 90 minutes. It may have taken Joao Pedro's late goal to defeat them but the Seagulls ought to have been out of sight long before then.\n\nThat said, a glance at Villa's bench suggests that there were limited options available to him with six first-team regulars missing through injury.\n\nEmery said: \"Today we lost and we didn't deserve more. We competed and we tried to stop them.\n\n\"They created more chances than us and they were dangerous. Today we needed the goalkeeper and he was here. Robin Olsen he was fantastic.\n\n\"Now the most important thing is to try and recover players. The most important thing now is rest. Thursday is now more difficult for us against Olympiakos but we will be there.\"\n\nAfter a bruising week for Villa, Emery repeated again how proud he was of his players for what they have achieved this season. By Tom Prentki\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nTo quote Ange Postecoglou's predecessor as Tottenham manager: \"They don't play for something important; they don't want to play under pressure. It's easy this way. Tottenham's story is this.\" Those remarks in March last year cost Antonio Conte his job but the symptoms he identified are still there.\n\nHaving seen Brighton overcome Aston Villa to keep open the possibility they might yet qualify for the Champions League, Tottenham delivered a performance that was every bit as abject as last month's 4-0 defeat at Newcastle with the proviso that this time they conceded all four goals within the hour.\n\nAt the business end of the season, they have lost four games in a row and failed to overcome anyone in the top half of the table for two months. The real Tottenham is this.\n\nPostecoglou argued that Spurs had played well. Before this game, he said he would rather change personnel than his aggressive tactics. The sight of \u00a3100m worth of Spurs players on the bench tells a story of who might be surplus to requirements, the fact that they played rather more effectively once Richarlison and James Maddison were on the pitch tells another. Scoring twice when 3-0 down to Arsenal and 4-0 down at Liverpool has given Spurs a kind of fig leaf but to try to win game from these kinds of position is like trying to win a grand prix after slashing your tyres.\n\nPart of Postecoglou's appeal has been his acknowledgement that Tottenham is a club that values style. There would not have been that many in the away end at Anfield who would have been alive in 1961 but the words of their Double-winning captain, Danny Blanchflower, that football is about the getting of glory would have had resonance in the years since Tottenham and Liverpool met in a Champions League final.\n\nPostecoglou has gone some way to diffusing the toxic atmosphere created by Conte and Jose Mourinho - Nuno Espirito Santo was not around long enough to make any impression on the players, who found him aloof and diffident. However, it is one thing making Tottenham fun to train with and fun to watch. They are increasingly fun to play against. By Tim Rich\n\nNewcastle United\n\nConsidering they have not won a significant trophy since 1969, the most noticeable feature of Newcastle supporters is their optimism and as they travelled back from Burnley they would have had quite a few reasons to be optimistic.\n\nIt was not just the result but the return of Joelinton for his first league game since New Year's Day, Miguel Almiron's comeback after six weeks out, and Alexander Isak and Callum Wilson playing upfront together for the first time in a year. They will not always be faced by the kind of defence that would gift them the kind of space they enjoyed at Turf Moor. Away from St James' Park, Newcastle have been flat-track bullies.\n\nAston Villa remain the only side of significance they have overcome away from home. Nevertheless, should they beat Manchester United at Old Trafford, where they have won once since 1972, Newcastle might be in the Europa League next season. That, after a season of injury disruption and a few feeble performances, would be counted as a good season. By Tim Rich\n\nRead more: Inside Newcastle's transfer plans - goalkeepers, Gibbs-White and Guimaraes\n\nChelsea\n\nThree weeks ago Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke and Nicolas Jackson were squabbling like schoolkids over who got to take a penalty; this time they united in perfect harmony to create goals for each other.\n\nPalmer swept in Chelsea's first after Jackson's shot from Madueke's cross had been blocked; Conor Gallagher scored the second after another block, this time to deny Madueke from a Palmer pass; number three was a close-range Madueke header; the fourth, straight after half-time, saw Madueke unselfishly square for Jackson to tap in; and Jackson ran through for a fifth that involved an offside flag overturned by VAR.\n\n\"Now we're starting to put everything together, being unselfish and working as a collective,\" said Madueke, whose personal improvement in the last few weeks mirrors his team's. The winger has kept Raheem Sterling on the bench and it is not inconceivable that a full England debut, presumably post-Euros, will follow.\n\n\"The assist from Noni to Jackson showed that we learn, that we are smart,\" said manager Mauricio Pochettino. \"The situation with the penalty, we received too much criticism but young teams always make mistakes. They are starting to feel like a group.\" By Jon West\n\nWhoever takes over from David Moyes at West Ham - and Julen Lopetegui could be forgiven for turning his phone off after this one - his No 1 priority should be selecting a new captain.\n\nIt seems impossible that Moyes, his current contract not so much running out as stumbling chaotically, will still be in charge next season. Not after another complete capitulation, a shipping of five goals for the second time in three games, and a fourth overall this term.\n\nMoyes was quick to point out that the loss of Declan Rice last summer was a big reason why only the bottom three have let in more than the Hammers' 70 goals and counting in league action alone.\n\nBut Rice has equally been missed as their captain: he wore the armband in his final season and before that when long-time leader Mark Noble was not picked.\n\nKurt Zouma is West Ham's current skipper, as poor a choice as Moyes has made in his entire managerial career. The centre-back, arguably more famous for maltreating a cat than for any on-pitch endeavour in claret and blue, had a stinker of a return to his former club.\n\nThat can happen but what did he do on the final whistle? Vladimir Coufal, Jarrod Bowen - unlucky to hit the woodwork three times - and Tomas Soucek made a present of their shirts to young fans who remained in a rapidly-emptying away end. Others went over and clapped but not Zouma. He was first down the tunnel, despite words from coach Kevin Nolan - another former captain.\n\n\"We were lacking toughness, leadership, mental toughness,\" listed Moyes, who had also opted for a quick tunnel exit. \"The manager will always take the responsibility but somewhere along the line the players will have to take the responsibility for not doing their jobs.\" By Jon West\n\nBournemouth\n\nBournemouth could count themselves hugely unfortunate to be on the wrong side of two contentious decisions at key points in the game during their defeat at the Emirates.\n\nKai Havertz initiated contact to win a penalty when the scoreline was level just before half-time and the length of time it took VAR to eventually side with referee David Coote indicated their uncertainty. After holding firm in the face of an unrelenting onslaught it was an unfortunate way to go behind.\n\nWorse was to come later on when at 2-0 down and with 15 minutes to go Antoine Semenyo had a goal that would have set up a nervy finale ruled out for a foul on the keeper by Dominic Solanke. It was a soft decision and one compounded by the lack of a penalty as a consolation after William Saliba clearly impeded Philip Billing.\n\nCredit to Andoni Iraola then for being so measured in his post-match press conference when he reiterated Arsenal deserved to win on several occasions despite big decisions going against his team.\n\n\"First of all, I think I would like to say that I think Arsenal deserved to win today,\" he said.\n\n\"I think they were better than us, especially first half. I think they pushed us a lot, but I don't think the game should have gone the way it has gone because the referee decisions, I don't agree with the decisions.\n\n\"I don't agree with the penalty one, but especially with the disallowed goal.\n\n\"But I want to repeat - I think they were better than us and I think they should have won the game.\"\n\nThat Bournemouth have already secured their highest-ever points tally in the Premier League makes it easier for Iraola to keep his cool, but other managers could certainly take note of his demeanour. By Oliver Young-Myles\n\nRead more: A Vegas gamble and Iraola's culture shift: How Bournemouth made history\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n\nMatheus Cunha led the calls for his Wolverhampton Wanderers teammates to end the season on a high, even if it means ruining Jurgen Klopp's Anfield farewell.\n\nA nervy home win over relegation favourites Luton is Wolves' only victory from their last eight league games, a run that has brought five points out of an available 24.\n\nInjuries have played their part in that run and relegation has long since ceased being a concern for Gary O'Neil's side.\n\nBut, with only a home game against Crystal Palace and Klopp's Anfield farewell on 19 May, to come, the Brazilian international believes a strong finish would set up his side for next season.\n\n\"I think six points would be very important,\" he said. \"It's hard, we play Liverpool and an important game against Crystal Palace at home - we have around the same points, so we need to play and get three points and keep focused.\n\n\"We've done an unbelievable season, but we cannot finish with a bad feeling. We need to win to make it feel like a good season and keep going for the next one.\"\n\nO'Neil watched this game from the stands, serving a suspension for criticising the officiating decisions in a recent defeat to West Ham.\n\nIn the 5-1 loss to City, Wolves conceded two more spot kicks to VAR, although O'Neil was slightly more diplomatic in his analysis this time.\n\n\"The first penalty was a really poor decision, terrible,\" he said. \"The second penalty was right but I was really surprised it was overturned as a clear and obvious error.\n\n\"But officials have no real part in the way the game ended up today. We fell short today and I'm disappointed with how we fell short, because there was a lot of effort and determination, but we made some key errors.\" By Ian Whittell\n\nFulham\n\nBefore qualification for the Europa League, when you had be a champion to enter the Champions League, most clubs' seasons ended like this in a series of dead fixtures that were either chock full of goals or achingly dull.\n\nJournalists used to describe the team as 'being on the beach' because all they seemed to be thinking about was their summer holidays which then were on the Costa Brava but are now in Mykonos or Dubai. Fulham's players are not just on the beach but appear to have fallen asleep on their sunbeds. They followed up last week's insipid draw with Crystal Palace with an even more forgettable London derby with Brentford.\n\nRaul Jimenez, who had not scored since the 2-1 win over Arsenal on New Year's Eve, spurned a glittering opportunity to break the drought. \"It was tough for both sides,\" said the Fulham manager, Marco Silva. It was tougher for anyone who had bought a ticket. By Tim Rich\n\nBrighton\n\nBrighton will feel that this is a season which has slipped away from them. No wins in six games before the visit of Aston Villa and no goal scored since 31 March at Anfield has meant that entertainment has been in short supply for the Seagulls faithful. But Simon Adingra, comfortably the game's best player, provided plenty of it against Unai Emery's side and was a constant thorn in the side of Ezri Konsa who eventually brought him down for the penalty from which Joao Pedro scored at the second attempt.\n\n\"Adingra was the best player for us and anyway, he can improve,\" Roberto De Zerbi said. \"We have to give him the right time to improve, to progress. The most important thing is to be a good guy with the right attitude to improve and he is a smart guy.\"\n\nA top-half finish remains a distinct possibility for Brighton who, like Villa, have been hampered in their Premier League ambitions by a lengthy injury list and midweek European football.\n\n\"We are suffering in the last two months, we are losing too many games and but we have to accept it. Since October we are playing without seven, eight, sometimes ten players. I think we didn't show an amazing game in terms of quality of football but we showed a big attitude.\" By Tom Prentki\n\nEverton's off-field problems may be on a global scale - the lawyers for prospective owners 777 Partners must be the busiest on the planet - but their players, having avoided relegation comfortably in the end, are certainly local heroes.\n\nLiterally in fact as no manager likes to pick Englishmen more than Sean Dyche, who chose nine as starters in Friday night's 1-1 draw at Luton. Indeed, the last 45 instances of that in the Premier League have all been Dyche selections - 41 for Burnley plus four as Toffees manager.\n\nOne is Jordan Pickford of course, with the goalkeeper on 60 caps and counting ahead of the Euro finals. Another is Ashley Young, evergreen at 38, and a man who won his last of his 39 England caps six years ago.\n\nThe rest, though, have either had tastes of the big time handed to them by Gareth Southgate or never made it past the Under-21 stage. Would it be cruel, therefore, to suggest that this makes their places vulnerable to a summer upgrade, should any legitimate owners be in place to finance one?\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin is in fine form at the moment - his goal against the Hatters was his fourth in five games - but persistent injury woes have stalled his international career at 11 caps. Defensive duo James Tarkowski and Ben Godfrey have been capped twice each and it is difficult to see them as anything other than Three Lions fringe men.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite could be the exception to that - the 21-year-old has had an exceptional season and was included in Southgate's most recent squad. It's his first full season in the Premier League though so let's not get carried away.\n\nWould a team of regular internationals do any better? Dyche doesn't seem to think so and with Everton's financial position unlikely to improve significantly any time soon we may never know. By Jon West\n\nRead more: Everton takeover plunged into doubt amid claims 777 is running out of money\n\nBrentford\n\nPerhaps it was significant that the first thing Thomas Frank wanted to talk about after a goalless draw with Fulham was to congratulate Ipswich Town on their promotion to the Premier League.\n\nA politician would have admired the Brentford manager's deflection of an interview because there was not much to say after a game so miserable that the Radio Five commentator suggested it would not just be last on Match of the Day but it would be better if the BBC showed a blank screen. It was not just shown last but after Luton vs Everton, which was on Friday, and a piece on Chelsea's Women's Super League team. That Ivan Toney has now failed to score for 10 straight league games would be a conversation stopper for a manager who hopes to make a considerable profit from the forward in the summer.\n\nIf Frank wanted to squeeze some positives from a forgettable afternoon, he could have pointed out that since the turn of the year at the Gtech Community Stadium, as we must now call the new Griffin Park, Brentford have lost only twice - to Liverpool and Manchester City. He could have added that, if this time next year, Ipswich are safe with two games to spare, that really would be a cause for congratulation. By Tim Rich\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nWith his other club, Olympiakos, beating Aston Villa in the Europa Conference League semi-finals, this was a pretty good week for Evangelos Marinakis. Should Nottingham Forest survive - and the odds are that they will - his gamble of firing Steve Cooper and replacing him with Nuno Espirito Santo will be judged a success.\n\nNuno has improved results but not by very much. His points-per-game score this season is one, compared to Cooper's 0.82. A point a game is usually enough to stay up and even the 31 Cooper was on course for before his dismissal might have been sufficient with two such dreadful teams in the mix as Burnley and Sheffield United - but not with the points deduction. Their first game since Mark Clattenburg's resignation as Forest's refereeing consultant saw them concede a penalty after 17 minutes.\n\nHowever, as their manager pointed out, Forest reacted and, although they rode their luck at times, it was enough. Their final away day of the season at Burnley may have nothing riding on it. Next season will provide a truer test of Marinakis' decision to do away with the manager who took them to the Premier League. By Tim Rich\n\nLuton Town\n\nLuton have given it their best shot and, as looks likely now, will go down with few regrets: Rob Edwards' Hatters have given their passionate fanbase much to cheer this season.\n\nYet there have still been plenty of \"what if?\" moments, not least the game at Bournemouth in March when a 3-0 lead somehow ended up as a 4-3 defeat. It was a similar tale at Newcastle the month before as 4-2 up soon turned to 4-4.\n\nLuton's biggest regret though will be the injury to Elijah Adebayo that sidelined him from 10 February until the end of last month. The striker, on target in his side's 1-1 draw with Everton on Friday in his first start in three months, was on a run of seven goals in 11 games before getting injured, with Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea and Newcastle each failing to stop him. Brighton were steamrollered for a hat-trick.\n\nThe Everton goal was his 10th in the Premier League, joining fellow front-man Carlton Morris in double figures.\n\nAnd to put that stat into perspective, no Premier League debutant duo has managed that since Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's first campaign at Arsenal in 2018. By Jon West\n\nBurnley\n\nIt would be hard to imagine a more disastrous afternoon. Burnley began it having lost just one of their previous eight matches, the last of which was a high-octane display at Manchester United.\n\nThey would be facing a Newcastle side whose away form had been a persistent weakness all season and whose defence would be without Sven Botman, Fabian Schar and Kieran Trippier. If they won, Burnley rather than Luton would have been the likelier to overhaul Nottingham Forest and save themselves, probably by beating Forest at Turf Moor in the last game of the season. It did not quite go to plan.\n\nThe 4-1 thrashing by a side supposedly unable to function outside St James' Park, combined with Forest's rather predictable win at Sheffield United, mean they will now have to win at Tottenham and beat Forest. You would not fancy their chances given that Burnley last scored a goal at Spurs in 2017 and have not won there since 1974 and the days of Leighton James, for whom the flags flew at half mast at Turf Moor on Saturday.\n\nEven then Forest would need just a point from their final two matches to send Burnley down on goal difference. All this assumes Luton do nothing. This is the match that effectively relegates Burnley and the unforced errors and naivety they displayed against Newcastle were a demonstration of why they will be leaving the Premier League. By Tim Rich\n\nSheffield United\n\nBramall Lane used to stage first-class cricket and even once upon a time a Test match. It was fitting that it should once more celebrate a century as Sheffield United became only the second team in the history of the Premier League to concede 100 goals in a season.\n\nLike the first, Swindon Town, Sheffield United will be relegated in last place. The big question is how this will impact United on their well-deserved return to the Championship. Swindon suffered such a toxic shock in the 1993-94 campaign that they were relegated again the season after.\n\nChris Wilder would hope they are better equipped but there is something fundamentally wrong about a side that has kept a single clean sheet in a season.

He started in the FA Cup final win at the end of that campaign. In this period of his career, Maitland-Niles was also able to earn five England caps, but he hasn't featured at international level since 2020.\n\nHis Arsenal career petered out, as loan moves to West Brom, Roma, and Southampton preceded his permanent departure to join Lyon as a free agent in the summer of 2023. In total, he made 132 appearances for the North London club, across all competitions.\n\nAinsley Maitland-Niles shares honest thoughts about Arsenal\n\nIt has been suggested that Maitland-Niles could have maintained his place in the Arsenal setup had he embraced what Arteta wanted of him. However, the Spanish coach was ultimately comfortable allowing the player to leave the Emirates Stadium on a free transfer.\n\nMaitland-Niles is now playing regularly and impressing for the French outfit.\n\nIn conversation with The Athletic, the England man has now expressed his feeling about Arsenal.\n\nHe said: \"It's my boyhood club, I still support them and look out for them. I'm hoping they are going to win the league this year. I'd love to see them do it. I have no envy in my heart at all.\"\n\nWhere Arsenal now stand in the Premier League title race\n\nThe Gunners are currently in the heat of a Premier League title race, and maintained their pace at the top of the table with a 3-0 win against Bournemouth on Saturday. Declan Rice impressed in the middle of the park as Arsenal kept the pressure on Manchester City with this victory.\n\nArteta's side only have two games left to go, with a visit to Old Trafford to take on Manchester United to come next. Meanwhile, Manchester City, who are one point behind Arsenal, have three more fixtures to contend with.\n\nIf Pep Guardiola's reigning champions win all their games then they will retain their crown. However, due to Arsenal's superior goal difference, then just a single draw for Manchester City could hand the North London outfit their first league title since 2004. Maitland-Niles is certainly hoping that things will pan out that way.", "source": {"uri": "arsenalinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arsenal Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_jones@arsenalinsider.com", "name": "Will Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainsley_Maitland-Niles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ainsley Maitland-Niles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Youth system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unai_Emery", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unai Emery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars\u00e8ne_Wenger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Both teams are at home this weekend (Arsenal vs. Bournemouth, Man City vs. Wolves) and will expected to pick up maximum points.\n\nChampions League (4): Arsenal, Man City and Liverpool are confirmed for a top-four finish, leaving one place to be filled.\n\nAston Villa (67, 35) are in complete control of fourth place with Tottenham (60, 34) the only team that can catch them. It could be finalised on Sunday if Villa win at Brighton and Spurs lose at Liverpool.\n\nEuropa League (2): Aston Villa will take the league place if they are overtaken by Tottenham.\n\nSpurs are in a strong position to finish fifth with Manchester United (54, 34) six points behind in sixth. Man United take on Man City in the FA Cup final on May 25 (stream live on ESPN+, U.S. only). If Erik ten Hag's team lift the trophy then they will be in the Europa League (UEL). If City win the cup, then the position transfers to the sixth place in the Premier League -- so it could still go to Man United that way too.\n\nThere's probably three other teams in contention to

but that's also dependent on the FA Cup winners.\n\nIf Man City win the FA Cup then the place in the UECL will drop down to seventh, and it would still be one of Man United, Newcastle, Chelsea and West Ham.\n\nThe UECL place will also drop to seventh if Man United win the FA Cup and finish sixth.\n\nRelegation (3): Four teams look to be fighting it out for one survival place, with three clubs to be relegated.\n\nAn immediate return to the Championship for Sheffield United (16, 35) was confirmed last weekend by their 5-1 loss at Newcastle.\n\nSecond-bottom Burnley (24, 35) still have a chance of avoiding the drop but have a difficult run in, facing Newcastle and Spurs before a possibly huge game at home to Nottingham Forest (26, 35) on the final day.\n\nThird-bottom Luton Town (25, 35) host Everton this weekend and need to start winning games.\n\nForest also await the result of an appeal over a points deduction which could yet change the picture.\n\nLeicester City's return to

Arsenal fans are starting to believe that this is their season.\n\n\"If we draw a game, we're not going to win the Premier League,\" was Pep Guardiola's analysis, reflecting the widespread belief that Arsenal won't slip up from here.\n\nThe pressure is on, then. And Manchester City's remaining fixtures aren't especially easy, not least the first of their final four matches on Saturday evening.\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers beat Man City 2-1 at Molineux back in September with a classic counter-attacking performance that focused on hitting Guardiola's side with fast breaks down both flanks.\n\nMatheus Cunha has been out for a long time with injuries but is back firing now, scoring two goals and assisting another in his last two Premier League encounters.\n\nCunha and Hwang Hee-chan, who scored in the victory over Luton Town last weekend, will be a serious threat on the counter-attack.\n\nHowever, in the reverse fixture it was Pedro Neto (now injured) who led the way for Wolves, while Man City fell predominantly because of Rodri's absence. Guardiola's side are still favourites - but Wolves have what it takes to cause an upset.\n\nBelief among the Arsenal players is sky-high. They have won 13 of their 15 Premier League matches in 2024, only dropping points against teams in the current top four.\n\nHowever, Arsenal have conceded four goals in their last four league encounters, as many as in their previous 11 contests, and if you add in the brief defensive collapse in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League tie against Bayern Munich, you get a slightly different picture.\n\nFew teams are better set up to capitalise on any wobbly behaviour at the back than AFC Bournemouth who, since their first win of the season in late October, have won 45 points from 26 matches with fast, direct, transition-based football.\n\nThey have attempted the most take-ons in the division, with 808. They are top six for passes per defensive action (PPDA), with 10.8, and high turnovers, with 315. And by looking at Opta's graphic below, they are right at the sharp end for \"direct speed\" and \"passes per sequence\", making them the league's fastest and most direct team.\n\nArsenal will expect to control possession and territory at Emirates Stadium, and certainly won't be as cautious against the high press as they were at Spurs, whose pressing game was bypassed with long goal-kicks.\n\nIf Arsenal aren't careful, Bournemouth could provide a shock twist.\n\nLuton Town are running out of time in their bid to avoid relegation.\n\nFor a long time it looked as though the raucous atmosphere at Kenilworth Road would keep them up, especially when Luton looked competitive in every match, but they have won only one of their last 14 in the Premier League, claiming a competition-low six points across that run.\n\nThe 5-1 defeat to Brentford in their last home outing was a new low. Rob Edwards' side need to bounce back immediately - and they've been presented with the perfect opportunity to do so on Saturday, especially with the return of Elijah Adebayo.\n\nEverton are winless in nine away Premier League matches (D3, L6) and they are the lowest-ranked team that Luton have left to play.\n\nBetter still, Luton have already beaten Everton twice this season, winning 2-1 at Goodison Park in both the Premier League and in the FA Cup.\n\nLuton are just about favourites. They need to make it count.\n\nAston Villa have an excellent Premier League record after playing Thursday night European football, winning 24 points from 12 matches so far (W7, D3). Unai Emery has clearly mastered the Thursday-Sunday schedule.\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion, not so much. Since their first UEFA Europa League match in September, Roberto De Zerbi's side have picked up only 32 points from 29 matches (W7, D11), and now sit 12th in the table.\n\nAt the beginning of the season nobody would have expected quite such a sharp contrast between the two teams, and the gap - 23 points - is getting worse over time.\n\nBrighton have lost their last two Premier League matches by an aggregate of 7-0 and have scored a mere three goals in their last seven matches in all competitions, while Villa - and in particular Ollie Watkins - are at their free-scoring best.\n\nWatkins has scored six goals in his four Premier League appearances against Brighton, including a hat-trick in a 6-1 win for Villa in the reverse fixture, and he has been involved in eight goals in his last five Premier League away matches - scoring six and assisting two.\n\nAll the signs point to an away win that would put Villa within touching distance of UEFA Champions League qualification.\n\nKnowing that they are set to be relegated, Sheffield United's players might feel a strange sense of relief. That does tend to happen.\n\nBack in 2015/16, when Villa had eight points at the halfway stage and were down long before their fate was confirmed in mid-April, Joleon Lescott infuriated supporters when he described the feeling of going down as a \"weight off the shoulders\".\n\nBut his comments were misinterpreted. He was right. There is something freeing about the sword finally falling.\n\nRelegated sides have avoided defeat in their first match after their relegation was confirmed on four of the last seven occasions (W3 D1), and indeed it happened to Sheff Utd last time they went down in 2020/21, when they beat Brighton 1-0 immediately after.\n\nChris Wilder will be hoping for a similar reaction. Ending the season on a high could do wonders for their confidence ahead of a promotion push next year.\n\nManchester United's 1-1 draw with Burnley wasn't just typical of Erik ten Hag's second season, it was practically a caricature.\n\nThe visitors poured forward through midfield seemingly at will, exposing enormous holes in the middle of the pitch and counter-attacking at walking pace, or at least that's how it felt.\n\nBurnley managed 39 progressive carries of the ball, the joint-most of any team against Man Utd this season - which is saying something. United have allowed 788 progressive carries in total, the third-most in the division behind Sheff Utd and West Ham United.\n\nCrystal Palace have become highly effective at breaking quickly under Oliver Glasner, with particular focus on the middle of the pitch, where two inside forwards - Michael Olise and Jordan Ayew - are parked behind Jean-Phillipe Mateta in a narrow 3-4-2-1.\n\nWith Palace swarming the middle column, and Casemiro looking overworked here, Palace should get plenty of chances in midfield following a transition. They're likely to put them away, too.\n\nOlise has scored four goals and assisted seven in his last eight home league starts while Mateta has scored seven goals in five matches at Selhurst Park under Glasner.\n\nOnly three players in Fulham's history have hit double figures for Premier League goals in their debut season: Andrew Cole (12 in 2004/05), Dimitar Berbatov (15 in 2012/13), and Aleksandar Mitrovic (11 in 2018/19).\n\nIt's a prestigious list that Rodrigo Muniz will join if he scores one more goal in the final three matches, and facing Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium is perhaps his best chance to do so.\n\nThat's because Brentford have conceded the most headed goals in the Premier League this season (19), accounting for a league-high 32 per cent of their total, while Muniz ranks sixth in the Premier League for most headed shots, with 24.\n\nHis record there probably has something to do with Fulham's crossing ability - they have attempted 684, the fourth-most in the Premier League, and have completed the second-most crosses into the penalty area (89).\n\nIt's obvious what Brentford need to be working on this week.\n\nSo agonisingly close. That's the story of Burnley's season. Wilson Odobert was through on goal, albeit at a tight angle, with the clock on 95 minutes at Old Trafford last weekend but he couldn't find the winner, leaving Burnley with yet another draw; five in their last eight.\n\nIf Burnley are to be within two points of Nott'm Forest when they host them on the final day they surely need to beat Newcastle United on Saturday. Another draw won't do, not with Spurs away the week after.\n\nWith four wins in the last six Newcastle are hardly the ideal opponent, and yet their away record can give Burnley some comfort.\n\nEddie Howe's side have lost eight of their last 11 Premier League away matches, while only 14 of their 53 points, or 26 per cent, have come in on the road, the lowest percentage of any side in the division.\n\nDefeat in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Europa League and faltering form domestically means West Ham have won one of their last nine matches in all competitions, leaving them on the precipice of consecutive bottom-half finishes.\n\nThey are three points above Wolves in 11th at the moment, but defeat at Stamford Bridge would put Wolves and Bournemouth in a strong position to overtake them considering the Hammers have Luton - fighting for their top-flight safety - and Man City in their final two matches.\n\nMoyes has never won an away Premier League match against Chelsea in 18 attempts (D7 L11), and the form guide suggests that isn't about to change. It looks like West Ham's season will end with a whimper.\n\nAs Spurs hunt down Villa for fourth, Liverpool could end up in an unexpected and unwanted battle with the same club.\n\nIf Ange Postecoglou's side win at Anfield this weekend then Liverpool will have won only one of their last six Premier League matches. Jurgen Klopp won't want his ending to be sullied like that - and yet there is more on the line than pride.\n\nShould Villa beat Brighton on Sunday and Liverpool lose, Villa would be five points off third place ahead of the Reds' trip to Villa Park next weekend.\n\nThe thought of finishing fourth, after so recently being in a three-horse title race, doesn't bear thinking about.\n\nA point would seal third. Three would lift Liverpool's spirits significantly and help to ensure their new manager doesn't walk into a gloomy dressing room.", "source": {"uri": "premierleague.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Behold: Haaland with his finest Michael Jordan impression.\n\nNot content with His Airness moment, Haaland added another three goals in City's 5-1 win over Wolves, taking his tally in club football to 200 in five seasons. \"Not bad,\" Haaland said after the game.\n\nIt was another ruthlessly efficient performance from City, with a smattering of Haaland induced magic. What remains so special about Pep Guardiola's side is how they can cross off crucial games in May like they're nondescript outings in October. There's a routine perfection to City at the end of the year. It doesn't matter if other contenders win, if things look tight at the top. They continue to chug along.\n\nWith precious few exceptions, great teams have life cycles. They gain experience, win a lot, age, and get bad. Not City. The depth of their squad is unrivalled. And now their star has returned to form. With three games to go, they're favorites to pick up a fourth title in a row.\n\nPlayer of the week\n\nIn a league full of one-percenters, you're looking for whatever fraction of a percentage can turn an advantage. Leandro Trossard becoming the league's most diverse finisher is one such advantage.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Liverpool's title bid slipped away when Diogo Jota was knocked out of their lineup with an injury. Trossard for Arsenal is what Jota was for Liverpool: a crafty finisher who takes up smart spots in the penalty box. He bagged Arsenal's second in a 3-1 over Bournemouth to help his team keep pace with City at the top.\n\nLike Jota, Trossard scores every type of goal imaginable - and some that are hard to dream up. According to StatsBomb, Trossard has been the most two-footed finisher in the Premier League in the past five seasons. His impact extends beyond goals, though. He does a little bit of everything. He is a magnet to the ball. He makes incisive runs. He's tough to dispossess. He keeps Arsenal's possession ticking along. And then when a chance does open up in front of goal, he's lethal. He is producing more valuable chances this season than Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden and Cole Palmer. He's neck-and-neck with Kai Havertz in shot conversion percentage since the turn of the year, and his post-shot xG - the quality of his finishing - is tied for second in the league behind only Haaland.\n\nTrossard is the walking embodiment of Mikel Arteta's belief that Arsenal are at their best sharing goals around the group. The manager resisted the urge to go all-in on signing a ready-made central striker. Instead, Arteta banked on the development of Declan Rice, Gabriel Martinelli, Havertz, Saka and Trossard to share the responsibility.\n\nIt's worked. The movement of a mobile, amorphous front three has sliced defensive lines apart, carving open opportunities for wide players and midfielders driving into the box. Martin \u00d8degaard (16) and Rice (15) have racked up goals and assists, but it's been Trossard who's provided crucial finishes at the end of the season. He's scored in five of his last eight league games, and scored eight times since the start of 2024.\n\nSaturday was a year to the day that Arsenal surrendered top spot to Man City last season. They have held their own this year. City seem impervious to pressure, but Arsenal are doing their best to push the title race to the final day of the season.\n\nRelegation subplot of the week\n\nThe race for Premier League survival may well be over. Nottingham Forest's 3-1 win over relegated Sheffield United moved them five points clear of Burnley and three ahead of Luton. Burnley were hammered 4-1 by Newcastle on Saturday, which all but guarantees they will play Championship football next season.\n\nWith two games to play, Luton could make up ground. But Forest's goal difference (11 clear of Luton) gives them a crucial advantage. Luton will have to pick up four more points than Forest in their final two games to ensure they stay up.\n\nThe remaining fixtures make that tricky. Forest will host Chelsea and head to Burnley on the final day of the season. Luton have a trip to West Ham and a home game against Fulham left to play.\n\nOn the field, the relegation spots look decided. The three teams that came up last season will probably head back down. The only lingering question: will the Premier League enforce further punishments on either Forest or Everton for violation of the league's profit and sustainability rules? To the courtroom!\n\nStat of the week\n\nLiverpool tore Tottenham apart in the opening hour at Anfield on Sunday, racing to a 4-0 lead. Spurs eventually pulled it back to 4-2, but the damage was already done.\n\nNo one apart from Drake has had a worse week than Ange Postecoglou. Tottenham lost the north London derby, were hammered by Chelsea in midweek and then limped in to a game against Liverpool despite still having an outside shot at picking up a top-four spot and securing Champions League football next season.\n\nPostecoglou is a pass-and-move, high-press zealot, but that has all come tumbling down over the past month. Since the start of April, they've picked up four points, a worse run than anyone except Luton and Sheffield United. They have a minus-nine goal difference in that span, tied for the second-worst in the league.\n\nThat's relegation stuff. Spurs look lifeless with the ball and devoid of a plan once they lose it. On Sunday, Liverpool won possession in the final third eight times in the first half alone - more than any other opening 45 minutes in the Premier League this season, according to Opta.\n\nIt has become a familiar sight for the Tottenham inclined: Spurs can't create any real chances of their own, while conceding a big chance every time they go forward. Liverpool's fullbacks had more touches in the opposition's box than Spurs' entire team had in the first half.\n\nPostecolgou has drawn (fair) criticism for his unwillingness to adapt during games. Like Guardiola and Arteta, Postecoglou wants his side to stick to their principles, to sharply move the ball around, rather than pivot when things are going poorly. His preference is to switch personnel rather than alter his team's style. But adherence to dogma can sink you in tricky games on the road. At Anfield, they were outplayed, outfought and overrun until J\u00fcrgen Klopp made changes in the second half.\n\nPostecoglou has sharpened his teeth over the past week. First, blasting his side on the field against Chelsea, and then taking to a press conference to insist \"change has to happen\" this summer. His players, pushed on to the hot-seat, fighting for a place next season, responded with another dud.\n\nAt some point, inconsistency is no longer a maddening habit holding you back from becoming what you should be. It's who you are.\n\nRough performance of the week\n\nA special mention to Tottenham's Emerson Royal, who was tormented by Mohamed Salah and the right side of Liverpool's attack at Anfield.\n\nHere's a back of the notebook accounting of his day:\n\nLost Salah for Liverpool's opening goal.\n\nHad to be pulled away from his own teammate on the pitch at half-time\n\nGifted the ball to Elliott to set-up Liverpool's third.\n\nPicked up a booking for a foul on Salah.\n\nMissed a headed clearance that wound up with Elliott for Liverpool's fourth.\n\nTaken off after 60 minutes for a central midfielder.\n\nEmerson, a right-winger masquerading as a fullback, was plopped on to the left side of the defensive line to cover for injuries. It was a disaster. It's hard to think of a player who's had a worse individual performance this season.\n\nThe Ned Stark award\n\nWest Ham lost their heads - again - in a 5-0 defeat away at Chelsea. Chelsea were slick in attack, slicing apart a hapless West Ham team. There's a tendency to see such a performance as cutting against the David Moyes grain. This is not what a David Moyes team\u2122 looks like.\n\nYes it is. Moyes's side have become easy to play against. They lose away games in graceless, almost absurd fashion. West Ham have now conceded 70 Premier League goals this season, the worst figure for a Moyes side in a single league campaign and the fourth-worst mark of any team this season. In their last three games, they've shipped 12 goals. Not what you want when your club is jetting in managers to potentially replace you.\n\nThe performance at Stamford Bridge on Sunday was a vintage \"one, two, three ... Canc\u00fan\" display from a team who felt it had little else to play for the rest of the way - save, perhaps, the manager's job.\n\nThe win moves Chelsea up to seventh, one place ahead of Manchester United. Defeat for West Ham leaves Moyes on the outs. Time for Julen Lopetegui to start sizing up the carpets.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But he's honestly not sure.\n\n\"I would like to think yes but we have to prove it tomorrow against Wolves and the next games,\" Guardiola said. \"We know that to win we need all 12 points otherwise it will be difficult because Arsenal are so strong, so consistent.\"\n\nCity have won five straight in the league since they were held to a scoreless draw on the final day of March by the Gunners side that they're chasing. They've outscored opponents 19-4 over that stretch.\n\nAnd while Premier League scoring leader Erling Haaland has battled some minor injuries, he has scored in his past three league matches to boost his total to 21 goals. Guardiola said Haaland is available on Saturday.\n\nAn exit from the UEFA Champions League in a recent quarterfinal defeat to Real Madrid also means City have had a rare full week to focus on Saturday's league task, as they will again before next week's trip to Fulham.\n\nWolves (13-15-7, 46 points) won the teams' previous meeting 2-1 at home in late September. More recently, they look to be at least partially recovered from a rash of injuries that contributed to a six-match winless run that dropped them into the bottom half of the table.\n\nHwang Hee-chan scored his first goal since February in last weekend's 2-1 win against Luton Town. And Matheus Cunha had an assist in only his second start in that span.\n\nWhile Wolves' recent slump has erased any serious possibilities of earning a place in Europe, a top-half finish is still possible.\n\n\"Hopefully we can finish the season strongly because we are in a better position now fitness-wise,\" said Wolves boss Gary O'Neil. \"The group's in a much better place, and it will need to be because it's a fairly difficult test that we face tomorrow.\"", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@sacbee.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Bournemouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Bournemouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matheus_Cunha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matheus Cunha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Hee-chan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hwang Hee-chan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luton_Town_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luton Town F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Table_Tennis/Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Table Tennis/Leagues", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/sacbee/facebook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Then the quality of Liverpool, Arsenal and City shone through to give a high-quality three-horse race that looks like it will go all the way to a photo finish with two.\n\nNo other league is still waiting to crown their champions, with PSG (nine points ahead of second), Inter Milan (18 points), Real Madrid (13 points) and Bayer Leverkusen (15 points) all streets clear of their nearest rivals. If it is drama football fans are looking for, there is only one place to be for the final weeks of the domestic calendar; last weekend saw Spurs nearly manage an improbable comeback against Arsenal before Nottingham Forest rattled City.\n\nThen there are the star names. City boast the FWA Footballer of the Year in Phil Foden and also the biggest brand in the entire Premier League in Erling Haaland - people tune in every week to see the Norwegian because of his explosive potential, as he showed in scoring four against Wolves.\n\nWhile the foundations of their success remain in question, City have undoubtedly become one of the biggest assets the Premier League have for the appeal they provide to individual games and the competition as a whole. It is not a coincidence that five of the six most-viewed games in the previous four seasons have featured the Blues, nor that their home match with Arsenal at the end of March set a new league record for US viewership.\n\nFor every person turned off by watching City play, millions more are tuning in and that is why the Premier League will continue to celebrate one of their biggest brands despite the unresolved charges.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_bajkowski@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Simon Bajkowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0130lkay_G\u00fcndo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FWA_Footballer_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FWA Footballer of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Darts/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Darts/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article29114783.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-2150882241.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

In truth, it does not seem like that long ago people were making their Premier League predictions for the campaign. The dominating favorite to win yet another league title was Manchester City. Now, after a wild season, Pep Guardiola's side is in the driver's seat for the rest of the campaign.\n\nHowever, with each team needing to play three or four games this season, there is still plenty of time for a shake-up to the standings. Could it happen this weekend? Manchester City has a road game at Wolves. The last time City did not win the Premier League was in 2019/20. In that season, Wolves beat Manchester City both home and away, with the win at Molineux setting Liverpool on an impassable path for the rest of the season. Wolves defeated Manchester City earlier this season. If Wolves can do it again at the Etihad, there could be more drama as the end of the season approaches.\n\nThat, of course, assumes Arsenal can maintain form during the run-in to the season's finale. A game against Bournemouth last season had fans dreaming of Premier League riches. That will be the hope at the Emirates again on Saturday. Liverpool is all but out of the title race, and its game against Tottenham has more of an impact on Spurs, which is desperately trying to claw its way back into the top four.\n\nThe relegation race should also be interesting this weekend. A strong run of form from Everton has the Toffees safe in the Premier League barring any more points deductions. Sean Dyche's side may still have a say on Luton's chances in the top flight, though, when the two meet on Friday. Then, on Saturday, Sheffield United, which is going down to the Championship, could pull Nottingham Forest down with it.\n\nIn celebration of this weekend's Kentucky Derby, Rebecca Lowe, Robbie Earle and Robbie Mustoe will do pregame coverage from Churchill Downs in Louisville, KY. Then, on Sunday, it is Paul Burmeister to work alongside Earle and Danny Higginbotham for pregame and postgame coverage.\n\nGOAL RUSH is available on Saturday at 10 a.m. ET. The Premier League whiparound show focuses on one game, but it will show other major moments as they happen from around the grounds. Goal Rush is only available on Peacock.\n\nFinally, there is one game available in 4K this weekend. You can watch Manchester City against Wolves in higher resolution on Saturday.

With the Premiere League on. Last weekend, in particular, saw viewers witness the competition shrink from three strong competitors to just two.\n\nLiverpool's fallow April continued as Jurgen Klopp dropped points against West Ham United, shredding the last shreds of a fairytale farewell, and fell aside. It's now a straight shootout between Arsenal, leading Manchester City by a point, though Pep Guardiola's men have a game in hand. The serial champions have destiny in their hands, whereas, the Gunners could only hope and pray that City slip in one of their four fixtures and grab all nine points they could, leading to a suspenseful climax.\n\nAt the moment may seem, that all the figures are stacked heavily in City's favour. Not just that they have been champions in the past three seasons with a knowhow of how to keep their wits under pressure, not just that they possess late-season invulnerability, but their players raise their game by several notches when the finish-line starts to glimmer in their sight. Guardiola said: \"They like to play with pressure. They know it's dead or alive.\"\n\nThe key difference between this season and the last has been the persistence of Arsenal. Last time, they wilted after their appearance against City. Just one win in four games in April and two defeats in five games in May stalled their title tussle.\n\nCompared to that, Arsenal has put up a braver performance this time around. Arsenal only lost Aston Villa in a match that was costly for their side. As a result, that was their first loss in six games. Speaking on the subject talisman Bukayo Saka said: \"Maybe last season that could have ended in a draw and we showed we have the experience.\" Now, they need to ensure that May is as sweet as April for them.\n\nJumping back to the last season for a second, a 12-match winning streak that spanned from late February to mid-May, combined with the faltering Arsenal, nailed City into the league. This time around, they are on an unbeaten 20-game run in the league, winning 16 of them, and having not tasted defeat this calendar year yet. Baffling then is the perception that City have looked vulnerable this season. That Erling Haaland had a middling season (still leading the chart despite missing eight games); that Kevin de Bruyne had looked like a spent force; that they have a porous backline. All of these are true to some extent, but City somehow get their business done.\n\nAll they need to ensure is that they win the four remaining fixtures. Simple. The lone ranger is Tottenham Hotspur, who subjected Arsenal to much torture in the last quarter of the game. The Gunners, though exuding control in the first hour, were fortunate to not have dropped points.\n\nMikel Arteta, who was spotted furiously praying in the dug-out in the dying stages of the game, was in a buoyant mood when he met the press. He said: \"I've seen that the whole season. They give me a reason to believe that every single day. We are right on it. The motivation for what is ahead is beautiful. We are all expecting that they're going to have a real go.\"\n\nThat being said, it appears like Arsenal have a slightly easier run-in -- Bournemouth, resurgent but not with adequate firepower, a ponderous and injury-ravaged Manchester United and plucky but leaky Everton. City have to travel to Spurs, the home of Arsenal's bitterest rivals, a game that could well have a say on the title tilt. All other games -- home to Wolves, West Ham and Fulham -- look endearingly winnable. It would be a glorious irony if Spurs could lend a helping hand to Arsenal's title dreams, or if Manchester United could hand their derby antagonists a boost when Arsenal visit Old Trafford. There could yet be twists and turns this season. It could, like the 2012 finale, boil down to the last seconds of the last game, and perhaps be decided on goal difference too.\n\nApril, though, was a cruel month for Liverpool. They began the month with more odds than Arsenal but saw the title prospects unravel. Beginning with a draw at Old Trafford, they lost to Crystal Palace and Everton, besides dropping points against West Ham. Worse was the sight of Jurgen Klopp and Mohammed Salah almost clutching at each other's throats, capturing their agony and frustration at wasting a title charge. It was symbolic, the two men that embodied their ideals in the last 10 years, behaving like teenagers.

Ironically, Mikel Arteta's team will be relying on their fierce rivals to aid their title aspirations.\n\nArsenal's campaign will conclude with a visit to Manchester United this Sunday, followed by a home game against Everton on the final day. However, even if they triumph in these two matches, it won't be enough to secure the league title if City manage to win their final three games.\n\nThis is precisely the outcome that Lineker, host of Match of the Day, anticipates. He expressed doubts about whether Spurs would be willing to assist their rivals, but conceded that there could be a 'Sergio Aguero moment' on the last day.\n\n\"You can't go out and not try. I spoke to a couple of Tottenham fans yesterday and both of them said 'no, we can't help Arsenal to win the league',\" Lineker shared on The Rest Is Football podcast.\n\n\"I can never remember any conversation ahead of a match where you go 'not sure I want to win today'. Could be another Aguero moment. I think you might be right [Manchester City to win all their games], but this is football and you never know.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Triple Arsenal title boost hope remains as Man City face unlikely Premier League challenge\n\nREAD MORE: What Ben White did at corners against Bournemouth as Arsenal advice takes effect\n\nShearer expects City to win the title but does not believe Spurs will roll over to prevent Arsenal from winning it. He referenced Blackburn Rovers' 1995 title win as an example.\n\nIn that season, Blackburn played Liverpool on the final day knowing a defeat would allow Manchester United to win the title if they beat West Ham. Though Liverpool are famously bitter rivals of United, Rovers lost 2-1 at Anfield, with Shearer scoring their goal.\n\nShearer believes that any drop in performance from Spurs will see them lose, but insists they will still be desperate to beat City.\n\n\"You're talking about the integrity of players. We had that scenario at Blackburn, when we had to go to Anfield last day of the season, it was either us winning the title or Man United. So you're thinking Liverpool were going to do us a right favour,\" he added.\n\n\"It was such a weird atmosphere because the fans were aware of it, they didn't want Man United to win at West Ham which meant they would have had a chance of winning the title, it was really weird.\"\n\n\"In the end everyone was happy apart from Man United, because Liverpool won, we won the title. But you can't ever question the players' integrity.

Newcastle United, played 34, 53 points. Chelsea, played 34, 51 points.\n\nBut, analysing Chelsea's last games, there is a reason Pochettino may be cheering on Manchester City in the FA Cup final...\n\nChelsea v West Ham -- win\n\nWest Ham are imploding. One win from nine games, a manager sliding towards the sack, a director of football who has been asked to stay away from the first team dressing room while he searches for a replacement.\n\nWhereas Chelsea have only lost once in 11 Premier League games and that brutal Arsenal thrashing aside are finding some kind of solidity and fluidity.\n\nIt is the sort of fixture Chelsea would likely have lost earlier in the season.\n\nNottingham Forest v Chelsea -- draw\n\nNottingham Forest are deep in a relegation battle. Will it inspire them to perform? Or will the pressure overwhelm them?\n\nOn the surface, things look bad. The club have complained more about refereeing decisions going against them than they have wins in 2024. They have shipped nine goals in their last four games.\n\nBut Chelsea have had a tendency to come unstuck against clubs in the bottom half. Surprising 2-2 draws with Sheffield United and Burnley, both in the bottom three. They also drew 2-2 against Brentford in recent games. Possibly another unexpected stumble.\n\nBrighton v Chelsea -- win\n\nBrighton are in free fall and still have to face Aston Villa and Newcastle before Chelsea visit the Amex. Perhaps competing in the Europa League until March has taken its toll, but whatever the reason performances have dropped off a cliff.\n\nThree goals conceded against Bournemouth, four against Manchester City, scraping a draw against Burnley, letting in another three against Arsenal -- it all paints a bleak picture of what shape Roberto De Zerbi's side are in at the moment.\n\nBrighton have a rough final run -- Manchester United are their opponents on the last day -- and it is likely to be a dismal end to the season.\n\nChelsea v Bournemouth -- draw\n\nBournemouth are already safe and are unlikely to have anything meaningful to play for by the final day of the season. It could relax them, or take the edge off.\n\nEither way, a couple of wins has raised confidences and ended an alarming mini-slump (defeats to Luton and Villa, a draw with Manchester United) that looked to be undoing the work of a relatively fine season.\n\nThey drew with Chelsea earlier in the season and it could be another fixture that proves tricky.\n\nThose eight points would leave Chelsea on 59 points for the season, meaning Manchester United would require six to finish ahead of them, Newcastle seven.\n\nManchester United's games\n\nCan United get two wins from their remaining four games? Or a win and three draws?\n\nErik ten Hag's excruciating side have won once in 90 minutes since the beginning of March. And even that victory came against Sheffield United, considered by some as the worst Premier League team in history.\n\nA trip to Crystal Palace, flying under Oliver Glasner, on Monday. Maybe a point. Hosting title-chasing Arsenal next. Unlikely to get anything. Hosting European rivals Newcastle. Hmm, a draw? Away to Brighton on the final day -- probably a win.\n\nEddie Howe is finding a second wind in the final straight. 13 points from a possible 18, Burnley, Brighton and Brentford still to play, as well as that crunch fixture against Manchester United.\n\nThe way things are going you can well see them hoovering up points and finishing strongly. They need to beat United's remaining total by two points and, given the contrasting form of the two sides, it seems a likely prospect.\n\nThis is where it could complicated. If you say Newcastle finish sixth, Chelsea seventh, Manchester United eighth, the Blues will have qualified for the Europa Conference League come 19 May. Pats on the back all round.\n\nBut if Manchester United were to win the FA Cup final against Manchester City six days later it would hand them a Europa League qualification place.

Behold: Haaland with his finest Michael Jordan impression.\n\nNot content with His Airness moment, Haaland added another three goals in City's 5-1 win over Wolves, taking his tally in club football to 200 in five seasons. \"Not bad,\" Haaland said after the game.\n\nIt was another ruthlessly efficient performance from City, with a smattering of Haaland induced magic. What remains so special about Pep Guardiola's side is how they can cross off crucial games in May like they're nondescript outings in October. There's a routine perfection to City at the end of the year. It doesn't matter if other contenders win, if things look tight at the top. They continue to chug along.\n\nWith precious few exceptions, great teams have life cycles. They gain experience, win a lot, age, and get bad. Not City. The depth of their squad is unrivalled. And now their star has returned to form. With three games to go, they're favorites to pick up a fourth title in a row.\n\nIn a league full of one-percenters, you're looking for whatever fraction of a percentage can turn an advantage. Leandro Trossard becoming the league's most diverse finisher is one such advantage.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Liverpool's title bid slipped away when Diogo Jota was knocked out of their lineup with an injury. Trossard for Arsenal is what Jota was for Liverpool: a crafty finisher who takes up smart spots in the penalty box. He bagged Arsenal's second in a 3-1 over Bournemouth to help his team keep pace with City at the top.\n\nLike Jota, Trossard scores every type of goal imaginable - and some that are hard to dream up. According to StatsBomb, Trossard has been the most two-footed finisher in the Premier League in the past five seasons. His impact extends beyond goals, though. He does a little bit of everything. He is a magnet to the ball. He makes incisive runs. He's tough to dispossess. He keeps Arsenal's possession ticking along. And then when a chance does open up in front of goal, he's lethal. He is producing more valuable chances this season than Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden and Cole Palmer. He's neck-and-neck with Kai Havertz in shot conversion percentage since the turn of the year, and his post-shot xG - the quality of his finishing - is tied for second in the league behind only Haaland.\n\nTrossard is the walking embodiment of Mikel Arteta's belief that Arsenal are at their best sharing goals around the group. The manager resisted the urge to go all-in on signing a ready-made central striker. Instead, Arteta banked on the development of Declan Rice, Gabriel Martinelli, Havertz, Saka and Trossard to share the responsibility.\n\nIt's worked. The movement of a mobile, amorphous front three has sliced defensive lines apart, carving open opportunities for wide players and midfielders driving into the box. Martin \u00d8degaard (16) and Rice (15) have racked up goals and assists, but it's been Trossard who's provided crucial finishes at the end of the season. He's scored in five of his last eight league games, and scored eight times since the start of 2024.\n\nSaturday was a year to the day that Arsenal surrendered top spot to Man City last season. They have held their own this year. City seem impervious to pressure, but Arsenal are doing their best to push the title race to the final day of the season.\n\nThe race for Premier League survival may well be over. Nottingham Forest's 3-1 win over relegated Sheffield United moved them five points clear of Burnley and three ahead of Luton. Burnley were hammered 4-1 by Newcastle on Saturday, which all but guarantees they will play Championship football next season.\n\nWith two games to play, Luton could make up ground. But Forest's goal difference (11 clear of Luton) gives them a crucial advantage. Luton will have to pick up four more points than Forest in their final two games to ensure they stay up.\n\nThe remaining fixtures make that tricky. Forest will host Chelsea and head to Burnley on the final day of the season. Luton have a trip to West Ham and a home game against Fulham left to play.\n\nOn the field, the relegation spots look decided. The three teams that came up last season will probably head back down. The only lingering question: will the Premier League enforce further punishments on either Forest or Everton for violation of the league's profit and sustainability rules? To the courtroom!\n\nLiverpool tore Tottenham apart in the opening hour at Anfield on Sunday, racing to a 4-0 lead. Spurs eventually pulled it back to 4-2, but the damage was already done.\n\nNo one apart from Drake has had a worse week than Ange Postecoglou. Tottenham lost the north London derby, were hammered by Chelsea in midweek and then limped in to a game against Liverpool despite still having an outside shot at picking up a top-four spot and securing Champions League football next season.\n\nPostecoglou is a pass-and-move, high-press zealot, but that has all come tumbling down over the past month. Since the start of April, they've picked up four points, a worse run than anyone except Luton and Sheffield United. They have a minus-nine goal difference in that span, tied for the second-worst in the league.\n\nThat's relegation stuff. Spurs look lifeless with the ball and devoid of a plan once they lose it. On Sunday, Liverpool won possession in the final third eight times in the first half alone - more than any other opening 45 minutes in the Premier League this season, according to Opta.\n\nIt has become a familiar sight for the Tottenham inclined: Spurs can't create any real chances of their own, while conceding a big chance every time they go forward. Liverpool's fullbacks had more touches in the opposition's box than Spurs' entire team had in the first half.\n\nPostecolgou has drawn (fair) criticism for his unwillingness to adapt during games. Like Guardiola and Arteta, Postecoglou wants his side to stick to their principles, to sharply move the ball around, rather than pivot when things are going poorly. His preference is to switch personnel rather than alter his team's style. But adherence to dogma can sink you in tricky games on the road. At Anfield, they were outplayed, outfought and overrun until J\u00fcrgen Klopp made changes in the second half.\n\nPostecoglou has sharpened his teeth over the past week. First, blasting his side on the field against Chelsea, and then taking to a press conference to insist \"change has to happen\" this summer. His players, pushed on to the hot-seat, fighting for a place next season, responded with another dud.\n\nAt some point, inconsistency is no longer a maddening habit holding you back from becoming what you should be. It's who you are.\n\nA special mention to Tottenham's Emerson Royal, who was tormented by Mohamed Salah and the right side of Liverpool's attack at Anfield.\n\nHere's a back of the notebook accounting of his day:\n\nEmerson, a right-winger masquerading as a fullback, was plopped on to the left side of the defensive line to cover for injuries. It was a disaster. It's hard to think of a player who's had a worse individual performance this season.\n\nWest Ham lost their heads - again - in a 5-0 defeat away at Chelsea. Chelsea were slick in attack, slicing apart a hapless West Ham team. There's a tendency to see such a performance as cutting against the David Moyes grain. This is not what a David Moyes team\u2122 looks like.\n\nYes it is. Moyes's side have become easy to play against. They lose away games in graceless, almost absurd fashion. West Ham have now conceded 70 Premier League goals this season, the worst figure for a Moyes side in a single league campaign and the fourth-worst mark of any team this season. In their last three games, they've shipped 12 goals. Not what you want when your club is jetting in managers to potentially replace you.\n\nThe performance at Stamford Bridge on Sunday was a vintage \"one, two, three ... Canc\u00fan\" display from a team who felt it had little else to play for the rest of the way - save, perhaps, the manager's job.\n\nThe win moves Chelsea up to seventh, one place ahead of Manchester United. Defeat for West Ham leaves Moyes on the outs. Time for Julen Lopetegui to start sizing up the carpets.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_connolly@theguardian.com",

The latest is that Harry Maguire is now out until the FA Cup final, meaning Erik ten Hag will surely have to start defensive midfielder Casemiro alongside Jonny Evans at centre-back.\n\nThis is far from ideal even at the best of times, but it's potentially disastrous from a United point of view when the opposition is Mikel Arteta's slick Arsenal side, containing attackers like Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Leandro Trossard.\n\nAFC have produced some of their finest football on the road this season, thrashing West Ham and Sheffield United by 6-0 score-lines away from home, whilst also hitting Burnley for five at Turf Moor. They also found themselves 3-0 up at half time away to rivals Tottenham, even if that game ended up being a bit too close for comfort in the second half.\n\nThe warning signs are there for United, though in fairness their fans might take some consolation in a defeat damaging their noisy neighbours City, whose immense success of recent times must be extremely grating for those on the red half of Manchester.\n\nArsenal beat United 3-1 at the Emirates Stadium earlier this season, but their record at Old Trafford is really poor, with the north London giants also failing to do the double over their rivals in the league since all the way back in the 2006/07 season.", "source": {"uri": "caughtoffside.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CaughtOffside"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_brus@caughtoffside.com", "name": "Mark Brus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Evans", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Evans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars\u00e8ne_Wenger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Havertz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kai Havertz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leandro_Trossard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leandro Trossard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turf_Moor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turf Moor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emirates Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burnley F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://icdn.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/arsenal-3-1-man-united-dalot-jesus-eriksen.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

points: Newcastle's Gordon looks set for Euros", "body": "London -- As the season draws to a close, some footballers will be planning their holidays, but that does not look the case with Newcastle United's Anthony Gordon.\n\nThe Newcastle man has been in superb form recently and produced another fine performance in the win over Burnley at the weekend with England manager Gareth Southgate in attendance.\n\nAnd it would be no surprise if Gordon is in the England squad for the European Championships in June.\n\nThese and other talking points from the weekend's Premier League matches.\n\nNewcastle's Gordon looks Euros-bound: Anthony Gordon was not on the scoresheet, but in front of watching England manager Gareth Southgate he ran the show in attack for Newcastle United in their 4-1 success at Burnley to boost his chances of going to the Euro 2024 finals in Germany.\n\nIf Newcastle qualify for European football next season, Gordon will have played his part with 10 goals and 10 assists so far.\n\nEngland have an array of attacking talents, but with Uefa having expanded squads for Euro 2024 to 26 players, the irrepressible Gordon is finding form at the right time and will be hard to leave out.\n\nLuton win friends, but relegation looms: Luton Town's Premier League stay may be a case of \"one and done\" as their lacklustre 1-1 draw at home to Everton on Friday edged them ever closer to the relegation trapdoor.\n\nThe 18th-placed Hatters have by no means disgraced themselves on their return to the top flight for the first time since 1992, but as against the Toffees, they have had a tendency to come up just short in crucial situations.\n\nA flurry of stoppage-time chances suggested a team still full of desire, but again it proved too little, too late, and Nottingham Forest's win over Sheffield United on Saturday leaves Luton with a mountain to climb if they are to survive.\n\nWith Sheffield United down already and Burnley likely to join them it would be the first time since 1998 that all three promoted clubs make an immediate return.\n\nRaya signing golden for Arsenal: When Arsenal signed David Raya on loan from Brentford last August there were raised eyebrows, especially as they already had an England international in Aaron Ramsdale.\n\nBut the Spaniard has fully vindicated Mikel Arteta's faith and in the 3-0 win over Bournemouth on Saturday he kept his 15th Premier League clean sheet of the season to secure him the Golden Gloves award -- the first Arsenal keeper to have that honour since Petr Cech in 2015-16.\n\nStrangely it is still not certain whether Raya's deal will be made permanent but, barring the odd error like the one against Tottenham Hotspur last week, he could not have done a great deal more to convince Arsenal to retain his services.\n\nTottenham's season running out of steam: Tottenham began the Ange Postecoglou era impressively and were unbeaten in their opening 10 Premier League games when talk of a title bid did not look farfetched.\n\nBut they are ending his first season in a horrible run of form with Sunday's 4-2 defeat at Liverpool their fourth defeat in a row -- the first time in 20 years that has happened.\n\nPostecoglou is still very much in credit after changing the dynamic at the club, but it is clear his risk-taking style of football needs some squad upgrades in the summer to make it truly effective against the top clubs.\n\nHaaland back in business: Manchester City's goalscoring machine Erling Haaland is rounding into form at the perfect time, with three games remaining in City's tight title race with Arsenal.\n\nCity manager Pep Guardiola deemed the 23-year-old Haaland, who missed two months earlier this season with a foot injury, \"back in business\" after he struck four times in City's 5-1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday to take his tally for the season to 25 league goals.\n\nThree of Haaland's goals on Saturday were in the first half, making him the third different player to score two first-half hat-tricks in Premier League history (also vs Nottingham Forest last season), after Andrew Cole and Michael Owen.", "source": {"uri":

Find out more in our Manchester City vs. Wolves betting picks.\n\nThe final Premier League game on Saturday sees Manchester City taking on the Wolverhampton Wanderers at Etihad Stadium. Man City can't afford to drop points in the EPL standings, while Wolves is simply playing for pride at this point.\n\nI'd be lying if I said backing anybody against City, even with a +2.5 goal handicap, was easy, but it's the smartest way to tackle Saturday's game.\n\nOn the surface, we're looking at a Wolves team that has won just one of their last seven Premier League games. However, when looking into those games, their biggest margin of defeat in that span was by two goals against very good Arsenal and Aston Villa teams.\n\nWe also need to factor in that City has given up 32 goals in 24 Premier League games this season, including allowing at least one score in three of their past five matches.\n\nA look at City's last 13 games show that they've won by a three-goal margin on just three occasions. We need to caveat that we are including tense Champions League games and an FA Cup semi-final in those numbers, but it shows a team that isn't regularly outscoring opponents heavily.\n\nConsidering our best bet is not available for Saturday's SGP, we're backing City to win. They have prevailed in 14 of 17 league games.\n\nI also expect Erling Haaland to score, as the Norwegian has found the back of the net in 21 of 27 EPL games this season.\n\nWe'll wrap up this SGP by selecting both teams to score. City have given up just under a goal per game this season in the Premier League, and with Wolves having both Matheus Cunha and Hwang Hee-Chan available, they now have their best goalscorers ready to chip in.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Manchester_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "City of Manchester Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Hee-chan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hwang Hee-chan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/19365db5-4905-4847-a3a6-0e029221fbfe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

scoresheet, but in front of watching England manager Gareth Southgate he ran the show in attack for Newcastle United in their 4-1 success at Burnley to boost his chances of going to the Euro 2024 finals in Germany.\n\nIf Newcastle qualify for European football next season, Gordon will have played his part with 10 goals and 10 assists so far.\n\nEngland have an array of attacking talents, but with UEFA having expanded squads for Euro 2024 to 26 players, the irrepressible Gordon is finding form at the right time and will be hard to leave out.\n\nLuton Town's Premier League stay may be a case of \"one and done\" as their lacklustre 1-1 draw at home to Everton on Friday edged them ever closer to the relegation trapdoor.\n\nThe 18th-placed Hatters have by no means disgraced themselves on their return to the top flight for the first time since 1992, but as against the Toffees, they have had a tendency to come up just short in crucial situations.\n\nA flurry of stoppage-time chances suggested a team still full of desire, but again it proved too little, too late, and Nottingham Forest's win over Sheffield United on Saturday leaves Luton with a mountain to climb if they are to survive.\n\nWith Sheffield United down already and Burnley likely to join them it would be the first time since 1998 that all three promoted clubs make an immediate return.\n\nWhen Arsenal signed David Raya on loan from Brentford last August there were raised eyebrows, especially as they already had an England international in Aaron Ramsdale.\n\nBut the Spaniard has fully vindicated Mikel Arteta's faith and in the 3-0 win over Bournemouth on Saturday he kept his 15th Premier League clean sheet of the season to secure him the Golden Gloves award -- the first Arsenal keeper to have that honour since Petr Cech in 2015-16.\n\nStrangely it is still not certain whether Raya's deal will be made permanent but, barring the odd error like the one against Tottenham Hotspur last week, he could not have done a great deal more to convince Arsenal to retain his services.\n\nTottenham began the Ange Postecoglou era impressively and were unbeaten in their opening 10 Premier League games when talk of a title bid did not look farfetched.\n\nBut they are ending his first season in a horrible run of form with Sunday's 4-2 defeat at Liverpool their fourth defeat in a row -- the first time in 20 years that has happened.\n\nPostecoglou is still very much in credit after changing the dynamic at the club, but it is clear his risk-taking style of football needs some squad upgrades in the summer to make it truly effective against the top clubs.\n\nManchester City's goal-scoring machine Erling Haaland is rounding into form at the perfect time, with three games remaining in City's tight title race with Arsenal.\n\nCity manager Pep Guardiola deemed the 23-year-old Haaland, who missed two months earlier this season with a foot injury, \"back in business\" after he struck four times in City's 5-1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday to take his tally for the season to 25 league goals.\n\nThree of Haaland's goals on Saturday were in the first half, making him the third different player to score two first-half hat-tricks in Premier League history (also v Nottingham Forest last season), after Andrew Cole and Michael Owen.\n\n(Reporting by Nick Said, Lori Ewing, Philip

The Gunners and the Cityzens, meanwhile, play a day earlier in home battles with Bournemouth and Wolves.\n\nWith Friday and Monday night fixtures to keep fans entertained, Gameweek 36 should be a cracker. Here's how 90min sees the weekend's duels panning out.\n\nFantasy Premier League players, beware; there is a Friday night deadline in Gameweek 36.\n\nKenilworth Road takes centre stage as Luton Town attempt to give their survival hopes a shot in the arm when Everton visit. The Hatters can move out of the relegation zone with a victory but the Toffees suddenly can't stop winning with three successes on the bounce securing their place in the top flight.\n\nSaturday sees the two remaining title challengers take to the turf, starting with current leaders Arsenal. While the Gunners have played an extra game, they can go four points ahead of Man City in the early kick-off if they dispose of Bournemouth. The Cherries are scrapping for a top-ten finish, with Andoni Iraola turning things around having gone winless in his first nine Premier League matches, but they could return to the south coast empty-handed.\n\nMan City will provide the evening entertainment and, regardless of Arsenal's performances, know victories in their four remaining fixtures will see them crowned champions of England for the fourth consecutive season. Opponents Wolves have proved stubborn foes for Pep Guardiola over the years but have been hamstrung by significant injuries in recent weeks.\n\nThere are three 15:00 BST kick-offs, one being a London derby between Brentford and Fulham at the Gtech Community Stadium. The Bees will be keen to avoid finishing any lower than their current position of 16th and could nick three points off a Cottagers outfit that has largely struggled away from home in 2023/24.\n\nFive points from three games mean Burnley's survival hopes aren't over just yet but a leaky defence and the in-form Alexander Isak could result in Newcastle leaving Turf Moor with a comfortable victory.\n\nSheffield United's relegation to the Championship was confirmed by last week's loss to the Magpies. The Blades have the chance to damage Nottingham Forest's fight against the drop but, with only three league wins all season, it's hard to back Chris Wilder's side.\n\nChelsea nullified a clueless Tottenham on Thursday night to bolster their own European qualification aspirations - if that's something they actually want - and face a fellow continental contender in West Ham on Sunday. The Hammers showed their attacking quality and defensive shortcomings in the 2-2 draw with Liverpool and the Blues' own inconsistency means another entertaining draw could be on the cards.\n\nAston Villa have a large points advantage over Spurs in the race for fourth and their trip to Brighton represents a good opportunity to get back on the horse after a 4-2 Europa Conference League semi-final first leg defeat to Olympiacos. The Seagulls have won just three league games in 2024 and lost their last two matches to Man City and Bournemouth by a 7-0 aggregate scoreline.\n\nThe late afternoon kick-off has potential to be a chaotic affair when Liverpool and Tottenham meet at Anfield. Both teams' goals have been severely dented over the past fortnight but last season's equivalent fixture - a 4-3 win for the Reds - was an absolute belter and more drama should be in store this time around.\n\nGameweek 36 closes out on Monday night when Manchester United limp down to London to take on Crystal Palace. The Eagles have picked up ten points from a possible 12 and have the attacking tools to down the Red Devils, who remain without key players and could only draw with Burnley last time out.", "source":

After today it's Manchester United away followed by Everton at home, but it still might not be enough.\n\nHow much more can they realistically do to overthrow City?\n\nPhysically, mentally, and financially, they are close to the brink.\n\nFor all of Pep Guardiola's genius as a coach and manager, another brutal facet of his reign as poster boy for the Abu-Dhabi backed superpower is how he brings rivals to their breaking point and maintains the drive to dominate once they crumble.\n\nDomestically, at least.\n\nIn his 14 completed seasons as a senior manager with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City, Guardiola has delivered 11 titles.\n\nHe's on the verge of making it 12 in 15 this month - all the while those 115 charges of financial wrongdoing from the Premier League linger in the background.\n\nGuardiola can become the first manager in English football to win four successive titles.\n\nAlex Ferguson won three on the spin twice among his tally of 13 with Manchester United.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFleeting, sporadic success is not something the greats indulge in.\n\nSo who could blame Mikel Arteta if he turns around and decides he doesn't need the hassle or the stress of trying to be perfect just to win one title?\n\nThe Bayern Munich job is available and that's normally an easy post to fill given it all but guarantees a Bundesliga crown, but even the rise of Bayer Leverkusen under his childhood friend Xabi Alonso - another Pep disciple - means that's a task fraught with increased danger.\n\nWill they ever lose a game again while the Spaniard is in charge?\n\nBarcelona - where Arteta developed as a player in La Masia - were in the market for a new manager until Xavi had a change of heart and opted to remain at Camp Nou.\n\nReal Madrid have a vibrant, thrilling squad that could well end this season as La Liga and European champions.\n\nThey have years together in front of them so it's no wonder they seem to be having a Benjamin Button effect on 64-year-old Carlo Ancelotti.\n\nArteta was backed in last summer's transfer window to the tune of \u20ac230 million in order to try and overtake City and it looks as though they will be pipped at the final hurdle.\n\nThey are on course to win more games than last season, draw and lose fewer, not to mention score more and concede fewer goals.\n\nOn every metric they have improved, and at that level finding the difference is what ultimately delivers the biggest prize.\n\nYet only a dramatic slip - well, a draw - from Guardiola's men at this stage would hand Arsenal the initiative.\n\nCity could well score fewer goals and concede more than last season yet such is their productivity still come out on top.\n\nFor Arsenal, ordinarily you would not heap this level of importance and pressure on a group of players delivering a title at a point when they are still being moulded by Arteta and only became serious contenders last year.\n\nA central defensive partnership of William Saliba and Gabriel, 23 and 26 respectively, provides a solid framework to work from in the future.\n\nDeclan Rice and captain Martin Odegaard are both 25. Bukayo Saka is just 22. Gabriel Martinelli turns 23 next month along with Kai Havertz who will be 24.\n\nThe age profile, not to mention quality, should place them on an upward trajectory.\n\nBut City's power and seemingly effortless ability to regenerate takes a different kind of toll on even the best players' capabilities.\n\nSimilarly, Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool fell agonisingly short on a couple of occasions with 97 and 92 points in 2018/19 and 2021/22 respectively, but did break the stranglehold with a title in the Covid-19 season of 2019/20.\n\nEven before the disruption they were streets ahead of a City side that finally seemed to show a human frailty that Guardiola had been able to avoid since his first season in England back in 2016/17.\n\nThe consistency and resilience Arsenal have shown this season will be difficult to sustain.\n\nThere is also the added question of how long you give Arteta to scale the mountain given he is about to conclude his fourth full season.\n\nOf the 11 managers who have won the Premier League, Ferguson was in charge for the longest time before delivering the title - seven years.\n\nKenny Dalglish was just shy of four when he led Blackburn Rovers to the summit in 1995.\n\nArsene Wenger did it in his second campaign (1997/98), Jose Mourinho won back to back titles with Chelsea in first spell from 2004 to 06 and then again in 2015. Carlo Ancelotti also delivered a title in his first season at Stamford Bridge in 2009/10, so too Antonio Conte in 2016/17.\n\nBefore Guardiola, Robert Mancini won City's first Premier League title in his second full season (2011/12) while Manuel Pellegrini followed the lead of Mourinho and Ancelotti by proving an instant success a decade ago.\n\nThe Chilean left at the end of the season in which Claudio Ranieri led Leicester City to their historic triumph in 2016 - also a one-season wonder.\n\nThat was the summer Guardiola arrived and the landscape changed.\n\nKlopp was already at Anfield by October 2015 and it wouldn't be until 2020 he got over the line.\n\nProof, if needed, that patience can pay off.\n\nArsenal have arrived at a similar stage and success now should only infuse Arteta and his players with the confidence that more can follow despite Guardiola's relenteless City machine.", "source": {"uri": "the42.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The42"}, "authors": [{"uri":

If Newcastle qualify for European football next season, Gordon will have played his part with 10 goals and 10 assists so far.\n\nEngland have an array of attacking talents, but with UEFA having expanded squads for Euro 2024 to 26 players, the irrepressible Gordon is finding form at the right time and will be hard to leave out. LUTON WIN FRIENDS BUT RELEGATION LOOMS\n\nLuton Town's Premier League stay may be a case of \"one and done\" as their lacklustre 1-1 draw at home to Everton on Friday edged them ever closer to the relegation trapdoor. The 18th-placed Hatters have by no means disgraced themselves on their return to the top flight for the first time since 1992, but as against the Toffees, they have had a tendency to come up just short in crucial situations.\n\nA flurry of stoppage-time chances suggested a team still full of desire, but again it proved too little, too late, and Nottingham Forest's win over Sheffield United on Saturday leaves Luton with a mountain to climb if they are to survive. With Sheffield United down already and Burnley likely to join them it would be the first time since 1998 that all three promoted clubs make an immediate return.\n\nRAYA SIGNING GOLDEN FOR ARSENAL When Arsenal signed David Raya on loan from Brentford last August there were raised eyebrows, especially as they already had an England international in Aaron Ramsdale.\n\nBut the Spaniard has fully vindicated Mikel Arteta's faith and in the 3-0 win over Bournemouth on Saturday he kept his 15th Premier League clean sheet of the season to secure him the Golden Gloves award -- the first Arsenal keeper to have that honour since Petr Cech in 2015-16. Strangely it is still not certain whether Raya's deal will be made permanent but, barring the odd error like the one against Tottenham Hotspur last week, he could not have done a great deal more to convince Arsenal to retain his services.\n\nTOTTENHAM'S SEASON RUNNING OUT OF STEAM Tottenham began the Ange Postecoglou era impressively and were unbeaten in their opening 10 Premier League games when talk of a title bid did not look farfetched.\n\nBut they are ending his first season in a horrible run of form with Sunday's 4-2 defeat at Liverpool their fourth defeat in a row -- the first time in 20 years that has happened. Postecoglou is still very much in credit after changing the dynamic at the club, but it is clear his risk-taking style of football needs some squad upgrades in the summer to make it truly effective against the top clubs.\n\nHAALAND BACK IN BUSINESS Manchester City's goal-scoring machine Erling Haaland is rounding into form at the perfect time, with three games remaining in City's tight title race with Arsenal.\n\nCity manager Pep Guardiola deemed the 23-year-old Haaland, who missed two months earlier this season with a foot injury, \"back in business\" after he struck four times in City's 5-1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday to take his tally for the season to 25 league goals. Three of Haaland's goals on Saturday were in the first half, making him the third different player to score two first-half hat-tricks in Premier League history (also v Nottingham Forest last season), after Andrew Cole and Michael Owen.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

United's unwanted century - A look at the Blades' defensive woes", "body": "Chris Wilder's men have conceded 100 Premier League goals this season.\n\nRelegated Sheffield United have conceded a joint-record 100 goals in this season's Premier League following Saturday's 3-1 home defeat to Nottingham Forest.\n\nHere, the PA news agency takes a statistical look at the worst defensive season the Premier League has seen.\n\nChris Wilder's side, remarkably, have equalled a record set when Premier League teams still played 42 games each.\n\nSwindon, who propped up the table in 1993-94, were until now the only team to concede 100 goals in a season since the top flight's rebranding the year prior to that.\n\nThe Blades had already surpassed Derby's 38-game record of 89 after their 4-2 defeat to Manchester United left them on 92 goals against.\n\nA 5-1 hammering by Newcastle confirmed their relegation and took them to 97 before they shipped three at home to Forest.\n\nAnd, with two games still to play, away to Everton and at home to Tottenham, the record will surely be broken.\n\nSheffield United's average of 2.78 goals conceded per game is far beyond Swindon's previous worst of 2.38.\n\nThe aforementioned loss to Newcastle set two other unwanted records.\n\nThe Magpies had also beaten them 8-0 at Bramall Lane earlier in the season and their 13 goals across the two games are the most ever scored by a Premier League team against a single opponent in the same season.\n\nThe Blades also became the first team to concede five or more goals seven times in one Premier League campaign.\n\nArsenal also feature twice on that list, winning 5-0 at the Emirates Stadium and 6-0 at Bramall Lane, while further 5-0 losses have come against Burnley - costing Wilder's predecessor Paul Heckingbottom his job - and Aston Villa and Brighton in a run of three successive home games in February and March completed by the Gunners.\n\nEven the Clarets, who could yet be relegated with United, narrowly missed out on emulating Arsenal and Newcastle after winning the recent return fixture 4-1.\n\nAgain the Blades broke the record held by those same Derby and Swindon teams.\n\nThe Rams lost 6-2 and 5-0 to Arsenal, 6-0 to Liverpool and Aston Villa, 5-0 to West Ham and 6-1 at Chelsea in their 11-point relegation season of 2007-08 while Swindon were beaten 5-0 by Liverpool, Leeds and Villa, 5-1 at Southampton, 6-2 at Everton and 7-1 at Newcastle.\n\nAstonishingly, United's only clean sheet in the league this season came in December's 1-0 home win over Brentford.\n\nThe fewest previously in a Premier League season is three, with the much-discussed Derby team one of four to share that record - they beat Newcastle 1-0, their only win, and had goalless draws with Fulham and Sunderland.\n\nThat same 2007-08 season saw Birmingham's only shut-outs come in beating Bolton 1-0 and Middlesbrough 3-0 and a 0-0 draw with Liverpool.\n\nThe 2011-12 season accounts for the other two such teams - Blackburn did not have a clean sheet until March, before finally managing 2-0 wins over Wolves, Sunderland and Norwich, while the Canaries themselves drew 0-0 with Chelsea and beat Bolton and Villa 2-0, the latter on the final day to avoid an outright record.\n\nCuriously, this season also sees multiple teams in the mix with Burnley and Luton currently both on two clean sheets, the Clarets adding a 2-0 win over Fulham to December's rout of the Blades, while Luton beat Newcastle 1-0 and Brighton 4-0.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish

Regardless of silverware, Mikel Arteta's side have been fantastic this year.\n\nHowever, they have the chance to build an even more formidable side this summer and will be desperate to strengthen the squad with investment in the upcoming transfer window. Their recruitment, mixed with a strong pre-season, could be essential to the north London side's success.\n\nHere is what Arsenal will be up to in 2024/25 pre-season as things stand.\n\nArsenal are one of the many Premier League giants set for a tour of the United States this summer, with the Gunners heading to North America in late July. At present, they only have two games scheduled but are likely to line more up in the near future - either in the United States or elsewhere.\n\nThe Gunners could also book their place in the Community Shield on 6 August for the second year running, but they would need to secure the Premier League title in order to do so.

Liverpool have won more League Cup medals than any other team with 10, including four in a row between the years 1981 and 1984. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe English Football League Cup (EFL Cup) is one of the main cup competitions in English football. Founded in 1960, it is open to all 92 teams that make up the top four tiers of the pyramid, with the first round of games taking place in August and the final most commonly staged in the final week of February.\n\nInitially, many top teams refused to take part in the competition, increasing the likelihood of a lower league team winning silverware. Nowadays, however, it is yet another honour that the elite teams in the country frequently fight over among themselves in a bid to add another trophy to their already overflowing cabinets.\n\nSince the first edition of the tournament in 1960/61, 23 different clubs have won the League Cup and this article will look at each one of those teams and examine their record in the competition as a whole.

In 1966, West Brom faced West Ham in the final and were beaten 2-1 at the Boleyn Ground with the legendary Bobby Moore scoring the winner for the Hammers. Two weeks later, the Baggies took the East London outfit back to the Hawthorns and battered them 4-1 to earn themselves their first bit of silverware for 12 years. The following year, West Brom contested the first single-leg final at Wembley, but were beaten 3-2 by QPR before reaching the final again in 1970, and losing to Manchester City.\n\nWest Brom's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1966\n\nRunners-up\n\n1967, 1970\n\n22 Queens Park Rangers 1967\n\nThe aforementioned QPR were the first-ever winners of a Wembley final in League Cup history, when they came from two goals down to beat holders West Brom in a thrilling final in 1967, with Mark Lazarus completing the turnaround for the Hoops in the 81st minute. The victory marked the first, and to date, only major honour in the club's history and was made all the more impressive by the fact that the West London outfit were playing in the third tier at the time. QPR did reach another final in 1986 and by that point they were a First Division club. However, they were soundly beaten 3-0 that day by fellow top-flight side, Oxford United.\n\nQPR's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1967\n\nRunners-up\n\n1986\n\n21 Leeds United 1968\n\nLeeds United are one of the more relatively successful teams in English football, and experienced their Golden Age at the end of 1960s and early 1970s. Their 1968 League Cup success marked the first major honour in the club's history, although it wasn't the last, as the West Yorkshire outfit ended the following season as champions of England. In March 1968, Leeds met Arsenal at Wembley in the League Cup final, and it was Don Revie's team who emerged victorious thanks to a 20th-minute strike from Terry Cooper. Despite their success in the following years, the Lilywhites never won the League Cup again, although they did reach the 1996 final in which they were hammered 3-0 by Aston Villa.\n\nLeeds United's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1968\n\nRunners-up\n\n1996\n\n20 Swindon Town 1969\n\nSwindon Town are undoubtedly one of the more surprising names on this list as this marks the only time the Robins have even come remotely close to winning some major silverware, and it came in particularly surprising fashion. Swindon were in the third tier when they reached the final in 1969, and were pitted against top-flight Arsenal, still licking their wounds after they were beaten by Leeds the year before. In arguably the greatest underdog story in the competition's history, the Wiltshire outfit won 3-1 against the Gunners, with their winger Don Rogers becoming a cult hero after scoring twice in added time.\n\nSwindon Town's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1969\n\nRunners-up\n\nN/A\n\n19 Stoke City 1972\n\nStoke City are one of the most historic clubs in English football, with their establishment in 1863 making them one of the oldest football clubs in the world. However, despite being a founder member of the Football League and spending large swathes of their history in the top flight, their 1972 League Cup success is the major honour in their history. The Potters had reached the final in 1964, but were beaten over two legs by Leicester City. Eight years later, they made amends eight years later by beating strong favourites Chelsea 2-1 at Wembley, as midfielder George Eastham bagged the winner with 17 minutes left to go.\n\nStoke City's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1972\n\nRunners-up\n\n1964\n\n18 Oxford United 1986\n\nOxford United had an enjoyable 1980s and reached the top flight for the first time in their history in 1985. Buoyed by future Liverpool stars John Aldridge and Ray Houghton, they were not only able to consolidate their position in the First Division, finishing a point above the drop zone in their first season following promotion, they also reached their first-ever major final. The Yellows contested the League Cup final with former winners QPR, in front of over 90,000 spectators at Wembley in April 1986. Houghton scored Oxford's second goal as they ran out comfortable 3-0 winners, making it almost certainly the greatest day in the club's history.\n\nOxford United's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1986\n\nRunners-up\n\nN/A\n\n17 Luton Town 1988\n\nLuton Town reached the heady heights of the Premier League in 2023 under Rob Edwards, but such an achievement still couldn't quite match their 1988 League Cup success. The Hatters reached the top flight for the first time in their history in 1982 and became a mainstay of the top flight for the remainder of the decade before finally succumbing to relegation in the final campaign before the re-brand to the Premier League in 1992. They also won the League Cup in 1988, pulling off a shock 3-2 win over Arsenal, with Brian Stein scoring the winner in the final minute. Luton reached the final again the following season, but were beaten 3-1 by Nottingham Forest.\n\nLuton Town's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1988\n\nRunners-up\n\n1989\n\n16 Sheffield Wednesday 1991\n\nSheffield Wednesday are a football club with a lot of history, but going into the 1991 League Cup final, they had not won a major honour for over 50 years. It was going to be a tall order for the Owls to rectify that fact as they were plying their trade in the second tier at the time, and they were up against a Manchester United side that were just about to get into their stride under Alex Ferguson. However, under Ron Atkinson, the man that Ferguson succeeded as manager at Old Trafford, Wednesday managed to pull off a shock result with midfielder John Sheridan scoring the winner in the 37th minute. They reached the final again two years later, and took an early lead before they were eventually pegged back by Arsenal and lost 2-1.\n\nSheffield Wednesday's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1991\n\nRunners-up\n\n1993\n\n15 Blackburn Rovers 2002\n\nBlackburn Rovers had suffered a difficult time of things after local millionaire Jack Walker had inspired them to the Premier League title in 1995, and slipped out of the top flight altogether just four years later. Graeme Souness brought them back up in 2001, and in their first season back in the Premier League, they recorded a top-half finish and reached their first cup final in over 40 years. In their very first Worthington Cup final, they were pitted against three-time winners Tottenham Hotspur, and managed to win 2-1 with their record signing, Andy Cole scoring the winner in the 68th minute.\n\nBlackburn Rovers' EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n2002\n\nRunners-up\n\nN/A\n\n14 Middlesbrough 2004\n\nMiddlesbrough had come very close to winning their first piece of major silverware in the second half of the 1990s. Under Bryan Robson, they reached the FA Cup and League Cup finals in 1997, and were beaten in both by Chelsea and Leeds United respectively, before reaching the League Cup final again in 1998, and losing to Chelsea at Wembley for the second time in two years. Six years later, they reached their third League Cup final, under Robson's successor, Steve McClaren. They faced Bolton Wanderers in the final and made an explosive start with Joseph-Desire Job scoring in the second minute and Bolo Zenden scoring from the spot five minutes later, and despite Kevin Davies pulling one back after 21 minutes, Middlesbrough were able to hold on for their first-ever major honour.\n\nMiddlesbrough's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n2004\n\nRunners-up\n\n1997, 1998\n\n13 Swansea City 2013\n\nIn 2013, Swansea City became the very first non-English team ever to win the League Cup, and they halted a fairytale story in the process. The Welsh side were flying in the Premier League under new manager Michael Laudrup, thanks in no small part to the exploits of Michu, who was enjoying one of the greatest first seasons ever seen in the league's history. They reached their first-ever cup final after beating Chelsea across two legs in the semi-finals and were pitted against fourth-tier Bradford City, who had remarkably knocked Arsenal out in the quarters. However, Swansea showed no mercy on the underdogs and ran out 5-0 winners to win the Capital One Cup for the first time in their history.\n\nSwansea City's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n2013\n\nRunners-up\n\nN/A\n\n12 Norwich City 1962, 1985\n\nIn 1962, Norwich City became the second team to win the EFL Cup, and the first from outside the top flight. Taking advantage of the days when fewer top-flight teams would take part in the competition, second-tier Norwich reached the final and made easy work of Rochdale over two legs, winning 3-0 away at Spotland before beating them 1-0 at Carrow Road and winning their first major honour by a 4-0 aggregate scoreline. The Canaries would make the final twice more, in 1973 and 1975, and were narrowly beaten by Tottenham and Aston Villa respectively, before they lifted the Milk Cup trophy for the second time in their history with a 1-0 victory over Sunderland in 1985.\n\nNorwich City's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1962, 1985\n\nRunners-up\n\n1973, 1975\n\n11 Birmingham City 1963, 2011\n\nBirmingham City won the League Cup in 1964 in the most satisfying circumstances possible. It was a Second City derby across two legs as the Blues took on arch rivals Aston Villa and beat them 3-1 at St. Andrew's in the first leg. A superb defensive display in the second leg at Villa Park resulted in a goalless draw, which was enough for Birmingham to win their first-ever major honour. The Blues competed in the first-ever League Cup final ever to go to a penalty shoot-out in 2001 when they held Liverpool to a 1-1 draw in extra time before losing 5-4 on spot-kicks, but they did lift the Carling Cup in 2011 after Obafemi Martins capitalised on a defensive mishap from Arsenal and scored the winner in the 89th minute.\n\nBirmingham City's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1964, 2011\n\nRunners-up\n\n2001\n\n10 Wolves 1974, 1980\n\nDuring the 1970s, Wolves won the League Cup twice in the space of six years. Their first triumph came in 1974 when they were pitted against Manchester City at Wembley and took the lead in the 44th minute through Kenny Hibbitt before City legend Colin Bell equalised on the hour mark. Legendary Wolves striker John Richards scored the winner with five minutes left to go and earned his side their first piece of major silverware in 14 years. They repeated the trick in 1980 when Andy Gray's solitary goal saw them pull off a major upset against European champions Nottingham Forest.\n\nWolves' EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1974, 1980\n\nRunners-up\n\nN/A\n\n9 Arsenal 1987, 1993\n\nIt's fair to say that, in contrast to their impressive record of league titles and FA Cups, Arsenal have not had the best of luck in the League Cup over the years. No other team has lost more finals than the Gunners' six, and they have suffered multiple humiliations at Wembley, including against Swindon, Luton and Birmingham. However, Arsenal did manage to win the competition in 1987, pulling off a surprise win over Liverpool, who had won the double the previous season, thanks to a brace from Charlie Nicholas. Six years later, George Graham's side wrapped up their second League Cup title with a 2-1 win over Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nArsenal's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1987, 1993\n\nRunners-up\n\n1968, 1969, 1988, 2007, 2011, 2018\n\nRelated 15 most successful English clubs in football history by major trophies won In football, trophies come with bragging rights. But which English club has won the most silverware in history? 8 Leicester City 1964, 1997, 2000\n\nLeicester City won the Premier League for the first time in 2016 and their first FA Cup followed five years later, but prior to both of those achievements, they had enjoyed plenty of success in the League Cup. They won their first title in 1964 with a 4-3 aggregate victory over Stoke City and reached the final again the following year, but came unstuck against Chelsea. Under Martin O'Neill in the late 1990s, the Foxes reached three League Cup finals, winning two and losing one. In 1997, they were taken to a replay by Middlesbrough but eventually triumphed, before they were beaten 1-0 by Tottenham in 1999. However, they bounced back the following year, inflicting a 2-1 defeat on second-tier outfit Tranmere Rovers.\n\nLeicester City's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1964, 1997, 2000\n\nRunners-up\n\n1965, 1999\n\n7 Tottenham Hotspur 1971, 1973, 1999, 2008\n\nOnly two teams have won more FA Cup titles than Tottenham Hotspur, and they possess a similarly impressive record in the League Cup. They lifted the trophy in 1971 and 1973 with wins over Aston Villa and Norwich City respectively, but they were beaten 3-1 in the 1982 final by Liverpool. Their fourth final was in 1999 and saw them win 1-0 over Leicester, and they reached the final again three years later, only to lose 2-1 to Blackburn. In 2008, they won the Carling Cup for the fourth time with a surprise win over Chelsea, but lost on penalties to Manchester United the following year. Chelsea got their own back in 2015 with a comfortable 2-0 win and six years later, Spurs were beaten in the final again, this time by Manchester City.\n\nTottenham Hotspur's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1971, 1973, 1999, 2008\n\nRunners-up\n\n1982, 2002, 2009, 2015, 2021\n\n6 Nottingham Forest 1978, 1979, 1989, 1990\n\nNottingham Forest appeared in six EFL Cup finals, winning four and losing two, between the years 1978 and 1992, and all were under the stewardship of legendary manager Brian Clough. The charismatic boss led them to glory in 1978, with a shock victory over Liverpool in a replay at Old Trafford, before they became the first team to retain their crown in 1979, winning 3-2 against Southampton. The following year, their run came to an end as they lost 1-0 to Wolves, but Cloughie's men were back to winning ways at the end of the decade, beating Luton in 1989 and Oldham in 1990, before they lost to Manchester United in 1992.\n\nNottingham Forest's EFL Cup record\n\nWinners\n\n1978, 1979, 1989, 1990\n\nRunners-up\n\n1980, 1992\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: In 1980, Nottingham Forest became the first team to appear in three consecutive EFL Cup finals.\n\n5 Aston Villa 1961, 1975, 1977, 1994, 1996\n\nAston Villa were the very first winners of the League Cup in 1961 after they overturned a two-goal deficit suffered against second tier Rotherham United in the first leg by winning 3-0 at Villa Park. They suffered the ignominy of losing the 1964 final to arch rivals, Birmingham City and were beaten again in 1971, losing 2-0 to Tottenham. Villa bounced back in 1975, beating Norwich City 1-0 and then triumphed over Everton two years later, winning a second replay 3-2 following two draws. The Villains pulled off a shock 3-1 win over Manchester United in 1994 and won their fifth League Cup title in 1996 with a 3-0 thrashing of Leeds United.

That will come against Tottenham next Tuesday, with Mikel Arteta's side ironically relying on their bitter rivals to help their title bid.\n\nArsenal meanwhile will bring their campaign to end with a trip to Manchester United on Sunday, before hosting Everton on the final day. Even if they win those two games, it will not be enough to win the league if Pep Guardiola's side secure three more victories.\n\nThat is exactly the scenario Lineker believes will end up happening, with the Match of the Day host unsure Spurs will want to help their rivals. He did admit though that there could be a ' Sergio Aguero moment ' on the final day.\n\n\"You can't go out and not try. I spoke to a couple of Tottenham fans yesterday and both of them said 'no, we can't help Arsenal to win the league',\" Lineker told The Rest Is Football podcast.\n\n\"I can never remember any conversation ahead of a match where you go 'not sure I want to win today'. Could be another Aguero moment. I think you might be right [ Manchester City to win all their games], but this is football and you never know.\"\n\nShearer agreed that City will end up lifting the title, though insisted Spurs will not roll over next week to prevent Arsenal winning the title. The England legend recalled Blackburn Rovers' title win in 1995 to make his point.\n\nIn that season, Blackburn headed to Liverpool on the final day knowing a defeat would allow Manchester United to win the title if they beat West Ham. Though Liverpool are famously bitter rivals of United, Rovers lost 2-1 at Anfield, with Shearer scoring their goal.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Who will win the Premier League title? Comment below.\n\nBut United were unable to defeat the Hammers, allowing Blackburn to win the title by one point. While Shearer believes that any drop in performance from Spurs will see them lose, he insisted they will still be desperate to beat City.\n\n\"You're talking about the integrity of players. We had that scenario at Blackburn, when we had to go to Anfield last day of the season, it was either us winning the title or Man United. So you're thinking Liverpool were going to do us a right favour,\" he added.\n\n\"It was such a weird atmopshere because the fans were aware of it, they didn't want Man United to win at West Ham which meant they would have had a chance of winning the title, it was really weird.\n\n\"In the end everyone was happy apart from Man United, because Liverpool won, we won the title. But you can't ever question the players' integrity. But if you're that much off it then it does make a difference.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

That is practically Tottenham's worst-case scenario if they win at Anfield.\n\n6th is technically only good enough for a place in the Conference League but that will most likely change based on the FA Cup Final.\n\nThe Winners of the Cup get the right to play in the Europa League but if both Manchester clubs already qualify for Europe ( City have) the extra Europa League spot goes to 6th which means the Conference League spot goes to the club who's finished the highest in the league who doesn't already have European football (that will be 7th place).\n\n6th would only mean the UEFA Conference if Man United win the Cup but finish outside the top 6. In that scenario 7th wouldn't be enough for any European Football.\n\nVilla lifting the UEFA Conference has zero bearings on the League table.\n\nLuton 0- 2 Everton\n\nLuton can get out of the bottom three with a win, which with Forest the next day playing the divisions bottom club, they might have to do if they want to avoid relegation. That's even before you consider Forest might be getting some points given back.\n\nThis fixture once looked crucial for both of these sides but finally Everton can play with the knowledge, they are safe which means they should play with freedom.\n\nIn theory then the home side need the points more, but I have been saying that a lot recently about the Hatters and they haven't made these opportunities count. This would be 4 consecutive wins and clean sheets for the Toffees. I bet Sean Dyche keeps wearing the tracksuit?\n\nArsenal 2-1 Cherries\n\nWhatever happens in the next few weeks this young squad will benefit from how we played in our last two games under must win conditions.\n\nOn paper our next three fixtures are all winnable and, in many ways, our biggest enemy is ourselves. How do we cope if we don't get an early goal?\n\nDoes the Emirates grow anxious if the scores our level after an hour?\n\nDo heads drop if the visitors take a lead?\n\nAll the talk about when or if City slip up is irrelevant if our attitude isn't correct on Saturday lunchtime.\n\nAlways dangerous when you have zero room for error against opposition with nothing to lose and everything to gain. Especially when the Cherries have individuals capable of moments of magic.\n\nNothing straightforward at this time of year with the stakes so high\n\nBrentford 2-1 Fulham\n\nLiterally the only game this weekend where at least one of the sides doesn't have something to play for.\n\nBoth are good footballing teams and now safe Brentford should be able to play with more freedom.\n\nBurnley 2-2 Newcastle\n\nGiven they looked relegated a few weeks ago Burnley would have bitten your hand off for a home game with Forest on the final day with their fate in their own hands.\n\nTo do that they probably can't afford to blink before the two above them.\n\nBeating Newcastle might be asking too much especially if Turf Moor hears that Forest are winning at Brammall Lane.\n\nAnother game where Kompany's team play well without getting the win?\n\nSheffield United 2-3 Nottingham Forest\n\nYes, Sheffield United have the freedom of playing without pressure now that their relegation has been confirmed, and no you can't trust Forest to handle expectation away from home.\n\nYet your still playing the team bottom of the league who already have the record for most goals conceded in a 38-game season.\n\nIt's just too big an opportunity for the visitors. Win this and that could be enough to stay up.\n\nIt could avoid a headache on the final day against Burnley.\n\nOut of their 4 fixtures left this is probably the least likely of there being a slip up. Not that I'm overly confident one exists.\n\nOutside of the bottom three, City might have picked Wolves to be their opponents at home. Gary O'Neil is dealing with lots of injuries and crawling over the finish line.\n\nInstead of a favour, it's more likely the Champions reduce our goal difference advantage.\n\nBrighton 2-2 Villa\n\nSo, Villa are making hard work of their European semifinal. We said the same regarding West Ham 12 months ago. Yes, winning the UEFA Conference League should be celebrated but to not win it should be viewed as an opportunity missed.\n\nYou can't blame Unai Emery's team if one eye is on the second leg in Greece. It's never ideal after a disappointing Thursday night to then have to go away in the Premiership. If you had to pick a place to travel to though it might be Brighton, simply because they are sleepwalking to the finish line. Spurs though have failed to put them under any pressure in the race for 4th so any result here is probably good enough.\n\nChelsea 2-1 West Ham\n\nBoth clubs will at least be eyeing up 7th place. Some strange things have to happen for that not to be enough to qualify for Europe.\n\nHammers Fans seem too preoccupied forcing David Moyes out to care. Does seem harsh to question a manager who could take the Irons into Europe for a third straight year.\n\nIf Chelsea play like they did in their last two games, they win this Derby.\n\nThe issue with a young team is every time you think they are finding momentum they do something silly.\n\nLiverpool 2-1 Spurs\n\nAll this talk of if Spurs will want to do us a favour when they play Man City. We know what their fans think but surely their players want to play in the Champions League.\n\nProblem is, if they don't get their act together Villa could have 4th sown up by the time the Champions go to the Lane.\n\nThat could even happen this weekend.\n\nThey could kick off at Anfield 10 points behind Villa which would mean they would have to win at a ground they rarely win at. It is asking too much of this team.\n\nAs for the Klopp and Salah bust up, I think it's simply two winners who are gutted that the season isn't finishing how they imagined.\n\nMentally Liverpool look exhausted, but the Kop might push them on to get a result.\n\nOutside of clinging on for Europa League qualification Spurs won't have much incentive when they play City. Not good news for Gooners\n\nPalace 2-1 Man United\n\nI defended Ten Hag last week, agreeing that some had overreacted towards his FA Cup Semi-Final win.\n\nAs manager of Man United though you can't then drop points at Old Trafford to the team 19th In the League and try to explain it as 'entertaining'.\n\nThat's a sign of the man getting desperate?\n\nIf Crystal Palace play how they have recently (and why not carry on playing like that) then is an Eagles win over United even considered an upset anymore?\n\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -\n\nForget the Prem, JustArsenal has its own epic title race with joint leaders (will announce criteria if players finish on joint points in final week).\n\nIs it a three-horse race?\n\nBaron might have something to say about that, 10 points giving them a last push while Matthew and Ackshay and Terrah need a big score to have an outside chance.\n\nQB got the highest score of last week, 15 points. 11 points for Edu means he's out of nowhere in the final Euro spot.\n\nWill soon be asking who is interested in playing in Euros.\n\nAnybody why wants to be tactical and doesn't want rivals to know

Pep Guardiola's all-conquering City, who also won the Champions League and FA Cup last season, will have to see off Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Liverpool and the rest to claim an unprecedented sixth league title in seven years.\n\nMeanwhile Luton Town are making their first appearance in the Premier League, having risen from non-league in an incredible decade of progress. They followed Championship winners Burnley and second-placed Sheffield United in earning promotion to the top flight.\n\nFollow the latest action from the Premier League below.\n\nForest make two alterations to the team that lost 2-0 to City in their last match. Montiel comes in at right-back to replace Williams, who is injured. Yates also comes in for Niakhate.\n\n14:44\n\nThe Blades make one change to the side that were thrashed 5-1 by Newcastle in their previous Premier League outing. It comes in the defence, with Robinson returning to captain the team, replacing Holgate. McAtee and Brewster return to the bench after being sidelined through injury.\n\nForest won two of their first three Premier League matches under Nuno Espirito Santo to ease relegation fears. However, the Tricky Trees have since been victorious in two of their previous 15 outings in the top flight and are only above the drop zone on goal difference after Luton drew 1-1 with Everton yesterday. The visitors hosted champions Manchester City in their last match, losing 2-0 despite creating an xG (expected goals) of 1.93 to the Citizens' 0.87. Chris Wood missed two massive opportunities to level the score after Josko Gvardiol's opener before Erling Haaland came off the bench to double City's lead. The Tricky Trees are also waiting for the results of their appeal against a four-point deduction for breaching profit and sustainability rules, which could have a massive impact on the relegation battle.\n\n14:30\n\nThe Blades are at the bottom of the Premier League and are playing for pride after being relegated from the top flight in their previous outing. United had to beat the Magpies to keep their unlikely survival hopes alive and took the lead at St James' Park through Anel Ahmedhodzic.

Oliver Glasner's side began in the ascendancy, with Michael Olise firing the Eagles ahead inside the opening quarter of an hour.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta then doubled Crystal Palace's lead shortly before half-time, netting his ninth goal in his last 11 Premier League games. Palace raced into a 4-0 lead just over 20 minutes after the restart through Tyrick Mitchell and Olise's second of the night.\n\nREAD MORE: We gave Erik ten Hag a fully-fit Man United squad for a season and this is what happened\n\nREAD MORE: Harry Maguire sends Kieran McKenna message after Ipswich boss secures promotion\n\nUnited are now in eighth position, with 54 points from their 35 games this season. They are six points from Tottenham Hotspur in fifth place and a whopping 13 from Aston Villa in fourth.\n\nDespite this, the season is far from over with three more games left to play - one of which being an FA Cup final at the end of the month. So, with that being said, the Manchester Evening News has looked at the different ways the Red Devils can secure European football.\n\nPremier League\n\nItaly and Germany have claimed the extra Champions League qualifying spots, so only the top four in the Premier League will go into next season's new-look tournament. Aston Villa need just three more points from their final two games to join Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\nOnly Tottenham Hotspur can rival Unai Emery's side for a place in the top four. Fifth place will qualify for next season's Europa League, with the team going straight into the new setup rather than playing any additional pre-qualifiers.\n\nNow, fifth place isn't out of the realms of possibility for Manchester United, but it's certainly a tough task. With Spurs, Newcastle and Chelsea also looking to the climb the Premier League table, the FA Cup final throws the Red Devils a lifeline.\n\nFA Cup\n\nThe winners of the FA Cup will also claim a place in the Europa League. If the winners of the competition finish in the top five of the Premier League - and therefore qualify for the Champions League or Europa League through their league position - the Europa League spot will be passed down to the next-highest ranked English top-flight outfit not competing in Europe.\n\nPermutations\n\nSo, here are the permutations. If Manchester United don't finish in the top five but win the FA Cup they qualify for the Europa League, with sixth place claiming a Europa Conference League spot.\n\nIf the Red Devils don't win the FA Cup then Europa League qualification will be awarded to fifth and sixth, while seventh claims Europa Conference League. Therefore, Manchester United can afford to not win the FA Cup so long as they finish in the top seven.\n\nCurrent Standings\n\nManchester United currently sit in eighth place on 54 points, meanwhile, Newcastle rank in sixth on 56 points and Chelsea are in seventh on 54 points. Each of the three sides has three games left before the end of the Premier League season.\n\nRemaining Fixtures\n\nManchester United\n\nArsenal (H) - Sunday, May 12\n\nNewcastle United (H) -

Click the sign-up box below to receive the newsletter every Monday morning this season for our verdict on all 20 Premier League clubs\n\nMissed penalties have already cost Manchester City dearly this season but, as Erling Haaland continued his mastery of the spot-kick art with two against Wolverhampton Wanderers, statistics suggested that will not happen again over the closing days of the title race.\n\nThe Norwegian, who missed the penalty shoot-out defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League last month, took his tally for the season to eight out of nine penalties, 16 of 18 for his City career, and a conversion rate of a super-elite 89 per cent.\n\nInterestingly, until Haaland's arrival, penalties had been a problem for Pep Guardiola's side - 27 misses in his seven seasons before this - with an average conversion rate ranging from a low of 62.5 per cent to a high of 78.5.\n\nConsidering the \"industry standard\" is 85 per cent, and the Premier League this season hitting 88.5, this is a rare area in which Guardiola's team has proved sub-par on his watch.\n\nNow? Not so much. City, as a team, have scored 12 of 13 this season - Haaland's miss against Sheffield United the only one - and a conversion rate of 92.3 per cent is, by a long way, the best ever by a Guardiola City team.\n\n\"Having mental strength is a skill as well,\" Guardiola said. \"And the people say 'ooh the penalty shooting is down to luck.' No it's not.\n\n\"If you are a good taker you have a better chance, if you are a good keeper you have a better chance and Erling is, of course, going to miss penalties, but everyone know he is a good taker. He thinks I am going to take a penalty, I am going to score. It's his confidence. That's right.\"\n\nHaaland's unflappable nature extended off the field following the 5-1 win, with a post-match interviewer gamely trying to elicit a response when he suggested the recent quotes from Roy Keane, labelling him a \"League Two\" striker, must serve as an inspiration.\n\n\"I don't really care that much about that man, so that's all right,\" Haaland said. \"The boys have been through this many years -- the club also. I've got experience from last year, it's about focusing on game by game.\"\n\nGame by game is how City and Arsenal must take the concluding fortnight of the campaign, with five left in total - three for City, two for Arsenal.\n\nFor many weeks now, the two combatants, plus Liverpool, have had their kick-off times staggered by television demands, although Guardiola has cut through talk of mind games or advantages of going first or last with some very simple maths.\n\nArsenal, he says, will win their remaining two games which means City must do likewise.\n\n\"Today we arrived here and the players knew if we don't win, ciao, ciao, bye bye, next season we see each other! It's not complicated. It doesn't matter if it's before or after,\" Guardiola said.\n\n\"Since the winter break, the way they [Arsenal] are playing. It's not the fact that they are winning, it's the way they play, so you smell that they are not going to lose in the games they have left. They are not going to.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_whittell@inews.co.uk", "name": "Ian Whittell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_League_Two", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL League Two"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Keane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roy Keane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SEI_202746299.jpg?crop=239px%2C0px%2C1797px%2C1016px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

"Sheffield United's unwanted century - A look at the Blades' defensive woes", "body": "Here is a statistical look at the worst defensive season the Premier League has seen.\n\nChris Wilder's side, remarkably, have equalled a record set when Premier League teams still played 42 games each.\n\nSwindon, who propped up the table in 1993-94, were until now the only team to concede 100 goals in a season since the top flight's rebranding the year prior to that.\n\nThe Blades had already surpassed Derby's 38-game record of 89 after their 4-2 defeat to Manchester United left them on 92 goals against.\n\nA 5-1 hammering by Newcastle confirmed their relegation and took them to 97 before they shipped three at home to Forest.\n\nAnd, with two games still to play, away to Everton and at home to Tottenham, the record will surely be broken.\n\nSheffield United's average of 2.78 goals conceded per game is far beyond Swindon's previous worst of 2.38.\n\nThe aforementioned loss to Newcastle set two other unwanted records.\n\nThe Magpies had also beaten them 8-0 at Bramall Lane earlier in the season and their 13 goals across the two games are the most ever scored by a Premier League team against a single opponent in the same season.\n\nThe Blades also became the first team to concede five or more goals seven times in one Premier League campaign.\n\nArsenal also feature twice on that list, winning 5-0 at the Emirates Stadium and 6-0 at Bramall Lane, while further 5-0 losses have come against Burnley - costing Wilder's predecessor Paul Heckingbottom his job - and Aston Villa and Brighton in a run of three successive home games in February and March completed by the Gunners.\n\nEven the Clarets, who could yet be relegated with United, narrowly missed out on emulating Arsenal and Newcastle after winning the recent return fixture 4-1.\n\nAgain the Blades broke the record held by those same Derby and Swindon teams.\n\nThe Rams lost 6-2 and 5-0 to Arsenal, 6-0 to Liverpool and Aston Villa, 5-0 to West Ham and 6-1 at Chelsea in their 11-point relegation season of 2007-08 while Swindon were beaten 5-0 by Liverpool, Leeds and Villa, 5-1 at Southampton, 6-2 at Everton and 7-1 at Newcastle.\n\nAstonishingly, United's only clean sheet in the league this season came in December's 1-0 home win over Brentford.\n\nThe fewest previously in a Premier League season is three, with the much-discussed Derby team one of four to share that record - they beat Newcastle 1-0, their only win, and had goalless draws with Fulham and Sunderland.\n\nThat same 2007-08 season saw Birmingham's only shut-outs come in beating Bolton 1-0 and Middlesbrough 3-0 and a 0-0 draw with Liverpool.\n\nThe 2011-12 season accounts for the other two such teams - Blackburn did not have a clean sheet until March, before finally managing 2-0 wins over Wolves, Sunderland and Norwich, while the Canaries themselves drew 0-0 with Chelsea and beat Bolton and Villa 2-0, the latter on the final day to avoid an outright record.\n\nCuriously, this season also sees multiple teams in the mix with Burnley and Luton currently both on two clean sheets, the Clarets adding a 2-0 win over Fulham to December's rout of the Blades, while Luton beat Newcastle 1-0 and Brighton 4-0.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He has become a lethal attacker under Mikel Arteta.\n\nHe provided the assist for Leandro Trossard's crucial second goal in Arsenal's 3-0 win over Bournemouth on Saturday, flicking the ball to him instinctively with the outside of his boot, then added the third himself with a cool finish on the angle in stoppage time.\n\nRice now has seven goals and eight assists in the Premier League this season, the fourth-highest combined total of any Arsenal player and more than twice as many as he has ever previously managed. \"To do that in this league is something else,\" said Arteta afterwards.\n\nHis goal involvements only told part of the story on Saturday. Rice caught the eye on numerous occasions, his drive in and out of possession pushing Arsenal upfield at times and helping to stem the tide at others. \"Declan Rice, we got him half price,\" was the chant from the home fans at the final whistle.\n\nThomas Partey's introduction at the base of midfield has helped, giving the \u00a3105m signing the freedom to bomb forward from the No 8 position. But Rice's increased attacking threat has been apparent all season. This was just the latest example.\n\nNick Wright\n\nIt wasn't too long ago Eddie Howe was fielding questions about his Newcastle players being on the beach.\n\nBut four wins from five, and 27 points from 14 games following a four-game losing streak either side of New Year, have changed the narrative around St James' Park.\n\nHowe has never looked under any sustained pressure but having reached the Champions League 12 months ago, the prospect of missing out on European football altogether would have been a tough pill to swallow this time around.\n\nOf course, that is still a very real possibility. But the Magpies are the form team of those chasing those final two European spots, are now the top scorers outside of Man City and Arsenal and have one of their rivals for those positions, Man Utd, still to come in their final three games.\n\nIt could easily have been a gloomy end to the campaign for Newcastle, who have suffered badly with injuries during the season which has tested a squad with a talented and expensive first XI, but limited options in reserve.\n\nIf anything, Saturday's win at Burnley was a reminder of the depth that needs adding to the squad in the summer. With Alexander Isak, Callum Wilson and Anthony Gordon all on the pitch and firing - the first time all three have started a game this season - they looked a constant threat and as dangerous in transition as any Premier League side.\n\nIt's when their top talent are not available, or are overworked, that things begin to tail off quickly, and that is what must be addressed before the start of next season.\n\nRon Walker\n\nHeading to the Gtech Community Stadium in the spring sunshine, there was hope two teams with nothing much to play for beyond local bragging rights would cut loose and serve up an entertaining, goal-filled contest. It wasn't to be.\n\nBryan Mbeumo's deflected shot hit the bar in the first half and sub Raul Jimenez spurned a good opening late on but these two teams - despite bringing intensity to this derby - both proved to be badly lacking in the final third.\n\nThe visitors repeatedly failed to make good positions count, with crosses drifting away from Fulham players and some wayward passing from the disappointing Willian not helping. Birthday boy Rodrigo Muniz was not at his best, Andreas Pereira was off target and Fulham have now drawn a blank 12 times this term - only Sheffield United have done so more.\n\nAs for Brentford, there was encouraging link-up play between Mbeumo and Ivan Toney but the latter has now gone 10 games without a goal, while Keane Lewis-Potter was a nuisance for Fulham but nothing more.\n\nThe real work for these sides is done. Brentford are safe and Fulham are settled in mid-table. But the area to work on in the summer is clear...\n\nPeter Smith\n\nLuton need at least four points to drag themselves above Nottingham Forest in the final two games. To put that in perspective, it is the same number of points they have taken from their last 12 games. That is why the Opta predictor has them at 95 per cent likely to go down.\n\nThis was a cathartic afternoon for Nuno Espirito Santo, who saw Ryan Yates' strike survive a VAR review. So often, when the lines have been drawn or when incidents have been taken to Stockley Park, fortune hasn't favoured them.\n\nBut the release of emotion from the away end when referee Chris Kavanagh awarded the goal - and again at full time - tells you how this could prove a seminal moment in Forest's season.\n\nThere were 32 chances in a game that ebbed and flowed. Sheffied United had a superior xG - 2.27 to 1.49 - had more shots and more possession. But there was more conviction from the visitors, and quality.\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi produced two picture-book goals to help Forest overcome a dreadful start at Bramall Lane and register a first away win since Boxing Day.\n\nThat came at Newcastle with the other coming at Stamford Bridge. Their situation at the foot of the table could look even rosier if an appeal against a four-point deduction for breaking financial rules is successful, with news expected next week.\n\nBut another victory over Chelsea regardless next weekend will see Nuno's spirited side over the line.\n\nBen Grounds\n\nSheffield United's horrible campaign hit a new low as Hudson-Odoi's second was the 100th goal they have conceded, making them the first Premier League team to rack up a century in a 38-game season, with Swindon doing it in 1993-94 over 42 games.\n\nThere is therefore very little once more for Chris Wilder to be encouraged from this latest home defeat, having again been so wasteful with their chances.\n\nThe last side to concede more in a 38-game top-flight campaign was Leicester City in 1908-09 (102) - and it is Sheffield United's porous defence for which they have gained notoriety this term.\n\nUnited's only clean sheet in the league this season came in December's 1-0 home win over Brentford.\n\nSwindon, who propped up the table in 1993/94, were until now the only team to concede a century of goals in a season since the top flight's rebranding the year prior to that.\n\nThe Blades had already surpassed Derby's 38-game record of 89 after their 4-2 defeat to Manchester United left them on 92 goals against. A 5-1 hammering by Newcastle confirmed their relegation and took them to 97 before they shipped three at home to Forest.\n\nTheir average of 2.78 goals conceded per game is far beyond Swindon's previous worst of 2.38. And, with two games still to play, away to Everton and at home to Tottenham, the record will surely be broken.\n\nBen Grounds\n\nLuton Town may well look back on Friday night as the one where safety slipped away.\n\nRob Edwards still talked a good game post-match. He used words like resilience, fight and spirit. He told reporters that belief of staying up still resonates. But time is running out.\n\nThis felt like an opportunity begging to be taken. Sean Dyche's Everton delivered a fairly rudimentary display, and played like a side whose hard graft had already been done, having secured safety against Brentford last weekend.\n\nDyche admitted as much: \"We lost our way... there is that feeling that we've done our work,\" he said.\n\nThe harsh reality is that Luton have only won once in their last 15. Since the start of February, they've shipped 46 goals in all competitions, the most of any side in Europe's big-five leagues, also failing to keep a clean sheet. It's hard to look beyond the stark facts.\n\nThe Hatters remained defiant and chased the game, bombarding the Everton box late on and registered six shots in stoppage time, but it wasn't enough. The threat of relegation continues to loom large and now, for all Luton's impressive endeavour and Edwards' never-say-die attitude, the end game looks near.\n\nLaura Hunter\n\nStream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

He has become a lethal attacker under Mikel Arteta.\n\nHe provided the assist for Leandro Trossard's crucial second goal in Arsenal's 3-0 win over Bournemouth on Saturday, flicking the ball to him instinctively with the outside of his boot, then added the third himself with a cool finish on the angle in stoppage time.\n\nRice now has seven goals and eight assists in the Premier League this season, the fourth-highest combined total of any Arsenal player and more than twice as many as he has ever previously managed. \"To do that in this league is something else,\" said Arteta afterwards.\n\nHis goal involvements only told part of the story on Saturday. Rice caught the eye on numerous occasions, his drive in and out of possession pushing Arsenal upfield at times and helping to stem the tide at others. \"Declan Rice, we got him half price,\" was the chant from the home fans at the final whistle.\n\nThomas Partey's introduction at the base of midfield has helped, giving the \u00a3105m signing the freedom to bomb forward from the No 8 position. But Rice's increased attacking threat has been apparent all season. This was just the latest example.\n\nNick Wright\n\nErling Haaland is supposed to be having an off season. His four goals against Wolves, taking him to 25 in the Premier League, reminded us of just how lethal he can be. Cole Palmer, his closest competition for the Golden Boot, is five adrift.\n\nCriticism about Haaland's all-round game had started to grow after some frustrating performances in big games this season. Haaland took out those frustrations on Wolves on Saturday, delivering the type of ruthless performance that became the norm last season.\n\nLiving up to a record haul in his maiden Premier League season was never going to be easy. Injuries have led to a disjointed campaign for the 23-year-old, but he's still managed to keep up an impressive scoring rate. Haaland's a victim of his own success.\n\nHe seems to have benefitted from the time off taken to recover from a muscle problem. Since returning, Haaland has scored five goals in just over 100 minutes. His response to being subbed was one of a player back to their best, chomping at the bit to stay on.\n\n\"He was furious,\" said Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp. \"Sometimes we talk about the finesse and little touches that he doesn't do so well but he's an animal in front of goal. This guy is built differently. He is a phenomenon.\"\n\nPerhaps the scariest takeaway from the win over Wolves is the confirmation that Haaland's had a sub-par season by his standards. Yet he's still head and shoulders above the rest of the goalscorers. Where would he and City be if he'd been at his best again?\n\nHaaland propelled City to the treble last season with 52 goals in all competitions. That's what he's capable of. Saturday was a reminder of that.\n\nZinny Boswell\n\nIt wasn't too long ago Eddie Howe was fielding questions about his Newcastle players being on the beach.\n\nBut four wins from five, and 27 points from 14 games following a four-game losing streak either side of New Year, have changed the narrative around St James' Park.\n\nHowe has never looked under any sustained pressure but having reached the Champions League 12 months ago, the prospect of missing out on European football altogether would have been a tough pill to swallow this time around.\n\nOf course, that is still a very real possibility. But the Magpies are the form team of those chasing those final two European spots, are now the top scorers outside of Man City and Arsenal and have one of their rivals for those positions, Man Utd, still to come in their final three games.\n\nIt could easily have been a gloomy end to the campaign for Newcastle, who have suffered badly with injuries during the season which has tested a squad with a talented and expensive first XI, but limited options in reserve.\n\nIf anything, Saturday's win at Burnley was a reminder of the depth that needs adding to the squad in the summer. With Alexander Isak, Callum Wilson and Anthony Gordon all on the pitch and firing - the first time all three have started a game this season - they looked a constant threat and as dangerous in transition as any Premier League side.\n\nIt's when their top talent are not available, or are overworked, that things begin to tail off quickly, and that is what must be addressed before the start of next season.\n\nRon Walker\n\nHeading to the Gtech Community Stadium in the spring sunshine, there was hope two teams with nothing much to play for beyond local bragging rights would cut loose and serve up an entertaining, goal-filled contest. It wasn't to be.\n\nBryan Mbeumo's deflected shot hit the bar in the first half and sub Raul Jimenez spurned a good opening late on but these two teams - despite bringing intensity to this derby - both proved to be badly lacking in the final third.\n\nThe visitors repeatedly failed to make good positions count, with crosses drifting away from Fulham players and some wayward passing from the disappointing Willian not helping. Birthday boy Rodrigo Muniz was not at his best, Andreas Pereira was off target and Fulham have now drawn a blank 12 times this term - only Sheffield United have done so more.\n\nAs for Brentford, there was encouraging link-up play between Mbeumo and Ivan Toney but the latter has now gone 10 games without a goal, while Keane Lewis-Potter was a nuisance for Fulham but nothing more.\n\nThe real work for these sides is done. Brentford are safe and Fulham are settled in mid-table. But the area to work on in the summer is clear...\n\nPeter Smith\n\nLuton need at least four points to drag themselves above Nottingham Forest in the final two games. To put that in perspective, it is the same number of points they have taken from their last 12 games. That is why the Opta predictor has them at 95 per cent likely to go down.\n\nThis was a cathartic afternoon for Nuno Espirito Santo, who saw Ryan Yates' strike survive a VAR review. So often, when the lines have been drawn or when incidents have been taken to Stockley Park, fortune hasn't favoured them.\n\nBut the release of emotion from the away end when referee Chris Kavanagh awarded the goal - and again at full time - tells you how this could prove a seminal moment in Forest's season.\n\nThere were 32 chances in a game that ebbed and flowed. Sheffied United had a superior xG - 2.27 to 1.49 - had more shots and more possession. But there was more conviction from the visitors, and quality.\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi produced two picture-book goals to help Forest overcome a dreadful start at Bramall Lane and register a first away win since Boxing Day.\n\nThat came at Newcastle with the other coming at Stamford Bridge. Their situation at the foot of the table could look even rosier if an appeal against a four-point deduction for breaking financial rules is successful, with news expected next week.\n\nBut another victory over Chelsea regardless next weekend will see Nuno's spirited side over the line.\n\nBen Grounds\n\nSheffield United's horrible campaign hit a new low as Hudson-Odoi's second was the 100th goal they have conceded, making them the first Premier League team to rack up a century in a 38-game season, with Swindon doing it in 1993-94 over 42 games.\n\nThere is therefore very little once more for Chris Wilder to be encouraged from this latest home defeat, having again been so wasteful with their chances.\n\nThe last side to concede more in a 38-game top-flight campaign was Leicester City in 1908-09 (102) - and it is Sheffield United's porous defence for which they have gained notoriety this term.\n\nUnited's only clean sheet in the league this season came in December's 1-0 home win over Brentford.\n\nSwindon, who propped up the table in 1993/94, were until now the only team to concede a century of goals in a season since the top flight's rebranding the year prior to that.\n\nThe Blades had already surpassed Derby's 38-game record of 89 after their 4-2 defeat to Manchester United left them on 92 goals against. A 5-1 hammering by Newcastle confirmed their relegation and took them to 97 before they shipped three at home to Forest.\n\nTheir average of 2.78 goals conceded per game is far beyond Swindon's previous worst of 2.38. And, with two games still to play, away to Everton and at home to Tottenham, the record will surely be broken.\n\nBen Grounds\n\nLuton Town may well look back on Friday night as the one where safety slipped away.\n\nRob Edwards still talked a good game post-match. He used words like resilience, fight and spirit. He told reporters that belief of staying up still resonates. But time is running out.\n\nThis felt like an opportunity begging to be taken. Sean Dyche's Everton delivered a fairly rudimentary display, and played like a side whose hard graft had already been done, having secured safety against Brentford last weekend.\n\nDyche admitted as much: \"We lost our way... there is that feeling that we've done our work,\" he said.\n\nThe harsh reality is that Luton have only won once in their last 15. Since the start of February, they've shipped 46 goals in all competitions, the most of any side in Europe's big-five leagues, also failing to keep a clean sheet. It's hard to look beyond the stark facts.\n\nThe Hatters remained defiant and chased the game, bombarding the Everton box late on and registered six shots in stoppage time, but it wasn't enough. The threat of relegation continues to loom large and now, for all Luton's impressive endeavour and Edwards' never-say-die attitude, the end game looks near.\n\nLaura Hunter\n\nStream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

There really is no way to tell", "body": "It is hard to judge Pep Guardiola's mood at the best of times, given the generally frantic figure that he cuts during -- or even after -- a Manchester City match.\n\nHe could be frantically correcting one of his players' mistakes as the rest of them reflect on a joyful 6-0 victory or crouching down in his technical area, his biggest touchline 'tell', as Sheffield United break forward for the first time on a December afternoon.\n\nBut it is fair to say that, at this time of the year, when anything less than victory probably means City missing out on a trophy altogether, he is about as relaxed as one might expect for the figurehead of a team trying to win the English top flight for an unprecedented fourth time.\n\nHandily, a day before Saturday's 5-1 victory over Wolves, he explained exactly what it is that probably makes him so content when he was asked about how important it is that he can trust his players at this time of year.\n\n\"We can lose all four games and that means I don't trust my players? It's impossible,\" he said.\n\n\"I see them, I saw them, I still feel what they are doing. There's no chance (of not trusting them).\n\n\"It's not winning or losing that will change my opinion about this season in terms of what they have done. If we win these two prizes (the European Super Cup and the Club World Cup), and win the third and fourth of the season (the Premier League and FA Cup), it's not going to change at all my opinion about that, about the club, if we win or don't win the title.\n\n\"Of course, we want it but we are fighting for something no team in this country has done ever, ever, so of course it's a big challenge and we want it. But opinion? It depends if we win in the last minute or not? No chance. I love them so much.\"\n\nThat trust means he can handle the consequences of the matches themselves; as long as they go into it and give their best, what more can you ask?\n\nCity largely dominated Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals, for example, but lost on penalties, so that is the end of that trophy pursuit for another year. They had won all their group games and both last-16 games, but are out.\n\nIf they even draw one of their final three league matches, there is a high chance Arsenal will win the title. They dare not repeat what they did against Madrid in the FA Cup final, lest they give Manchester United a sniff.\n\nAnd yet Guardiola never seems any more stressed than he would do if, say, Crystal Palace had a corner when trailing 2-0 in a 3pm kick-off in September.\n\nThose little drops down to the turf are quite telling in themselves. On Saturday, he was down there as Wolves broke forward, looking for the three goals they needed to draw level, but as soon as Rodri dropped the ball into midfield for Kevin De Bruyne to control, the manager sprang back up. Danger averted.\n\nHe was down and back up again within three seconds in February as he saw Everton scupper their own foray but last June, in Istanbul, he collapsed to the floor as Manuel Akanji left a backpass for Ederson which nearly gifted Inter the opener in the Champions League final.\n\nA glimpse, there, that in the biggest matches, those little moments matter all the more, but you really would never tell by his general demeanour that so much is at stake.\n\nGuardiola knows that his team have to win all of their matches and that itself is something that helps him and City keep focused on what they need to do.\n\nFor much of last season, the title was not in their hands. It hasn't been for most of this season either, but they know that if they just keep winning, things might change. It changed last season when City beat Arsenal 4-1 in April, after trailing since the very start, and it is again now, since Arsenal and Liverpool's double blunder three weeks ago.\n\n\"We know if we don't win or draw, there won't be a chance to fight until the end,\" he said after City beat Brighton 4-0 last month. \"Of course, pressure is there, otherwise you can't perform like that.\"\n\nThat is a key point, too: the City players seem to enjoy this pressure. They might even, as Guardiola suggested there, need it to be at their best, to put in the performances that we have come to expect from them.\n\n\"They like to play with pressure,\" he said in April. \"They know it's dead or alive.\"\n\nHe has also said that it was in October and November when he felt his team were looking tired, and not ready to pick themselves up for another title push. Those are the months when he is most concerned, when those around the training ground ask each other, 'What's up with him today?'.\n\nThink back to last January, when he spoke for 20 minutes about how his players' fire was dying out, how they and the entire club had become 'happy flowers', too content with their previous achievements to bother trying again.\n\nHe got the reaction he was looking for and it meant that, by the end of the campaign, he could sit back, safe in the knowledge that his players would do what they needed. Even as the treble drew nearer, you could not tell what was bubbling away underneath, until, for example, he cried his eyes out on the Wembley pitch after beating Manchester United in the FA Cup final.\n\nIt no doubt helps Guardiola that he has been in this position at this time of year many times before: it is the fourth time at City alone. He knows anything can happen in football -- such as the elimination against Madrid this season, and two seasons ago, or even Liverpool's recent struggles.\n\n\"My appreciation for Liverpool is higher than ever,\" he said 10 days ago. \"You see the game they draw at Old Trafford or (against Everton): (Jordan) Pickford was exceptional. Against Palace, the chances they miss. Tell me the reason why... It's football.\"\n\nAll he asks for is that his players are ready to try -- \"to be there\", as he puts it. By this stage of the season, he has no doubts about that.\n\nGuardiola took his opportunity, live on the BBC, to rail against the scheduling after a combination of luck and sheer effort saw them beat Chelsea in the FA Cup despite the emotional and physical fatigue of that European shootout defeat. But other than that, he has had the air of a man completely at ease with his and his team's destiny.\n\nAs he says, he would trust his players even if they were to lose every match from here on in and with that being the case, what else is there to worry about? Other than how Brighton can hit you on the break or how dry Nottingham Forest's pitch could be.\n\nThose are the details that will occupy his mind at any point in the season but, when there is so much at stake, Guardiola always seems as calm as he possibly could be.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_lee@theathletic.com",

The recruitment strategy must be on point -- both for players and managerial staff, there should be little to no conflict in the dressing room, and the home stadium must be an impenetrable fortress. Winning away from home is incredibly difficult in the English top flight, so it is crucial to be solid at home and avoid defeat at all costs.\n\nToday, we will take a look at five teams that have shown what it is like to be unbeatable monsters at home. Continue reading to meet said five teams and check out the 10 longest home unbeaten runs in the history of the Premier League.\n\n#10 Manchester City -- 29 Matches*\n\nReigning champions Manchester City is kicking off the list, with them currently enjoying a stellar 29-game home unbeaten run at the Etihad Stadium. Pep Guardiola's team commenced their ruthless streak in December 2022, after falling to a 2-1 defeat to Brentford on November 12.\n\nManchester City need to avoid defeat in their next three Premier League matches to become the first-ever English team to win four league titles on the bounce. The last of the three matches is against West Ham United at the Etihad Stadium, which gives them the perfect opportunity to improve their position on this list.\n\n#9 Liverpool -- 29 Matches\n\nJurgen Klopp, who will step down as Liverpool's manager at the end of the 2023-24 season, successfully steered the team away from defeat 29 times between April 2021 and October 2022. The Reds finished second in the 2021-22 season, only a point behind champions Manchester City. Whereas in 2020-21, they finished third in the rankings.\n\nLeeds United ended Liverpool's fine run at Anfield on October 29, 2022, claiming a 2-1 victory over the Reds.\n\n#8 Arsenal -- 30 Matches\n\nBetween December 1997 and August 1999, Arsenal avoided defeat in 30 matches Premier League matches at Highbury, playing eye-catching soccer along the way. Arsene Wenger, who was in charge of the club at the time, guided the Gunners to the Premier League title in 1997-98 and a second-place finish the following season.\n\nThe north London outfit lost their unbeaten run four matches into the 1999-2000 season. On August 22, 1999, Manchester United rolled into town and claimed a 2-1 victory.\n\n#7 Liverpool -- 31 Matches\n\nKicking off the list is 19-time English champions Liverpool, who went 31 games without losing at Anfield Stadium between December 2007 and August 2009. Unfortunately, the Merseyside outfit could not win any Premier League title in that span, with Rafael Benitez taking them to a fourth-place finish in 2007-08 and a second-place finish the following season.\n\nLiverpool's unbeaten run at Anfield ended just three games into the 2009-10 season. On August 24, 2009, Aston Villa bagged a memorable 3-1 win at Anfield, sending shockwaves around England.\n\n#6 Arsenal -- 32 Matches\n\nA Premier League legend through and through, Arsene Wenger oversaw Arsenal's longest league unbeaten run in history between May 2003 and January 2005. The Gunners went 32 games without losing at home. During the run, Arsenal won their last title in the Premier League era. The north London powerhouse went 38 games unbeaten en route to glory in the 2003-04 season -- a record that stands proudly to this day.\n\nOn February 1, 2005, Arsenal suffered their first defeat at Highbury in almost two years. League rivals Manchester United were responsible for the end of their home unbeaten run, as they picked up a solid 4-2 victory.\n\n#5 Manchester United -- 35 Matches\n\nSir Alex Ferguson turned Old Trafford into hell for the opposition during his 26-season reign as Manchester United manager. Between December 1994 and October 1996, United recorded their then-longest unbeaten run of 35 matches in the Premier League. They won the Premier League title in 1995-96 and set up the stage for another win in the 1996-97 campaign.\n\nUnited's unbeaten run at Old Trafford ended on November 2, 1996, as Chelsea bagged a 2-1 victory. It marked their third defeat on the trot in the English top flight.\n\n#4 Manchester United -- 36 Matches\n\nIn fourth place, we once again have Manchester United, who enjoyed their Premier League-best home unbeaten run of 36 matches between December 1998 and December 2000. Sir Alex Ferguson was in charge of the Mancunians at the time, making it their second solid defeatless run under the legendary manager. United won two English top-flight titles (1998-99, 1999-2000) and set the stage for their third consecutive victory in 2000-01 in those two years.\n\nBitter foes Liverpool ended their 36-game run on December 17, 2000, beating them 1-0 at Old Trafford.\n\n#3 Manchester City -- 37 Matches\n\nShockingly, Manchester City's longest home unbeaten run of 37 matches did not come under the masterful Pep Guardiola. The brilliant run lasted between December 2010 and December 2012, under the keen eyes of Roberto Mancini. On May 13, 2012, the Cityzens played their most iconic match at the Etihad Stadium, beating Queens Park Rangers 3-2 in added time to claim their first Premier League title. City finished third in the league in the 2010-11 season and second in 2012-13.\n\nCrosstown rivals Manchester United finally breached Manchester City's fortress on December 9, 2012. The Red Devils bagged a narrow 3-2 win at the Etihad Stadium to end City's run.\n\n#2 Liverpool -- 68 Matches\n\nFeaturing for the third time on this list, Liverpool enjoyed their best-ever home unbeaten run between May 2017 and January 2021, going 68 matches unbeaten at Anfield Stadium. Jurgen Klopp's side won their maiden Premier League title (2019-20) during their triumphant run on Merseyside. They came fourth in 2017-18, second in 2018-19, and third in 2020-21.\n\nThe Anfield outfit ceded their unbeaten home run on January 21, 2021, to underdogs Burnley. Punching well above their weight, the visitors claimed a 1-0 victory in Liverpool's backyard.\n\n#1 Chelsea -- 86 Matches\n\nAt the summit sit west London powerhouse Chelsea, going a whopping 86 games unbeaten at Stamford Bridge between March 2004 and October 2008. The Pensioners achieved this astounding home run primarily under the tutelage of one of the finest managers of the 21st century -- Jose Mourinho.\n\nChelsea enjoyed their most dominant spell in the Premier League thanks to their sensational home run. They won consecutive league titles in the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons and finished second in 2006-07 and 2007-08. On October 26, 2008, Liverpool finally put an end to their home run, claiming a 1-0 victory at the Bridge.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"},

GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThis Premier League season has been one to remember, with goals aplenty, a title race that looks set to go down to the wire and a relegation battle that could end up doing the same.\n\nManchester City and Arsenal are vying for the crown at the top of the table, while Luton, Burnley and Nottingham Forest are all battling to stay in the Premier League, with two from three guaranteed to be relegated.\n\nThere have been plenty of star performers over the last nine months, and former Aston Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor, in his relatively new role as a pundit on talkSPORT, has picked out his 10 best players of the season. Declan Rice and Mohammed Salah are both snubbed, but there are plenty of predictable names on the list...\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Gabriel Agbonlahor is Aston Villa's all-time leading scorer in the Premier League with 73 goals - 14 more than Ollie Watkins on 59.\n\nGabby Agbonlahor's 10 best Premier League players in 23/24\n\nRank\n\nPlayer\n\nClub\n\n1\n\nPhil Foden\n\nManchester City\n\n2\n\nMartin Odegaard\n\nArsenal\n\n3\n\nCole Palmer\n\nChelsea\n\n4\n\nOllie Watkins\n\nAston Villa\n\n5\n\nBukayo Saka\n\nArsenal\n\n6\n\nRodri\n\nManchester City\n\n7\n\nEmiliano Martinez\n\nAston Villa\n\n8\n\nWilliam Saliba\n\nArsenal\n\n9\n\nErling Haaland\n\nManchester City\n\n10\n\nJarrod Bowen\n\nWest Ham\n\n10 Jarrod Bowen West Ham United\n\nJarrod Bowen is enjoying a brilliant season at West Ham and looks a decent bet to make it into England's squad for this summer's European Championship in Germany. He has scored 16 times in the Premier League, also registering six assists, and it's that kind of form that earned him a recall by Gareth Southgate for the October, November and March international breaks.\n\nBowen has some stiff competition on the right wing, with Bukayo Saka currently ahead of him in England's pecking order, but his performances for the Hammers can only be a good thing for his international chances.\n\nAgbonlahor told talkSPORT of Bowen: \"He's that guy at West Ham, he's got 15 goals in the Premier League in a team you can say doesn't play as attacking as other teams. I think with the squad being 26, he definitely goes to the Euros as well with England.\"\n\nJarrod Bowen's 2023-24 Premier League stats\n\nAppearances\n\n32\n\nGoals\n\n16\n\nAssists\n\n6\n\n9 Erling Haaland Manchester City\n\nErling Haaland scored 52 goals in 53 appearances for City last campaign, so any slight drop-off this time around was always likely to be scrutinised and that is exactly what has happened. Haaland still boasts a remarkable scoring record, with 32 goals in 40 appearances in all competitions, and he is the Premier League's top scorer with 21 goals - one more than former City teammate Cole Palmer.\n\nHaaland, however, has missed more big chances than any other player this season with 30 - four more than Darwin Nunez in second and eight more than even the derided Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson. Agbonlahor said: \"The standards he set last season, this season he has missed a lot of chances.\"\n\nErling Haaland's 2023-24 Premier League stats\n\nAppearances\n\n27\n\nGoals\n\n21\n\nAssists\n\n5\n\n8 William Saliba Arsenal\n\nArsenal have got the best defence in the Premier League and William Saliba's performances are a big factor in that. Gunners fans expected a lot of the Frenchman when he returned to the club in 2022 after a fruitful season on loan at Nice and he has delivered in brilliant fashion over the last two years.\n\nSaliba has been involved in more shut-outs than any other player in the division this season, with 16 clean sheets - two more than second-placed teammate David Raya and three more than defensive partner Gabriel.\n\nAgbonlahor praised Saliba off the back of his performance in the Community Shield win over Manchester City last August, saying: \"People don't want to take him on. If he can stay fit the whole season, then they will have a better chance [of winning the title].\"\n\nWilliam Saliba's 2023-24 Premier League stats\n\nAppearances\n\n35\n\nClean sheets\n\n16\n\n7 Emiliano Martinez Aston Villa\n\nEmiliano Martinez is more than just a wind-up merchant - he is also a very good goalkeeper. He will forever mostly be remembered by a lot of football fans for the manner of his celebration after Argentina won the 2022 World Cup, but that's not what Villa supporters primarily associate him with.\n\nOnly four goalkeepers have kept more clean sheets in the league than Martinez, who has also played a key role in the Villans' Europa Conference League campaign, performing penalty shoot-out heroics in their quarter-final win over Lille.\n\n\"There's a reason why he's the best goalkeeper in the world for me,\" Agbonlahor said of Martinez.\n\nEmiliano Martinez's 2023-24 Premier League stats\n\nAppearances\n\n33\n\nClean sheets\n\n8\n\n6 Rodri Manchester City\n\nRodri is coming to the end of his fifth season at City and over the last couple of years he has established himself as one of, if not the most important player in Pep Guardiola's team.\n\nThe Spaniard had big boots to fill at the Etihad but has gone strength to strength since Fernandinho's departure in 2022, and is now widely regarded as the best holding midfielder in the division, and perhaps even the world.\n\nRodri is currently on a remarkable run of not having lost a match in regulation time in his last 70 appearances for the club, a run that stretches back to a defeat by Tottenham in February 2023.\n\nRodri's 2023-24 Premier League stats\n\nAppearances\n\n30\n\nGoals\n\n7\n\nAssists\n\n7\n\n5 Bukayo Saka Arsenal\n\nBukayo Saka's output at Arsenal has improved in every season since he was promoted to the first team. The 22-year-old scored four goals in 2019-20, before seven goals the following season, then 12, then 15, and Saka is currently on 19 goals for the current campaign, the latest of which came in the Gunners' North London derby win over Tottenham a week ago.\n\nSaka is seemingly a shoo-in for England's starting line-up at the Euros and he will hope that he will be heading to Germany this summer as an English champion. Agbonlahor is a big fan of Saka and said last year that he would take the youngster over England legend David Beckham in his best Three Lions' XI of all time.\n\nBukayo Saka's 2023-24 Premier League stats\n\nAppearances\n\n33\n\nGoals\n\n15\n\nAssists\n\n9\n\n4 Ollie Watkins Aston Villa\n\nOllie Watkins looks to be well on the way to becoming a Villa legend, and his goals could well end up earning the club a place in the Champions League. Villa haven't competed in Europe's elite club tournament since winning it in 1983, and prior to this season had not figured at all in European competition since a run to the last 32 of the UEFA Cup in 2008-09.\n\nAgbonlahor said: \"Ollie Watkins, I wanted to put him higher because he has been outstanding. What he's done for Aston Villa this season - 19 Premier League goals, 12 assists, zero penalties - he's been outstanding, definitely goes to the Euros, and you can argue that he deserves to break into the starting team.\"\n\nOllie Watkins' 2023-24 Premier League stats\n\nAppearances\n\n34\n\nGoals\n\n19\n\nAssists\n\n12\n\n3 Cole Palmer Chelsea\n\nEyebrows were raised when Chelsea spent over \u00a340million on Cole Palmer last summer given the youngster had only started three times for Manchester City in the Premier League. Palmer has eliminated any doubts about his top-level quality, though, emerging as the talisman for Mauricio Pochettino's struggling team.\n\nMuch has been made of the amount of penalties Palmer has scored for Chelsea but his statistics would still be mightily impressive with spot-kicks taken away. Nine of Palmer's 25 goals have come from 12 yards, while has also registered 13 assists in all competitions.\n\n\"He's been outstanding, and when you watch him, he looks better with every game,\" Agbonlahor said. \"No Palmer against Arsenal (in the recent 5-0 defeat), no Chelsea. They really rely on Cole Palmer.\"\n\nCole Palmer's 2023-24 Premier League stats\n\nAppearances\n\n30\n\nGoals\n\n20\n\nAssists\n\n9\n\n2 Martin Odegaard Arsenal\n\nMartin Odegaard's story is a rare case of a wonderkid realising his potential. Real Madrid have an embarrassment of riches in their team but they must still rue letting Odegaard join Arsenal in 2021 having watched from afar just how good of a player he has developed into in North London.\n\nThe 25-year-old creative midfielder is not just a great player, but he is also a leader in this young Arsenal team, having embraced his captaincy role after being handed the armband by Mikel Arteta two years ago.\n\nAgbonlahor said: \"When you watch Odegaard, his first touch, his clever balls, he's an outstanding player and one Arsenal need to definitely keep for the rest of his career.\"\n\nMartin Odegaard's 2023-24 Premier League stats\n\nAppearances\n\n32\n\nGoals\n\n8\n\nAssists\n\n8\n\n1 Phil Foden Manchester City\n\nAgbonlahor reckons Phil Foden has been the best player in the Premier League this season, and it's difficult to argue with him. Foden has 24 goals and 10 assists in all competitions and has finally established himself as one of City's most important players after years of gradual progression under Pep Guardiola.\n\n\"Not many players in the Premier League are world class, Phil Foden is world class,\" Agbonlahor said. \"16 Premier League goals, he's the main man now. In previous seasons it's been De Bruyne. He's been outstanding, he can play anywhere across the front line, even as a false nine. We have to build a squad and a team at the Euros around Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham.\"\n\nPhil Foden's 2023-24 Premier League stats\n\nAppearances\n\n31\n\nGoals\n\n16\n\nAssists\n\n7\n\nAll

The one doubt is the Old Trafford game.\"\n\nI couldn't disagree more. If there is an Arsenal wobble coming, it's more likely to come here than against Manchester United. To put it simply, Bournemouth are a better side than United.\n\nI've spent most of the season watching the Cherries let me down when playing a top-five side. In nine fixtures, they have taken just one point, losing eight games to an aggregate score of 28-6. Ouch.\n\nBut I still believe this style of football under Andoni Iraola can beat the big boys. And I simply must back them here at a gigantic price. They are 12/1 with Sky Bet for the away win which is ludicrous for a team that have taken 42 points from their last 25 games. It's the fifth-best return of any Premier League side.\n\nGranted, my timeline is going to be full of after-timing Arsenal fans taking huge pleasure in proving me wrong when their side win 5-0, but I can't let Bournemouth go unbacked at those odds.\n\nThis has become a free-scoring fixture in the past two seasons with 13 goals scored in the last three meetings between these two, who do have a bit of history from a Championship play-off final that Fulham won in 2020. With both teams safely cuddled up in mid-table this could descend into another goal-fest - although the market does foresee that with over 2.5 goals a likely winner but woefully short at 4/7 with Sky Bet.\n\nWith an end-to-end nature expected, I'm happy to head to the total offsides market where four or more offsides looks to have a great chance at 10/11 with Sky Bet. Fulham have caught the opposition offside 90 times this season - the fourth highest in the Premier League - and when assessing the match-ups of these two teams, previous meetings have pointed to an avalanche of offsides. There's been 19 total match offsides in the last three games meaning an average of 6.3 per 90 minutes. The assistant referee will hopefully be very busy.\n\nBurnley's job over the next two games is to keep Nottingham Forest within two points. If they do that then the final-day showdown between the pair at Turf Moor could be a relegation shootout. That would be great fun.\n\nThe market is skewed far too in favour of Newcastle here in a game Burnley will be competitive in. The Toon are Evens with Sky Bet for the away win. No thanks.\n\nVincent Kompany's men have only lost one of their last eight Premier League games, taking 11 points during that run. It's kept them alive and kicking. Now they need to turn those draws into wins.\n\nThose that like to play the cards market should be encouraged to take advantage of some fancy prices in the player card options, especially with Anthony Taylor in charge. He's been dishing out cards like confetti this season - a whopping 120 in 24 matches, which makes him the strictest referee on the Premier League circuit.\n\nSean Longstaff (13/2 with Sky Bet) and Elliot Anderson (11/2 with Sky Bet) were both booked in the recent 1-0 defeat at Fulham and do look overpriced to go in again.\n\nCan we expect any sort of reaction from Sheffield United now their relegation has been confirmed? Perhaps a freedom to express themselves? Probably not.\n\nOn the last 12 occasions a team that has played a Premier League game with a relegation confirmed, they have failed to win, losing nine of those matches to an aggregate scoreline of 35-11.\n\nGames don't come more winnable than this for Nottingham Forest, who are 8/13 with Sky Bet to pick up maximum points. Can they deal with the pressure and expectation? I wouldn't be trusting them at those odds although they are of course the more likely winners.\n\nI'd rather take more of a punt and back Morgan Gibbs-White to score in the game at 11/4 with Sky Bet. A player of his ability really needs to be stepping up in games where the pressure to deliver is on. He is also their designated penalty taker and surely one spot-kick is going to drop their way sooner or later.\n\nManchester City are in title-winning robot mode. Having almost a week to prepare for this one is a huge factor and they are 1/11 with Sky Bet for the win for good reason.\n\nI do think Wolves are overpriced to score though at 6/5 with Sky Bet, especially now Hwang Hee-Chan and Matheus Cunha are fit and will give them a very explosive outlet on the counter-attack.\n\nWolves have been significantly stronger with both in the team. The win rate leaps from 26 per cent to 50 per cent when both start and the average goals per game increased from 1.1 to 1.6.\n\nCity have conceded in 32 of 44 games in the Premier League and Champions League this season - that's a 73 per cent strike rate for the opposition scoring.\n\nThat figure probably should be higher too as the two clean sheets they kept in the wins over Nottingham Forest and Chelsea came against the backdrop of some bulky expected goals against numbers. Chelsea failed to score from 1.4 and Forest managed to create 1.93 without finding the net.\n\nWolves can punish similar levels of generosity.\n\nAston Villa's Ezri Konsa is the most fouled defender in the Premier League this season. His 59 fouls won in his 32 games played in the Premier League this season puts him top of the tree for fouls won by defenders and his per-90 haul of 1.88 has him ranked fifth for defenders for that particular metric.\n\nHe has an extraordinary ability to draw fouls off the opposition when in possession. Unai Emery encourages his players to be brave and bold on the ball and Konsa has taken note.\n\nIf anything, his numbers are on the rise, too. He's won 24 fouls in his last nine games.\n\nWith Konsa likely to play through the middle on Sunday, it seems sensible to try and profit from his direct opposition in terms of their foul count. In this case that player is Danny Welbeck, who is 15/8 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls.\n\nWest Ham can be a team with a throw-in-the-towel mentality, especially when playing away from home. There was the 5-0 at Fulham and the recent 5-2 capitulation at Crystal Palace.\n\nThis makes their opposition very appealing across the handicap markets.\n\nThe Hammers have kept just one clean sheet in their last 21 Premier League away games? Can you guess where? A 2-0 away at Arsenal. That's bonkers.\n\nTheir overall defensive metrics since the turn of the year remain horrendous. They've conceded the third-most goals of any team in their last 16 Premier League games (35) and their expected goals against per-90 figure is 2.1, which is the second worst of any team for that period - behind only Luton.\n\nChelsea have lost only one of their last 18 home games in all competitions, scoring 52 goals. They are becoming a reliable team playing with great confidence in forward areas. They could run riot here. Chelsea to win by three or more goals at 4/1 with Sky Bet is a runner.\n\nThis could head down the path of being like an exhibition, friendly-like encounter. The probabilities are very high that Liverpool are going to finish third and Tottenham are going to finish fifth. The goals should flow in a backdrop of what might be a game that produces a low card count considering the lack of jeopardy on the line.\n\nAnd the amount of cards shown per game are on the decline. In the first 18 matchdays of the season there were 46.5 cards shown per matchday as referees were keen on clamping down on time-wasting and dissent.\n\nHowever, over the last five matchdays there have been just 32.2 cards per matchday with just one red card being shown in those 50 matches. So that's a drop of about 1.4 cards per game.\n\nThere were no cards shown at all in two Premier League games last weekend, in Nottingham Forest vs Manchester City and Newcastle vs Sheffield United meaning the \"no card\" option in the first player carded market landed at big odds. It's got a chance of going in again here at 28/1 with Sky Bet.\n\nThis is the worst Manchester United side in Premier League history, isn't it?\n\nCrystal Palace are favourites to win at Selhurst Park which tells you all you need to know about where the markets rate this United side, whose 12 league defeats this season is the most United have ever lost in a single Premier League campaign. I'm happy to back that number to become 13.\n\nOliver Glasner has got Palace running and pressing more while also encouraging his attacking players to play much more centrally. Michael Olise - who usually likes to get chalk on his boots - is playing more within the goalposts as seen by his poachers-like goal in the hammering of West Ham.\n\nThere is so much pace, power and intelligence in that area of the pitch from Palace and Harry Maguire and Casemiro could be seeing stars for the majority of this encounter trying to stop the likes of Olise. The 100/30 with Sky Bet on the Palace star to score in a home win looks a cracking bet to consider.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [],

That will come against Tottenham next Tuesday, with Mikel Arteta's side ironically relying on their bitter rivals to help their title bid.\n\nArsenal meanwhile will bring their campaign to end with a trip to Manchester United on Sunday, before hosting Everton on the final day. Even if they win those two games, it will not be enough to win the league if Pep Guardiola's side secure three more victories.\n\nThat is exactly the scenario Lineker believes will end up happening, with the Match of the Day host unsure Spurs will want to help their rivals. He did admit though that there could be a 'Sergio Aguero moment' on the final day.\n\n\"You can't go out and not try. I spoke to a couple of Tottenham fans yesterday and both of them said 'no, we can't help Arsenal to win the league',\" Lineker told The Rest Is Football podcast.\n\n\"I can never remember any conversation ahead of a match where you go 'not sure I want to win today'. Could be another Aguero moment. I think you might be right [ Manchester City to win all their games], but this is football and you never know.\"\n\nShearer agreed that City will end up lifting the title, though insisted Spurs will not roll over next week to prevent Arsenal winning the title. The England legend recalled Blackburn Rovers' title win in 1995 to make his point.\n\nIn that season, Blackburn headed to Liverpool on the final day knowing a defeat would allow Manchester United to win the title if they beat West Ham. Though Liverpool are famously bitter rivals of United, Rovers lost 2-1 at Anfield, with Shearer scoring their goal.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Who will win the Premier League title? Comment below.\n\nBoth Lineker and Alan Shearer believe Manchester City will win the title\n\nBut United were unable to defeat the Hammers, allowing Blackburn to win the title by one point. While Shearer believes that any drop in performance from Spurs will see them lose, he insisted they will still be desperate to beat City.\n\n\"You're talking about the integrity of players. We had that scenario at Blackburn, when we had to go to Anfield last day of the season, it was either us winning the title or Man United. So you're thinking Liverpool were going to do us a right favour,\" he added.\n\n\"It was such a weird atmopshere because the fans were aware of it, they didn't want Man United to win at West Ham which meant they would have had a chance of winning the title, it was really weird.\n\n\"In the end everyone was happy apart from Man United, because Liverpool won, we won the title. But you can't ever question the players' integrity. But if you're that much off it then it does make a difference.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Moyes has pulled up trees there, won a European trophy. Solid seventh, eighth, ninth, top half of the table again.\n\nI'm not saying it'll happen overnight, what happened to Charlton, but I remember many years ago when I played their fans were asking to get rid of Alan Curbishley, saying it was boring, middle of the table, they wanted to kick on.\n\nThey've never been seen since. This manager is top, top drawer. They won a European trophy! It's just madness.\n\nI wouldn't have got rid of him in a month of Sundays. You'll get West Ham fans coming back, saying this and that, throwing every stat in the world. But I'll just throw you the biggest stat of them all. He. Won. You. A. Trophy.\n\nI don't care all about this entertaining football, we don't play that well, we should be doing better with these players. They won a trophy! You look at Arsenal, they're unbelievable and they could end up with nothing.\n\nI said before, Fulham was the only game which could trouble Man City. You look at it at the moment, what chance have Tottenham got? What chance have West Ham got? This is the only game.\n\nFulham were at Brentford last week and got a 0-0. But the moment Man City score, you can't see Fulham netting two or three. Hopefully they'll make it a hard game, but I said a while back when Arsenal lost to Aston Villa, I didn't give them a chance.\n\nThey've done great to stay in there, if I'm honest. They haven't done anything wrong, bar one game against a team who are a good side - but can't win a game now! This is why people go on about playing for big clubs - this is the difference, everyone wants to beat you.\n\nSince then, Villa have hung on against Chelsea, got turned over by Olympiakos and then been beaten by Brighton.\n\nFulham's the last-chance saloon. If they win that game, it's over.\n\nChelsea haven't been consistent enough. They've been good in the cups - that's what sometimes happens when you're a young team.\n\nThey're doing well at the moment, fair play, and they're right in the race for Europe. For me, they've got to get in - they've got into a final, a semi-final, they were bang unlucky in both, and it could turn out to still be not a bad season.\n\nBut they'll have to go and buy players, and not sit and think that they got it right all along. No, they haven't. They're miles off Man City and Arsenal. You've got to look at the all-round picture.\n\nThey've got to bring in experience in the summer. It looks like Thiago Silva's going, he's their main experienced player.\n\nSo they've got to add to that, you need that if you want consistency when things aren't going too well, and they can just calm it down a bit. They probably need an experienced centre-half to take Silva's place, and they could do with another centre-forward too.\n\nThey want to be getting into the Champions League next year, surely. So they've got to start bridging the gap to Arsenal and Man City.\n\nThis is Chelsea, not a run-of-the-mill team. Chelsea are used to winning things, they want to win stuff - not finish fourth in the league like Tottenham wanted to do, and celebrate about it.\n\nI can't see how Poch isn't in charge next season, though nothing surprises you. I haven't thought they should ever get rid of him, he's a good manager. Individuals don't win anything, and as long as they can keep sorting that out and keep playing as a team now, they'll be alright.\n\nI've said before, it's not going to be the same next year for Tottenham. This is one of those situations where you look at it and go yeah, free hit, free hit, it's a lot better than last year.\n\nBut there's no way they're having this next year, getting beaten by four and five, having no Plan B. That's what's happened though.\n\nEveryone's jumped on the set plays. He'll be working on them - the man's a good coach. But every time they let in a goal from one now, they're in trouble.\n\nEverybody loved him, the press loved him, everyone did unless you were an Arsenal fan. Now everyone's jumping on him.\n\nI like Ange, don't get me wrong. For a neutral, he's brilliant. If you're a fan, I'm not so sure. It's easy to live with that philosophy when you're manager of Celtic. 'We're going to go out and play front-foot football.'\n\nYou can't do that at Tottenham. No disrespect, but you can do that at Celtic. If you open the game up there, you have a shot, we have a shot, you win the game. It's not the case at Spurs.\n\nYou've got to be cute, that's why people like Mourinho and Conte went in and played the way they played. They could've gone in and played like that, weighed it up and said they'd win a lot of games - but in the big ones, you'd get rinsed.\n\nHe's got to change next season. Tottenham fans are getting restless already; their season ranks on stopping Arsenal winning the league now. You can't keep on living like that, and the players have got to stand up as well.\n\nMaddison's come back from injury, he hasn't touched the ball. It's not just the manager, he did have injuries, but you can't just keep on doing what you're doing. I like him, I like the way they play, but it's no good if you're a fan.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ange_Postecoglou", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ange Postecoglou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Merson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Merson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Curbishley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alan Curbishley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton_Athletic_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlton Athletic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympiacos F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentford_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brentford F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/05/1600x900/skysports-graphic-west-ham_6545497.png?20240506163123", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535861", "eventUri": "eng-9535861", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

They followed Championship winners Burnley and second-placed Sheffield United in earning promotion to the top flight.\n\nFollow the latest action from the Premier League below.\n\nFulham came very close to a full three points against Crystal Palace last weekend, only to be denied by a thunderbolt of a strike by Jeffrey Schlupp. While a spot in Europe next season seems quite out of reach, Marco Silva's team still has the chance to push for a Top 10 spot at the end of the season. However, they need more of those full three points, starting from this game against their West London rivals. Injuries are not a real concern for Silva, who will have an almost full squad to choose from. Having said that, Tosin Adarabioyo remains a doubt after he was left out of the squad last weekend in light of his refusal to sign a new Fulham contract. The Cottagers will also seek revenge after a convincing 0-3 loss to the Bees at Craven Cottage in the reverse fixture.\n\n14:34\n\nBrentford come into the West London derby against Fulham on the back of a 0-1 defeat at Goodison Park last week. But a stretch of five unbeaten games before that has helped them stay up for next season. While there is nothing big left to fight for in the remainder of the season, there is an opportunity for the Bees to end the table a few spots higher than 16th and manager Thomas Frank will likely throw all at it. They will have the services of Neal Maupay again after he missed out last week, but the likes of Aaron Hickey, Joshua Dasilva, and Rico Henry continue to miss out.

His absence last season coincided with an almighty defensive meltdown and that was no coincidence. Saliba bailed out Arsenal twice on Saturday as he recovered superbly in the first half to deny Dominic Solanke after Gabriel's mistake, then turned on the jets to stop Justin Kluivert's counter and calmly keep possession of the ball. Saliba reminds you of prime Virgil van Dijk: So calm, powerful, and efficient in everything he does. He even made a marauding run forward and should have scored in the first half as the similarities with Van Dijk are clear. Arsenal keeping another clean sheet, their 17 of the season (most in the PL) and conceding just 28 goals (the fewest in the PL) is in large part down to Saliba's incredible calmness, durability and solidity. Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, and Declan Rice get plenty of praise and rightly so, but there is a legitimate claim to be made that William Saliba is Arsenal's most important player. When he's not there, everything falls apart. Luckily Arsenal haven't been without him this season. Saliba is one of those players who makes everyone around him better and more comfortable. He's Arsenal's MVP. -- Joe Prince-Wright\n\nErling Haaland's injury deprived him of the chance to challenge his single-season Premier League record for goals, but his four-spot on Saturday run his goal-per-minute to one for every 91.88 minutes in league play. While that's about a quarter-hour off from debut season -- one for every 77.14 minutes -- it is still pretty darn good and comes in a season in which Kevin De Bruyne missed the first 20 PL games and Haaland missed matches 16 through 21. While other good teams missed plenty more stars this season, City was without two FIFA Best XI players for considerable stretches of this hopeful fourth-straight title run. What's more? Twenty-four year old Julian Alvarez has come into his own, now onto 10 goals and nine assists in PL play this season. Pep Guardiola rebuilds on the fly as well as anyone, and City could seal a title while looking to the league and saying, \"Is that the best you could do?\" -- Nick Mendola\n\nIt looks like Chelsea could finish in the European spots after all and given everything they have been through this season that would be a remarkable achievement. Chelsea won't spend much this summer and they probably don't need to. Defensively they will have key players back and that is the main area where Chelsea can improve, as even in this mauling they gave up big chances and had the crossbar to thank on three occasions for not conceding. Going forward and in midfield they look pretty set as the quartet of Madueke, Palmer, Jackson and Gallagher have clicked in attack. Not having to bed in new players and introduce your philosophy during preseason will be a huge help to Pochettino, and the finish to this season will have bought him more time as things are clearly heading in the right direction at Chelsea. With Liverpool having a new manager, Spurs' project under Postecoglou stalling, Manchester United struggling on and Aston Villa unlikely to maintain their upward trend with Champions League football likely, Chelsea will have a legitimate chance of finishing in the top four next season. -- Joe Prince-Wright\n\nThe laundry list of injuries hoisted upon Eddie Howe's Magpies this made a European return feel unlikely at points this season, but the attacking quality is so good that the points have piled up. It sure helps that Manchester United and West Ham United have wildly underachieved in the second half of the season, but that disclaimer needs to be followed in bold by the world-class talent of Alexander Isak and Bruno Guimaraes (and, perhaps, an emerging superstar in young Anthony Gordon). The duo will be recruited hard this summer but are electric and capable of performing on the highest stages. Their goals and playmaking have helped overcome injuries to key pieces like Sven Botman, Kieran Trippier, Joelinton, and Callum Wilson. The last two names were back on the pitch by the end of the game Saturday -- Wilson started and played so well with his goal and would-be assist -- and reminded everyone that Newcastle's project might've been ahead of schedule last season, but look on that initial schedule now with a possible Europa League qualification. -- Nick Mendola\n\nTottenham had a few good minutes early at Anfield, then largely went to bed for the better part of an hour. It felt like perhaps the season of learning and playing Ange Postecoglou's exuberant and energetic system had finally sucked the players dry (Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds vibes, honestly). But Richarlison's entry led to a goal and Tottenham suddenly seemed to realize this wasn't a dead end. Liverpool, of course, doesn't ever stop playing open football and so we got a nice and entertaining finish (for everyone but Jurgen Klopp). Both of the these teams need their summer recharge, as Arne Slot (presumably) will try to reinvigorate a good but fading Liverpool and Postecoglou will seek to find more players who want to play his way. Spurs can't quit their charge because of who's coming up behind them -- let alone Aston Villa's still-congested Run-in -- but the North Londoners can clearly use for a rest. -- Nick Mendola\n\nUnai Emery's Aston Villa have run out of steam, seemingly proven Sunday after being hinted by their 4-2 defeat at home to Olympiacos in the Europa Conference League semifinal first leg on Thursday. Villa never got going at Brighton and looked so sluggish. The Villans were never able to gain control of the game. This is understandable given how intense their season has been with the Thursday-Sunday grind and that they've reached the final four of the Conference League and are close to clinching Champions League qualification in the Premier League. Villa's squad has been stretched to its limits and they have achieved great things. But they were so far off it at Brighton that it doesn't bode well for the second leg of their Conference League semifinals at Olympiacos on Thursday as Emery aims to oversee a remarkable comeback. -- Joe Prince-Wright\n\nIt was the kind of performance that Callum Hudson-Odoi was expected to deliver in future title races at Chelsea not so long ago, not relegation fights at Forest. But Forest fans will be singing the 23-year-old's name in the East Midlands this weekend after scoring first to pull Forest level at 1-1 in the 27th minute, then again to make it 3-1 in the 65th. Hudson-Odoi's first goal was of the highest quality, turning and instinctively curling the ball toward the far post from just inside the penalty area. The second wasn't as impressive for the quality of finish, as it was for the shifty dribbling and beating of the defender before sticking another right-footed finish far post. In truth, Hudson-Odoi should have had a hat trick as he pinged a nearly identical chance off the outside of the post just a couple minutes earlier. -- Andy Edwards\n\nAn overhead kick that slams into keeper Jordan Pickford. A shot through traffic just deflected out by Jarrad Branthwaite. Oh, Luton, you were so close to a winner on Friday -- even getting the rub of the green on two possible penalties -- and that's been the story so often this season. Granted most of their \"almosts\" came much earlier in the season, like the 4-4 draw with Newcastle that could've been a win, the 3-2 loss at Chelsea that featured a 2.64-1.57 goal differential advantage for the Hatters, and a similar September loss to West Ham (There were points won that shouldn't have been, too, but we digress). That said, three points were necessary at home against a team that has very little but vacation left in its plans. Luton will regret this match as much as any this season (including the stunning loss to Sheffield United). You have to beat the lower-half sides to stay up. Now Rob Edwards' men need to defeat tougher foes in West Ham and/or Fulham. -- Nick Mendola\n\nIvan Toney will be a hugely exciting signing for one of the Premier League's top-half sides this summer, not only for the goals he's scored while at Brentford but also for his impact in so many facets of the game, and that makes the upcoming transfer window incredibly intriguing (and important) for the Bees. The goals (36 in 81 PL games) will get most of the headlines, but Toney is more of a complete player than he is typically credited. His presence improves Brentford defensively because he always offers a safe out-ball from the back, able to win (and keep) the long ball with the best of them; Toney is a monster defender on set pieces (all the more important with injuries at center back); He's also an underrated playmaker on counter-attacks, attempting -- and completing -- long-range passes at a rate well above average. Replacing Toney won't be too dissimilar from what Tottenham have endured this season following Harry Kane's departure. Fundamentally, everything about the way that Brentford play will be touched by Toney's departure, as he's a key figure in just about all of it. -- Andy Edwards\n\nWill the Clarets, now very likely to go down given Forest's win over Sheffield United, be able to bounce right back up next season in the Championship? You'd bet on it if they keep manager Vincent Kompany, who will be in demand next season whether Burnley miraculously stay up or go down to the Championship. He's got good plans but his pieces are good enough. Lorenz Assignon and Maxime Esteve were good additions in January but really needed to come over the summer. Will Kompany stay if a bigger job comes calling? -- Nick Mendola", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Despite the lack of confirmation that seventh place will secure a European spot, Eddie Howe's Newcastle aim to snatch sixth place away from Manchester United.\n\nNewcastle arrive at Burnley off the back of an emphatic 5-1 victory over Sheffield United, while Burnley earned a hard-fought point at Old Trafford in their previous outing. With both teams fighting for their respective goals, this fixture promises to be a challenging one to predict.\n\nMost players backed: Burnley 1 - 2 Newcastle\n\nSheffield United v Nottm Forest | Saturday 15:00 | Make your prediction here\n\nThe game against already relegated Sheffield United presents Nottingham Forest with a golden opportunity in their quest to remain in the Premier League. Despite being winless in their last four matches, Forest must start accumulating points to distance themselves from Luton and Burnley at the bottom of the table.\n\nWith a crucial six-pointer against Burnley on the horizon on the final day of the season, and a trip to Chelsea before that, a fixture against a dejected Sheffield side seems perfectly timed.\n\nMost players backed: Sheffield 1 - 2 Nottingham Forest\n\nMan City v Wolves | Saturday 17:30 | Make your prediction here\n\nManchester City continue their title charge as they host Wolves at the Etihad. Pep's men remain undefeated in domestic competition in 2024, and many would expect business as usual this weekend. With De Bruyne fully recovered from his injury, and Haaland back on the scoresheet after a goal drought by his standards, anything less than three points here would be considered a slip-up.\n\nWolves managed to end their rut of poor form with a win against relegation-threatened Luton last time out. Gary O'Neil's side will be looking to cause drama at the top of the table and complete a surprising double over the reigning champions after a 2-1 victory at Molineux back in September.\n\nMost players backed: Man City 3 - 0 Wolves\n\nBet \u00a310 on this weekend's Premier League action and Get \u00a330 in Free Bets - T&Cs Apply\n\nView the latest Sports News here\n\nBrighton v Aston Villa | Sunday 14:00 | Make your prediction here\n\nAfter falling to an unconvincing defeat against Olympiacos in the Conference League, Villa will need to bounce back to strengthen their hopes of playing Champions League football next season. Currently sat seven points above fifth placed Tottenham, three points for Unai Emery's men against an inconsistent Brighton would ensure a top 4 finish if Liverpool manage to beat Spurs at Anfield.\n\nMost players backed: Brighton 1 - 2 Aston Villa\n\nChelsea v West Ham | Sunday 14:00 | Make your prediction here\n\nA third London derby in four games awaits Chelsea as they face West Ham, as the Blues are chasing down a spot in Europe next season. With only two points separating the two teams in the table, and West Ham having won the earlier fixture this season, it comes as a tough game to predict.\n\nHowever, Chelsea's impressive home form, having suffered only one loss in their last 11 matches at Stamford Bridge, includes eight wins. It may prove tricky for David Moyes' team to come away from West London with a positive result.\n\nMost players backed: Chelsea 2 - 1 West Ham\n\nLiverpool v Spurs | Sunday 16:30 | Make your prediction here\n\nChelsea did Liverpool a favour by securing their top four finish after beating Tottenham midweek. Liverpool can pile more misery on Spurs if they beat them on Sunday, as a win for Aston Villa combined with a Liverpool home victory would end Tottenham's Champions League aspirations.\n\nLiverpool are all-but out of the title race and even if they do their job, they will still need Arsenal and City to slip up to come back into contention.\n\nMost players backed: Liverpool 2 - 1 Tottenham\n\nBet \u00a310 on this weekend's Premier League action and Get \u00a330 in Free Bets - T&Cs Apply\n\n6 Scores Challenge Terms and Conditions\n\nFor full details on gameplay, please refer to our 6 Scores Challenge rules.

The Eagles stormed past Erik ten Hag's side at Selhurst Park on Monday night, extending their unbeaten streak to five games.\n\nPalace burst out of the gates, with Michael Olise breaking the deadlock inside the opening quarter of an hour. Jean-Philippe Mateta then doubled the home side's lead shortly before half-time, netting his ninth goal in his last 11 Premier League games.\n\nTyrick Mitchell then etched himself onto the scoresheet in the second half. A few moments later, Olise doubled his tally for the evening with a brilliant strike to put the final nail in the coffin. Following defeat in south London, Man United squandered the opportunity to leapfrog Chelsea and Newcastle in the race for Europa League qualification.\n\nBut, with three games left to play, a lot could still change before the curtain drops. So, with that being said, football.london has looked at how Chelsea can secure European football.\n\nPremier League\n\nItaly and Germany have claimed the additional Champions League qualifying places, so only the top four in the Premier League will go into next season's revised competition. Aston Villa only need three more points from their last two games to join Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\nOnly Tottenham Hotspur can rival Unai Emery's side for a place in the top four. Fifth place will qualify for next season's Europa League, with the team going straight into the new setup rather than playing any additional pre-qualifiers.\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham wage bill compared to Premier League rivals\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal transfer decision vindicated as Rio Ferdinand and Peter Crouch proven wrong\n\nWhile Chelsea trail Spurs in fifth by six points with only a few games to spare, fifth place remains possible. However, the Blues would have to rely on Newcastle, Manchester United AND Tottenham to drop points - which is unlikely.\n\nFA Cup\n\nWhile Chelsea aren't, of course, in the FA Cup final, the competition still throws the club a lifeline of some sort. The winners of the FA Cup will claim a place in the Europa League. If the winners finish in the top five of the Premier League - and therefore qualify for the Champions League or Europa League through their league position - the Europa League spot will be passed down to the next-highest ranked English top-flight outfit not competing in Europe.\n\nPermutations\n\nIf Manchester United don't finish in the top five but win the FA Cup then they qualify for the Europa League, with sixth place claiming the Europa Conference League.\n\nBut, if Manchester City win the FA Cup then Europa League qualification will be awarded to team ranked fifth and sixth, while seventh place claims Europa Conference League. So, Chelsea can finish seventh and still secure European football on the basis that Pep Guardiola's side defeat the Red Devils at Wembley.\n\nCurrent Standings\n\nManchester United currently sit eighth on 54 points, while, Newcastle rank sixth on 56 points and Chelsea place seventh on 54 points. All three teams have three Premier League games left.\n\nRemaining Fixtures\n\nManchester United\n\nArsenal (H) - Sunday, May 12\n\nNewcastle United (H) - Wednesday, May 15\n\nBrighton (A) - Sunday, May 19\n\nNewcastle United\n\nBrighton (H) - Saturday, May 11\n\nMan United (A) - Wednesday, May 15\n\nBrentford (A) - Sunday, May 19\n\nChelsea\n\nNottingham Forest (A) - Saturday, May 11\n\nBrighton (A) - Wednesday, May 15\n\nBournemouth (H) - Sunday, May 19", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_stokes@football.london",

{"id": 232061072, "title": "23 Best Father's Day Gifts for Every Type of Dad in 2024", "text": "Every dad deserves a good knife. Something that looks nice, is relatively easy to maintain, and will last a while. There are a ton of inexpensive knives on Amazon in a shockingly wide range of quality, and the bad ones are really quite bad. If you want to gift someone a truly nice knife, my first recommendation is usually something from The James Brand. The Chapter 2 is a simple-looking knife with a ton of quality parts. The scale, clip and spacer are all 6AL-4V titanium, the drop point blade is S35VN stainless steel with a black coating, which means it's resistant to scratches even when you're doing something silly with it. This is a great-looking small knife, and the sealed ceramic bearings mean the blade both opens and closes with nearly perfect smoothness. This is a knife for actually doing things, while looking like something you'd see in a display case as a collectible. If you've got a dad in your life who would like a quality EDC knife, this is where to start.", "summary": "Father's Day stumping you?

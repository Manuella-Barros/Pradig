In April Charlotte, 32, revealed she was expecting her \u2018miracle\u2019 first child, a baby girl, after previously suffering miscarriages. She did not disclose the identity of the father until this week, when the Traitors UK star told Metro.co.uk it is 31-year-old singer Conor Maynard. Charlotte exclusively told us that she met singer Conor, 31, at Raffles nightclub on the night the final of the Traitors aired \u2013 January 26. Now, images have emerged that show Conor in what looked to be in an uncomfortable exchange with his reported new girlfriend. Conor wore a purple hoodie and cap, with the mystery woman sporting a grey jumper and jeans, as the pair left the singer\u2019s sister\u2019s birthday drinks at what looked to be Peartree Cafe in Battersea Park. This comes as Charlotte Chilton revealed he was the father of her child (Picture: MJ-Pictures.com) This new mystery woman didn\u2019t look too happy (Picture: MJ-Pictures.com) The pair had been for Conor\u2019s sister\u2019s birthday drinks in Battersea Park (Picture: MJ-Pictures.com) They looked fairly loved up at the drinks (Picture: MJ-Pictures.com) But while walking through the park, the atmosphere looked tense as his reported new girlfriend appeared to be upset. During the drinks a picture of him lovingly looking down at his new flame was a stark contrast to scenes after the park drinks. Charlotte, who appeared on BBC show The Traitors last year, told us how she didn\u2019t initially tell Maynard that she was expecting due to her previous miscarriages. Charlotte revealed the father of her dad was Conor in an interview with Metro.co.uk(Picture: Ken McKay/ITV/Shutterstock) But a few weeks after finding out, she did, and said he was \u2018lovely\u2019 about it. However, she felt his tone change and progressive conversations worsened, in Charlotte\u2019s opinion, as Conor expressed that he was not ready to be a dad. Charlotte thought the best course of action was to give him time, and hoped he\u2019d come round to the idea. He hasn\u2019t yet spoken out about the revelation (Picture: MJ-Pictures.com) But it appears this new relationship may have taken a recent hit (Picture: MJ-Pictures.com) The name of Conor\u2019s new flame is not known (Picture: MJ-Pictures.com) \u2018The minute I started talking about co-parenting and being understanding of his work schedule, he obviously was a bit disappointed that I was doing that,\u2019 she continued, sharing that she sent him pictures of her 12-week scan. \u2018I messaged \u201cFeel free to respond whenever you\u2019re ready\u201d as I was annoyed at that point,\u2019 she said. She then shared: I\u2019m doing this on my own. I don\u2019t need him. I don\u2019t need his money. I would only want him involved if he wanted to be\u2026 Ultimately, when she\u2019s older it\u2019ll be her decision. Conor has not contacted Charlotte since she spoke about him being the father of her child. \u2018I don\u2019t know whether it has got back to Conor, but I just wanted to get out there and to just kind of say this is not acceptable.\u2019 She added: \u2018Families come in all shapes and sizes. I love my step dad. One day, if I marry a man or a woman, they could be there for her. No matter what, she\u2019ll be surrounded by love. \u2018I didn\u2019t plan this situation but it is a miracle.\u2019 Metro.co.uk has contacted Conor Maynard\u2019s representatives for comment on Charlotte Chilton\u2019s claims.

{"id": 243365170, "title": "Say no to 0.5% Pleasanton sales tax: Letter to the editor", "text": "The Pleasanton City Council is using scare tactics to ramrod a permanent half-cent sales tax increase to the citizens. The City Council has made some minor concessions to reduce the budget, but they can find more savings by simply placing a few of the very expensive capital improvement projects on hold. These projects can easily fund the $13 million budget shortfall, and when the economy recovers and the normal tax base returns, the city can move forward with the improvement projects. Please remember that an increase to the sales tax is permanent, as in forever. Do not be fooled by the scare tactics and urge the City Council to place some of the capital improvement projects on hold. No new taxes.

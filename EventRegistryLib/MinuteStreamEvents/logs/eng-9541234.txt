A second-round series between the Panthers and Bruins starts Monday night in South Florida, the two best teams in the Atlantic Division squaring off with a trip to the NHL's final four on the line.

This season, they're meeting in the second round in a series sure to feature bad blood and revenge as narratives in a matchup that's quickly becoming a rivalry.\n\nTo get here, the Panthers defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games. The Bruins went to seven games against the Toronto Maple Leafs, ending in Boston on Saturday with a 2-1 overtime win on a goal by David Pastrnak that provided a quick turnaround to their next opponent.\n\nThe Bruins have defeated the Panthers four times this season, twice in overtime. But the games that really mattered came last spring, when Boston went in as the prohibitive favorites after setting regular-season records for wins (65) and points (135), only to fall to Florida after leading the best-of-7 series 3-1.\n\n\"There are no secrets,\" Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. \"We're divisional rivals. We played each other four times. And seven (in the playoffs last season). We've played each other enough. We understand each other.\"\n\nThere's no question the Bruins are looking for a different outcome this time.\n\n\"We have a real tough test coming ahead and we know that,\" coach Jim Montgomery said. \"We haven't won anything yet. We've just earned the right to play in the second round.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Panthers have their eyes set on a return trip to the Stanley Cup Final, where they were propelled after the series win against the Bruins in 2023.\n\nDoes that make them the favorite?\n\n\"I think it's more for you to decide,\" Florida captain Aleksander Barkov said. \"We just play our game. We know how to play, we know how to play hard and that's what we're going to do. We have the same mindset as last year. We want to outcompete every team we play, so it doesn't matter who we play. We want to be at our best in every game, so it's not our decision to decide who's favored and who's not.\"\n\nGame breakers\n\nPanthers: Though the Panthers have some dangerous weapons in Barkov, Sam Reinhart and Matthew Tkachuk, Carter Verhaeghe is who the Bruins have to worry about the most. He led Florida with five goals in the first round and his nine points tied Tkachuk for the team lead. Verhaeghe scored in overtime to win Game 2. Over the past two postseasons he has five game-winning goals, three in OT including Game 7 against the Bruins last season. When the game is tight, keep an eye on Verhaeghe.\n\nBruins: Brad Marchand proved his mettle leading the Bruins to their first-round win against the Maple Leafs. He took over in Games 3 and 4 with three goals and two assists and finished the series with eight points (three goals, five assists). It's not just his ability to produce. The Bruins feed off the emotion and fire of their captain, making his understanding of the gamesmanship in the playoffs just as important as the points he's producing.", "source": {"uri": "nhl.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NHL.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amalie_benjamin@nhl.com", "name": "Amalie Benjamin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Verhaeghe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carter Verhaeghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_ratio16_9-size50/v1714966899/prd/s39uucr53uewwym9bjqg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541234", "eventUri": "eng-9541234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

A second-round series between the Panthers and Bruins starts Monday night in South Florida, the two best teams in the Atlantic Division squaring off with a trip to the NHL's final four on the line.

The Bruins held a 3-1 series lead but needed overtime in Game 7 to advance.\n\nThe Panthers advanced with a five-game victory against the Tampa Bay Lightning, who were the first wild card from the East.\n\nBoston went 4-0-0 against Florida during the regular season, with two of those wins coming in overtime.\n\nWho will win this second-round series full of revenge and intrigue? That's the question before staff writers Amalie Benjamin and Tom Gulitti.\n\nBenjamin: The obvious answer is that the Panthers will defeat the Bruins in their second-round series. But why take the obvious choice? I'm instead looking at the X-factors, not just the regular season, where the matchup favored the Bruins. Boston went 4-0-0 against the Panthers this season, four games when they played some of their absolute best hockey. But I'm also looking at the revenge the Bruins will be out for after losing to the Panthers in seven games in the first round last season after going up 3-1 in the best-of-7 series. Add in the fact that the Bruins might have gotten some of their kinks out in a grueling seven-game series against the Maple Leafs -- and the Panthers could have gone cold during their week off -- and I think the Bruins can try to ride their emotions and their momentum into a couple of early series wins. It sure won't be easy, but hockey can be a game of intangibles. These Bruins have been tested and they passed (if narrowly). They'll bring that against Florida.\n\nGulitti: I don't know if the Panthers are the obvious answer to who will win this series, but I think they are the favorites this time after being heavy underdogs when they met last season. Back then, Florida barely squeaked into the playoffs as the second wild card from the East and the Bruins were the Presidents' Trophy winners who set NHL records in points (135) and wins (65). After playing through some injuries at the start of this season and finishing first in the Atlantic Division, Florida looks like the same team that reached the Cup Final last season before losing to the Vegas Golden Knights and is driven to get back there and win it this time. The Panthers dispatched the Lightning in five games in the first round and will enter this series with confidence from defeating the Bruins last season and the belief they are a better team than a year ago. Carter Verhaeghe (five goals, four assists) and Brady Tkachuk (three goals, six assists), who were the scoring heroes against Boston last season, each had nine points in the first round. And, unlike last season when Alex Lyon was the Panthers' starting goalie at the beginning of the series, Sergei Bobrovsky is in top form after being voted a finalist for the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's best goalie.\n\nBenjamin: You want to talk goaltending? I'll talk goaltending with you. Jeremy Swayman stood on his head throughout the entirety of the series against the Maple Leafs, culminating in allowing just a single goal-against in Game 7. He finished the series with a 4-2 record, giving up just two goals against in each of the losses, with a 1.49 goals-against average in the series, with a .950 save percentage. And that's against the second-best offense in the regular season in the Maple Leafs (3.63 goals per game). But I don't expect the Bruins to just use Swayman in the series; I expect them to go back to Linus Ullmark as well. Ullmark, who allowed three goals on 34 shots in his only start against Toronto, was outstanding against the Panthers in the regular season, going 3-0-0 with a 1.62 GAA and .957 save percentage, and Swayman won his only start against Florida, allowing three goals on 21 shots. The goalies give the Bruins the utmost confidence and, if as Matthew Tkachuk said Sunday that the series might be a low-scoring contest, the goaltending might be the difference-maker for Boston.\n\nGulitti: I should at least get an assist for setting you up for the goaltending debate. There's no question Swayman was outstanding against the Maple Leafs and during the regular season. I know that the Bruins rotated goalies all season, but they should stick with Swayman now and ride the hot hand. That Boston might switch to Ullmark at some point could benefit Florida; I think Bobrovsky can match either goalie, but even if that isn't the case and the Bruins end up having a slight edge in that category with Swayman (if he plays every game), the Panthers are the deeper team otherwise. Florida had four players with at least 70 points during the regular season -- Sam Reinhart (94), Tkachuk (88), Aleksander Barkov (80) and Verhaeghe (72) -- and the Bruins had one -- David Pastrnak (110). Beginning the series without Sam Bennett (apparent hand injury) will hurt, but Florida can compensate at least briefly for that. And the Panthers' defense, which has Oliver Ekman-Larsson in the third pair, is actually stronger than last season.", "source": {"uri": "nhl.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NHL.com"}, "authors":

(AP) - There are no shortage of storylines for this Florida-Boston rematch.\n\nThere\u00b4s the Panthers, trying to move another step closer toward a return to the Stanley Cup Final. There\u00b4s the Bruins, looking to avenge a shocking upset in a Round 1 series last season. The rested Panthers having just gotten a few days off, the razor-sharp Bruins rolling in after a Game 7 overtime win over Toronto.\n\nFlorida coach Paul Maurice summed it all up succinctly.\n\n\"None of that matters when the puck drops,\" Maurice said.\n\nHe\u00b4s probably right. A second-round series between the Panthers and Bruins starts Monday night in South Florida, the two best teams in the Atlantic Division squaring off with a trip to the NHL\u00b4s final four on the line. Florida rallied from a 3-1 deficit to stun Boston in Round 1 a year ago, and the Bruins needed to exorcise those Game 7 overtime demons on Saturday night to beat Toronto and keep their season alive.\n\n\"We\u00b4re a better team for what we just went through,\" Bruins coach Jim Montgomery said Saturday night after Boston\u00b4s 2-1 win over Toronto. \"Now we know what it takes to push through.\"\n\nFlorida Panthers center Aleksander Barkov (16) and left wing Matthew Tkachuk, left, congratulate center Carter Verhaeghe (23) after Verhaeghe scored a goal during the third period of Game 5 of the first-round of an NHL Stanley Cup Playoff series against the Tampa Bay Lightning, Monday, April 29, 2024, in Sunrise, Fla. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nThe Panthers have home-ice advantage because they won the Atlantic Division, even though Boston spent the overwhelming majority of the season in first place. Florida passed the Bruins on the final day of the regular season for both clubs.\n\nBut the way Boston sees it, surviving the Round 1 test against Toronto delivered a needed edge.\n\n\"It\u00b4s resilience. It\u00b4s mental toughness. It\u00b4s belief in one another,\" Bruins defenseman Charlie McAvoy said. \"When we needed it the most in the biggest game of the year, we got it. And I think our group can take a lot from that.\"\n\nFlorida watched the Boston-Toronto series knowing either way, it\u00b4d be a rematch - the Panthers beat Boston in Round 1 and Toronto in Round 2 last year. Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk said he expected to see Boston, and the Bruins proved him right.\n\nFlorida has been off for a week since ousting Tampa Bay in Round 1.\n\n\"I personally love it,\" Tkachuk said. \"It feels like we\u00b4re just about to start playoffs now. That break was really good for us.\"\n\nFlorida is in the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the third consecutive year. The only other teams that can say that are Carolina and Edmonton.\n\nThe Dallas-Vegas winner on Sunday night will make Round 2 for the second straight year. None of the other four teams in the second round this season - Boston, the New York Rangers, Colorado and Vancouver - made Round 2 last season.\n\nBoston went 4-0-0 vs. Florida this season, winning two of those games in overtime. The Bruins were one of four teams - and the only from the Eastern Conference - to beat the Panthers in every meeting this season, joining Vancouver, Minnesota and Winnipeg.\n\nBruins goalies Jeremy Swayman (3.00, .857 in one game) and Linus Ullmark (1.62, .947 in three games) combined to stop 108 of 116 Florida shots. Sergei Bobrovsky was in net for all four games for Florida, giving up 13 goals on 101 shots (3.24, .871).\n\nGame 2 is in Sunrise on Wednesday and Game 3 is at Boston on Friday - which led to the switching of a Tim McGraw concert. He\u00b4ll now play at TD Garden on Wednesday.\n\nA good sign for the Bruins: Teams that win a Game 7 in overtime have gone on to win their next series 16 out of 21 times since 2003.\n\nThe most recent team to use a Game 7 OT victory as a springboard to next-round success was Florida - which beat Boston in Game 7 of Round 1 last year and wound up going all the way to the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nBoston had four previous Game 7 overtime wins before Saturday. The Bruins went on to win the next series three of those times (1939, 2011, 2013) and lost the next series once (1983).\n\nPower plays weren\u00b4t exactly powerful in the Bruins-Panthers regular-season series. Boston went 2 for 13 with the man advantage and Florida went 0 for 11.\n\nThe Panthers were worse on the power play against only one opponent this season. They were 0 for 17 against Toronto, the team that Boston defeated to get into Round 2 against Florida.\n\nFlorida had the second-most shots on goal in the NHL this season. But the Bruins find a way better than anyone else to bottle up the Panthers.\n\nBoston allowed Florida an average of 29 shots on goal per game. The only team in the NHL to allow Florida a lower average this season was Philadelphia, which held the Panthers to 22 shots per contest in their three matchups.\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl\n\nFans celebrate after the Boston Bruins defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in overtime during Game 7 of an NHL hockey Stanley Cup first-round playoff series, Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Boston.

That's when the Presidents' Trophy-winning Boston Bruins were stunned. The Florida Panthers, who only snuck into the playoffs by a point, tied the game with a Brandon Montour blast to force overtime. It only got worse from there for the Bruins as the Panthers scored the game-winner off a quick shot from Carter Verhaeghe to pull off the series upset.\n\nRelated: Boston Bruins vs Florida Panthers Round 2 Preview\n\nThe Panthers were never the same after that goal and played with a different energy. After defeating the Bruins in seven games, they beat the Toronto Maple Leafs in five games and swept the Carolina Hurricanes to advance to the Stanley Cup Final. They made a deep playoff run while the Bruins saw a historic season, one where they went 65-12-5, end in disappointment.\n\nThe Bruins and the Panthers meet again in a rematch that at first glance seems similar but is noticeably different. This time, the Panthers are the favorites as the team that finished the season with the best record in the Atlantic Division. This time, the Bruins have a similar core but different skaters taking on complementary roles. While it's not a rerun of last season's matchup, this series is sure to deliver like the one fans were treated to a season ago.\n\nLast season the first round was great, not just between the Bruins and the Panthers, but in the entire NHL. Seven of the eight series went to a Game 6 and three of them went seven games. This series, however, was the most memorable. The Bruins jumped out to a 3-1 series lead but then watched things fall apart.\n\nThe Panthers took Game 5 in overtime and then pulled away in Game 6 with a 7-5 victory. The back-to-back victories forced the Bruins to make a goaltending change, a move that was seen as a desperate one by Jim Montgomery and the coaching staff (interestingly, they didn't make the same mistake this time around). The Game 7 win completed the comeback and allowed the Panthers to go all the way to the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nThis season, the Bruins are the ones seeking revenge, yet both teams enter this series and the playoffs altogether with unfinished business to take care of. The Panthers, after losing in the Final to the Vegas Golden Knights, are looking to get back and more importantly, win the title, something the franchise has never experienced in its 25 years of existence. The Bruins meanwhile are looking to win one more Cup with some of the remaining core players. Last season, it was supposed to be the perfect sendoff for Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci. It wasn't meant to be but this season, it can be the final mark in a great career for Brad Marchand who was named the captain this season and won't have many more chances to win it all.\n\nFrom end to end, the Bruins and Panthers have been the top two teams in the Atlantic Division and have battled for the top spot all season. It came down to the final game as the Bruins lost 3-1 to the Ottawa Senators to allow the Panthers to sneak past them. In an alternate universe, they win one of their last two games and secure the top seed, but what fun would that be? (if that happened, there would be no Battle of Florida and no Maple Leafs dramatic playoff exit - okay, the latter probably still would have happened).\n\nMake no mistake, these two teams are the two best in the division and arguably two of the best teams in the NHL as well. They have looked great at both ends of the ice and have no glaring weaknesses. The Bruins once again have star power and depth but a goaltending unit that gave them an edge on a nightly basis. The Panthers have the star power to lead the way but are built from the net out with Sergei Bobrovsky having a Vezina Trophy-caliber season. With talent across the board, the matchups will be on full display all over the ice.\n\nThe Bruins' top six is led by Marchand and David Pastrnak while the Panthers have Matthew Tkachuk and Sam Reinhart leading the way offensively. Diving deeper, the spine of both forward units will make for an interesting series. Specifically, the Charlie Coyle vs Aleksander Barkov matchup will not only be fun but likely determine the winner of this series. Coyle was tasked with replacing Bergeron as the top-line center for the Bruins and he delivered this season, making him one of the under-the-radar skaters in the playoffs. He will go up against Barkov, one of the best two-way centers in the NHL who as a Selke Trophy finalist, has an uncanny ability to turn defense into instant scoring chances.\n\nBarkov and Coyle will play pivotal roles for their teams throughout the series and similarly will the other centers on both rosters. The Bruins hope that Pavel Zacha, Morgan Geekie, and Trent Frederic rebound from a forgettable first round as the three skaters combined for only five goals and three assists (in comparison, Verhaeghe scored five goals and four assists in two fewer games). For the Panthers, they'll hope Anton Lundell steps up as a scorer in that second-line center role as he added four assists against the Lightning but never found the back of the net.\n\nAnother big element of this series will be the pace of play. Both teams want to slow things down by controlling the puck in the offensive zone and generating effective shots on the net. At the same time, they have the defensemen capable of adding a spark with stretch passes from the defensive zone and with their puck-handling ability.\n\nThe Panthers saw Gustav Forsling emerge as their top two-way player this season with 10 goals and 29 assists but Montour has a track record of making an impact in the playoffs. The Bruins meanwhile have a duo of Hampus Lindholm and Charlie McAvoy leading the way but Lindholm is the one who stole the show recently with his Game 7 performance against the Maple Leafs. With his team's back against the wall, he scored the game-tying goal late in the third period, and in overtime, he sent a stretch pass off the boards to Pastrnak for the game-winner. It's plays like those that can and should be expected in this series, one that could speed up on any given shift.\n\nThis is a series that like last season, should go the distance and anything short of that will be a disappointment. Both teams are evenly matched and will trade blows throughout the seven-game series. Likewise, the Bruins and Panthers should provide a dramatic ending and while it will be hard to top last season's, it should be one that can be remembered for years to come.\n\nAlong with being a close series that goes seven games, each game should be tight and low-scoring. Both teams played great defense this season with the Panthers in particular allowing only 2.41 goals per game and it should result in plenty of defensive battles as a result.\n\nThe Bruins and Panthers are slowly budding into the rivalry of the decade. The two teams have become the model franchises of the Eastern Conference and are well-built teams from the top down. This series is Round 2 and will probably not be the final time they meet up in the playoffs in the seasons ahead.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_fink@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Mike Fink", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Division (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Verhaeghe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carter Verhaeghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Coyle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Coyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Bergeron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrice Bergeron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Krej\u010d\u00ed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Krej\u010d\u00ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vezina_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vezina Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Senators", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa Senators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Lundell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anton Lundell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_J._Selke_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank J.

(AP) -- There are no shortage of storylines for this Florida-Boston rematch.\n\nThere's the Panthers, trying to move another step closer toward a return to the Stanley Cup Final. There's the Bruins, looking to avenge a shocking upset in a Round 1 series last season. The rested Panthers having just gotten a few days off, the razor-sharp Bruins rolling in after a Game 7 overtime win over Toronto.\n\nFlorida coach Paul Maurice summed it all up succinctly.\n\n\"None of that matters when the puck drops,\" Maurice said.\n\nHe's probably right. A second-round series between the Panthers and Bruins starts Monday night in South Florida, the two best teams in the Atlantic Division squaring off with a trip to the NHL's final four on the line. Florida rallied from a 3-1 deficit to stun Boston in Round 1 a year ago, and the Bruins needed to exorcise those Game 7 overtime demons on Saturday night to beat Toronto and keep their season alive.\n\n\"We're a better team for what we just went through,\" Bruins coach Jim Montgomery said Saturday night after Boston's 2-1 win over Toronto. \"Now we know what it takes to push through.\"\n\nThe Panthers have home-ice advantage because they won the Atlantic Division, even though Boston spent the overwhelming majority of the season in first place. Florida passed the Bruins on the final day of the regular season for both clubs.\n\nBut the way Boston sees it, surviving the Round 1 test against Toronto delivered a needed edge.\n\n\"It's resilience. It's mental toughness. It's belief in one another,\" Bruins defenseman Charlie McAvoy said. \"When we needed it the most in the biggest game of the year, we got it. And I think our group can take a lot from that.\"\n\nFlorida watched the Boston-Toronto series knowing either way, it'd be a rematch -- the Panthers beat Boston in Round 1 and Toronto in Round 2 last year. Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk said he expected to see Boston, and the Bruins proved him right.\n\nFlorida has been off for a week since ousting Tampa Bay in Round 1.\n\n\"I personally love it,\" Tkachuk said. \"It feels like we're just about to start playoffs now. That break was really good for us.\"\n\nONE OF THREE\n\nFlorida is in the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the third consecutive year. The only other teams that can say that are Carolina and Edmonton.\n\nThe Dallas-Vegas winner on Sunday night will make Round 2 for the second straight year. None of the other four teams in the second round this season -- Boston, the New York Rangers, Colorado and Vancouver -- made Round 2 last season.\n\nTHE SERIES\n\nBoston went 4-0-0 vs. Florida this season, winning two of those games in overtime. The Bruins were one of four teams -- and the only from the Eastern Conference -- to beat the Panthers in every meeting this season, joining Vancouver, Minnesota and Winnipeg.\n\nBruins goalies Jeremy Swayman (3.00, .857 in one game) and Linus Ullmark (1.62, .947 in three games) combined to stop 108 of 116 Florida shots. Sergei Bobrovsky was in net for all four games for Florida, giving up 13 goals on 101 shots (3.24, .871).\n\nGame 2 is in Sunrise on Wednesday and Game 3 is at Boston on Friday -- which led to the switching of a Tim McGraw concert. He'll now play at TD Garden on Wednesday.\n\nAFTER OT IN GAME 7 ...\n\nA good sign for the Bruins: Teams that win a Game 7 in overtime have gone on to win their next series 16 out of 21 times since 2003.\n\nThe most recent team to use a Game 7 OT victory as a springboard to next-round success was Florida -- which beat Boston in Game 7 of Round 1 last year and wound up going all the way to the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nBoston had four previous Game 7 overtime wins before Saturday. The Bruins went on to win the next series three of those times (1939, 2011, 2013) and lost the next series once (1983).\n\nSPECIAL TEAMS\n\nPower plays weren't exactly powerful in the Bruins-Panthers regular-season series. Boston went 2 for 13 with the man advantage and Florida went 0 for 11.\n\nThe Panthers were worse on the power play against only one opponent this season. They were 0 for 17 against Toronto, the team that Boston defeated to get into Round 2 against Florida.\n\nGETTING SHOTS\n\nFlorida had the second-most shots on goal in the NHL this season. But the Bruins find a way better than anyone else to bottle up the Panthers.\n\nBoston allowed Florida an average of 29 shots on goal per game. The only team in the NHL to allow Florida a lower average this season was Philadelphia, which held the Panthers to 22 shots per contest in their three matchups.\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",

The matchup is available on multiple streaming services for free.\n\nWatch the Stanley Cup Playoffs with a free trial from Fubo\n\nToday's game will broadcast live on ESPN with the puck scheduled to drop at 8 p.m. Eastern.

You may cancel before the end of the free trial to avoid being charged. Sling TV is also offering promotional discounts for new customers.\n\nThe Bruins escaped the first round for the first time since 2021 with a thrilling 2-1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs in overtime of Game 7. David Pastrnak's game-winning goal propelled Boston into the next round and set up another date with the defending Eastern Conference champion Panthers.\n\nThe Bruins, who scored just four goals in the final three games of the first round, nearly blew a 3-1 lead in the opening round for the second consecutive season, recalling last year's stinging first-round exit to the Panthers, which derailed a historic regular season run for Boston in which they amassed a record-setting 65 wins and 135 points.\n\nNow they'll meet again in a juicy rematch.\n\nAll eyes will be on the play on Brad Marchand after taking over games 3 and 4 with three goals and eight assists. His emotion fuels the rugged Bruins, especially in close calls, which this series figures to churn out in bunches.\n\nBoston's sturdy defensive front that allowed just one power play goal on 21 chances against the Maple Leafs is anchored with elite goaltending from Jeremy Swayman, who recorded a scintillating .950 save percentage. Boston's allowed an NHL-best 1.71 goals per game in the first round.\n\nIn a competitive series, Florida took down the in-state rival Tampa Bay Lightning in five games. It's their third trip to the second round in the past three seasons.\n\nThe Panthers are led by the attacking tandem of Matthew Tkachuk and Carter Verhaeghe, who combined for 18 points in the first round. Boston allowed 12 goals in seven games against the Maple Leafs.\n\nFlorida goalkeeper Sergei Bobrovsky (.896 save percentage) will hunker down against the timely shooting of the Bruins.\n\nPhysicality, drama and bad blood is expected to spill onto the ice in this Eastern Conference clash.\n\nBoston defeated Florida four times this season, including twice in overtime. They were the only team in the Eastern Conference to win every game against the Panthers this season. They also won games 3 and 4 on the road in last year's playoff series. The Panthers finished a point ahead of the Bruins in the Atlantic Division this season.\n\nHere are more details about Game 1 and how to watch it via various TV and streaming options:\n\nWhat: Florida Panthers vs. Boston Bruins, NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs Second Round Game 1", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirecTV_Stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DirecTV Stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sling TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Verhaeghe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carter Verhaeghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Division (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/KBHYDIRVVNHUFNPBJND4ZJ6UCQ.jpg?auth=8e2813c6e7657fff28b781be2cbc22faa37beaa32bc18cd428307731a5e4fc04&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541234", "eventUri": "eng-9541234", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 231, "textEnd": 236}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The game total is sitting at 5.5 with the under slightly favored (+105o/-125u).\n\nThe Panthers are coming off a five-game series victory over Tampa Bay and have gone over 5.5 goals in three straight games. The Bruins needed seven games to see off Toronto in an extremely low-scoring series. Boston and Toronto averaged just 4.0 goals per game in regulation time, and the last three games in the series all ended 2-1 (two in OT).\n\nOdds as of May 6 at DraftKings. Learn where is DraftKings legal in North America.\n\nThe winner of the Bruins/Panthers series will advance in the NHL playoff bracket to race the winner of the Hurricanes/Rangers series in the Eastern Conference finals. New York took a 1-0 lead over Carolina last night.\n\nWhile the Panthers will have the confidence that comes with winning their first-round series with the Bruins last season, Boston was undefeated against Florida in the 2023-24 regular season. The Bruins went 4-0 against the Panthers including a pair of overtime wins while the Panthers were 0-2-2. Three of the four games were decided by a single goal.\n\nBoston held a 3-1 series lead on the Panthers in the first round last year, and held one-goal third-period leads in both Games 6 and 7 before eventually bowing out in OT in Game 7.\n\nNHL player props from DraftKings on May 6.\n\nThe players with the shortest odds to score at least one point are Florida's Matthew Tkachuk and Boston's David Pastrnak, both listed at -238. Tkachuk, Pastrnak, Sam Reinhart, and Carter Verhaeghe all have shot totals of 3.5 but Pastrnak has the best odds to go over at -135.\n\nTkachuk and Verhaeghe led the Panthers with nine points in five games against Tampa Bay. Reinhart had a team-high 23 shots while Verhaeghe and Tkachuk were at 22 and 21, respectively.\n\nBrad Marchand led the Bruins with eight points in seven games against Toronto. Pastrnak had just five points but fired a team-high 23 shots on goal. No other Bruin had more than 16 shots on goal against the Leafs despite the series going the full seven games.\n\nBoston is playing a much more defensively oriented style this season than last. They generated just 168.4 Expected Goals For during the regular season (per moneypuck.com) compared to 188.6 in 2022-23. In the first round against Toronto, Boston averaged just 26.5 shots on goal per game, but still had a 53.22% xGF at 5-on-5.\n\nBruce Cassidy has found the system that he believes works best for his current roster, and it's one that skews towards lower-scoring games. That's not unsurprising given how Boston blew its 3-1 series lead against the Panthers last year (i.e. unable to hold late leads in potential series-clinching games).\n\nThe Panthers, meanwhile, were very quietly the second-best defensive team in the NHL this year, allowing just 200 goals (only one more than league-leading Winnipeg). Don't expect this years Bruins/Panthers series to look like last year's, when the teams averaged 7.3 goals per game in regulation.\n\nFor Game 1, I'm targeting the under on 5.5 goals and also the under on Morgan Geekie's shot total of 1.5. Geekie had just ten shots on goal in seven games against the Leafs and, crucially, averaged just 16:20 of ice-time per game.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sascha_paruk@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Sascha Paruk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Geekie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Geekie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Verhaeghe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carter Verhaeghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_21777885.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541234", "eventUri": "eng-9541234", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 100, "textEnd": 105, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

It won't get easier for the defending Eastern Conference champions in the second round. But they still appear to be the favorites over a Boston Bruins team coming off a hard-fought seven-game series against the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nThough some may have thought the Lightning would have presented a challenge for the Panthers, plenty was working in favor of the Panthers. They were the better five-on-five team during the regular season, especially across their final 25 games, and they were a much deeper team than the Lightning, specifically up front.\n\nThe result was the Panthers controlling the game at five-on-five in Round 1. They finished with a 50.8 expected goals share (xG%) at that game state, and they'll be going up against a Bruins team that they should have an advantage over at full strength, even though the Bruins finished with a 52.08 xG% in their first-round series against the Maple Leafs.\n\nA distinct advantage the Panthers have over the Bruins is their center depth. Aleksander Barkov was just nominated for the Selke Trophy and looks like a good bet to win it. He had a strong series against the Lightning, finishing with a 56.83 xG% at five-on-five and five points in five games across all strengths.\n\nThe Bruins ran with a top line of Pavel Zacha, Morgan Geekie and David Past\u0159n\u00e1k in Game 7 against the Maple Leafs. Of course, Bruins coach Jim Montgomery could mix that up to start the series against the Panthers. But if they stick with that line, the Carter Verhaeghe, Barkov and Matthew Tkachuk unit should be licking their chops. Zacha had no goals and two points against the Maple Leafs, while Geekie totaled two goals and three points.\n\nEven if Panthers coach Paul Maurice mixes up his lines when Sam Bennett returns (he is out for Game 1), the Panthers forward depth is significantly better than the Bruins. Anton Lundell would slide down to the third line to center Evan Rodrigues and Vladimir Tarasenko, leaving Bennett with Sam Reinhart and Eetu Luostarainen. Compared to the Bruins' third line of James van Riemsdyk, Trent Frederic, and Justin Brazeau, the Panthers seem to have a much deeper forward group.\n\nRelated: Bruins vs. Panthers: The Playoff Rematch the NHL Needed\n\nThe Bruins did go 4-0-0 against the Panthers during the regular season, but I wouldn't put too much stock into that. Florida had an xG% of 50 percent or better at five-on-five in each matchup. They just fell short each time; three of the four games were decided by one goal. They are the better team and should have their way at five-on-five. There's just one thing that may be standing in their way.\n\nThe Maple Leafs can't score goals if their lives depended on it in the playoffs, but that doesn't take away from how good Jeremy Swayman was in their first-round series, especially early on when Toronto played some of their better games. Swayman finished with a .950 save percentage across six games in Round 1 while saving 7.59 goals above expected.\n\nYou may look at that as a Panthers fan and get understandably concerned. Those numbers are outstanding, but a .950 SV%, even in the playoffs, probably isn't sustainable. I'd expect those numbers to regress, and the fact that the Panthers should be the better team at five-on-five means Swayman should face more quality looks than he did against the Maple Leafs.\n\nIf the Panthers finish their chances and get pucks past Swayman, I don't think they'll have much trouble defeating the Bruins. They should feel confident since they got plenty of pucks past Andrei Vasilevskiy in the first round and made him finish that series with a save percentage below .900.\n\nJust like the first-round series, Sergei Bobrovsky could be the great equalizer to Swayman as he was to Vasilevskiy. He was just nominated for the Vezina Trophy after posting a .915 SV% during the regular season. He only finished with an .896 SV% in the first round, but still outdueled Vasilevskiy. And it's not like he didn't make ten-bell or timely saves to keep the Panthers in games. There were plenty of those.\n\nHis SV% being below .900 isn't a significant concern because, like the Lightning series, the Panthers should outplay the Bruins at five-on-five most nights. He likely won't need to win or steal games for the Panthers. He just needs to be better than his counterpart in Swayman. If he is and doesn't lose games for the Panthers, I don't anticipate any problems in net.\n\nThe Bruins' special teams units are coming into this series hot. They ended the first round with a power play that converted on 35.2 percent of its chances and a penalty kill that killed off 95 percent of the Maple Leafs' power plays. The caveat is that the Maple Leafs' power play and penalty kill struggled in the regular season, which seemed to carry over into the playoffs.\n\nThat might mean the Bruins' special teams units overachieved a bit in the first round. If we look at how each team's special teams units performed during the regular season, they were about even. The Panthers and Bruins' penalty kills both finished at 82.5 percent. Meanwhile, the Panthers' power play converted at 23.5 percent, while the Bruins were at 22.5 percent.\n\nJudging by that, which might still be the better indicator than their first-round series, the Panthers and Bruins seem to be about even in special teams. I wouldn't anticipate one team having the edge over the other, but that should be an advantage for the Panthers since they should be the better five-on-five team. It'll probably be difficult for the Bruins to win the series if they don't dominate on special teams.\n\nLundell moved up into the top six after Bennett's injury and performed more than admirably against the Lightning. Most of those minutes came alongside Verhaeghe and Tkachuk, but it looks like he'll start Round 2 alongside Luostarainen and Reinhart. Lundell finished the first round with a 56.38 xG% at five-on-five and totaled four points in five games. Whether it's as the second- or third-line center, he could be the team's X-factor like he was against the Lightning at times.\n\nCoyle had a career season, finishing with 25 goals and 60 points in 82 games. Still, the Bruins will need more from him than he provided against the Maple Leafs. No goals and two assists in seven games won't cut it against a much better Panthers team. If he shows up, he could help give the Bruins a chance at the upset.\n\nEveryone remembers last year's first-round series between these two teams, but these are two completely different clubs. The Bruins are not as good as they were in 2022-23, and the Panthers are much better than they were heading into that first-round tilt against the Bruins.\n\nThe Panthers are the favorites here because they have a deeper and more talented roster than the Bruins. Swayman could steal a game or two for the Bruins, but can he steal an entire series? I wouldn't put it past him, but I wouldn't consider it likely. The Bruins may be motivated to exact revenge on the Panthers for last year's playoff meeting, but Florida will likely be too much in the end.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_chauvancy@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Alex Chauvancy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Lundell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anton Lundell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Verhaeghe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carter Verhaeghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Vasilevskiy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrei Vasilevskiy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_J._Selke_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frank J.

The Bruins, meanwhile, were extended to seven games by Toronto before subduing the Maple Leafs 2-1 in overtime Saturday night.\n\nGame 1 is scheduled for Monday night, with the Panthers listed as a favorite. On futures boards, Florida is available at to win the Cup, with Boston at . Here are the the Panthers vs. Bruins odds, props and futures, plus a closer look at the matchup.\n\nHere are the Panthers vs. Bruins Game 1 odds at top U.S. sports betting sites.\n\nIn 2023's opening round, Florida had one of the most stunning best-of-seven victories in history when it overcame a 3-1 series deficit to prevail in Game 7 in overtime in Boston.\n\nAnd what made that achievement even more startling was that the Bruins had just set the league record for points in a season with 135. The Panthers had 92. That 43-point differential was the second-greatest in history a playoff team was able to overcome.\n\nHere are the current Florida Panthers futures odds and props:\n\nHere are the current Boston Bruins futures odds and props:\n\nFlorida not only has the home-ice edge for the series but will have a significant rest benefit, too.\n\nThis will be the first time in two years a playoff series opened with one team having had six days off facing a team that just completed a seven-game series and was given only one day to recover.\n\nThat last occurred in 2022 when Tampa Bay had six days off after vanquishing Florida in five games in the Eastern Conference semifinals and faced a New York Rangers squad that had one day off after needing seven games to eliminate Carolina.\n\nIt didn't come as much of a surprise that Tampa Bay, the two-time defending Cup champs, won the series. But it no doubt cost many sports bettors off-guard when an exhausted Rangers team bashed the visiting Lightning in Game 1 by 6-2. Thus, don't disregard Boston' chances Monday night.\n\nBoston went 4-0 against two foes this season, and one of them was Florida.\n\nThe Bruins also were 4-0 against Toronto, but that dominance surely didn't carry over to Round 1 when Boston barely hung on to oust the Leafs.\n\nOverall this regular season, Boston had a record of 23-9-8 against the other 15 teams that qualified for the playoffs. Florida's mark was 21-14-4, including 0-2-2 vs. Boston.\n\nBoston probably has too many holes in its game to overcome against a Florida squad that allowed the second-fewest number of goals this season.\n\nAgainst the Leafs, the Bruins scored only once in regulation in each of their final three games and lost the vast majority of face-offs. And what happened to Boston winger/captain Brad Marchand? He had eight points the first four games in Round 1 but none the final three with a total of two shots\n\nAnd as great as Boston goalie Jeremy Swayman played against Toronto (1.49 goals-against average, .950 save percentage), Florida counters with Sergei Bobrovsky, whose 2.37 GAA in the regular season was third-best in the league.

Boston will look to enact revenge after being upset in last year's playoffs, but my Bruins vs. Panthers predictions aren't entirely bullish on the visitors, at least for tonight.\n\nBoston won all four meetings between the two teams during the regular season, but Florida wrapped up its Round 1 matchup against the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games. It took the Bruins all seven to send the Toronto Maple Leafs packing.\n\nWith Florida a huge favorite to win the series and Game 1, here are our free NHL picks for the series opener on Monday, May 6.\n\nIt's a quick turnaround for the Boston Bruins following their Game 7 overtime win on Saturday, while the Florida Panthers have been resting and preparing for a week. The Panthers are a huge uptick in class for the Bruins, and it's also worth noting the Toronto Maple Leafs dished out the most hits (346) in Round 1. It was anything but a leisurely seven-game series for the Bs.\n\nI anticipate Boston's offense will continue to struggle after being held to just four goals over the final three games against Toronto. This bodes poorly as the Panthers finished the regular season tied for the fewest goals against per game.\n\nAdditionally, I value the gap in 5-on-5 play favoring the Cats. Florida ranked second in Corsi For percentage (55.7%) and fifth in expected goals percentage (54.3%) during the regular season, while Boston ranked 24th (47.0%) and 18th (50.0%), respectively.\n\nThe Bruins lack the lineup and scoring depth to go toe-to-toe with the Panthers, and No. 1 goalie Jeremy Swayman has negative regression ahead of his .950 postseason save percentage. A splash of statistical correction also looms for Boston's special teams. The Bruins posted a 35.3 power-play percentage and 95.2 penalty-kill percentage in Round 1 after recording 22.2% and 82.5% marks during the regular season.\n\nI also expect to see Cats starter Sergei Bobrovsky build off his 31-save Game 5 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning. Bobrovsky was only so-so through the first four games of Round 1, with an .874 SV%, so stopping 31 of 32 shots to eliminate the Bolts is encouraging.\n\nBoston will need to play conservatively to compete in this series, and while I expect a statistical decline ahead for Swayman, I'm talking about him saving 91% of the shots he faces instead of 95%. Additionally, as discussed, I'm primarily backing the Panthers in regulation because I don't anticipate the Bruins scoring enough to win.\n\nFlorida swapped its lines in Sunday's practice, and Aleksander Barkov centered Matthew Tkachuk and Carter Verhaeghe. There's no guarantee they stick, but all five of Barkov's points in Round 1 came at home, and he was on the ice for the most expected goals (7.45) across those three games.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nBoston has been held to a single regulation goal in three consecutive games.

Instead, they defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in overtime (2-1) and advanced to the second round. There are certain players they can thank for this, and one of them is David Pastrnak. After being called out after Game 6 by his head coach, Jim Montgomery, he responded in a big way by scoring the game-winning goal. Upon the conclusion of the game, Pastrnak said this regarding the call out,\n\n\"I told him, 'If I were the coach and you were the player, I'd say the same thing. I needed to be better.\"\n\nIt's safe to say he will need to be better going forward because their next opponent is a rematch from last season. The Bruins have the opportunity to avenge last season's heartbreaking defeat against the pesky Florida Panthers. The Panthers, meanwhile, made quick work of the Tampa Bay Lightning, defeating them in five games.\n\nThis is going to be a great series between these two teams, who also do not like one another. As Game 1 begins Monday night in Sunrise, Florida, let's see how these two teams stack up against one another.\n\nWhen the game is played at five-on-five, the Panthers are the superior team. In fact, they were one of the best teams in this regard. The Panthers have tremendous depth, play with structured defense, and forecheck hard. For the Bruins' offense, they are going to have to find ways to capitalize because the Panthers do not provide much.\n\nDuring the regular season, the Panthers allowed the second fewest shot attempts (3,353) and the second-fewest shots on goal. Shot suppression was key for them, and the Bruins, who were near the bottom in shots on goal and shot attempts, will need to be much better. One glaring note is that the Panthers allowed the fewest goals at five-on-five play, which is a testament to how good they are in this area of play. For the playoffs, the margins are much closer.\n\nRelated: 3 Key Pieces That Got the Bruins to the 2nd Round\n\nBoth teams finished with a Corsi for percentage (CF%) under 50%, but the Bruins series was much more open than the Panthers series. The Bruins were much superior in shot attempts and even generated the second most expected goals (14.99) but scored below their expected rate. In contrast, the Panthers capitalized on their chances and scored above it. Goaltending smothered the Bruins later in the series, whereas the Panthers were able to solve Andrei Vasilevskiy.\n\nThe Bruins will need to bring the same type of offense they did against the Maple Leafs because the Panthers are a tougher defensive opponent. They also have to beat the defense and the goalie.\n\nIt's cliche to say, but the series could come down to goaltending. A year ago, Alex Lyon played well enough for the Panthers to claw their way into the playoffs, only to see Sergei Bobrovsky take over. Safe to say, playoff Bob arrived and carried the team to the Stanley Cup Finals. For the Bruins, they not only boast the best tandem in the league, but also a goalie that avenged a Game 7 first round loss and is hungry for more.\n\nDuring the regular season, both teams' goaltending was excellent, and not just by one guy. The Panthers finished with the second-best team save percentage (.913), whereas the Bruins finished third (.912). It's going to be a battle, as both teams have a chance to win regardless of who's in the net.\n\nJeremy Swayman saved the Bruins more times than anyone could count. The Lightning held the Panthers to 238 attempts (12th among qualified teams), and with the Bruins allowing the second most shot attempts during five-on-five play, they'll need Swayman's stellar play to continue. He comes into this series with a 1.49 goals against average, a .950 save percentage, and 7.58 goals saved above expected. He was dialed in completely and had a 2011 Tim Thomas-esque playoff series.\n\nThe Bruins will have to get past the stifling defense and Bobrovsky. This playoff run, he has a 2.73 GAA and a .896 save percentage, but 0.5 goals saved above expected. Both goalies stack up well against one another, and with game-changing forwards on both teams, they'll need to step up big. The other area is going to be special teams play, which could be a weapon in this series.\n\nThere are so many weapons for both teams when it comes to the man advantage. For the Bruins, there is premiere sniper Pastrnak and captain Brad Marchand, who had six points on the power play in the first-round series against the Maple Leafs. As for the Panthers, the arsenal of weapons is lengthy, with Matthew Tkachuk and Sam Reinhart leading the charge. This series is destined to be physical, as the rivalry will spark and enter a new halter. If either team decides to be undisciplined and take trips to the penalty box, special teams could be a major factor.\n\nThe Bruins power play that struggled to end the season rose from the ashes in round one. Against the Maple Leafs penalty kill, they finished with a 40% success rate. However, they'll be running into a stronger penalty kill unit that smothered the league's top-ranked powerplay that was the Lightning. The Panthers finished the first round with an 80% success rate on the penalty kill, so the Bruins special teams unit will need to capitalize if they get the chance.\n\nThe Bruins have a major advantage in penalty kills, finishing with a 95% success rate and giving the Maple Leafs no life in the first round. The Panthers will want to see their weapons come to life, but it will be a major challenge against this unit.\n\nThe Bruins' road to redemption starts now. This is going to be a fantastic series with two of the top teams in the Eastern Conference facing off. The Panthers have a slight edge in terms of play at five-on-five, but special teams will be a major factor. The stars in this series will need to shine brightest.\n\nGoaltending will be the biggest factor, and that's not including the possibility that Linus Ullmark will appear in this series. It's going to be interesting to see how this series plays out, but expect it to go the distance.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tommy_bennett@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Tommy Bennett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Lyon_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Lyon (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Vasilevskiy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrei Vasilevskiy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Matthew-Tkachuk-Panthers-Linus-Ullmark-Bruins-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541234", "eventUri": "eng-9541234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

After qualifying as the second wild card from the East, the Panthers pulled off one of the biggest upsets in NHL postseason history, rallying from a 3-1 series deficit and winning 4-3 in overtime in Game 7 to eliminate the Bruins, who won the Presidents' Trophy as the NHL's top team during the regular season and set League records with 135 points and 65 wins.\n\n\"I just think that it showed we can beat anybody, and it gave us a lot of confidence no matter who we played no matter what building we were in, no matter what atmosphere we were in, we have a chance to win,\" Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk said. \"And it brought us super close together that series, and the effects of that series are still being shown now.\"\n\nFlorida was the second team in NHL history to overcome a 3-1 series deficit to eliminate the Presidents' Trophy winner and rode the belief it gained from defeating Boston all the way to the Stanley Cup Final before losing to the Vegas Golden Knights. The Panthers are determined to get back to the Cup Final and win it this season and took the first step by defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games in the first round.\n\nNow, they'll have to go through the Bruins again, but might be slight favorites this time. Florida finished first in the Atlantic Division with 110 points (52-24-6); Boston was second in the Atlantic with 109 (47-20-15).\n\nThe Bruins won all four games against the Panthers during the regular season (two in overtime) and will be motivated to avenge their first-round loss last season. The Panthers plan to take the same approach they had a year ago.\n\n\"We just play our game,\" Florida captain Aleksander Barkov said. \"We know how to play, we know how to play hard, and that's what we're going to do. We have the same mindset as last year. We want to outcompete every team we play, so it doesn't matter we play.\n\n\"We want to be at our best in every game. So, it's not our decision to decide who's favored and who's not.\"\n\nSome of the faces have changed, but each team has 13 players who dressed for at least one game in the first round this season that played in the series between them last season. The Bruins, most notably, lost centers Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci to retirement last offseason, but still had a strong regular season and will be riding an emotional high from withstanding the Maple Leafs' attempted comeback from a 3-1 series deficit and prevailing in Game 7 on David Pastrnak's goal at 1:54 of overtime.\n\n\"We know that this is a very similar team to last year,\" Tkachuk said. \"A couple different pieces, but I think last year there was a lot of high-scoring games. We're probably expecting it be a little bit on the lower-scoring side just by judging how both teams like to play and like to have success. So, it's a great challenge here.\"\n\nThe Panthers haven't played since advancing with a 6-1 victory against the Lightning in Game 5 of their first round series last Monday. They hope to benefit from the additional rest but know they will have to gear up quickly to match the Bruins intensity to begin Game 1.\n\n\"I think it's a mindset,\" Barkov said. \"We've just got to get our minds ready. Obviously we haven't been playing, but I think our practices have been good. We've been trying to push the pace in practices and not to lose that. Obviously when you play every other day, you have that pace already and, of course, for them, they've been playing all the time and we've been resting. So, it's kind of different, but I think we'll be fine.\n\n\"We've been working really hard, and our minds will be ready.\"\n\nGiven how well the teams know each other, it seems likely they'll skip past the feeling-out process that is common at the start of a playoff series and get down to business quickly.\n\n\"I'm expecting a very good series,\" Tkachuk said. \"They're such an unbelievable team in every aspect of the game. They touch everything. They're really good at special teams. Their 5-on-5 is great. Their goaltending is amazing. Their team defense is really good. They've got some star players. I think it's a lot like our team, so it should be a great series.\"", "source": {"uri": "nhl.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NHL.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Division (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents'_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidents' Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Krej\u010d\u00ed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Krej\u010d\u00ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Bergeron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrice Bergeron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_ratio16_9-size50/v1714941569/prd/b1z8c7ul5znzcc33lz3k.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541234", "eventUri": "eng-9541234", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The Maple Leafs lone series win came last spring with a six-game series win over the Tampa Bay Lightning, who the Panthers eliminated in five games this year.\n\nTkachuk, 26, is off to a strong start in these playoffs with three goals and nine points in five games.

Florida marched all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals for the second time in franchise history, although they ultimately lost in five games to the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\n\"It showed we could beat anybody and it gave us a lot of confidence,\" star Panthers winger Matthew Tkachuk said. \"No matter who we played, no matter what building we're in, no matter what happens here, we have a chance to win. It brought us super close together, and the effects of that series are still being shown off.\"\n\nAnd now, the playoff rivalry will be renewed with the Panthers facing the Bruins in the playoffs for the second consecutive year -- this time in Round 2 after Florida beat Tampa Bay in five games and Boston beat Toronto in seven games in their respective opening-round matchups.\n\nPuck drop for Game 1 of the best-of-7 series is at 8 p.m. Monday at Sunrise's Amerant Bank Arena.\n\nThe Panthers have known they will be in the second round for nearly a week now after. Boston had to stave off Toronto's efforts to mount a comeback from down 3-1 in the first-round series.\n\nThe roles are basically reversed heading into this Florida-Boston series, but that doesn't mean the Panthers are concerning themselves about the fact that those outside the room are viewing them as the favorites this time around.\n\n\"I think that's more for you to decide,\" Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov said. \"We just play our game. We know how to play. We know how to play hard. That's what we want to do. We have the same mindset as last year. We want to out-compete every team we play. It doesn't matter who we play. We want to be at our best every game. It's not our decision to decide who's the favorite.\"\n\nLast year, the Panthers didn't have to worry about that because, at least on the outside, they were the clear-cut underdog. Florida barely made it into the playoffs while Boston went 65-12-5 in the regular season. The Bruins quickly proceeded to jump out to a 3-1 series lead against the Panthers, putting Florida on the brink of seeing its postseason journey end before it could begin.\n\nFlorida would need to put together three consecutive wins to stay alive.\n\nAnd that's when the magic began.\n\nIt started with Game 5 at Boston's TD Garden. Florida took the lead three times in regulation on goals by Anthony Duclair, Sam Bennett and Sam Reinhart only for Boston to respond each time and force overtime.\n\nTkachuk sealed the first of three must-win game 6:05 into overtime and shortly afterward gave his team a resounding message.\n\n\"Boys, remember this room,\" Tkachuk said in the dressing room. \"We'll be back here for seven.\"\n\n\"We didn't think we had a disadvantage at all,\" Panthers defenseman Brandon Montour said, \"but I think once we tied it up, it became surreal for everyone and we said 'We can do something here.'\"\n\nIn that Game 7, the Panthers jumped out to a 2-0 lead early in the second period before Boston scored three unanswered goals to take a 3-2 lead 4:11 into the third period.\n\nUndeterred, Montour tied the game with a minute left in regulation and winger Carter Verhaeghe clinched the series win 8:35 into overtime.\n\n\"That just showed us pretty much that when we do things the right way and when we play really hard, everything is possible,\" Barkov said. \"That's what we learned from that series and it's been carried over to this year.\"\n\nThis year, Florida won the Atlantic Division, edging Boston for the crown by one point.\n\nThe Panthers did not, however, beat their in any of their four regular-season matchups, although two of the games went to overtime, a third was also decided by one goal and the fourth was a two-goal game.\n\n\"They definitely got us in the regular season,\" Tkachuk said. \"I think if you ask them, they're probably using that for confidence go to this series. And we're like 'The regular season doesn't matter. We got them in playoffs.' We'll use our playoff experience and use that as confidence. They did take it to us this year, but they were all close games.

The team rewrote the history books in 2022-23, setting new single-season records for points (135) and wins (65). The Bruins were the odds-on favorites to win the Stanley Cup. The excitement rivaled the team's postseason success in 2011, 2013 and 2019.\n\nIt all meant absolutely nothing after a first-round loss to the Florida Panthers.\n\nSimilar to last year, the Bruins enjoyed another successful regular season en route to another playoff matchup against the rival Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round. Many believed it would be an easy victory for Boston, but the Maple Leafs erased a 3-1 series deficit to force Game 7. Fans didn't seem encouraged by Boston's chances to win Saturday night at TD Garden.\n\nMore: In sports-passionate New England, Joe McDonald asks: Which team is No. 1?\n\nMontgomery's coaching ability in the playoffs came into question, along with the lack of point production by David Pastrnak. Had the Bruins lost to the Maple Leafs, another coaching change should have been in the works. Fortunately for Montgomery and the Bruins, they silenced the critics with an impressive 2-1 overtime win with Pastrnak scoring the game-winning goal. Boston goaltender Jeremy Swayman was outstanding the entire series as he helped the Bruins advance to the second round and a rematch against the Panthers.\n\nHis 4-2 record, along with a 1.49 goals-against average and .950 save percentage, save the day against the Maple Leafs. In fact, he became only the second goalie in Bruins history to record a save percentage higher than .950 (minimum six games played), joining Tim Thomas, who posted a .967 SP during the 2011 Stanley Cup Final. Maybe that's a good omen for the Bruins.\n\nOverall, the Bruins have enjoyed success because of their goaltending tandem of Swayman and Linus Ullmark. Moving forward in the postseason, it should be Swayman's net until he loses it.\n\nThe Bruins will need a lot more than solid goaltending to beat the Panthers.\n\nBoston was built to win in 2011. The Bruins could roll four lines against any opponent, while Boston's defense was nearly unbreakable. Thomas produced one of the greatest overall goaltending performances in history en route to a Stanley Cup win. In 2013, injuries and bad puck luck proved crucial during Boston's loss to the Chicago Blackhawks in the Cup final. In 2019, the Bruins should have won, but Brad Marchand's decision to leave the ice with only seconds remaining in the first period led to the St. Louis Blues gaining a 2-0 lead and it changed the outcome of Game 7 as the visiting team hoisted the Stanley Cup on TD Garden ice.\n\nAs mentioned, the early postseason exit in 2023 was embarrassing.\n\n\"Last year was such an empty feeling,\" Montgomery told reporters after Saturday's win. The coach also believes things are different this season as the Bruins prepare to face Florida.\n\nThe Bruins have an opportunity to avenge that disaster against the Panthers this spring, but Boston needs to play a lot better than it did against the Maple Leafs. Pastrnak needs to produce and that's going to be a bigger challenge against a heavier and more physical Panther team. Montgomery challenged Pastrnak to play better prior to Game 7 and maybe his game-winning goal could propel that production and confidence moving forward.\n\nMontgomery's \"trying to bring the best out of every single player and he expects more,\" Pastrnak told reporters after Game 7. \"I'll try to be better and I admit I need to be better. I still have ways to be better.\"\n\nThe Bruins need to tighten their play in the defensive zone and not force their goaltender to make highlight-reel saves time and again, even though it's spectacular to watch Swayman's heroics between the pipes. Special teams play a critical role in the Stanley Cup playoffs and the Bruins should receive plenty of opportunities on the power play since the Panthers will produce an intense physical game.\n\nAsk any Stanley Cup champion and he'll tell you luck plays an important factor in a team's ability to win. That only increases the further a team advances in the playoffs and the Bruins will need to be on the receiving end of that puck luck, especially against an elite goaltender such the Panthers' Sergei Bobrovsky. He's a finalist for this season's Vezina Trophy after compiling a 36-17-4 record, a 2.37 goals-against average and a .915 save percentage, including six shutouts in 58 games for Florida. He guided the Panthers to a second Atlantic Division title in three seasons and the second-highest points total (110) in franchise history.\n\nThe Panthers also have the offensive fire power of Aleksander Barkov and Carter Verhaeghe, which should be a threat against the Bruins.\n\nThis is going to be a tough series for Boston. It should go seven games, but I don't think the Bruins have enough to pull off another series victory and advance to the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nUnfortunately for Bruins fans, NESN broadcasts are complete for the postseason. So, I wanted to take this opportunity to recognize Jack Edwards for an impressive 19-year career as the Bruins play-by-play broadcaster. He recently announced his retirement and he will be missed. Whether or not you enjoyed Jack's call, there's no denying his talent, passion and dedication to his craft and the Bruins. His chemistry with longtime broadcast partner Andy Brickley is unmatched in their industry and it was a pleasure to work alongside Jack all these years. We became friends and I wish him nothing but happiness in retirement. He came a long way from his days at WJAR in Providence. Good luck, Jack. Maybe the Bruins will win this one for you.", "source": {"uri": "eu.providencejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Yes, thank you: CBS News Miami's Steve Goldstein", "body": "SUNRISE -- For the second consecutive year and the third time in franchise history, the Florida Panthers will play the Boston Bruins in the playoffs.\n\nWhile the rested Panthers have had a week off after blowing by the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games, the Bruins had to go to overtime in game seven to beat Toronto in the first round. This second-round series begins Monday night at Amerant Bank Arena and it will be a hotly contested battle with some bad blood that's developed over the last few years.\n\nThis is the first time the Panthers have played Boston outside of the first round. The franchise won its' first ever series by beating the Bruins in 1996, and then stunned the best regular season team in NHL history last year by erasing a 3-1 series deficit and winning game 7 in overtime in Boston. The Bruins won the four games the teams played this season, two in overtime.\n\nThe goaltending matchup is the one to watch. Sergei Bobrovsky had quite a few well documented highlight reel saves in the opening round win against Tampa Bay and hns had a fantastic season. Boston's Jeremy Swayman took over in the Toronto series as the starter and was terrific. Swayman only played game 7 in last year's series against the Panthers. It's likely we will see low scoring games most of the time with the goaltenders on top of their game.\n\nEven without Sam Bennett to start the series the Panthers should have the advantage at center (Bennett is day to day and should return soon). Aleksander Barkov was all-world against Tampa and Anton Lundell stepped up and played excellent all-around hockey. Kevin Stenlund played a bigger role and proved he can play the playoff style needed. Boston lost long time stars Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci to retirement after last year's series. But give the Bruins credit as players like Charlie Coyle have played well enough. But with that said, the Panthers are the better team, by a sizable amount, at the all-important position, up the middle.\n\nOver the last three years the Panthers have won five playoff series, more than any other NHL team. They won the President's Trophy as the best regular season team in the league and have reached the Stanley Cup final. They've played numerous low scoring, hard-nosed playoff type of games, with success. That's who this team is. So, the Panthers don't need to change their game or raise their level of play when they get to the postseason because they play that way all the time. They are very comfortable in tight games and all things being equal it is going to be difficult for an opponent to beat them four out of seven times.\n\nBoston led Toronto three games to one but nearly had an identical scenario of last year's stunning seven game playoff series loss to the Panthers. Toronto won games 5 and 6 but Boston was able to pull out game seven in overtime. No team in NHL, NBA or MLB history had ever lost back-to-back playoff series in consecutive years when leading 3-1 and thanks to Saturday's win the Bruins avoided making history. Led by goalie Jeremy Swayman the Bruins didn't panic when the pressure was at its highest and found a way to win the series.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Lundell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anton Lundell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Krej\u010d\u00ed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Krej\u010d\u00ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Bergeron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrice Bergeron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bennett_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bennett (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Coyle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Coyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/10/31/7ee014c3-f897-403e-8d1e-8f9fa7d901e6/thumbnail/1200x630g2/dd7f3df1653b46dcad12638435081afc/mcavoy-2.jpg?v=1d6c78a71b7b6252b543a329b3a5744d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541234", "eventUri": "eng-9541234", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Now the Bruins have a chance for revenge.\n\nOne major difference between last year and this series is home ice advantage. The Panthers have it this time, but that might not be a bad thing for the Bruins, who have won four of their last six road playoff games. They've also won four of their last five road games in Florida, including victories in Games 3 and 4 of last year's first-round matchup.\n\nHere's a look at the Bruins' playoff stats on the road over the last two seasons:\n\nThe Bruins abandoned their goalie rotation after Game 3 of the first round. Jeremy Swayman posted a .950 save percentage and didn't allow more than two goals in any of his six starts versus the Leafs. He absolutely deserves to start Game 1, but it wouldn't be surprising if Linus Ullmark made an appearance at some point in the series. The Bruins have not officially announced their starting goalie yet, though.\n\nOne potential lineup change might be at fourth-line center. Patrick Brown was in that spot during Monday's morning skate. Brown was recalled on an emergency basis Sunday. He hasn't played for the Bruins since Jan. 27, but he has played great for the Providence Bruins with 20 points in his last 20 AHL games. Brown also could contribute on the penalty kill and has done well on faceoffs in his career. Boston was the worst team on faceoffs (43.8 percent) in the first round.\n\nBrandon Carlo and his wife welcomed their second child Monday morning. B's head coach Jim Montgomery told reporters after the morning skate that the team is \"very hopeful\" Carlo will make it to Florida for the game. If not, Matt Grzelcyk and Derek Forbort are among the options to enter the lineup.\n\nThe Panthers won't have center Sam Bennett for the series opener. His status after that is unknown. No other lineup changes are expected for Florida.\n\nHere are the projected lineups for Bruins-Panthers Game 1.\n\nJames van Riemsdyk--Trent Frederic--Justin Brazeau\n\nCarter Verhaeghe--Aleksander Barkov--Matthew Tkachuk\n\nEetu Luostarinen--Anton Lundell--Sam Reinhart\n\nEvan Rodrigues--Kevin Stenlund--Vladimir Tarasenko", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Lundell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anton Lundell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Verhaeghe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carter Verhaeghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eetu_Luostarinen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eetu Luostarinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Brown_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Brown (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Grzelcyk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Grzelcyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Rodrigues", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Rodrigues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_van_Riemsdyk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James van Riemsdyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Providence Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Tarasenko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Tarasenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hockey_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bennett_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bennett (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Forbort", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derek Forbort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Carlo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Carlo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsboston.com/2024/05/Hampus-Lindholm-USATSI_21955774.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541234", "eventUri": "eng-9541234", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-27", "textStart": 1551, "textEnd": 1558}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The Bruins built a 3-1 series lead but were beaten 4-3 in overtime in Game 7 on April 30 at the Garden. The Bruins will begin their payback campaign against the Panthers on Monday night (8) at Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise, Fla.\n\nThe Bruins were in a similar situation after building a 3-1 series lead against the Maple Leafs before dropping the next two games. The Bruins narrowly avoided becoming the only team of the four major American sports leagues to build a 3-1 lead and lose a playoff series in consecutive years.\n\nGoaltender Jeremy Swayman recorded 30 saves and sniper David Pastrnak scored the game-winner at 1:54 of overtime.\n\n\"I am very proud of the group overall,\" said Bruins general manager Don Sweeney, prior to the team's departure from Hanscom Field on Sunday. \"Our series certainly tightened up from a goal-scoring standpoint in all situations. We knew it was going to be about trying to persevere and find that one more play with this group and fortunately we were able to do that.\n\n\"To a man, each guy went out and did their job and I thought our start was so much better than in (Games) 5 and 6 which didn't translate into a lead. We were playing from behind but we found a way. Congratulations to our group, they earned it.\"\n\nSweeney said the turnover of leadership in the locker room and the addition of so many new players to the roster makes last year's loss to the Panthers marginally a non-issue. The Bruins were 4-0 against the Panthers this season that included two overtime thrillers.\n\n\"We know the opponent and we will be prepared for it and we get the opportunity to fly south today,\" said Sweeney.\n\nThe major decision facing Bruins' coach Jim Montgomery will be to stay with Swayman in Game 1 or platoon the position with Linus Ullmark, the 2023 Vezina Trophy winner. Swayman made six starts against the Leafs with four wins and leads all remaining goaltenders in save percentage (9.50) and goals against average (1.49).

The Bruins built a 3-1 series lead but were beaten 4-3 in overtime in Game 7 on April 30 at the Garden. The Bruins will begin their payback campaign against the Panthers on Monday night (8) at Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise, Fla.\n\nThe Bruins were in a similar situation after building a 3-1 series lead against the Maple Leafs before dropping the next two games. The Bruins narrowly avoided becoming the only team of the four major American sports leagues to build a 3-1 lead and lose a playoff series in consecutive years.\n\nGoaltender Jeremy Swayman recorded 30 saves and sniper David Pastrnak scored the game-winner at 1:54 of overtime.\n\n\"I am very proud of the group overall,\" said Bruins general manager Don Sweeney, prior to the team's departure from Hanscom Field on Sunday. \"Our series certainly tightened up from a goal-scoring standpoint in all situations. We knew it was going to be about trying to persevere and find that one more play with this group and fortunately we were able to do that.\n\n\"To a man, each guy went out and did their job and I thought our start was so much better than in (Games) 5 and 6 which didn't translate into a lead. We were playing from behind but we found a way. Congratulations to our group, they earned it.\"\n\nSweeney said the turnover of leadership in the locker room and the addition of so many new players to the roster makes last year's loss to the Panthers marginally a non-issue. The Bruins were 4-0 against the Panthers this season that included two overtime thrillers.\n\n\"We know the opponent and we will be prepared for it and we get the opportunity to fly south today,\" said Sweeney.\n\nThe major decision facing Bruins' coach Jim Montgomery will be to stay with Swayman in Game 1 or platoon the position with Linus Ullmark, the 2023 Vezina Trophy winner. Swayman made six starts against the Leafs with four wins and leads all remaining goaltenders in save percentage (9.50) and goals against average (1.49). Ullmark has a history of success against the Panthers but he did not fare well against them in last year's playoffs.\n\n\"It's been a strength of our team,\" said Sweeney. \"Jeremy got momentum on his side and ran with it. We had spoken about that and we had a plan in place. We will put both players in the best possible situation that we can to help our team win and move forward.\"\n\nThe Florida Panthers have a Patrice Bergeron impersonator on their roster and his name in Aleksander Barkov.\n\nThe NHL announced on Sunday that Barkov, Toronto's Auston Matthews and Carolina's Jordan Staal were the three finalists of the Selke Trophy, an award given annually to league's best all-around player. Like Bergeron, all three play the center position.\n\nBarkov won the Selke in 2021 and has been a finalist in three of the last four seasons. Bergeron captured the Selke a record six times including the last two seasons before his retirement from the league in 2023.\n\nBarkov posted some very Bergeron type Selke numbers this season. The Panthers captain took 1,100 face offs with a win rate of 57.3% and was fifth among NHL forwards with a plus 33. He scored 23 goals with 57 assists in 73 regular season games with two goals and three assists in the playoffs.\n\n\"He is a hell of a player and perhaps had Patrice not been playing he would have won (more),\" said Sweeney. \"It is a credit to him as a hockey player and he is leader of their hockey club and we have to respect the opponent.\"\n\nIn a related Panthers' item, coach Paul Maurice has ruled out center Sam Bennett for Game 1 against the Bruins. Bennett sustained a hand/wrist injury in Game 2 of the Panthers opening round series with Tampa Bay.\n\nVeteran right-wing Pat Maroon, 35, was one of Sweeney's roster additions and he came to Boston with a wealth of Stanley Cup experience. Maroon was with the St. Louis Blues when they knocked off the Bruins in Game 7 of the 2019 Stanley Cup final. He moved on to Tampa Bay where he won consecutive championships in 2020 and 2021.\n\n\"It is the hardest trophy to win,\" said Maroon. \"You can't be too high and you can't be too low, you have to be even and keep finding ways and keep battling through momentum shifts.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rich_thompson@bostonherald.com", "name": "Rich Thompson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Sweeney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Don Sweeney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Bergeron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrice Bergeron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vezina_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vezina Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Maroon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Maroon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_J._Selke_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank J.

Last year's series saw Florida, the Eastern Conference Wild Card seed, erase a 3-1 series deficit and win in Game 7 overtime against the League-leading Bruins. This year, however, it's the Panthers who finished in the Atlantic Division's top seed, taking on the No. 2 Bruins.\n\nThe two clubs competed in close games during the regular season in 2023-24, with three out of four being one-goal contests. Boston swept the regular-season series, while Florida has won both of the previous two postseason series between the two clubs.\n\nOur AI-powered dfsPro model projects a number of individual performances worth keeping an eye on during Monday's second-round matchup. Let's dive into some of our favorite NHL player props for Game 1 of Bruins vs. Panthers!\n\nBoston defenseman Charlie McAvoy started strong out of the gate this postseason averaging a point per game over Boston's first four contests against the Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round. He cooled off offensively in the back half of the series, however, posting three scoreless games causing our model to project a 16% downturn in his average point potential tonight against the Panthers tonight. Still, our model projects McAvoy to finish just above the betting line at 0.54 points in Game 1.\n\nThe Maple Leafs largely neutralized Bruins center Charlie Coyle during their first-round series, holding him to just two assists over seven games. As a result, his expected point production in Game 1 against Florida has taken a hit, with our model projecting a 19% drop-off from his average of 0.73 points per game. Even with the projected decline, however, Coyle's point forecast for tonight's contest sits just above the betting line at 0.59.\n\nPanthers winger Vladimir Tarasenko put up three points (1 goal, 2 assists) in five games during Florida's first-round series against the Tampa Bay Lightning. Our model projects a 9% decrease in Tarasenko's average of 0.72 points per game in Game 1 against the Bruins, but he is still projected to land just above the betting line at 0.65 points.\n\nPanthers center Sam Reinhart put 23 shots on goal over five games in the first-round series against Tampa Bay, and he only had fewer than four shots in one of those five contests (three shots in Game 3 on April 25, a 5-3 Panthers win). He averaged 2.84 shots per game during the regular season, and our model projects a 33% uptick over that average to 3.79 shots tonight against the Bruins.\n\nLike his teammate Tarasenko, Panthers defenseman Brandon Montour put up three points in five games during the first round against the Lightning. He averaged exactly 0.5 points per game during the regular season, but our model projects a 26% increase over that average to 0.63 points in Game 1 against the Bruins.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_lingan@heavy.com", "name": "Emma Lingan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Division (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Coyle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Coyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Tarasenko", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Tarasenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_McAvoy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie McAvoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2115890955_edd766-e1715027656486.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541234", "eventUri": "eng-9541234", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 2419, "textEnd": 2427}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

You saw right from the beginning of the game, we were a different team.\"\n\nThe Bruins, who finished one point back of the Panthers in the Atlantic Division, were poised to make quick work of Toronto but needed two players to step up for them to finally seal the deal. Goaltender Jeremy Swayman sparkled while posting a 1.49 goals-against average and .950 save percentage through six games.\n\nDavid Pastrnak, a 110-point player in the regular season, was called out by Montgomery to elevate his play amidst a middling series and delivered the overtime-winning goal.\n\n\"He said the stuff he did after Game 6 and I told him, 'If I'm the coach and you were me, I would say the same thing,' \" Pastrnak said. \"I had no problem with him saying that. He's trying to bring the best out of every single player.\"\n\nThe Panthers, who knocked out the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games, will finally be back in action, having last played April 29 when they advanced with a 6-1 series-clinching victory.\n\nLast year's Eastern Conference playoff champions have spent a long time waiting to find out their next opponent after vanquishing their state rivals.\n\n\"I think we all knew it was probably going to be Boston the way that series was going,\" winger Matthew Tkachuk said after practicing on Sunday.\n\nTkachuk said last season's series victory over the Bruins, who ran away with the 2022-23 league's regular-season title, was a huge turning point for the Panthers' organization.\n\n\"The effects of that series are still being shown now,\" Tkachuk said. \"We know that this is a very similar team to last year, a couple of different pieces, but there were a lot of high-scoring games, and I'm expecting it to be more of the lower-scoring side judging by how both teams like to play and how they have success.\"\n\nAlthough the extended break had the potential to give second-line center Sam Bennett time to heal from his suspected hand or wrist injury, he is not yet ready to return.\n\n\"He's at or probably better than I hoped he would be,\" coach Paul Maurice said.\n\nIn Bennett's absence, Anton Lundell has moved up the lineup and taken a bigger role.

This contributed to them hitting the over in nearly every one of their first-round games against the Lightning.\n\nConversely, the Bruins smothered the Leafs defensively and won their first-round series with the Maple Leafs in seven games through low-scoring, gritty matchups.\n\nWhile Boston has added some young pieces to the roster, this seems like the closing of the championship window for some of the legendary Bruins players such as Brad Marchand and Milan Lucic.\n\nThe unfortunate reality for both of these talented teams is the incredible depth of the Eastern Conference this season. One of these teams will have to face either the New York Rangers or Carolina Hurricanes, both capable of winning the Stanley Cup.\n\n\" READ MORE: Back the Mets and Cardinals to score plenty of runs in Monday night's matchup in St. Louis\n\nIt's important to note that this matchup has a relatively low over-under at 5.5 goals.\n\nIf you are OK with the risk, I think this could provide some value with the over paying +100. The Panthers have surged offensively and match up well with both rosters relatively similar to last season.\n\nHowever, I'm hesitant to take the over with the Bruins' penchant for low-scoring affairs.\n\nIf Boston turns Game 1 into a grimy matchup, it could slow down the Florida offense. So, how does this affect your betting strategy?\n\nI am bullish on this Panthers team and think they have the Eastern Conference's best chance at winning the Stanley Cup.\n\nI think the Panthers take Game 1 against the Bruins. However, I'm not confident enough on how the game will play out to take the over 5.5 total goals.\n\nIf you are confident in the low O/U, you can squeeze more value out of the moneyline by pairing it with the over to make a plus-money same game parlay.

Panthers center Sam Bennett might be able to play against the Boston Bruins following an injury, per Sports Net Canada. Bennett is definitely out for Game 1, but considered day-to-day.\n\nThe center suffered an upper body injury in a recent playoff game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. Bennett left Game 2 of the Lightning playoff series, and was expected to be out a good while. The center is on the mend and skating Sunday, per Sports Net. Florida is preparing to take on the Boston Bruins, who defeated Toronto after an intense seven game series.\n\nBennett and the Panthers\n\nBennett was having some success in the playoffs before going down to injury. The center had a goal and an assist in his two playoff game appearances, along with a plus-minus of + 1. The center has a career playoff record of +7 in his plus-minus, and adds a lot of versatility to the line when he's on the ice.\n\nDuring the regular season, Bennett had 41 total points, including 20 goals. His 41 points were the second-highest he has ever had in a campaign. He had a career-high 49 points while skating for the Panthers in the 2021-22 campaign. The center was on the ice for about 17 minutes a game this season for Florida.\n\nThe Panthers skated past the Lightning in five games. Florida flexed their muscles on offense, scoring six goals in the closeout Game 5. The team scored 20 total goals in the series, third in the NHL among playoff teams. Only the Colorado Avalanche and Edmonton Oilers scored more goals to this point in the playoffs, per league stats. A healthy Bennett would add even more firepower to the offense, and the club could certainly use it against the Bruins. Boston closed out the Maple Leafs in seven games, by piling it on offensively. The Bruins scored a total of 18 goals against Toronto, while allowing only 12 goals in seven games.\n\nBennett is in his third full season with Florida. He previously played for the Calgary Flames from 2014-21. In his career, the center has scored 137 goals and added 141 assists. He also skated in the Ontario Hockey League before his time in the NHL, as Bennett is a Canadian. Bennett has 44 career points in the NHL Playoffs. He was with the team last season when Florida made its run to the Stanley Cup, before bowing to Las Vegas.\n\nThe Panthers and Bruins play Game 1 of their playoff series Monday. The puck is scheduled to drop at 8:00 Eastern in Florida. Panthers fans are certainly hoping Bennett can return to the ice sooner rather than later.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_adducchio@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Benjamin Adducchio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bennett_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bennett (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus\u2013minus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plus\u2013minus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Hockey_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ontario Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary_Flames", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calgary Flames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sam-Bennett-gets-positive-injury-update-ahead-of-Bruins-series-but-theres-a-catch.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541234", "eventUri": "eng-9541234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Will the Favorites Prevail?", "body": "The first round of the NHL's Eastern Conference Stanley Cup playoffs is over - and this writer went 2-2 in his Eastern predictions. Let's now turn our attention to the second round, and see if we can improve on that 50 percent success mark:\n\nNew York Rangers (1) vs. Carolina Hurricanes (2)\n\nWhy the Rangers could win: Did you see how the Blueshirts manhandled the Washington Capitals in the first round? They barely broke a sweat in sweeping the Caps, and set the league on notice - this isn't the same Rangers team that faltered badly in Round 1 of the 2023 playoffs. Under the expert coaching of Peter Laviolette, the Rangers dominated Washington and saved themselves a lot of time and energy to punch their ticket to Round 2. Star goalie Igor Shesterkin is superior to Hurricanes counterpart Frederik Andersen, and the Rangers can match or improve on any element of Carolina's game. The Blueshirts were the best regular-season team in the league, and the best Eastern playoff team in the opening round. Carolina has a chance to beat them, but not a great chance.\n\nWhy the Hurricanes could win: The Hurricanes also steamrolled their first-round opponents in Round 1 this spring, dispatching the New York Islanders in five games with relative ease. Carolina's well-balanced, well-coached group has the speed and depth to keep pace with the Rangers, and in a six-or-seven-game series like the one this matchup promises to be, a fortunate bounce here or there can be the difference between an Eastern Conference final appearance and a second-round exit. Rod Brind'Amour is going to have his 'Canes charges motivated and prepared to battle the Rangers, and nobody would be surprised if Carolina squeaked by New York in a long and difficult series.\n\nWho is going to win:Rangers, in six games\n\nThe Rangers were our pick to win the East in our pre-playoffs predictions, and nothing has changed to make us feel any differently. The Rangers have it all, but they have that little bit extra - particularly, in goal - to be the difference against the Hurricanes. Shesterkin is a bona-fide difference-maker between the pipes, and he's the primary reason we expect the Blueshirts to outlast the 'Canes and make it back to the Eastern final and beyond. It's not going to be a cakewalk for them, but the Rangers have the elite talent at all positions to at least be as good as Carolina, and we're projecting the Rangers will take on either the Florida Panthers or Boston Bruins in the conference final.\n\nFlorida Panthers (1) vs. Boston Bruins (2)\n\nWhy the Panthers could win: The Panthers made short work of their intra-state rivals in Tampa Bay, sending the Lightning packing in five games in Round 1. Florida was by no small measure the better team of the two, limiting the Bolts to just eight goals in the Panthers' four wins in the first-round series. And the Panthers conserved a ton of energy - at least, compared to the Bruins, who needed seven games to narrowly beat the Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round. Florida has the energy and depth to outlast Boston, and the Panthers also have good enough goaltending to match Bruins star netminder Jeremy Swayman. Whatever the Bruins did to the Leafs in Round 1, the Panthers are going to do to Boston in Round 2.\n\nWhy the Bruins could win: The only way Boston is winning this series is if Swayman stands on his head and out-and-out steals games from the Panthers. The Bruins' offense has been wobbly at best, but Boston beat the Leafs because their defense picked up the slack and limited Toronto to very few second and third chances in high-danger spots around the net. If they can thwart Florida's high-quality scoring chances, Swayman should be able to give his teammates a chance to win this matchup and take on either the Rangers or Hurricanes in the conference final.\n\nWho is going to win:Florida, in five games\n\nYes, we believe the Panthers are going to demolish the Bruins with relative ease, as Florida isn't going to be dissuaded from imposing its will against Boston. The Panthers are at least as much of a well-coached group as the Bruins are, but Florida's defense corps is better than Boston's, and the Panthers' go-to skaters are better than the Bruins'. The rest the Panthers built up by beating Tampa in five games should be a big help to them in this series, and we suspect this series will be just as short as Florida's first-round series was. The Panthers are tracking toward a showdown against the Rangers, and while that will be a toss-up series, this tilt will go Florida's way and eliminate the Bruins sooner than later.\n\nRelated: Bruins Steal the Leafs' Lunch Money Again - And It All Started with Bobby Orr in Early '60s\n\nRelated: NHL Announces 2024 Selke Trophy Finalists", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_proteau@kansascity.com", "name": "Adam Proteau", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Shesterkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Igor Shesterkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Laviolette", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Laviolette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_Andersen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frederik Andersen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Brind'Amour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rod Brind'Amour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Islanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Islanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_J._Selke_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank J.

Florida marched all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals for the second time in franchise history, although they ultimately lost in five games to the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\n\"It showed we could beat anybody and it gave us a lot of confidence,\" star Panthers winger Matthew Tkachuk said. \"No matter who we played, no matter what building we're in, no matter what happens here, we have a chance to win. It brought us super close together, and the effects of that series are still being shown off.\"\n\nAnd now, the playoff rivalry will be renewed with the Panthers facing the Bruins in the playoffs for the second consecutive year -- this time in Round 2 after Florida beat Tampa Bay in five games and Boston beat Toronto in seven games in their respective opening-round matchups.\n\nPuck drop for Game 1 of the best-of-7 series is at 8 p.m. Monday at Sunrise's Amerant Bank Arena.\n\nThe Panthers have known they will be in the second round for nearly a week now after. Boston had to stave off Toronto's efforts to mount a comeback from down 3-1 in the first-round series.\n\nThe roles are basically reversed heading into this Florida-Boston series, but that doesn't mean the Panthers are concerning themselves about the fact that those outside the room are viewing them as the favorites this time around.\n\n\"I think that's more for you to decide,\" Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov said. \"We just play our game. We know how to play. We know how to play hard. That's what we want to do. We have the same mindset as last year. We want to out-compete every team we play. It doesn't matter who we play. We want to be at our best every game. It's not our decision to decide who's the favorite.\"\n\nHow Paul Maurice found peace being 'just a piece' -- and how that's helped the Panthers\n\nLast year, the Panthers didn't have to worry about that because, at least on the outside, they were the clear-cut underdog. Florida barely made it into the playoffs while Boston went 65-12-5 in the regular season. The Bruins quickly proceeded to jump out to a 3-1 series lead against the Panthers, putting Florida on the brink of seeing its postseason journey end before it could begin.\n\nFlorida would need to put together three consecutive wins to stay alive.\n\nAnd that's when the magic began.\n\nIt started with Game 5 at Boston's TD Garden. Florida took the lead three times in regulation on goals by Anthony Duclair, Sam Bennett and Sam Reinhart only for Boston to respond each time and force overtime.\n\nTkachuk sealed the first of three must-win game 6:05 into overtime and shortly afterward gave his team a resounding message.\n\n\"Boys, remember this room,\" Tkachuk said in the dressing room. \"We'll be back here for seven.\"\n\n\"We didn't think we had a disadvantage at all,\" Panthers defenseman Brandon Montour said, \"but I think once we tied it up, it became surreal for everyone and we said 'We can do something here.'\"\n\nIn that Game 7, the Panthers jumped out to a 2-0 lead early in the second period before Boston scored three unanswered goals to take a 3-2 lead 4:11 into the third period.\n\nUndeterred, Montour tied the game with a minute left in regulation and winger Carter Verhaeghe clinched the series win 8:35 into overtime.\n\n\"That just showed us pretty much that when we do things the right way and when we play really hard, everything is possible,\" Barkov said. \"That's what we learned from that series and it's been carried over to this year.\"\n\nFlorida Panthers' Aleksander Barkov a Selke Trophy finalist for third time in four seasons\n\nThis year, Florida won the Atlantic Division, edging Boston for the crown by one point.\n\nThe Panthers did not, however, beat their in any of their four regular-season matchups, although two of the games went to overtime, a third was also decided by one goal and the fourth was a two-goal game.\n\n\"They definitely got us in the regular season,\" Tkachuk said. \"I think if you ask them, they're probably using that for confidence go to this series. And we're like 'The regular season doesn't matter. We got them in playoffs.' We'll use our playoff experience and use that as confidence. They did take it to us this year, but they were all close games. So I'm expecting a very good series.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Verhaeghe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carter Verhaeghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Duclair", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Duclair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_J._Selke_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank J.

Florida, meanwhile, hasn't played in a bit. The Panthers defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in just five games to advance in the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nMarchand and his team acknowledged the difference in rest on their side. Still, the Bruins are not going to make any excuses heading into this series. This is the hand they were dealt, and they will gameplan for the Panthers with their current circumstances.\n\n\"I'd say the toughest part about this game and the transition between this game and next series is that we're obviously riding a big high and we have to completely forget about it starting [Sunday] morning,\" Brad Marchand said, via NHL.com. \"But that's the great thing about playoffs is we earned another four games but now have to completely flip the script and get prepared again.\"\n\nBruins, Panthers have familiarity\n\nBrad Marchand and his team are taking on a rather familiar opponent in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. In fact, the Bruins and Panthers met just last season in the tournament. And that series ended up being one of the more talked about showdowns of the year, especially given the result.\n\nThe Bruins initially raced out to a 3-1 series lead. And it wasn't exactly the most competitive series, either. Boston controlled the play for most of the games. It truly looked like the Panthers were on the brink of an early exit in the Stanley Cup Playoffs once again.\n\nHowever, Florida kept themselves in the series. They picked up a huge overtime win in Game 5 before winning Game 6 on home ice. This forced a Game 7, which took place back in Boston. This game also went to overtime, where Florida got the job done. Carter Verhaghe scored another clutch goal to send the Panthers into the second round.\n\nScript is flipped in 2024 Stanley Cup Playoffs\n\nThe Panthers went on to win the Eastern Conference title in 2023. However, they fell short of the Stanley Cup when they lost in five games to the Vegas Golden Knights. It was an inspiring run from a team that barely snuck into the Stanley Cup Playoffs to begin with.\n\nIn 2024, though, the roles are completely flipped. Brad Marchand and his Bruins were the historically good team looking to cap off a 65-win season with a Stanley Cup. This year, they are a good team, but they are not are potent as they were this time a season ago.\n\nThe Panthers, meanwhile, aren't the underdogs in this fight. Florida is one of the best defensive teams in the NHL this year. And they are one of the more physical teams in the tournament. The Panthers entered the Stanley Cup Playoffs as a favorite to win it all. Their performance against the Lightning has ensured they remain favorites in the tournament.\n\nBrad Marchand and the Bruins have the talent to win this series. But the challenge is different from the last time they played the Panthers.

A rematch with the Florida Panthers team that ruined their Stanley Cup dreams a year ago. This Panthers team looks even better than the one that went to the Stanley Cup Final a year ago.\n\nThat latter point brings us to a pretty big issue the Bruins might have in this series. While the Panthers look better, the Bruins roster looks worse than last year's on paper with one pretty big glaring weakness that has been a question mark all season.\n\nTheir centers.\n\nWhen Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci retired after the 2022-23 season it left two massive holes in their top two center spots. Instead of bringing in outside help, they simply gave Charlie Coyle and Pavel Zacha bigger roles and bumped them up the depth chart. For the most part, it kind of worked in the regular season. They were effective enough, didn't really lose any of their production and still helped the Bruins win 47 games.\n\nBut neither one of them is a No. 1 center, and it is extraordinarily difficult to win a Stanley Cup without having a true No. 1 center on your roster. The type of impact player that is going to keep opposing coaches awake at night going into a playoff series and one that you can count on to help carry your offense.\n\nThe duo combined for zero goals in the Bruins' first-round series against Toronto and were consistently crushed in the face-off circle. Going up against Aleksander Barkov, Sam Reinhart and Anton Lundell is going to be a big advantage in Florida's favor.\n\nCoyle and Zacha were enough to get them through the regular season. They were barely enough to sneak by a perpetually underachieving Toronto team. Getting by Florida in a best-of-seven series where matchups and weaknesses can be exploited is going to be a significantly harder challenge. Especially when this Bruins team couldn't do it with Bergeron and Krejci in those spots.\n\n* After losing in seven games to the Panthers a year ago, including three consecutive losses to close out the series, Boston came back and swept the regular season series by winning all four games.\n\n* It seems that the Bruins goalie rotation that they stuck with all regular season has officially gone out the window in the playoffs as Jeremy Swayman has taken over the No. 1 spot. He had a staggeringly high .950 save percentage in his six games in the first round and should have the job on lockdown. It is his net.\n\n* The Panthers were tied for the fewest goals against in the NHL during the regular season and it was a pretty collective team effort that got them there. They were fifth in the NHL in expected goals against during 5-on-5 play and also had the second-best team save percentage in the NHL.\n\n* The Bruins are going to need more from defenseman Charlie McAvoy in this series. He provided little offensively in the first round and struggled to make routine plays out of the zone as the series went on. Florida's forecheck is going to be a nightmare for him and the Bruins if he does not get his play back under control.\n\n* Matthew Tkachuk's regular season production took a dip this season, but he was a monster in the first round against Tampa Bay with three goals and six assists in the five games.

While Boston's relief of not blowing a 3-1 first-round series lead was palpable, needing seven games puts the Bs at a disadvantage for Round 2. They shuffle down to Florida for a quick turnaround against the well-rested Panthers.\n\nA significant disparity in rest complicates expectations as we continue to use the tools we've sharpened leading up to the postseason (even-strength play, skating talent, goaltending) to break it all down.\n\nAdvanced metrics glossary\n\nConverting scoring changes at a high rate and having above-average goaltending are crucial ingredients to playoff success. Let's look at predictive metrics for those two elements.\n\nSkaters' scoring talent\n\nAgainst the Leafs, the Bruins were much better on the power play than at even strength, but 12-of-88 (13.6%) wasn't enough to match their regular-season SNIPES rate, which was fourth among playoff teams. Meanwhile, in five games, the Panthers had the same number of even-strength high-danger chance conversions (six) in 20 fewer chances.\n\nGoaltending matchup\n\nSergei Bobrovsky was steady against the Lightning, so the Bruins' goaltending situation is far more interesting.\n\nThe Bruins had little choice but to roll with Jeremy Swayman, who needs a raise to pay the foreign buyer's tax on his ownership of Toronto. A 1.42 GSAx is unbelievably good. But given the quick start to Round 2, this could be an opportunity to rest Swayman in Game 1 and get back to the rotation Jim Montgomery intended to use before the playoffs started. Linus Ullmark won all three starts against the Panthers this season, racking up a .947 save percentage and 1.62 goals-against average.\n\nTeam ratings\n\nOddsmakers create moneylines based on a numerical valuation of every team. Here's the market's most recent valuation compared to how I have them rated (based on the metrics above) for the full season and post-All-Star break:\n\nThe Bruins and the Maple Leafs both had a team rating 15% above league average, resulting in a close, competitive series. Meanwhile, the Panthers controlled 53% of even-strength play in Round 1, befitting a team with a slightly higher rating than its second-round opponent.\n\nHere are the prices that would be considered valuable for each team on the road, at home, and to win the series.\n\nBased on the entire season, the Bruins have a 46% chance to win the series, while their +150 odds imply a 40% win probability. That 6% difference is likely the result of a rest disparity and the idea that Boston may have been fortunate to beat Toronto, who missed Auston Matthews and William Nylander at various points of the series.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see if the market applies that thought process to the games in Beantown since a Game 1 moneyline of +145 suggests the Bruins will be +120 underdogs at home in Game 3.\n\nThe Panthers are the better team and boast both rest and home-ice advantage. Any Bruin exhaustion will potentially show up as the players wear down later in the series. Should a theoretically valuable bet on Boston come to fruition, it may be the result of fatigue getting to Florida early - which could help the Bruins take advantage of Bobrovsky's habit of occasional lulls in play.\n\nHere are possible ways to back the Bruins early:\n\nIf the Bruins fall behind early in the series, it'll be surprising if things get better for them as playoff minutes pile up. Acknowledging that Boston could steal low-scoring games early enough to clip Florida, we'll sacrifice some of the Panthers -2.5 payout and play the series game total.", "source": {"uri": "thescore.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theScore.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://assets-cms.thescore.com/uploads/image/file/627667/w768xh576_GettyImages-2136580383.jpg?ts=1714922892", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541234", "eventUri": "eng-9541234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The Panthers, as expected, were the stronger team at 5-on-5 and contained Nikita Kucherov for the majority of the series.\n\nWhile the Panthers were full value for their Round 1 victory, the Bruins had to slug it out against the Leafs, who were missing William Nylander, Auston Matthews and Joseph Woll at various times in the series.\n\nThe Bruins really struggled to create anything offensively at 5-on-5 against the Leafs and relied on the heroics of Jeremy Swayman in goal, a huge special teams advantage and a moment of magic from David Pastrnak to get the job done.\n\nAnd it isn't just recent results that is causing the betting market to side with the Panthers. Although these two teams finished neck-and-neck in the standings, there's a lot of context that is needed. The most obvious red flag is that Florida finished with a much better goal difference. The Cats were +68 on the campaign, while the B's finished at (a still impressive) +43.\n\nUnder the hood, it's more of the same. Florida was near the top of the NHL in 5-on-5 goal difference, shot attempt share, expected goal rate and high-danger scoring chance percentage through the 82-game marathon. Boston was right there with the Cats in goal difference, but the Bruins were closer to average in everything else.\n\nBoston's elite goaltending covered up some considerable cracks.\n\nThe Bruins are a good team and can't be taken lightly, but they'll need to drastically improve their offensive form from last series while still winning the goaltending and special teams battles. Maybe that happens, but I think there's value betting on Game 1 to get away from them and this series to end quickly.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Woll", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Woll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Kucherov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikita Kucherov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/center-steven-lorentz-18-celebrate-80930422-e1715000531342.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541234", "eventUri": "eng-9541234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The Florida Panthers had other plans with an epic upset that catapulted them all the way to the Stanley Cup Final and beyond.\n\nThat beyond is here: Florida is now the big dog in the Atlantic; the team to beat. The Panthers have grown into a powerhouse ready to prove last year's run was no fluke.\n\nStanding in their way is the team that set the table for them, only now, the tables have turned. Can the Bruins flip the script and get revenge?\n\nLast year the Bruins had a 73 percent chance of getting by the Panthers, but ultimately the 27 percent prevailed.\n\nOne year later, the Bruins are in the exact opposite position, now sitting as 31 percent underdogs. A lot has changed since (on both sides) to lead to that conclusion.\n\nThat conclusion means Florida should take care of business. The Panthers have a stronger, deeper team with more stars and depth that can contribute at both ends of the ice. There's more than enough to overwhelm a Bruins team with real deficiencies papered over by elite goaltending.\n\nOf course, the same was true last year when the underdog prevailed. It could happen again, this time for the Bruins -- a fitting twist for this growing Atlantic rivalry. That thirst for vengeance might make this a closer series than it looks on paper.\n\nThe Panthers and Bruins are separated by 44 goals, which stems from the differences in their offense.\n\nFlorida's a high-octane team that blends elite puck movement and a strong forecheck to challenge opponents. The Panthers thrive in transition and generate a lot of dangerous passes at five-on-five. Their biggest problem tends to be converting on those chances enough to match what they create, but that wasn't the case in Round 1. That even-strength play, paired with a power play that has generated a ton of quality looks all year, adds up to a plus-46 Offensive Rating.\n\nBoston, on the other hand, is down to minus-3 after Round 1. Similar to the regular season, the Bruins take a quality-over-quantity approach. Some teams manage to make more out of less, like Boston -- but that can get tested against solid defensive teams like Florida.\n\nThe Panthers let a higher rate of quality chances back in Round 1 against the Tampa Bay Lightning compared to the regular season. But generally speaking, Florida's an aggressive defending team at even strength and short-handed. And they've had super solid goaltending to support them from Sergei Bobrovsky.\n\nThis is where these teams match up a lot more closely, with just five goals between their Defensive Ratings.\n\nDefense was a strength of the Bruins all year. At five-on-five, Boston didn't give up many shots or scoring chances and had steady goaltending to back it up. Like Florida, it disrupts passes and doesn't allow many rush chances back. But the Bruins can get exposed by their sloppy breakouts.\n\nSimilar to Florida, the Bruins conceded more shots and quality chances than usual in Round 1 at five-on-five. Unlike the Panthers, their penalty kill was pretty stout in their opening series. But the special teams battle is going to get a lot tougher for both sides of this matchup in Round 2.\n\nWhat's changed since last season's epic seven-game clash?\n\nBoston had a captain change during the offseason that you may have heard about, so we'll start there. Patrice Bergeron's retirement didn't just remove the Bruins' emotional core; it took a still-elite player out of the lineup. His departure, paired with second-line counterpart David Krejci's, created a domino effect that pushed Charlie Coyle and Pavel Zacha from the third line to the 1C and 2C slots.\n\nIt'd be understandable to assume the biggest hit Boston took overall was at defense; it also wouldn't be quite correct. Boston's team Offensive Rating year over year has dropped 44 points, from plus-47 to plus-3. The decline starts at 1C, where Bergeron, even at 37, was a plus-6 offensive player. Mix in his defensive value (plus-4) and you've got a net drop of eight points when compared to Coyle, who replaced Bergeron as the everyday center for Jake DeBrusk and Brad Marchand.\n\nBoston's offensive dip might begin down the middle, but it extends throughout the lineup. Marchand put up 67 points for the second straight season, but his Net Rating dropped. Tyler Bertuzzi and Taylor Hall posted plus Offensive Ratings as third-line wingers; the 2023-24 Bruins had none of those. Some of that was unavoidable; last season, Boston parlayed a \"Last Dance\" mentality with short-term cap space to add effective rental players like Bertuzzi and Garnet Hathaway. Both would be upgrades on their 2023-24 analogs.\n\nOn the left side of the blue line, they've taken an even bigger year-over-year hit. Hampus Lindholm hasn't been nearly as helpful to the offensive cause (plus-7 to zero), and they've gone from Dmitry Orlov (plus-5 Offensive Rating) as a third-pair luxury to Parker Wotherspoon (minus-3). The end result: a lineup, outside of David Pastrnak, that has seen a major, across-the-board drop in offensive effectiveness. That relative lack of firepower is the single biggest reason the script has flipped since the last time these teams saw each other in a playoff series.\n\nThe issue is also exacerbated by the Panthers' overall improvements, mainly on defense. Matthew Tkachuk isn't going to show up on Hart Trophy ballots for a second straight season, but he's still elite -- and Florida counterbalanced his slight dip with Sam Reinhart's quantum leap. Reinhart was good last season, putting up 31 goals and nine at five-on-five. In 2023, his output jumped to 57 goals, including a league-leading 27 on the power play. His emergence as a true all-situations offensive force stands in stark contrast to what's become of the Bruins' wingers.\n\nOn defense, Brandon Montour and Aaron Ekblad have taken a step back as point producers but made up for some of that with improved defensive play. Gustav Forsling, meanwhile, took another step forward, becoming Florida's most complete defenseman and serving as a bit of a shorthand for why this series' initial outlook is so much different than the last.\n\nIs David Pastrnak ready to step up and take over after being the Game 7 hero?\n\nIt's not that Pastrnak had been bad for the first six games of the Bruins/Toronto Maple Leafs first-round series; as Boston jumped out to a 3-1 lead, he'd put up two goals, two primary assists and three positive Game Scores, including a 2.17 in Game 4 that led forwards on both teams. It's that his production and overall play had noticeably dipped in Games 5 and 6, enough so for coach Jim Montgomery to publicly ask for more from his 47-goal winger. After all, it's tough to close out a series when your best player is held off the scoresheet on consecutive nights.\n\nPastrnak understood. \"I told Montgomery, 'If I am the coach and you are me, I'd say the same thing,'\" he said after Game 7. The goal he scored couldn't have been more important.\n\nNow his task will be to maintain momentum. Last postseason, he scored five goals in seven games against the Panthers, including three in Games 6 and 7. Boston lost those by a combined score of 11-8, but it's hard to blame Pastrnak. At five-on-five with him on the ice, Boston won on expected goals, 3.6 to 1.92. It's also worth noting that the Bruins controlled about 66 percent of the expected goals in Pastrnak's 30:37 matched up with Aleksander Barkov. They'll need more of the same.\n\nFlorida's power stems from its top end -- a group that runs seven deep, well spread out between forwards and defensemen.\n\nThere are other contenders with four forwards north of a plus-10 Net Rating, but they don't have the same strong backbone on the back end. Forsling has turned into one of the game's best shutdown defensemen this year and is projected to deliver a plus-6 Defensive Rating, which is a top-three mark in the league. Between him and Ekblad, the Panthers boast one of the league's best shutdown pairs -- one that helped limit the damage that Tampa Bay's best could muster in Round 1. That pair taking on tough minutes also frees up Montour to freewheel offensively, a key layer to Florida's pressurized attack.\n\nSome contenders can match that, but they don't have nearly the same firepower up front. The Panthers have three forwards who grade out with an identical plus-20 Net Rating. There's captain Barkov, the league's best two-way forward. There's his running-mate, Reinhart, who carries his own strong defensive pedigree while also scoring 50-plus goals this season. And then there's Tkachuk, a sparkplug who generates a ton of offense and whose down year would be most players' career year. Add Carter Verhaeghe, who has a penchant for heroics this time of year, and it's a downright frightening quartet.\n\nIt helps too that those same players were operating at their expected high level against the Lightning. Over five games, they were projected to be worth 6.1 goals, and they delivered as promised at plus-6.7. Verhaeghe's well-documented clutch factor was a huge part of that, but that's also part of the luxury of having a well-balanced abundance of talent at the top. In any given series, it's unlikely every star will be firing on all cylinders at once. But it is likely at least one or two can own the moment to carry the load, with the next series getting a stamp from someone else.\n\nBy Net Rating, Florida's top seven skaters hold a 42-goal advantage over Boston's -- essentially the exact difference between the two teams in terms of their total makeup. If Florida beats Boston as expected, it may be as simple as \"the Panthers had more great players.\"\n\nThe Panthers aren't just stars and scrubs, though. The supporting cast may not be spectacular, but it is well-rounded enough to push the team toward the league's upper echelon. There aren't a lot of holes to expose -- aside from a fairly weak fourth line that was exposed a bit in Round 1. Aside from them, the third line is solid, Vladimir Tarasenko offers up offensive punch, and Sam Bennett is a terrific piece between the Clutch Brothers when healthy (he is expected to at least miss Game 1). On defense, Niko Mikkola has been a solid defensive foil next to Montour and the third pair has been more than adequate.\n\nIf there's a weakness that can be exploited in Florida, it's between the pipes. We saw Bobrovsky at his best in last year's playoffs and in spurts this season. The Panthers win easily with him at the helm when he's at the top of his game. Bobrovsky doesn't even have to be elite for Florida to win this series, the Panthers are more than capable enough elsewhere. But the potential to be bad enough to lose the series for Florida is one that also lingers in the background.\n\nBobrovsky is far from safe or reliable -- a direct contrast from what Boston has in both Jeremy Swayman and Linus Ullmark.\n\nGoaltending is Boston's largest advantage. That's especially true if Swayman can continue to harness the frustrating series-stealing energy he showed in Round 1 where his .950 save percentage was one of the best marks ever in a single series. In six games he saved 8.4 goals above expected, the highest mark of any goalie.\n\nEven if he falters or the Bruins opt to go back to their rotation, Boston has the best \"second\" option in the league with Ullmark ready to step in if necessary.\n\nThe Bruins having the two best goalies in the series is a nice luxury, but there's unfortunately only one net and several holes in front of the team that the Panthers can take advantage of.\n\nUp front, that starts with the team's top two centers, a dire one-two punch that was outchanced against Toronto and struggled to deliver any semblance of offense. That puts more pressure on key wingers Pastrnak, Marchand and DeBrusk to produce. While that may have worked against a Leafs team whose biggest enemy is itself, it's going to be a lot more difficult against a Panthers team that has more firepower and is much stingier.\n\nThe key for Boston may be understanding its best bet is trying to slow things down to dampen the damage. On one hand, Charlie Coyle was on for only 33 percent of the five-on-five goals in Round 1. On the other, he was only outscored 2-1 -- big whoop.\n\nSlowing the opposing attack and creating a safe space for Boston's elite goaltending to shine is what worked against Toronto. The Bruins will have to do the same against an even scarier opponent. The Bruins defense is well-equipped to handle that with a defensive trifecta of Charlie McAvoy, Lindholm and Brandon Carlo. The trio may not be offensively on par with Florida's, but it handles its business well defensively. Carlo especially was excellent in Round 1.\n\nA lot hinges on McAvoy being an all-around force. While the Panthers may have the better top end, an argument can be made that the best forward, defenseman and goalie are all on Boston's side. If Pastrnak, McAvoy and Swayman can make that difference felt, the Bruins have a shot. It's just a real uphill climb elsewhere.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk vs. Brad Marchand\n\nThe most eye-catching matchup of this series? One between two highly skilled rat kings in Marchand and Tkachuk.\n\nTkachuk comes into the series as one of the most valuable forwards, with a plus-20 Net Rating that is tied with Barkov, Reinhart and Pastrnak. His goal scoring may have slipped this year, but he's been an elite playmaker at even strength and on the power play to give the Panthers an edge in his minutes.\n\nWith nine points in five games, Tkachuk put his stamp on Round 1. He delivered offensively but didn't dominate his minutes as much at five-on-five, especially when matching up head-to-head against Victor Hedman. Florida outscored Tampa Bay 5-3 and had the slight edge in scoring chances in his minutes, which doesn't quite meet the high bar he set for himself last spring. But the Bruins saw firsthand last postseason what a playoff menace he can be, whether he's making them pay on the scoresheet or bringing that disruptive energy, and that's what they have to anticipate this series.\n\nThat's Marchand's specialty as well. Balancing pest-like tendencies with high-end skill is an art that Marchand is elite at. That got the Leafs off their game at times in Round 1 and could be a distraction for Florida as well. Against Toronto, Marchand and the Bruins had a slight edge in expected and actual goals at five-on-five. After Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner, Marchand will now likely get a heavy dose of Tkachuk to open the series.\n\nWho ends up driving those minutes may come down to who can play through each other's rat king tactics versus who gets distracted and derailed by it.\n\nThe \"rematch\" angle is irresistible for a reason -- Florida ruined things for the Bruins in 2023-24, and now the Bruins have an opportunity to turn the tables. Plus, Boston just prevented a second straight first-round collapse. That counts for something.\n\nStill, one side has gotten better, and one has gotten worse. Florida's edge is too significant to ignore.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It is not for the faint of heart, nor for the weary and weak. The Boston Bruins are well aware of this, and they'll be put to the test under such a scenario starting Monday night.\n\nNot long after adding another voluminous chapter to the Toronto Maple Leafs' gargantuan book of Postseason Heartbreak -- thanks to a David Pastrnak backhand goal 1:54 into overtime Saturday night at TD Garden, giving his squad a 2-1 series clinching victory -- the Bruins were forced to think about what lay ahead vs. the Florida Panthers while still celebrating the moment at hand.\n\nCaptain Brad Marchand knows and acknowledges this as well as anyone in the NHL. Saturday's contest was his 12th Game 7, and dating back to his rookie season in 2010-11 he's experienced both the ebullience of winning and moving on, and the disenchantment of an abrupt ending to a season.\n\nThe short rest and quick refocusing that a Game 7 victory and subsequent new playoff foe brings, he said, is a minor inconvenience and nothing more.\n\n\"The toughest part about this game and the transition between this game and the next series is we're obviously riding a big high, but we have to completely forget about it,\" he said. \"But that's the great thing about the playoffs; we earned another four games.\n\n\"Now we have to completely flip the script and get prepared again. All the best teams come this time of year are able to forget that game (7) the next day ... it's about the next one.\"\n\nGames 1 and 2 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Panthers will be played at Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise Monday and Wednesday. It returns to TD Garden for Games 3 and 4 Friday and Sunday.\n\nFlorida is rested and has been waiting for its second round opponent since dispatching their in-state rivals from Tampa Bay in five games. The Bruins will be playing for the eighth time in 17 days when the puck drops Monday night.\n\nNow with some momentum, Marchand said the Bruins want to get back to playing quickly as opposed to practicing for several days in the lead-up to another series. They're feeling good about their game, he noted, making jumping back into the playoff fray actually advantageous.\n\n\"Give yourselves another chance, an opportunity to move forward and play another incredible team,\" Marchand said. \"Watch the first round and (Florida) absolutely dominated. They're a very, very difficult matchup. So another opportunity to be excited about it and the great challenge ahead of us.\"\n\nThe Panthers are not the cursed Maple Leafs. They are deeper, tougher and built for a long postseason run. They leaped over a Boston team that looked like they eased up in its last two regular season games (wanting to play Toronto in the first round instead of Tampa Bay), and now have the home ice advantage and the all-important last change in four of a potential seven games.\n\nAnd of course, they rallied from a 3-to-1 deficit a year ago as the No. 8 seed to stun top seeded Boston in the first round en route to a berth in the Cup Final.\n\nThe Bruins will be a decided underdog. They'll need Jeremy Swayman (\"by far our best player in the (Toronto) series,\" head coach Jim Montgomery acknowledged) to remain at the same level that saw him finish with a 1.49 goals against average and .950 save percentage against the Leafs. They need superstars like Charlie McAvoy (another tough game Saturday), Pastrnak and Marchand to step up their games. They need the bottom two lines to continue to play as well as they did in Game 7, and the defense to pack it in in front of Swayman and limit Grade-A chances from Florida's marksmen.\n\nPastrnak admitted in the postgame press conference that along with the elation of scoring his game-winner Saturday, there was also a measure of \"relief\" of finally putting away the pesky-but-star-crossed Torontonians and advancing. Not said -- but it was certainly understood -- was the fact that Boston avoided the ignominy of being the first professional team in the Big 4 sports to blow 3-1 series leads in consecutive years.\n\nThe Bruins have advanced. A superior opponent awaits.\n\nCan they step up to the bigger challenge?\n\nPhil Stacey, the Executive Sports Editor at The Salem News, covers the Boston Bruins for CNHI Sports Boston.

In the final game, Toronto got out to a 1-0 lead in the third period, but less than two minutes later, Boston tied the game.\n\nThe Bruins ended up scoring in overtime to advance to the second round to play the Florida Panthers. Although Florida didn't have much time to prepare for who they would play in the second round, Tkachuk says he and the team knew the Maple Leafs would lose.\n\n\"I was just happy it went to Game 7, to be honest, have them play another game. At that point, it was late, I just wanted to go to bed, but I wanted to see who won. But, I think, without this coming out too badly, I think we all knew it was probably going to be Boston the way that series was going. I'm sure a lot of expected at the beginning of the series, but in playoffs, you never know. I think throughout the whole series we were probably expecting they were going to come out and win it one way or another,\" Tkachuk told the media on May 5.\n\nIt was a subtle jab from Tkachuk given that the Maple Leafs have been known to disappoint in the playoffs, which happened once again.\n\nWith the Bruins defeating the Maple Leafs in Game 7, Boston will now play Florida in the second round of the playoffs.\n\nFlorida stunned Boston in Game 7 of the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs last season, so there is history going into this series. With that, Tkachuk is expecting a great series for the fans.\n\n\"I'm expecting a very good series,\" Tkachuk said, via NHL.com. \"They're such an unbelievable team in every aspect of the game. They touch everything. They're really good at special teams. Their 5-on-5 is great. Their goaltending is amazing. Their team defense is really good. They've got some star players. I think it's a lot like our team, so it should be a great series.\"\n\nAfter being upset last year in the playoffs, Boston won all four games against Florida in the regular season, with two coming in overtime.\n\n\"We know that this is a very similar team to last year,\" Tkachuk said. \"A couple different pieces, but I think last year there was a lot of high-scoring games. We're probably expecting it be a little bit on the lower-scoring side just by judging how both teams like to play and like to have success.

The Atlantic Division matchup between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins went the distance after Toronto dug out of a 3-1 hole and forced a Game 7.\n\nDespite having all the momentum and getting superstar Auston Matthews back for the final game, the Leafs let another third-period lead slip away against the Bruins and David Pastrnak sent them packing in overtime. Toronto's never-say-die attitude had many speculating they might finally exorcise their demons.\n\nTkachuk, who has had plenty of time on his couch to think about how he would rile up Leafs fans, says he knew history would repeat itself and the Bruins would be making their way to Sunrise, Florida.\n\n\"I think, without this coming out too badly, I think we all knew it was probably going to be Boston the way that series was going,\" Tkachuk said Sunday. \"I'm sure a lot of people expected that at the beginning of the series.\"\n\nAfter Boston took a 3-1 series lead, many had already moved on to talking about Toronto's offseason with no regard to a potential comeback. So Tkachuk was not alone.\n\nBoston has won every playoff series against the Leafs over the last 65 years and Toronto has been unable to escape the first round in seven of their last eight seasons. Toronto, one of the league's Original Six franchises, has also not won a Stanley Cup since 1967.\n\n\"With the playoffs, you never know, but I think throughout the whole series we were probably expecting [Boston] were going to come out with that one way or another,\" Tkachuk said.\n\nTkachuk has a history of kicking Toronto when they're down. After wiping out the Leafs in just five games in last year's second round, Tkachuk made sure to acknowlege Leafs fans who had chanted \"We want Florida\" after winning their first playoff series since 2004.\n\n\"I don't think they want Florida that much anymore,\" Tkachuk said then. \"I wasn't hearing many of those [chants] after that game and that may be the best part.\"\n\nThe Panthers had beaten the Bruins in a historic seven-game upset series before downing the Leafs last year. Boston was the Presidents' Trophy winner as the NHL's best regular season team with a record-setting 135 points before being ousted.\n\nTkachuk credits that series victory with creating the playoff beast that is now his Florida team.\n\n\"I just think that it showed that we could beat anybody and it gave us a lot of confidence no matter who we played or what building we were in,\" Tkachuk said. \"It brought us super close together. The effects of that series are still being shown now. It's a great challenge for both teams. We've had a week off, they've been playing. It's up to us to get up to speed fast tomorrow and try to get in the game early.\"\n\nPerhaps using some of that playoff disappointment as fuel, the Bruins swept the regular season series against the Panthers this year. All of the games were very close though with two going to overtime and the goal differential only being 13-8 in favor of Boston.\n\nThe best-of-seven second-round series between the two Atlantic Divison foes will kick off Monday night at Florida's Amerant Bank Arena.

Michael Dwyer/Associated Press\n\nBOSTON -- Boston Bruins Coach Jim Montgomery wanted to do something different with his team heading into a first-round Game 7 matchup against the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nGAME 1\n\nWHO: Boston Bruins at Florida Panthers\n\nWHEN: 8 p.m. Monday\n\nTELEVISION: ESPN\n\nThe Bruins were facing the prospect of blowing 3-1 leads in the opening round in back-to-back seasons, and a sense of impending doom hung over the team.\n\nMontgomery hoped a little change of scenery might do the trick. So instead of sleeping in their own beads ahead of the winner-take-all game Saturday night, the Bruins stayed at a hotel and took buses to TD Garden.\n\n\"The thinking was, we're 2-5 at home the last two years in the playoffs, and what's going to allow us to eliminate the noise?\" Montgomery said.\n\nHe thought back to a visit he made to the New England Patriots' spring minicamp last year. There, he spoke with former coach Bill Belichick about the importance of limiting distractions.\n\n\"It's something that stuck with me. And it's something that I've been preaching as the playoffs have been nearing,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt just may have saved Boston's season.\n\nThe Bruins overcame a deficit to tie Game 7 in the third period, then David Pastrnak scored 1:54 into overtime as the Bruins beat the Maple Leafs, 2-1.\n\nIt was the kind of total team performance Montgomery was aiming for since his team took a 3-1 series lead.\n\nIt was also a slump-busting night for Pastrnak, who had a team-high four shots on goal after posting just two goals and two assists through six games. His puck handling was integral to jump-starting Boston's offense in the third period and in overtime.\n\n\"A little relief as well,\" Pastrnak said. \"Obviously, the happiness from the group and sticking together the whole series was unbelievable, and we couldn't be prouder of ourselves.\"\n\nBoston moves into the next round with netminder Jeremy Swayman playing at his highest level of the season. He didn't allow more than two goals in any game, posting a 1.49 goals-against average.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He was our best player in the series, and it's not close,\" Montgomery said.\n\nSwayman's excellence helped Boston narrowly avoid becoming the first NHL, NBA or Major League Baseball team to lose consecutive best-of-seven series after holding a 3-1 lead.\n\nMontgomery said it is an experience he thinks will help the Bruins going forward.\n\n\"I think we're a better team because of what we just went through. Now they know what it takes to push through,\" he said. \"First round's the wild, wild west. It usually is. This year, it seems like there's only two Game 7s. But usually there's six.\"\n\nNext up is another chance at redemption against a Florida Panthers team that rallied from 3-1 down in last year's first round to send home a Bruins team that set league records for wins and points in the regular season. The second-round series starts Monday night in Sunrise, Fla.\n\n\"That's playoff hockey,\" Montgomery said. \"Last year had no bearing on how this was going to bear out. We knew that. It's a storyline, and that's part of what comes with playoffs. That's going to happen. But at the end of the day, we did a great job staying in moment, believing in our group. And we came out on top.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

They took a 3-1 series lead over Toronto, saw the Leafs tie the series, then Saturday defeated the Leafs, 2-1, in overtime.\n\nA disaster was averted. And now the Bruins go to the second round to face the Panthers, and Boston coach Jim Montgomery believes the Bruins are better for this particular first-round scare.\n\n\"We're a better team because of what we just went through,\" said Montgomery after Saturday's victory. \"Now they know what it takes to push through. First round's the wild, wild west. It usually is.\"\n\nMontgomery and the Bruins know last year's shocking loss will be talked about often during this year's series. But Montgomery insists the Bruins will stay in the present, just as they did against Toronto.\n\n\"That's playoff hockey,\" Montgomery said. \"Last year had no bearing on how this was going to bear out. We knew that. It's a story line, and that's part of what comes with playoffs. That's going to happen. But at the end of the day, we did a great job staying in moment, believing in our group and we came out on top.\"\n\nHere is The Detroit News' look at the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs:\n\nEditor's note: The Central Division semifinal series between Dallas and Vegas ended Sunday after our print deadline. The winner plays Colorado, with the preview appearing as an online update to this story Monday.\n\n\u25b6 First round: Florida d. Tampa Bay in five games. Boston d. Toronto in seven games.\n\n\u25b6 Regular-season series: Florida 0-2-2, Boston 4-0-0\n\n\u25b6 Story lines: This is a repeat of last year's first-round series in which Florida pulled off a massive upset of the Bruins, who had a record-setting regular season. ... The Bruins nearly suffered a similar fate this year, taking a 3-1 series lead before pulling out a Game 7 overtime victory over Toronto. ... Bruins G Jeremy Swayman (4-2, 1.49 GAA, .950 SVS) has taken over the starting position. ... The Panthers eliminated Tampa behind a balanced offensive attack led by C Carter Verhaeghe (five goals, nine points) and LW Matthew Tkachuk (six assists, nine points). ... The Bruins swept the season series, with two of the games going into overtime.\n\n\u25b6 Key player: Boston D Charlie McAvoy. The rugged defenseman was outstanding in Round 1, playing forceful hockey at both ends of the rink. McAvoy will face an even deeper forward lineup in the Panthers.\n\n\u25b6 Prediction: Florida in seven.\n\nNEW YORK RANGERS (METROPOLITAN 1) VS. CAROLINA (METROPOLITAN 2)\n\n\u25b6 Records: N.Y. Rangers 55-23-4 (114 points); Carolina 52-23-7 (111 points)\n\n\u25b6 First round: N.Y. Rangers d. Washington in four games. Carolina d. N.Y. Islanders in five games.\n\n\u25b6 Regular-season series: N.Y. Rangers 2-1-0, Carolina 1-2-0.\n\n\u25b6 Story lines: Carolina's depth showed in the first round over the Islanders, as 12 different Hurricanes scored in the series. ... Then again, 10 different Rangers scored in the sweep over Washington. ... Carolina LW Jake Guentzel and C Evgeny Kuznetsov, both acquired at the trade deadline, had four points in the first-round series win paying important dividends. ... Rangers coach Peter Laviolette coached Carolina to the 2006 Stanley Cup championship when current Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour was captain. ... The Rangers defeated Carolina in seven games in the 2022 division final. ... Carolina is attempting to reach the Eastern Finals for the third time since 2019.\n\n\u25b6 Key player: Carolina LW Andrei Svechnikov. The Hurricanes didn't have Svechnikov last season (knee surgery), but one goal and four assists in the first round showed the type of offensive spark he can provide.\n\n\u25b6 Story lines: The Canucks swept the season series, winning by a combined score of 21-7, but three games were early in the season when Edmonton was struggling. ... Edmonton was 9-for-20 (45%) on the power play in Round 1. ... Vancouver G Arturs Silovs won two games, and G Thatcher Demko and Casey DeSmith each had one win in the first round. ... Which goaltender will Vancouver go with in Round 2, as Demko and DeSmith are recovering from injuries?\n\n\u25b6 Key player: Edmonton G Stuart Skinner. Skinner was great against Los Angeles, with a 2.59 goals-against average and .910 save percentage. Skinner struggled in last year's playoffs (3.68 GAA, .883 SVS), but has looked like a poised, confident goalie this season.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Although Montgomery left the door open for Linus Ullmark to play in the series, it appears Swayman will start Game 1 after he did not allow more than two goals in any of the six games he played in the first round and was 4-2 with a 1.49 goals-against average and .950 save percentage.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can see confidence that he has and that only gives us confidence as well just to play in front of him,\u00e2\u20ac Bruins center Charlie Coyle said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac| This is a team that likes to get to the net and find their way, so we want to make sure we limit them, their chances, be tough on them, box out, all that good type of stuff, the details, and let \u00e2\u20ac~Sway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 see the puck a little more. But we know he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always there and he gives us so much confidence to play in front of him.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nBobrovsky was 4-1 with a 2.78 GAA and .896 save percentage in the first round after being voted a finalist for the Vezina Trophy as the NHL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top goalie for the third time (won in 2012-13 and 2016-17). He was 36-17-4 with a 2.37 GAA, .915 save percentage and tied for the NHL lead with six shutouts in 58 regular-season games.\n\nFlorida hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t played in a week since advancing with a 6-1 win against Tampa Bay in Game 5 of the first round on April 29. So, the Panthers will be well rested but might be rusty and not at the same level emotionally as the Bruins.\n\nBoston will jump into this series riding a wave of emotion after its overtime win in Game 7 on Saturday, but could be worn down physically after a long, grueling series against Toronto.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a rhythm advantage,\u00e2\u20ac Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obviously, they just came off their own high. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been on both sides of that. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come off Game 7s and lost Game 1 and come off Game 7 and won Game 1. So, we have our advantage. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fairly rested. All of the small bumps and bruises that we had are gone. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back after the first period tomorrow for both teams.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nFor different reasons, neither team is as strong down the middle as it was in the playoffs last season. Whichever manages it better could have an edge.\n\nThe Panthers will play at least Game 1 without Sam Bennett, who has been sidelined since Game 2 against the Lightning because of an apparent hand injury, but he could return later in the series. In Bennett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absence, Anton Lundell has moved up from the third line to take Bennett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place as Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-line center. Lundell had a solid first round with four assists in five games and will need to continue to produce.\n\nCoyle and Pavel Zacha did an admirable job filling the Bruins top two center spots this season after the retirements of Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci. But Coyle (two assists) and Zacha (two assists) each struggled in the first round, and Zacha was shifted to left wing in Game 7 with Morgan Geekie replacing him at center on the line with David Pastrnak. Third-line center Trent Frederic was one of Boston\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best players against Toronto with three goals in the series.\n\nJames van Riemsdyk -- Trent Frederic -- Justin Brazeau\n\nScratched: Jesper Boqvist, Derek Forbort, Matt Grzelcyk, Jakub Lauko, Michael DiPietro\n\nInjured: Andrew Peeke (upper body), Danton Heinen (undisclosed)\n\nCarter Verhaeghe -- Aleksander Barkov -- Matthew Tkachuk\n\nEetu Luostarinen -- Anton Lundell -- Sam Reinhart\n\nVladimir Tarasenko -- Kevin Stenlund -- Evan Rodrigues\n\nScratched: Ryan Lomberg, Tobias Bjornfot, Uvis Balinskis, Josh Mahura, Jonah Gadjovich, Spencer Knight, Rasmus Asplund, Mike Benning, Magnus Hellberg, Matt Kiersted, Will Lockwood, Mackie Samoskevich, Justin Sourdif\n\nInjured: Sam Bennett (upper body)\n\nCarlo missed the Bruins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 morning skate for the birth of his son, but coach Jim Montgomery said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very hopeful\u00e2\u20ac Carlo will arrive in time to play. If he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, it appears Forbort will take his place. \u00e2\u20ac| It appears Brown, who was called up from Providence of the American Hockey League on Sunday, will take Boqvist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place as the fourth-line center. \u00e2\u20ac| Heinen, a center, and Peeke, a defenseman, skated again Monday; Montgomery said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting closer\u00e2\u20ac but will remain out for Game 1. \u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac| Florida coach Paul Maurice ruled out Bennett, a center, for Game 1; he is day to day with an apparent hand injury sustained in Game 2 against the Tampa Bay Lightning. \u00e2\u20ac| Lomberg, a forward, has been out since Game 1 of the first round due to an illness. He has been practicing since Game 4 but will not play Monday.", "source": {"uri": "nhl.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NHL.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They saw the crowds pick up during last season's run to the Stanley Cup Finals and have seen little drop-off so far this season.\n\nThe latest data point: The Panthers led all NHL teams in average attendance during Round 1 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, averaging 19,530 fans for their three home games against the Tampa Bay Lightning at Amerant Bank Arena. The listed capacity for the Sunrise arena is 19,250.\n\nFlorida will host at least two games in Round 2 as well against the Boston Bruins -- Game 1 on Monday and Game 2 on Wednesday. If the series gets extended, Florida would also host Games 5 and 7 of the best-of-7 series.\n\n\"It's called home-ice advantage for a reason,\" forward Evan Rodrigues said. \"They were loud. They were into it from Game 1. It gives you a boost, especially when maybe you have a lull in the game and the crowd gets up and roaring, it gives you that little extra energy to have a good next shift. Usually, all it takes is one shift to turn the tide of the game.\"\n\nThe full crowds isn't anything new for Florida this season. The Panthers averaged 18,632 fans per home game during the regular season, with 16 of their 41 home games being classified as sellouts.\n\n\"It's been huge with our attendance and how loud our arena gets,\" defenseman Brandon Montour said. \"The success that we have as a team playing at home is huge. We're hoping to get off to a good start in these two games.\"\n\nSam Bennett 'not far off'\n\nThe Panthers will once again be without second-line center Sam Bennett, who hasn't played since sustaining a hand/wrist injury in Game 2 against the Lightning, for the series opener against the Bruins on Monday.\n\nBut coach Paul Maurice said Bennett is \"not far off\" from returning. He has skated each of the past three days on his own.\n\nOutside of Bennett's absence, the Panthers are at full strength for the Bruins series.\n\nQuote of the day\n\n\"Both teams have some things that can be really good for them coming in. They're in a rhythm, coming off a real big high. We've had some -- rest isn't the right word, it's recovery. You have two days off at home, you're rested. But now, the bruises are gone and we feel pretty strong. We know we're going to have to be ready for the first 10 [minutes], but I think only as ready as the next 10. The next 10 will be very close, really hard, hotly contested, but I think it'll be very physical, very fast. But I also think what might be different is it will also be very disciplined. Maybe last year, each team was trying to mark their territory and not every check got finished. That Game 1 was as heavy of a game as I can remember and both teams know they can't do that now. This game is heavy. It's hard. But I think the difference is it will look a lot more disciplined.\" - Maurice on his expectations for Game 1 against the Bruins.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_mcpherson@miamiherald.com", "name": "Jordan McPherson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Rodrigues", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evan Rodrigues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bennett_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bennett (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/wd10wt/picture288132805/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/PANTHERS%20VS%20LIGHTNING%20GAME%205%20AS%20068.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541234", "eventUri": "eng-9541234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Or even more to the point, are B's fans having nightmarish thoughts that like last year, when the locals lost the possible Game 5 clincher against the Florida Panthers, and they also lost that game in overtime, on home ice - just like they did this past Tuesday night versus Toronto. The overtime winning goal came at 2:26, off the stick of Toronto rookie Matthew Knies. In either case, the Bruins in Game 5 delivered a disaster of a game that if not for the stellar play of Jeremy Swayman (31 saves), would have been lost in the first period when the Leafs managed to outshoot Boston 12-2. The Bruins were unable to get much past Toronto's goaltender Joseph Woll (27 saves), the former Boston College product, who stopped everything coming his way, with the single exception being Trent Frederic's goalmouth scramble that tied the game 1-1 in the first. Periods two and three were a scoreless, dead heat standoff, during which the visitors still managed to dominate the game.\n\nIn the post-game conference, coach Jim Montgomery was dead on with his summation: \"We weren't good enough, just as simple as that, and Toronto came out ready to play. They took it to us and we weren't ready to match their desperation.\" Despite the Leafs having to play without their sniper Auston Matthews, they managed to persevere by controlling much of the pace of the game. Boston continued to appear disjointed in much of their play, including their power play chances. There is an obvious need for Boston to instill the urgency of play that was so lacking in Game 5. Captain Brad Marchand didn't mince words following the game, commenting: \"We needed to be better than we were, they were prepared to play and start the game, and we weren't. Unfortunately we never really got it together, we needed better urgency. We knew they were going to come and compete hard, it is what it is, you can't dwell on it.\"\n\nCoach Montgomery should have to give little thought to his Game 6 starter, as Swayman is an easy choice with his steady, solid play. Swayman expressed his confidence, noting, \"We saw an opportunity that we missed and we're not going to let that happen again. So the motivation is completely internal, and it's contagious in this locker room, and we'll be a different team on Thursday. We all know what's coming, and I can be more excited.\" Look for the possible reshuffling of the Bruins' lineup, with one of them maybe being the return of Kevin Shattenkirk on defense, and Johnny Beecher up front. The bottom line is a win in Thursday night's Game 6 in Toronto tonight (Thursday 8:00pm) could end this nightmare, and punch the Bruins' ticket to the second round, where they will have a chance to gain some revenge over the same Florida Panthers who took them to the cleaners in last season's first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs in seven games. A loss in Toronto on Thursday, and it's back to Boston for Saturday night's Game 7, in which anything can happen...and it's not always good for the locals!", "source": {"uri": "chelsearecord.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chelsea Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_morello@chelsearecord.com", "name": "Bob Morello", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Knies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Knies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Woll", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Woll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Shattenkirk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Shattenkirk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541234", "eventUri": "eng-9541234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

So instead of sleeping in their own beads ahead of the winner-take-all game Saturday night, they stayed at a hotel and took buses to TD Garden.\n\n\"The thinking was, we're 2-5 at home the last two years in the playoffs, and what's going to allow us to eliminate the noise?\" Montgomery said.\n\nHe thought back to a visit he made to the New England Patriots' spring minicamp last year. There he spoke with former coach Bill Belichick about the importance of limiting distractions.\n\n\"It's something that stuck with me. And it's something that I've been preaching as the playoffs have been nearing,\" he said.\n\nIt just may have saved Boston's season.\n\nThe Bruins overcame a deficit to tie it in regulation, then David Pastrnak scored 1:54 into overtime and the Bruins beat the Maple Leafs 2-1.\n\nIt was the kind of total team performance Montgomery was aiming for since taking a 3-1 lead on Toronto.\n\nIt was also a slump-busing night for Pastrnak, who had a team-high four shots on goal after posting just two goals and two assists through six games. His puck handling was integral to jumpstarting Boston's offense in the third period and in overtime.\n\n\"A little relief as well,\" Pastrnak said. \"Obviously, the happiness from the group and sticking together the whole series was unbelievable and we couldn't be prouder of ourselves.\"\n\nBoston moves into the next round with netminder Jeremy Swayman playing at nearly his highest level of the season. Since Montgomery stopped alternating Linus Ullmark and Swayman in Game 3, Swayman hasn't allowed more than two goals in a game.\n\n\"He was our best player in the series and it's not close,\" Montgomery said.\n\nIt helped them narrowly avoid becoming the first NHL, NBA or Major League Baseball team to lose consecutive best-of-seven series after holding a 3-1 lead.\n\nMontgomery said it is an experience he thinks will help them going forward.\n\n\"I think we're a better team because of what we just went through. Now they know what it takes to push through,\" he said. \"First round's the wild, wild west. It usually is. This year it seems like there's only two Game 7s. But usually there's six.\"\n\nAnd next up is another chance at redemption against a Florida Panthers team that rallied from 3-1 in last year's first round to send home a Bruins team that set league records for wins and points in the regular season.\n\n\"That's playoff hockey,\" Montgomery said. \"Last year had no bearing on how this was going to bear out. We knew that. It's a storyline, and that's part of what comes with playoffs. That's going to happen. But at the end of the day, we did a great job staying in moment, believing in our group. And we came out on top.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Boston also made a roster move on its travel day, recalling forward Patrick Brown on an emergency basis.\n\nBrown played 11 games with the Bruins in the regular season, logging no goals and one assist with a plus/minus of -3. The 31-year-old, who played 42 games with Boston's AHL affiliate this season, hasn't played at the NHL level since Jan. 27. The Michigan native has a fair share of experience at hockey's top flight, though, appearing in 149 games dating back to the 2014-15 season with 22 postseason appearances.\n\nIt's unclear what exactly prompted general manager Don Sweeney to recall Brown. The only known forward injury situation the Bruins are currently dealing with is that of Danton Heinen, who missed Games 6 and 7 in Round 1 due to an undisclosed ailment. Sweeney on Sunday told reporters he expects Heinen to return to the lineup \"at some point\" in the series against the Panthers, per Boston.com's Conor Ryan.\n\nThe Bruins and the reigning Eastern Conference champions will meet for Game 1 of their best-of-seven set Monday night at Amerant Bank Arena.

Only fourth-liners Jesper Boqvist (8:32) and Pat Maroon (8:30) logged less.\n\nBut in the wake of Boston's triumph, Brad Marchand credited the 35-year-old for his role in shelping punch the Bruins' ticket to the second round of the playoffs.\n\nIt was Shattenkirk's address to the team on Friday that the Bruins captain said mattered more than anything that can be gleaned from Saturday's stat sheet.\n\n\"Shatty gave the group an incredible speech,\" Marchand noted after Boston's 2-1 OT win over Toronto. \"That really allowed us to kind of settle down and understand where we were at and how we had to play and what we needed to believe to get the job done.\"\n\nShattenkirk, who hoisted the Stanley Cup with the Lightning in 2020, checked off plenty of boxes for general manager Don Sweeney as a free agent target last summer.\n\nBeyond adding playmaking to Boston's third pairing, Shattenkirk's mettle and calming presence were needed on a roster that lost established voices in Patrice Bergeron, David Krejci, Nick Foligno, and more.\n\nWith the Bruins repeating last year's script by relinquishing a 3-1 series lead, Shattenkirk's impromptu speech served as a steadying force before their grasp on the series slipped away.\n\n\"At some point in time, you never know when you're going to lean on [Shattenkirk's veteran leadership],\" Sweeney said Sunday. \"But obviously it was a crucial moment.\n\n\"He felt very comfortable standing up in front of that group to deliver that message and obviously it resonated for Brad to bring it up and disclose it. Good on him. It's exactly what you hope for when you bring in players that have won, and that are craving to get back in that environment.\"\n\nShattenkirk is far from the only established veteran Sweeney added amid a cap crunch -- with Boston signing James van Riemsdyk in free agency and acquiring three-time Cup champion Maroon at the trade deadline.\n\nMaroon is no stranger to the peaks and valleys of a long playoff push. But even with his name etched on the Cup multiple times, Maroon acknowledged that Shattenkirk's message resonated with him.\n\nAnd with a second-round matchup against the Panthers looming, the Bruins will need to rely on their veterans if they hope to exact revenge against Florida.\n\n\"It's an opportunity. You don't know when these opportunities are going to come again,\" Maroon said. \"And that's the message that basically goes back to Shatty. You don't want any regrets when you go and you're watching TV and you're retired and you're looking back -- and you're like, 'Man, I wish I had one more Game 7.'\n\n\"And I think this is the beauty of us playing the sport. This is why we play the game -- to win as many Stanley Cups as you can, right?\"\n\nThe Bruins don't need to start from scratch crafting a game plan for the Panthers. In Florida's first-round series win over Tampa Bay, the Panthers used 13 players who suited up in their playoff victory over the Bruins last spring.\n\n\"Very similar team. Their depth is there,\" Sweeney said. \"They play the right way, they don't give up a lot of scoring chances. The series should be tight. Power play is good. [Goalie Sergei] Bobrovsky has played well. (Goalie Anthony) Stolarz has played well.\n\n\"It's a hell of an opponent. I think we know each other pretty well -- where our strengths are. It's just going to come down to winning the small areas of the game that generally translate throughout a series and hopefully we find a way to persevere this year.\"\n\nA heavy, punishing forecheck led by Matthew Tkachuk and Sam Bennett has been a hallmark for Florida the past two seasons. But Maroon focused on Florida's defensive fortitude -- especially with Boston only averaging 2.57 goals per game against Toronto.\n\n\"They've gotten a lot better over the years,\" Maroon said. \"They play stingy hockey, they play simple, hard, heavy hockey. They don't really get out of their structure. It's going to be a good test.\"\n\nThe Maple Leafs were a fortuitous bounce away from beating Boston. But Tkachuk wasn't anticipating a rematch with Toronto. \"Without this coming out too badly, I think we all knew it was going to be Boston the way that series was going,\" Tkachuk said Sunday ... Panthers coach Paul Maurice confirmed Bennett will not play Game 1 on Monday but is \"day to day.\" The physical center hasn't played since Game 2 vs. Tampa Bay after a shot from teammate Brandon Montour struck his hand ... Sweeney had good news regarding banged-up Bruins Andrew Peeke and Danton Heinen. \"I expect everybody at some point in time to be available in this series,\" Sweeney noted ... Sweeney was noncommittal about Boston's approach to its goalie rotation. \"We'll monitor where Jeremy [Swayman] is this morning coming off an amazing high.

Boston and Toronto ultimately settled things in a win-or-go-home Game 7, which David Pastrnak and company claimed in overtime at TD Garden.\n\nThe Original Six clubs going the distance suggests they were evenly matched. Tkachuk, however, seemingly didn't give the Leafs much of a chance against the Black and Gold.\n\n\"I think that -- without this coming out too badly, I think we all knew it was probably going to be Boston the way that series was going,\" Tkachuk told reporters Sunday, as seen in a Bleacher Report video. \"I'm sure a lot of people expected that at the beginning of the series. Playoffs, I guess, you never know. But I think throughout the whole series we were probably expecting they were gonna come out and win that one way or the other.\"\n\nTkachuk's remarks are up for interpretation. The Panthers star has no problem being an agitator, so he very well might have rubbed salt in the Maple Leafs' wound.

Boston saved its season Saturday night with a dramatic overtime win over the Toronto Maple Leafs in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup playoffs first-round series. David Pastrnak's game-winning goal secured a date with the Florida Panthers, a series the B's will open Monday night in the Sunshine State. Before making that trek, though, the B's had themselves quite the Saturday night celebrating themselves after dispatching the Leafs.\n\nLuckily for Bruins fans, a lot of that jubilation was caught on film with what should be a terrific \"Behind the B\" episode coming up soon. The Bruins' cameras were rolling with a mic'd-up Brad Marchand all night, and the B's released a 4-minute video with all of the highlights from the postgame bash. If you're a fan of the Black and Gold, it's must-watch stuff.\n\nThere's so much to sink your teeth into from that video, starting with Marchand in the handshake line. We're given a front-row seat to his message for fierce series adversaries like Tyler Bertuzzi and Max Domi, the latter for whom Marchand expresses the utmost respect. We also get Jake McCabe telling Marchand to go beat Florida, something neither the Bruins nor the Leafs could do in respective series last spring.\n\nFrom there, the locker room celebration is what you'd expect, and the cameos from Bruins legends like Patrice Bergeron and Tuukka Rask bring it all together.\n\nThe party was an abbreviated one, though.

The veteran forward shook hands with the trio, as well as the rest of Toronto's team, Saturday night after the Bruins defeated the Leafs in Game 7 at TD Garden.\n\nA three-time Stanley Cup champion, Maroon knows full well how difficult it is to win a postseason series, let alone the whole thing. The 36-year-old couldn't help but admire the fight Toronto showed after Boston jumped out to a 3-1 series lead.\n\n\"Just telling the guys, 'Good job. You guys played a really good series,'\" Maroon told reporters Saturday, per The Athletic. \"It wasn't one person. But just letting them know they're a heck of a team. They fought hard until the end. They had some missing key pieces in certain games. They played very well without them in the lineup. They played well with them in the lineup. They did a good job fighting back.

FanDuel  | TSN", "body": "Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end.\n\nFor the Toronto Maple Leafs and their fans, it's time to embrace the inevitable change that is coming.\n\nAfter rallying from down 3-1 to force a Game 7 against the Boston Bruins, Toronto ultimately fell short with a loss in the winner-take-all series finale on Saturday night.\n\nAs a close friend put it, \"I'd rather them lose in five.\"\n\nWhile Leafs Nation speculates about what's next for the organization, the rival Bruins are in Sunrise for Game 1 of their second-round playoff series against the Florida Panthers tonight.\n\nBoston was -120 to win its first round series versus Toronto at FanDuel.\n\nThe Bruins are a +146 series underdog against the Panthers in the second round.\n\nFlorida is a -176 favourite to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nAfter going 6-for-6 with my series winner predictions in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, I've already locked in my favourite futures bet for the second round.\n\nPlus, I'm on a 7-2 run with the daily FanDuel Best Bets in this column over the past two weeks.\n\nHopefully, we can begin this week with another winner for tonight's game.\n\nThis is the Morning Coffee for Monday, May 6th, 2024.\n\nA Futures Bet To Consider For Round 2 Of the Stanley Cup Playoffs\n\nThe Carolina Hurricanes, Florida Panthers, New York Rangers, Edmonton Oilers, and Dallas Stars all delivered for me in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nA five-leg parlay with each of those teams to advance paid +566 at FanDuel.\n\nI also recommended a play on the Rangers to beat the Washington Capitals in six games or fewer at -160 odds as my favourite futures bet of the first round.\n\nPlus, I parlayed the Rangers with the Denver Nuggets to advance at -180 odds.\n\nIt didn't take long for me to lock in my favourite futures bet for the second round at FanDuel on Saturday night.\n\nThe Panthers opened -164 to win their series against the Bruins.\n\nThat number has already moved to Florida -184.\n\nThe Panthers to win the series in six games or fewer is down from +122 to +116 at FanDuel.\n\nMy favourite futures bet for the second round is Florida to win the series.\n\nI also bet Florida -1.5 in the series at +122 odds.\n\nI may add another play to a short list of futures for the second round at some point before puck drop tonight.\n\nAs somebody with a ton of friends and family that are Maple Leafs fans, it was tough to see Toronto lose in the first round once again.\n\nAs somebody who thoroughly enjoyed betting on Maple Leafs props in the first round, it's too bad I couldn't get seven more games between Toronto and Boston.\n\nFortunately, we still have a lot of hockey in front of us.\n\nI've already highlighted that I love the Panthers to win their first round series at -164 odds.\n\nNow it's time for a couple of Same Game Parlays for Game 1.\n\nFirst up, I'll lock in Sam Reinhart 2+ shots on goal and the Panthers to win at -114 odds.\n\nReinhart averaged 4.6 shots on goal against the Tampa Bay Lightning in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs for a team-high 23 shots on goal in five games.\n\nHe's -148 to register 3+ shots on goal in Game 1 tonight.\n\nA Same Game Parlay with Reinhart 3+ shots on goal and the Panthers to win can be found at +153 odds.\n\nI'll stick with Reinhart 2+ shots on goal and Florida to win at -114 odds for my first FanDuel Best Bet.\n\nFor my second FanDuel Best Bet, I'll take Reinhart 3+ shots on goal parlayed with Carter Verhaeghe 2+ shots on goal at -101 odds.\n\nVerhaeghe was right behind Reinhart with 22 shots on goal in five games against the Lightning.\n\nHe's -152 to register 3+ shots on goal tonight.\n\nI'll lock in Reinhart 3+ shots on goal and Verhaeghe 2+ shots on goal at -101 odds as my FanDuel Best Bet.\n\nHopefully, we can stay hot with a pair of winners to start the week.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType":

The Leafs couldn't complete the comeback, though, as David Pastrnak's overtime goal in Game 7 on Saturday sent Boston into the second round.\n\nAs is tradition when an NHL postseason series concludes, the Original Six rivals shook hands at center ice. A clip from an upcoming episode of \"Behind The B\" revealed what Marchand said to Bertuzzi, a former Bruins teammate, and Max Domi before he celebrated in the locker room.\n\n\"Hell of a series, brother,\" Marchand told Bertuzzi. \"Way to battle, eh?\"\n\n\"Hell of a series, brother,\" Marchand told Domi. \"You're unbelievable.

Only fourth-liners Jesper Boqvist (8:32) and Pat Maroon (8:30) logged fewer reps in Game 7.\n\nBut in the wake of Boston's overtime triumph over Toronto, Brad Marchand made sure to credit the 35-year-old veteran for his essential role in helping punch the Bruins' ticket to the second round of the playoffs.\n\nFor Boston's captain, it was a team-wide address from Shattenkirk on Friday that mattered far more than anything that can be gleaned from Saturday's stat sheet.\n\n\"Shatty gave the group an incredible speech,\" Marchand noted after Boston's 2-1 win over the Leafs. \"That really allowed us to kind of settle down and understand where we were at and how we had to play and what we needed to believe to get the job done.\"\n\nShattenkirk, who hoisted a Stanley Cup with the Lightning in 2020, checked off plenty of boxes for Don Sweeney as an offseason target.\n\nBeyond his ability to add playmaking poise to Boston's third D pair, Shattenkirk's veteran mettle and calming presence were needed on a Bruins roster that lost established voices in Patrice Bergeron, David Krejci, Nick Foligno, and others last summer.\n\nWith the Bruins repeating last year's script by relinquishing a 3-1 series lead, Shattenkirk's impromptu speech served as a steadying force before Boston's grasp on the series completely slipped away.\n\n\"At some point in time, you never know when you're going to lean on it,\" Sweeney said of Shattenkirk's value as a veteran on Sunday. \"But obviously it was a crucial moment.\n\n\"He felt very comfortable standing up in front of that group to deliver that message and obviously it resonated for Brad to bring it up and disclose it. Good on him. It's exactly what you hope for when you bring in players that have won, and that are craving to get back in that environment.\"\n\nShattenkirk is far from the only established veteran that Sweeney added to this group amid a cap-crunched season -- with Boston signing James van Riemsdyk in free agency and dealing for three-time Cup champion Pat Maroon at the trade deadline.\n\nMaroon is no stranger to the peaks and valleys that present themselves over a long playoff push. But even with his name already etched into the Stanley Cup numerous times, Maroon acknowledged that Shattenkirk's message resonated with him.\n\nAnd with a second-round matchup against the Panthers looming, the Bruins will need to rely on their veterans more than ever if they hope to exact revenge against Florida.\n\n\"It's an opportunity. You don't know when these opportunities are going to come again,\" Maroon said Sunday. \"And that's the message that basically goes back to Shatty. You don't want any regrets when you go and you're watching TV and you're retired and you're looking back -- and you're like, 'Man, I wish I had one more Game 7.'\n\n\"And I think this is the beauty of us playing the sport. This is why we play the game -- to win as many Stanley Cups as you can, right?\n\nJim Montgomery and the Bruins don't need to start from scratch when it comes to crafting a game plan for the Panthers. In Florida's first-round series win over Tampa, the Panthers used 13 players who also suited up in their playoff victory over the Bruins the previous spring.\n\n\"Very similar team. Their depth is there,\" Sweeney said of the Panthers. \"They play the right way, they don't give up a lot of scoring chances. The series should be tight. Power play is good, (Sergei) Bobrovsky has played well. [Anthony] Stolarz has played well.\n\n\"It's a hell of an opponent. I think we know each other pretty well -- where our strengths are. It's just going to come down to winning the small areas of the game that generally translate throughout a series and hopefully we find a way to persevere this year.\"\n\nA heavy, punishing forecheck led by heat-seeking missiles like Matthew Tkachuk and Sam Bennett has been a hallmark for Florida over the past two seasons.But Maroon focused more on Florida's defensive fortitude as a hurdle -- especially with Boston only averaging 2.57 goals per game against Toronto.\n\n\"They've gotten a lot better over the years,\" Maroon said of Florida. \"They play stingy hockey, they play simple, hard, heavy hockey. They don't really get out of their structure.

That could make predicting second-round outcomes even more difficult.\n\nAll four division winners, and three of the second-place finishers, each advanced to the second round. The lone exception is the Colorado Avalanche, the third seed in the Central Division who knocked off the second-place Winnipeg Jets in five games.\n\nRelated: 2024 Stanley Cup Playoffs: schedule, results, TV info for each 2nd-round series\n\nSportsnaut hockey experts Jim Cerny and Ryan Gagne provide their predictions for each of the four 2nd-round series in the 2024 Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nIn the first round, Gagne held the edge, predicting six of the eight series correctly. He only missed out with the Jets and Los Angeles Kings. Cerny was 5-3, mistakenly picking the Jets, Nashville Predators and Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nNew York Rangers (M1) vs. Carolina Hurricanes (M2)\n\nJim Cerny (Managing Editor/Lead Hockey Writer): Picking a winner here is not easy. You know what's more difficult? Picking the loser of this series. That's how much respect I have for the Rangers and Hurricanes, who each have loaded lineups, highly-regarded coaches, great special teams and been at the top of their games for months. The Brett Pesce and Jesper Fast injuries dig in some to Carolina's depth, though Pesce is expected back at some point in the series. One Rangers advantage is their ability to strike quickly, perhaps, as former Rangers captain and long-time radio analyst Dave Maloney said last week, not having to work as hard to score goals. The Hurricanes advantage is the relentless pace they play at. You can't predict puck luck, officiating or injuries ahead of a series, but I do think Rangers goalie Igor Shesterkin can be the difference here. Rangers in 7\n\nRyan Gagne (Staff Writer): The top two teams in the Metropolitan Division will likely go the distance in their second-round series. Each team had relatively easy matchups to begin their quest for the Stanley Cup, but the hard work starts now. If their regular season games indicate what is to come, this series will be close every game, and whoever scores the last goal and makes the last save will win Hurricanes in 7\n\nFlorida Panthers (A1) vs. Boston Bruins (A2)\n\nGagne: The Panthers were the best team in the Atlantic Division and quickly dispatched the veteran Tampa Bay Lightning in the opening round. They now face the Bruins, whom they eliminated in Game 7 last season. Even though it appears to be a mismatch that favors the Panthers, perhaps only Jeremy Swayman can win the series for the Bruins, while the Panthers need to keep playing their game, which got them to the Stanley Cup Final in 2023. Despite the need to avenge their previous defeat, Boston poses no challenge in 2024. Panthers in 6\n\nCerny: I agree that the Panthers are the better team, not to mention more well-rested after the Bruins had to go to overtime in Game 7 to finish off the Maple Leafs. But I wouldn't go as far as to say they present no challenge in this series. True, the Bruins goaltending will need to be unreal in this series because the Panthers can beat you in so many different ways, but Florida needs to have a healthy dose of respect for Boston, too. The Sam Bennett injury is a concern for the Panthers, but not one that will alter the result here. Panthers in 6\n\nVancouver Canucks (P1) vs. Edmonton Oilers (P2)\n\nCerny: Let's start with this: the Canucks swept their season series against the Oilers, 4-0. However, three of those wins came before Kris Knoblauch stepped in as coach and the Oilers turned their season around. Edmonton had one less win and five fewer points than Vancouver and looked terrific in quickly dispatching the Kings in the first round. Connor McDavid (12 points), Leon Draisaitl (10) and Evan Bouchard (nine) were explosive in the first round and Edmonton's special teams were outstanding (45 percent on power play; 100 percent on penalty kill). The Canucks are on their third-string goalie and stud defenseman Quinn Hughes looks a bit beat up already. Oilers in 6\n\nGagne: The Oilers easily defeated the Kings, getting a free pass out of the first round. Despite their struggles against the Predators, the Canucks prevailed, thanks to a rookie goalie, and now face a more challenging opponent. Even though many don't give the Canucks much of a chance, they have the lineup and skills to shut down the Oilers offense and get enough goals past Stuart Skinner. This series winner may be a surprise considering the Oilers' fanbase believes they got another free pass to the final four -- Canucks in 7\n\nDallas Stars (C1) vs. Colorado Avalanche (C2)\n\nGagne: The Stars lived up to their billing as the best team in the Western Conference with a thrilling Game 7 victory over the defending Stanley Cup champion Vegas Golden Knights. Despite having home-ice advantage, they are about to run into the juggernaut Avalanche, who seem unstoppable. Even though many experts expect this to be the best series of the playoffs, this potential shootout will come down to goaltending, and I think that favors Colorado with Alexandar Georgiev over Dallas' Jake Oettinger. Avalanche in 6\n\nCerny: This is going to be a great series. Similar to the Rangers-Hurricanes clash, these teams might very well be the best in their conference, and some would argue, the entire League. The Avalanche bounced back from that crazy Game 1 loss to the Jets and made Vezina Trophy favorite Connor Hellebuyck look like an amateur in the process. The Avalanche exploded for 28 goals in five games. Georgiev was better after Game 1, but Oettinger is at least as good, if not better. That, coupled with a stout Stars defense, could be just enough for the Stars to win a back-and-forth series.

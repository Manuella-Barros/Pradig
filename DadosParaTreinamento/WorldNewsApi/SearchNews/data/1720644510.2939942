{"id": 231210676, "title": "I tried CosRx's luxurious budget cleanser - it smells like walking into a spa", "text": "I'll admit, I'm not the best at trying new things - I have a routine and I like to stick to it, and I've been using a lot of the same products for years. When I got the opportunity to try something from the South Korean beauty brand CosRx, their Low pH Good Morning Cleanser to be precise, I panicked. Will I have a reaction? Will it make my skin flare up? Am I going to break out? I'd heard of their famously natural products like the Power Essence Snail Serum and the Soothing Aloe Suncream and thought - surely a product designed for sensitive skin won't be so bad? So I went ahead and tried it. The product The CosrX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser is specially developed to compliment our skin's natural pH, which surprisingly, is mildly acidic. This specially balanced formula is then able to cleanse impurities without stripping away natural moisture. Infused with betaine salicylate (BHA) and tea tree oil, the cleanser is ideal for those with oily skin types, because these ingredients work to reduce the appearance of enlarged pores and reduce excess oil. CosRx say the gel cleanser is best for targeting dull, dry and uneven skin, adding that the low pH formula is ideal for sensitive users. Though it started as a small indie skincare brand, CosRx have well and truly made waves in the Western beauty world. The Good Morning Gel Cleanser is available at Boots for \u00a314.70 and whilst mini versions are available for as low as \u00a39 from Cult Beauty and ASOS. Here's where you can find the Good Morning Gel Cleanser daily face wash: Boots - Buy 150ml here for \u00a314.70 Cult Beauty - Buy 150ml here for \u00a313.99, or buy 50ml here for \u00a39 Beauty Bay - Buy 150ml here for \u00a315.95 Look Fantastic - Buy 150ml here for \u00a315.99 ASOS - Buy 150ml here for \u00a316, or buy 50ml here for \u00a39 Initial thoughts This gel cleanser is one of the best smelling face washes I've ever used. While tea tree is mentioned in the ingredients list, that's not all I can smell. The CosRx cleanser smells clean and refreshing, and the scent in my hands reminds me of walking into a spa. It's the kind of thing I'd expect to feel on my face during a facial, and it smells just as luxurious. The cleanser appears in a gel-like formula, which you can easily lather up in your hands before applying to your face. The product is light and refreshing, and it doesn't feel like you're moving around lots of thick cream on your face. The gel is lightly bubbly, but you don't get too many suds. While some people really like to see a good lather when they're washing, this doesn't bother me too much, and I enjoyed the light cleansing feeling. When I rinse my face, the gel cleanser leaves a fresh tingly sensation, which really makes my skin feel clean. After drying my face, my skin can sometimes feel a little tight - this could be due to the pore minimising effects, and I don't mind too much because the tightness fades once I apply some moisturiser. Final thoughts I really love the refreshing feel of the CosRx Low pH Good Morning Cleanser, but the scent by far is my favourite part. I can't think of another budget product that smells as professional as this, and I'm pleased with the results it gives. After using it every day (sometimes twice) for a week, I'm not sure that my pores are any smaller, but I'll definintely vouch for the fact that my skin does look brighter. The easy to use gel is a handy product to keep by the sink for every day washing, and my skin hasn't suffered from the new cleanser which I was slightly worried about. My little 50ml bottle is still going strong after consistent use, and I'm pleased I'll be able to pack the travel sized version in my hand luggage on my next holiday. After a fantastic first impression of the brand, maybe I'll consider their Aloe Soothing Suncream too. CosRx's Good Morning Cleanser has been gentle on my skin, while still leaving me squeaky clean. I didn't have a reaction, my skin didn't flare up, and I didn't break out - so it's definitely something I'd recommend to people with these concerns! Having tried and tested the cleanser, it's definitely something I'll now add to my daily skincare. Who knows? Maybe this product will stick around in my routine for years too.

Amrabat joined United on a season-long loan deal from Fiorentina and the terms included an option to make the move permanent for \u20ac25m. That looked unlikely until the Moroccan finished the campaign with a flourish, starting the final four games and playing in the FA Cup final triumph against Manchester City. The 27-year-old solidified United's midfield when he was drafted into the team and made a total of 30 appearances, 17 of them from the start.

It is understood it's likely to be finalised once a decision on whether to stick with Ten Hag has been formalised. Ineos are currently conducting an end-of-season review which will help them come to a decision on the Dutch manager. Ten Hag pushed for the signing of Amrabat last season, having worked with the midfielder for a year at FC Utrecht, and he has since joined the same agency as the United boss, the Sports Entertainment Group (SEG), who played a vital role in getting a loan deal over the line on deadline day last summer. If Ineos opt to stick with Ten Hag then he could push for that move to be made permanent, although technical director Jason Wilcox will also have a greater say in recruitment during this summer. If Ten Hag is dismissed then a final call could come down to Wilcox, with Amrabat's loan deal set to expire at the end of June. Amrabat's future might also hinge on what happens with Casemiro, who has been linked with a move to the Saudi Pro League and could be sold by United this summer. While United continue to wait on a start date for sporting director Dan Ashworth, amid a deadlock in negotiations with Newcastle for the 53-year-old, it is Wilcox and director of football negotiations Matt Hargreaves who are leading plans for the window. With a relatively small budget to play with before sales, they will factor that consideration into any decision on Amrabat. Wilcox is leading talks with goalkeeper Tom Heaton, 38, and centre-back Jonny Evans, 36, as the club weigh up whether to extend the deals of the veteran academy graduates. Both are out of contract on June 30 but discussions are ongoing about potential extensions. A new deal for Heaton could involve the guarantee of a role once his playing career is over, while a decision on the future of Evans is tied into plans for defensive reinforcements. Raphael Varane will leave the club on a free transfer this summer and Victor Lindelof could be sold. United want to sign at least one new centre-back and retain an interest in Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite, who could leave Goodison Park before June 30 in the Toffees seek to boost their PSR position with the Premier League.", "summary": "Man Utd have an option to sign Sofyan Amrabat on a permanent deal but haven't yet decided whether to trigger it.", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-stall-sofyan-amrabat-29317881", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article29317902.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2154992723.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:43:18", "author": "Tyrone Marshall", "authors": ["Tyrone Marshall"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.121}

Trump greeted the child warmly, presenting him with a signed $20 bill and posing for a photo while onlookers and security surrounded them.Trump joked with the crowd, \"I like that kid! So, if your parents don't want you, I'll take you.\" The quip drew laughter from the crowd and left the boy beaming, despite his tears.The video shared to X, formerly Twitter, by Trump's Deputy Director of Communications, Margo Martin, had nearly 570,000 views by 10 p.m. Saturday.Trump's choice of venue added an intriguing subplot to the visit. \"Tony and Nick's\" is the rebranded incarnation of the once-renowned restaurant, \"Tony Luke's,\" a name change spurred by family feuds and legal woes.The shop's owners, Anthony Lucidonio Sr. and son Nick, admitted to tax fraud in 2022, confessing to an $8 million shell game with the IRS. This backdrop lent an ironic twist to Trump's appearance, given his own much-scrutinized tax history.At the popular eatery, where Trump reportedly left a $500 tip, he touted his proposal for tax-free tips for restaurant workers. It's a pitch tailored for blue-collar neighborhoods, even in a city that typically leans heavily Democratic.Trump's Philadelphia campaign stop is part of a broader strategy of venturing into traditionally Democratic territories, with recent stops in the Bronx and Detroit. It's a high-stakes approach that signals the campaign's belief in their ability to flip disaffected Democratic voters.The centerpiece of Trump's Philly blitz was his 7 p.m. rally at Temple University. The former president delivered on his campaign's promise to skewer Biden's economic policies, wielding statistics like a purported 34% approval rating for Biden among Pennsylvanians. Newsweek has reached out to both the Biden and Trump campaign offices for comment on Saturday via email.Pennsylvania's importance in the electoral landscape can't be overstated. Trump narrowly clinched the state in 2016, only to see it slip from his grasp in 2020. With its 19 electoral votes up for grabs, Pennsylvania could once again play kingmaker in November.Earlier in the day, Trump addressed the faithful at the Faith & Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority conference in Washington D.C. The former president pledged to shield religious communities from government overreach, a thinly veiled reference to COVID-era restrictions on religious gatherings.", "summary": "The young fan wore a navy-blue suit, red tie, and blonde wig reminiscent of the former president's signature style.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-young-fan-tears-philadelphia-cheesesteak-1916192", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2415120/donald-trump.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:52:17", "author": "Adeola Adeosun", "authors": ["Adeola Adeosun"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.036}

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)\n\nMelinda French Gates says she will be donating $1 billion over the next two years to individuals and organizations working on behalf of women and families globally, including on reproductive rights in the United States.\n\nIt's the second billion-dollar commitment French Gates has personally made in the past five years. In 2019, she pledged over ten years to expand women's power and influence.\n\nEarlier this month, French Gates announced she would step down from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and vowed to focus on women and families. As a part of leaving the Gates Foundation, French Gates received $12 billion from Bill Gates for her philanthropy going forward.\n\nFrench Gates, one of the biggest philanthropic supporters of gender equity in the U.S., said Tuesday in a guest essay for The New York Times that she's been frustrated over the years by people who say it's not the right time to talk about gender equality.\n\n\"Decades of research on economics, well-being and governance make it clear that investing in women and girls benefits everyone,\" she wrote.\n\nFrench Gates said over the last few weeks she's started directing what will total $200 million in new grants through her organization, Pivotal Ventures, to groups working in the U.S. to protect women's rights and advance their power and influence. The grants are for general operating support, meaning they are not earmarked for specific projects. The groups include the National Women's Law Center, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nTeresa Younger, the president and CEO of the Ms. Foundation for Women, who also received a grant, has long called on donors to give unrestricted, multi-year funding to organizations.

She declined to disclose the amount of the grant but said it would help expand their work with organizations in the South and Midwest.\n\nThe nonprofit MomsRising Education Fund also received a grant that will extend to the end of 2026, with Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, its executive director and CEO, saying, \"We're deeply honored and enormously grateful that Melinda French Gates is stepping up for women and families in a time when the rights of our daughters may be significantly less than of ourselves or our own mothers.\"\n\nFrench Gates also pledged to give 12 individuals $20 million each to distribute to nonprofit organizations of their choice before the end of 2026. Those funds will be managed by the National Philanthropic Trust, one of the largest public charities that offers donor-advised funds, a spokesperson for Pivotal Ventures said.\n\nIn total, French Gates announced $690 million in commitments out of the promised $1 billion, which also include an \"open call\" for applications that the organization Lever for Change will administer this fall. French Gates said $250 million will be awarded to fund organizations working to improve women's mental and physical health globally.\n\nFrench Gates' Pivotal Ventures is a limited liability company that also manages investments in for profit ventures, so there is little public information about its grantmaking or the assets it manages. Pivotal Ventures has focused on a number of avenues to increase women's economic and political participation and power, like closing the wage gap, compensating care work often done by women, and encouraging women to run for political office.\n\nPivotal Ventures said it has committed $875 million of the $1 billion that French Gates pledged in 2019 to a mixture of venture and philanthropic funding. Additionally, the Gates Foundation has funded research and interventions to improve maternal mortality and women's health more broadly for years. In 2020, it hired its first president for its gender quality division and in 2021, the foundation pledged $2.1 billion to gender equity efforts convened by UN Women.\n\nIn her essay Tuesday, French Gates touched upon the high maternal mortality rates in the U.S., noting that Black and Native American mothers are at the highest risk.\n\n\"Women in 14 states have lost the right to terminate a pregnancy under almost any circumstances.

As a part of leaving the Gates Foundation, French Gates received $12 billion from Bill Gates for her philanthropy going forward.\n\nFrench Gates, one of the biggest philanthropic supporters of gender equity in the U.S., said Tuesday in a guest essay for The New York Times that she's been frustrated over the years by people who say it's not the right time to talk about gender equality.\n\n\"Decades of research on economics, well-being and governance make it clear that investing in women and girls benefits everyone,\" she wrote.\n\nFrench Gates said over the last few weeks she's started directing new grants through her organization, Pivotal Ventures, to groups working in the U.S. to protect women's rights and advance their power and influence. The grants are for general operating support, meaning they are not earmarked for specific projects. The groups include the National Women's Law Center, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nTeresa Younger, the president and CEO of the Ms. Foundation for Women, who also received a grant, has long called on donors to give unrestricted, multi-year funding to organizations. She praised French Gates' new commitment as a part of a larger trend of major women donors giving generously to nonprofits.\n\n\"If philanthropy took lessons from the way that women are moving money, we would see more money in the field having greater impact,\" Younger said.\n\nHer organization learned of the grant, which is the first they've received from Pivotal Ventures last week, and Younger said there was no application process. She declined to disclose the amount of the grant but said it would help expand their work with organizations in the South and Midwest.\n\nIn addition, she also pledged to give 12 individuals $20 million each to distribute to nonprofit organizations of their choice before the end of 2026. Those funds will be managed by the National Philanthropic Trust, one of the largest public charities that offers donor-advised funds, a spokesperson for Pivotal Ventures said.\n\nIn total, French Gates announced $690 million in commitments out of the promised $1 billion, which also include an \"open call\" for applications that the organization Lever for Change will administer this fall. French Gates said $250 million will be awarded through that process to fund organizations working to improve women's mental and physical health globally.\n\nFrench Gates' Pivotal Ventures is a limited liability company that also manages investments for profit ventures, so there is little public information about its grantmaking or the assets it manages.

French Gates said $250 million will be awarded to fund organizations working to improve women's mental and physical health globally.\n\nFrench Gates' Pivotal Ventures is a limited liability company that also manages investments in for profit ventures, so there is little public information about its grantmaking or the assets it manages. Pivotal Ventures has focused on a number of avenues to increase women's economic and political participation and power, like closing the wage gap, compensating care work often done by women, and encouraging women to run for political office.\n\nPivotal Ventures said it has committed $875 million of the $1 billion that French Gates pledged in 2019 to a mixture of venture and philanthropic funding. Additionally, the Gates Foundation has funded research and interventions to improve maternal mortality and women's health more broadly for years. In 2020, it hired its first president for its gender quality division and in 2021, the foundation pledged $2.1 billion to gender equity efforts convened by UN Women.\n\nIn her essay Tuesday, French Gates touched upon the high maternal mortality rates in the U.S., noting that Black and Native American mothers are at the highest risk.\n\n\"Women in 14 states have lost the right to terminate a pregnancy under almost any circumstances. We remain the only advanced economy without any form of national paid family leave. And the number of teenage girls experiencing suicidal thoughts and persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness is at a decade high,\" she said.\n\nFrench Gates will be leaving the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation next week. She helped co-found the organization nearly 25 years ago.\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and for news coverage of women in the workforce and state governments from Pivotal Ventures.\n\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will change its name to the Gates Foundation. It is one of the largest philanthropic organizations in the world. As of December 2023, its endowment was $75.2 billion, thanks to donations from Gates and the billionaire investor Warren Buffett. While it works across many issues, global health remains its largest area of work, and most of its funding is meant to address issues internationally rather than in the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Gates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melinda_French_Gates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Melinda French Gates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_&_Melinda_Gates_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Foundation_for_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ms. Foundation for Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Women's_Law_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Women's Law Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Reproductive_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center for Reproductive Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_workforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women in the workforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parental leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Organizations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Organizations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Philanthropy_Gates_Women_Rights_18746.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604751", "eventUri": "eng-9604751", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 239, "relevance": 1}

At the time of their separation, the two said they still shared a belief in the foundation's mission and would continue to work together despite their marriage ending.\n\n--\n\nEditors Note: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is among NPR's financial supporters.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_franklin@npr.org", "name": "Jonathan Franklin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melinda_French_Gates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melinda French Gates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Gates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_&_Melinda_Gates_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacinda_Ardern", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacinda Ardern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maternal health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Organizations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Organizations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5519x3104+0+168/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F42%2Fd8f8470844149fd4846c9675015a%2Fap23103759274416.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604751", "eventUri": "eng-9604751", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 2931, "textEnd": 2937}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

And the number of teenage girls experiencing suicidal thoughts and persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness is at a decade high,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Despite the pressing need, only about 2% of charitable giving in the United States goes to organizations focused on women and girls, and only about half a percentage point goes to organizations focused on women of color specifically,\" she added.\n\nFrench Gates noted that in her career as a women's advocate, \"I have learned that there will always be people who say it's not the right time to talk about gender equality. Not if you want to be relevant. Not if you want to be effective with world leaders (most of them men).\"\n\nShe called such a perspective \"frustrating and shortsighted,\" noting that decades of research \"make it clear that investing in women and girls benefit everyone.\"\n\n\"We know that economies with women's full participation have more room to grow,\" she explained. \"That women's political participation is associated with decreased corruption. That peace agreements are more durable when women are involved in writing them. That reducing the time women spend in poor health could add as much as $1 trillion to the global economy by 2040.\"\n\nFrench Gates has already begun directing new grants through her Pivotal Ventures organization to groups that \"protect the rights of women and advance their power and influence\" in the U.S. including the National Women's Law Center, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nIn the fall, she'll introduce a $250 million initiative focused on \"improving the mental and physical health of women and girls globally\" via an open call to grass-roots organizations.\n\nFrench Gates also recently offered 12 people -- including former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, athlete and maternal health advocate Allyson Felix, and Afghan educator and women's rights advocate Shabana Basij-Rasikh -- their own $20 million grant-making fund to distribute as they see fit.\n\n\"I'm eager to see the landscape of funding opportunities through their eyes, and the results their approaches unlock,\" French Gates said.\n\nFrench Gates said she could have never imagined being part of an effort like this when she was young.\n\n\"Because I have been given this extraordinary opportunity, I am determined to do everything I can to seize it and to set an agenda that helps other women and girls set theirs, too,\" she concluded.\n\nThe Gates Foundation, which French Gates spearheaded with her former husband, has made $77.6 billion of grant payments in its three-decade lifespan, making it one of the largest donor organizations in the world.\n\nIn 2015, French Gates founded Pivotal Ventures, an initiative focused on advancing opportunities for women and minorities in the United States, especially in technology.", "source": {"uri":

Donating $1 billion to women's rights after leaving the foundation she created with her ex-husband", "body": "Melinda French Gates left her and her ex-husband's nonprofit just a couple weeks ago. Now more of a solo artist, French Gates has just done the equivalent of dropping a hit EP right after leaving a boy band. In other words, she's establishing her own philanthropic style with a boldness, immediacy, and ease that's characteristic of someone who is not to be reckoned with.\n\n\"The time is right for me to move forward into the next chapter of my philanthropy,\" she tweeted earlier this month of her choice to exit the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It appears French Gates is eager to tuck into this next chapter, shirking senioritis and instead striking while the iron is hot.\n\nShe proved as much when announcing that she's donating $1 billion to womens' rights in a guest op-ed for The New York Times published on Tuesday. Her gift will be distributed by her organization, Pivotal, over the course of the next two years to organizations that are focused on international issues that impact women and families, including reproductive rights in the U.S. This fall, French Gates is set to continue her efforts by introducing a $250 million initiative centered around bolstering the mental and physical health of women and girls across the globe.\n\nPaving French Gates' way as she departs the organization she co-launched decades ago and enters a new phase of giving, is a piece of advice she received long ago. \"Set your own agenda, or someone else will set it for you,\" she remembered someone once telling her, adding that she's \"carried those words\" since then.\n\nIt's likely that she's referring to her mother, as French Gates' spoke of her mom sharing similarly worded guidance in a Shondaland essay published in 2019. French Gates noted that her mother, like many women of her generation, was not able to go to college or pursue her own career. Her mother, therefore, loved that her daughter \"had big dreams,\" French Gates wrote.\n\n\"At first, I took her advice literally: I became a goal-setter,\" French Gates notes, explaining that she still has the notebook paper she \"used to map this plan out.\" She planned on graduating top of her class, going to a top-tier school, pursuing computer science, becoming employed at a software company, and also, being a mother.\n\nHer mother's voice proved foundational to not just rising up the ladder but in understanding what to do when she suddenly found herself at the very top. \"As it turns out, my mom's advice not only helped me get where I wanted to go, it also helped me stay true to myself as I navigated the unexpected,\" she adds.\n\nWorth $11 billion today, French Gates made her riches mostly due to her stock in Bill Gates' company, Microsoft. But she's made a name for herself when it comes to philanthropy. Once referred to by Warren Buffet as smarter than Bill Gates when it comes to \"seeing the whole picture,\" French Gates appears to give credence to this when it comes to her target donations. She's one of a few hundred extremely wealthy individuals who are looking to give away large portions of her riches to greater causes, having signed the Giving Pledge to donate her fortune during or after her lifetime.\n\nExplaining in 2019 that she never imagined that she'd marry Bill and then start a foundation when she started working at Microsoft, she explains her new reality as a philanthropist was \"daunting\" as her experience was really in the tech world.\n\n\"I had no experience with this kind of work or with the often-heartbreaking things I was seeing on these trips. So I did exactly what my mother taught me to do: I listened,\" she said, and it inspired how she used her immense resources for helping others.\n\nContinuing to dedicate her efforts to uplifting women, she notes today that \"the second the global agenda gets crowded, women and girls fall off.\" Explaining that it's \"frustrating and shortsighted,\" French Gates speaks of upheaval across the globe and narrows in on the nation's own shortcomings. She brings up the high maternal mortality rates for especially Black and Native American women, the chipping away of reproductive rights, and the lack of federally instituted paid family leave.\n\nDonations are not meeting the immense need, as French Gates says only 2% of giving in the U.S. goes to organizations for women's rights and just half a percentage point is donated to groups that are especially focused on women of color.\"When we allow this cause to go so chronically underfunded, we all pay the cost.

Set to launch charitable organization for gender equality", "body": "Melinda Gates will be starting her charitable organization focusing on gender equality. She had earlier decided to step down from the Bill Gates Foundation. In an essay published in the 'New York Times', Melinda Gates who is the ex-wife of Microsoft founder Bill Gates revealed that she will be starting her charitable organization with a visible focus on gender equality. In the essay, Melinda Gates sets out her priorities and reasons for starting her charitable organization even as she explains her reasons for stepping down from the Bill Gates Foundation.\n\nDetailsEarlier, this month, Ms Gates stepped down from her position in the Bill Gates Foundation. The 59-year-old philanthropist revealed that she would receive $12.5 billion as part of the deal from her ex-husband Bill Gates.\n\nIn the editorial, she revealed that she was leaving the organization as she sought to focus on her specific agenda. She seeks to make gender equality, a top priority of her upcoming organization.\n\nGender equality\n\nShe stated that she has been an advocate for women and girls for the past 20 years and the concept of gender equality has always received less priority or has been sidelined in many cases. She has attributed the lack of finance as an important reason why gender equality has always remained in the background.\n\nRoe Wade judgment\n\nCiting the Roe Wade judgment of the US court on the issue of abortion, she rued how women of the current generation are facing challenges in enforcing their rights as compared to the previous generation. This judgment empowered the states to curb abortions. It is something being seen as a step against women's rights.\n\nOut of the 12.5 billion she will be receiving, she said that she will be donating $1 billion to the National Women's Law Centre, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Centre for Reproductive Rights. This may ensure that the judgment could be reviewed based on research and evidence being presented to the judiciary.\n\nMelinda Gates is also offering $20 million to 12 people to do as they wish. This includes former Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern and various other Afghan women's rights activists.\n\n1. When did Bill and Melinda Gates divorce each other?\n\nIt was reported by the media that the couple divorced each other in August 2021. This was caused by to irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.\n\n2. What is the net worth of the Gates Foundation?\n\nThe private charitable organization has a net worth of $75.2 billion.

The funds will go to a number of groups and initiatives but much of it will promote abortion.\n\nGates' new initiative marks the beginning of her renewed philanthropic efforts, concentrating on abortion and pushing it to the forefront even after promoting abortion on a global scale with the Gates foundation.\n\nThe funds will be allocated to support a range of organizations, such as the Center for Reproductive Rights, The 19th, and several others. CRR is one of the major pro-abortion groups that has spent decades fighting to eliminate pro-life laws.\n\nGates wrote in an article today:\n\nMany years ago, I received this piece of advice: \"Set your own agenda, or someone else will set it for you.\" I've carried those words with me ever since.\n\nThat's why, next week, I will leave the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, of which I was a co-founder almost 25 years ago, to open a new chapter in my philanthropy. To begin, I am announcing $1 billion in new spending over the next two years for people and organizations working on behalf of women and families around the world, including on reproductive rights in the United States.\n\nWomen in 14 states have lost the right to terminate a pregnancy under almost any circumstances.\n\nThis donation to promote abortion is on top of what the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation promised for radical pro-abortion efforts earlier this year.\n\nThe Gates Foundation's board of trustees has approved a record $8.6 billion budget for 2024, up from $8.3 billion in 2023 and $7 billion in 2022, the charity announced from Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum is hosting its annual meeting. Over the years, the charity has poured tens of millions of dollars into pro-abortion groups, Democrat-aligned nonprofits and Chinese government organizations, among other causes.\n\nThe foundation works in areas related to gender equality, policy advocacy and global health, according to its website. Pro-abortion groups have received tens of millions from the Gates Foundation to promote \"family planning\" and so-called women's empowerment.\n\nThe Gates Foundation has given over $94 million to Planned Parenthood since the charity was founded, including $10.5 million in 2022 alone, according to its grant database. Planned Parenthood performed 374,155 abortions in the United States between 2021 and 2022, according to its most recent annual report.\n\nDemocrat-aligned nonprofits have also been major beneficiaries of the Gates Foundation. The Gates Foundation has given New Venture Fund over $200 million since 2016, according to its grant database. New Venture Fund is part of the network of nonprofits managed by Arabella Advisors, which The New York Times has labeled a \"dark money\" operation. New Venture Fund bankrolls an array of left-wing groups, according to tax filings.", "source": {"uri": "lifenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_ertelt@lifenews.com", "name": "Steven Ertelt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melinda_French_Gates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Melinda French Gates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_&_Melinda_Gates_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Reproductive_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center for Reproductive Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabella_Advisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabella Advisors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dark money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Planned Parenthood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davos", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Organizations/Grant-Making_Foundations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Organizations/Grant-Making Foundations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/melindagates2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604751", "eventUri": "eng-9604751", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

They are giving women hope, and the money megaphone, needed to call out gender inequality and draw attention to that fact that our human rights are being strategically stripped away. They understand that voices are powerful, but cash is needed to make those voices heard, and for action to be taken.\n\nMelinda Gates has been quietly donating millions of dollars to charities for years, so why is her new commitment to give out $1 billion garnering such attention? Because, the donations will be focused on supporting women and girls in three core areas: expanding women's power and influence, fast-tracking women in key sectors, and mobilizing stakeholders to make gender equality a priority.\n\nThe historic pledge by Gates underscores her dedication to gender equality and through her investment and philanthropic arm, Pivotal Ventures, she's leading the charge to address deeply entrenched societal issues that impede women's progress. Gates provided insight on why she feels now is the time to fight back, \"As shocking as it is to contemplate, my 1-year-old granddaughter may grow up with fewer rights than I had. While I have long focused on improving contraceptive access overseas, in the post-Dobbs era, I now feel compelled to support reproductive rights here at home. For too long, a lack of money has forced organizations fighting for women's rights into a defensive posture while the enemies of progress play offense. I want to help even the match.\"\n\nGates isn't alone in her frustration because women across the globe are showcasing their feminist rage by staging a 'Women's Strike' set to take place on June 24th, 2024. It's meant to be a show of resistance to the overturning of Roe v. Wade -- as it will be the 2-year anniversary of that dark day in our history. The goal of the strike is simple, for our government to feel the economic impact of women demanding an end to the constructs of a patriarchal society, which means a fight for equal rights, reproductive freedom, and to live without fear of gender-based violence. Participants are encouraged to stay home from work and school and avoid spending any money -- unless they work for, or are buying from, a women-owned business.\n\nOn that note, let's break down how Gates' $1 billion commitment aims to help women and body-check the patriarchal forces at play.\n\nBy increasing the representation of women in leadership roles across sectors, Gates aims to shift power dynamics. This includes supporting women in politics, media, and technology, where female voices and perspectives have been historically underrepresented. The initiative will fund campaigns, training programs, and research that help women gain the skills and opportunities needed to lead.\n\nGates' commitment will also target sectors like technology, media, and finance, where women are significantly underrepresented. By investing in mentorship programs, scholarships, and career development initiatives, the goal is to build a pipeline of talented women who can break through the barriers in these male-dominated fields.\n\nAchieving gender equality requires a collective effort. Gates' strategy includes partnering with governments, corporations, and other philanthropic organizations to align resources and policies that support women's advancement.\n\nOne of the critical areas where Melinda Gates' initiative is expected to make a significant impact is reproductive rights. Access to reproductive health services is a cornerstone of gender equality, enabling women to make informed decisions about their bodies and futures.\n\nWith the funding from Pivotal Ventures, organizations that provide family planning services and education will receive much-needed support. This includes access to contraception, sexual education, and maternal health services, particularly in underserved communities.\n\nBeyond direct services, Gates' will bolster advocacy efforts that seek to protect and expand reproductive rights. This includes lobbying for policies that ensure comprehensive reproductive health care is accessible and affordable for all women.\n\nThe commitment also includes funding for innovative solutions in reproductive health. This might involve the development of new contraceptive technologies, mobile health platforms that provide reproductive health information, or community-based initiatives that address cultural barriers to family planning.\n\nIn addition to reproductive rights, Melinda Gates' $1 billion pledge is poised to advance other critical initiatives that women and girls are passionate about. These initiatives span across education, economic empowerment, and combating gender-based violence.\n\nGates' funding will support programs that ensure girls have access to quality education, particularly in STEM fields where gender disparities are most pronounced. Scholarships, mentorship, and training programs will be pivotal in nurturing the next generation of female leaders and innovators.\n\nMoney equals power and financial independence is a key driver of gender equality. The initiative will support women entrepreneurs through grants, microloans, and business development programs.\n\nGates' commitment includes funding for programs that provide support services to survivors of violence, as well as initiatives that aim to prevent violence through education and community engagement.\n\nGates' $1 billion commitment is a bold and transformative step towards achieving gender equality. By addressing systemic barriers and supporting key initiatives she's paving the way for a more just and equitable world. Her investment is not only a testament to her dedication but also a call to action for other leaders and stakeholders to join in the effort to uplift women and girls globally.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_and_reproductive_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual and reproductive health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feminist movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patriarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

To begin, I am announcing $1 billion in new spending over the next two years for people and organizations working on behalf of women and families around the world, including on reproductive rights in the United States.\n\nIn nearly 20 years as an advocate for women and girls, I have learned that there will always be people who say it's not the right time to talk about gender equality. Not if you want to be relevant. Not if you want to be effective with world leaders (most of them men). The second the global agenda gets crowded, women and girls fall off.\n\nIt's frustrating and shortsighted. Decades of research on economics, well-being and governance make it clear that investing in women and girls benefits everyone. We know that economies with women's full participation have more room to grow. That women's political participation is associated with decreased corruption. That peace agreements are more durable when women are involved in writing them. That reducing the time women spend in poor health could add as much as $1 trillion to the global economy by 2040.\n\nAnd yet, around the world, women are seeing a tremendous upsurge in political violence and other threats to their safety, in conflict zones where rape is used as a tool of war, in Afghanistan where the Taliban takeover has erased 20 years of progress for women and girls, in many low-income countries where the number of acutely malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women is soaring.\n\nIn the United States, maternal mortality rates continue to be unconscionable, with Black and Native American mothers at highest risk. Women in 14 states have lost the right to terminate a pregnancy under almost any circumstances. We remain the only advanced economy without any form of national paid family leave.

For too long, a lack of money has forced organizations fighting for women's rights into a defensive posture while the enemies of progress play offense. I want to help even the match.'\n\nMelinda goes on to say that women and girls across the world and in the US face more threats to their freedoms than they have in a generation, citing the end of Roe V Wade, which protected abortion rights federally.\n\n'As shocking as it is to contemplate, my 1-year-old granddaughter may grow up with fewer rights than I had,' the mother-of-three said.\n\nThe philanthropist said her new charity will be giving $1billion to the National Women's Law Center, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nMelinda has also offered 12 people their own $20million grant0making fund to do as they wish.

He succeeds the current CEO, Emilio Emini, PhD, who recently announced his retirement, effective on June 30, 2024.\n\nDr. Matchaba began his career as a physician in South Africa before working for more than two decades in the pharmaceutical industry. In his time with Novartis Global Pharmaceuticals in the US and Switzerland, Dr. Matchaba gained expertise in drug development, global product registration, and market access. Prior to joining the institute, his most recent roles were President of Novartis' U.S. Foundation and Novartis Group Head of Global Health.\n\nBefore joining Novartis, Dr. Matchaba was a Senior Research Scientist at the Cochrane Centre based at the South African Medical Research Centre in Cape Town, which he joined after practicing as an obstetrician and gynecologist in Durban. He also worked as a medical doctor in the mines of Botswana for three years, where he saw the ravages of tuberculosis (TB) firsthand. He was born in Zimbabwe and is a citizen of South Africa and the US.\n\n\"After an extensive global search, we are delighted to announce that Dr. Matchaba will lead the Gates MRI,\" said Trevor Mundel, Board Chair of the Gates MRI and President, Global Health, of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \"Dr. Matchaba has seen every aspect of global health drug development in his 23 years at Novartis, most notably in his work to build sustainable partnerships to treat sickle-cell disease in Africa and Chagas disease in South America. His extensive experience in global health will help the Gates MRI as it progresses candidate therapeutics, supplements, and vaccines through clinical development and ultimately, into manufacturing and distribution.\"\n\n\"Dr. Matchaba's experience in harnessing the power of medical innovation -- from research through to distribution and patient access -- will serve us well,\" said Dr. Emini. \"As we continue the clinical studies on potential interventions to fight the diseases that disproportionately impact low- and middle-income countries, we need continued leadership that can leverage the capabilities of current partners while building new collaboration models.\"\n\n\"Tuberculosis, malaria, diarrheal diseases, and maternal and child health are public health challenges that impact communities in low- and middle-income countries,\" said Dr. Matchaba. \"The Gates MRI was founded to help address these intractable concerns and to save lives. I look forward to joining with new colleagues and research partners in this critically important work.\"\n\nIn March of this year, the Gates MRI launched a Phase 3 clinical trial to assess the efficacy of the M72/AS01E tuberculosis vaccine candidate. The institute is conducting a number of additional clinical trials, evaluating potential therapeutics, vaccine candidates, and a probiotic candidate to reduce the burden of illness in low- and middle-income countries globally.\n\nThe Gates MRI is an affiliate of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nAbout the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute (Gates MRI)\n\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute is a non-profit medical research organization dedicated to the development and effective use of novel biomedical interventions addressing substantial global health concerns, for which investment incentives are limited, including malaria, tuberculosis, enteric and diarrheal diseases, and diseases that impact maternal, newborn, and child health.

For too long, a lack of money has forced organizations fighting for women's rights into a defensive posture while the enemies of progress play offense. I want to help even the match.'\n\nMelinda goes on to say that women and girls across the world and in the US face more threats to their freedoms than they have in a generation, citing the end of Roe V Wade, which protected abortion rights federally.\n\n'As shocking as it is to contemplate, my 1-year-old granddaughter may grow up with fewer rights than I had,' the mother-of-three said.\n\nThe philanthropist said her new charity will be giving $1billion to the National Women's Law Center, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nMelinda has also offered 12 people their own $20million grant0making fund to do as they wish. The grantees include former prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern and Afghan champion of girls' education, Shabana Basij-Rasikh.\n\nThe couple are pictured with their three kids in a 2019 family photo.

They were last seen together at the Academy Museum for Motion Pictures in Los Angeles for a black tie event celebrating major scientific achievements of the year.\n\nMelinda's op-ed comes after she fueled romance rumors when she stepped out donning a blinding diamond ring, prompting many to question whether she was planning to walk down the aisle with her former Fox News anchor boyfriend Jon Du Pre, who she was first linked with back in 2022.\n\nMelinda's op-ed comes after she fueled romance rumors when she stepped out donning a blinding diamond ring\n\nThe 59-year-old billionaire was seen wearing the large bauble during an outing in New York on Sunday - hours after she debuted it for the first time\n\nMany were shocked when news hit the web that Melinda, 59, and former Fox News anchor Jon, 65, were dating back in 2022 - since he had an extremely controversial past\n\nBut the billionaire philanthropist quickly shut down any suggestion that she and Jon, 65, are headed for the altar when she addressed the speculation in a statement via her rep confirming that the pair have broken up - and insisting that she is not currently engaged to anyone.\n\nMany were shocked when news hit the web that Melinda and Jon were dating back in 2022 - particularly because the former Fox News anchor appeared to be the complete opposite of her ex-husband, Bill, and also had an extremely controversial past that saw him admitting to abusing his wife while still living with the Mormon religion.\n\nEx-Mormon Jon once admitted to verbally abusing his previous wife, writing in his memoir about how he would erupt in fits of 'explosive rage' that left her 'cowering' in fear.\n\nHe recalled calling his ex as a 'spoon-fed, spoiled-rotten b***h' in the book, and openly admitted to 'embarrassing her in front of their friends' and 'blaming her' for any 'little thing that went wrong' during the relationship.\n\nMelinda first revealed back in March 2022 that she was officially 'dipping her toes' into the dating world again during an appearance on CBS Mornings (seen)\n\nOne month later, she and Jon were spotted attending a Brooklyn Nets basketball game together (seen).

Unlike famous fortune-tellers like Nostradamus or Baba Vanga, Gates, now 68 years old, seems to possess an unparalleled understanding of future trends.\n\nIn his 1999 book \"Business @ the Speed of Thought,\" Gates presented a series of predictions regarding technological advancements, many of which have seamlessly integrated into our daily lives. Despite his expertise primarily lying in the tech sector, Gates demonstrated bold anticipation of broader societal shifts.\n\nIn addition to his early recognition, as far back as 2015, of the potential disruptive impact of a global pandemic, well before the emergence of the Coronavirus, Gates' predictive prowess extends across various other domains. Here, we delve into Gates' 15 significant predictions, now indispensable components of contemporary existence.\n\nPrice Comparison Sites\n\nGates predicted the rise of automated price comparison services, simplifying the process of finding the best deals across various industries. Today, platforms like Compare the Market and Google Products fulfill this prophecy, making it effortless for consumers to find the most cost-effective products and services.\n\n\"Automated price comparison services will be developed, allowing people to see prices across multiple websites, making it effortless to find the cheapest product for all industries.\"\n\nMobile Phones\n\nAnticipating the ubiquitous presence of mobile devices, Gates foresaw a future where people could stay connected and conduct electronic business from anywhere. His prediction accurately describes the functionality of today's smartphones, which serve as indispensable tools for communication, information access, and productivity.\n\nGates said: \"People will carry around small devices that allow them to constantly stay in touch and do electronic business from wherever they are.\n\n\"They will be able to check the news, see flights they have booked, get information from financial markets, and do just about anything else on these devices.\"\n\nOnline Finance\n\nGates envisioned the transition of financial transactions and management to the online sphere, predicting online bill payment, financial management, and even online healthcare services. Today, these services are commonplace, offering convenience and accessibility to users worldwide.\n\nThe Microsoft co-founder predicted: \"People will pay their bills, take care of their finances, and communicate with their doctors over the internet.\"\n\nVirtual Assistants\n\nWhile not explicitly predicting devices like Amazon's Alexa, Gates foresaw the development of personal companions that streamline daily tasks by connecting and synchronizing devices. His description aligns with the functionality of modern virtual assistants, which facilitate various activities and enhance user convenience.\n\nThe tech mogul said: \"They will connect and sync all your devices in a smart way, whether they are at home or in the office, and allow them to exchange data.\n\n\"The device will check your email or notifications, and present the information that you need. When you go to the store, you can tell it what recipes you want to prepare, and it will generate a list of ingredients that you need to pick up.\n\n\"It will inform all the devices that you use of your purchases and schedule, allowing them to automatically adjust to what you're doing.\"\n\nHome-Monitoring Systems\n\nGates anticipated the emergence of home-monitoring systems, akin to contemporary technologies like Ring doorbells and Google Nest, providing constant video feeds and notifications for remote monitoring of one's residence.\n\n\"Constant video feeds of your house will become common, which inform you when somebody visits while you are not home,\" he wrote.\n\nSocial Media\n\nPredicting the rise of internet-based discussions and global connectivity, Gates envisioned a future where residents could engage in online discussions on various topics, foreshadowing the advent of social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok.\n\n\"Residents of cities and countries will be able to have internet-based discussions concerning issues that affect them, such as local politics, city planning, or safety,\" Gates predicted.\n\nAuto-Generated Adverts\n\nGates foresaw the personalized nature of advertisements, where software utilizes consumer data to suggest tailored activities, discounts, and offers based on individual preferences, enhancing the relevance and effectiveness of marketing efforts.\n\n\"Software that knows when you've booked a trip and uses that information to suggest activities at the local destination.

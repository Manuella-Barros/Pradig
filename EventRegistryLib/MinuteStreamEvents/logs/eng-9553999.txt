Keep in mind, more than 350 schools play Division I men's college basketball. Also, the Tigers are one of five ACC schools that reached such a status.\n\n\"I think somehow there is a narrative that needs to change a little bit with our program,\" Clemson head coach Brad Brownell said.\n\nWhat is that narrative?\n\nThe narrative is Clemson is a football school and cannot win in men's college basketball. That is something that has been used against Brownell and the Clemson Basketball program for years, and he pointed out Wednesday that is not the case anymore.\n\nBrownell described the commitment Clemson has made to his program and to him. So much so, Clemson athletic director Graham Neff and Brownell are in the middle of contract negotiations.\n\n\"We are currently in talks, and I am excited about that and hope to get something done quickly,\" Brownell said. \"There has been a lot going on, on both sides over the course of the last two months, maybe the last month.\"\n\nA new deal is well-deserved for Brownell.\n\nClemson became the first team this past year to win three games as an underdog in the NCAA Tournament since 1985. This year's Elite 8 run is just the second in the program's history.\n\nFor the first time in school history, Clemson beat four Associated Press Top 25 teams on the road in one season. The Tigers also set a single-season-record with 12 wins away from Littlejohn Coliseum.\n\nThe Tigers .625 ACC win percentage over the last two years is the best conference win percentage in the program's history.\n\nIt does not end there, the Tigers' 47 wins since the start of the 2022-'23 campaign is the most wins by the program in a two-year stretch. Clemson won 23 games in 2023, and then 24 games this past season.\n\n\"We have done well. We have talked about being top five in the league in wins over a seven-year period.

The latest on his future", "body": "The Clemson men's basketball team has its roster for 2024-25 mostly settled, but the Tigers are still waiting on a decision from one key player.\n\nVeteran guard Chase Hunter, one of the stars of Clemson's Elite Eight run, announced April 17 he was entering his name in the 2024 NBA Draft pool while maintaining his eligibility to return for a potential sixth season with the Tigers.\n\nHunter, 23, started all 36 games for Clemson last year as a fifth-year senior and averaged 17.8 points per game on 50% shooting in four NCAA Tournament games, including back-to-back 20-point games in wins over New Mexico and Baylor.\n\nClemson men's basketball coach Brad Brownell provided an update on Hunter's process during a end-of-season news conference Wednesday at Littlejohn Coliseum.\n\nBrownell said he was \"optimistic\" that Hunter would return for a sixth year, adding that Hunter had worked out for an NBA team earlier this week.\n\n\"I'm excited about his future,\" Brownell said of Hunter.\n\nBrownell also said that Hunter's 2024 NCAA Tournament run was the best he's played in his Clemson career to date.\n\nAccording to an NCAA memo distributed to schools in February, Hunter, who is currently going through the draft evaluation process, must withdraw his name from the draft by May 29 at 11:59 p.m. in order to be eligible for the 2024-25 season.\n\nThat NCAA early entry withdrawal deadline comes after the G League Elite Camp in Chicago (May 10-12) and the more prestigious NBA Draft Combine, also held in Chicago (May 12-19). As of Wednesday, Hunter has not been invited to either of those events, according to publicized invitation lists.\n\nBrownell previously said during a radio interview last month \"there's a chance\" Hunter returns for a sixth season at Clemson, citing the guard's strong connection to the program and the possibility of name, image and likeness (NIL) compensation.\n\nHunter, who has an infant daughter, has previously said his family will factor into his stay-or-go decision. He joined Clemson as a four-star recruit in the Class of 2019 out of Atlanta and has an extra \"COVID year\" of eligibility remaining.\n\nHunter has already used a medical redshirt year of eligibility after playing just nine games as a freshman in 2019-20 before suffering a season-ending foot injury.\n\nHe holds career averages of 9.2 points, 2.6 assist and 2.4 rebounds per game during his 133-game Clemson career. But he's taken his game to another level the past two seasons, peaking with an NCAA all-region team selection in March, and would presumably slide right back in as the Tigers' starting point guard if he returns.\n\nClemson, which went 24-12 and finished No. 14 in the final AP Top 25, lost first-team All ACC center PJ Hall to the NBA Draft and starting guard Joe Girard III to graduation. But the Tigers return starting power forward and reigning ACC Most Improved Player Ian Schieffelin and a number of bench players including guard Dillon Hunter, Chase's younger brother.\n\nBrownell has also signed two veteran transfers, former Boston College guard Jaeden Zackery and former Cincinnati center Viktor Lakhin, and brings in the country's No. 20 composite recruiting class for 2024.",

(FOX Carolina) - Clemson head men's basketball coach Brad Brownell has been hard at work in the transfer portal since returning from L.A. where the Tigers played in the NCAA Elite 8 for just the second time in program history.\n\nWednesday was the first chance for media members to talk to the head coach since the team's return from LA and he had plenty to say about the Tiger's accomplishments this year and the last several years.\n\n\"Somehow there's a narrative that needs to change a little bit with out program,\" Brownell said in his opening statement to the media. He pointed out, in his opinion, the program's success has been undercut for too long. He noted the team's consistent place among the top five in the ACC in wins.\n\n\"It started at like five years, six years, seven years. Like we are winning consistently,\" Brownell said in reference to the team's place in the top five for wins running seven straight seasons now.\n\nBrownell said it was time people took notice of the tournament success they have added to the consistent regular season success.\n\n\"This year's Elite 8 run puts us in another category. I mean it changes the narrative,\" Brownell said.\n\nThe Tigers have joined an elite class of college basketball. They are one of just 24 teams in the country that have been to a Sweet 16 and at least an Elite 8 in separate seasons since 2018. Five of those 24 are from the ACC including Clemson, North Carolina, Duke, Florida State and Miami.\n\n\"That, with the consistency of regular season winning within the league, I think that's the one people haven't paid much attention to,\" Brownell said. \"There are a lot of teams that have a great year and then have a terrible year and we just haven't had those years. Knock on wood. We haven't won a league yet. That's still a goal. Certainly an ACC Tournament, we have to do better. That's on me.\"\n\nBrownell has shouldered the program's shortcomings for a long time but on Wednesday he owned its success too.\n\nTaking credit he has earned but rarely accepted.\n\n\"If you're not fundraising. I mean I'm doing a ton of fundraising folks and I have been for 14 years,\" Brownell explained. \"One of the reasons we were in the Elite 8 is because of all the fundraising, friend-raising, whatever you want to call it, for 14 years. It's one of the reasons we have a facility that's much nicer than it was. It's filling those premium seats.\n\n\"I do deserve a lot of credit for that. A lot,\" Brownell continued. \"Because it's been a 14-year journey and had we had a different coach or a newer, younger coach at the time it wouldn't have happened. There would have been no chance. So, you know, that's obviously been a spot of mine, a sore spot at times because I think that's gone not as noticed as I'd have liked. And obviously, it's vital. College basketball right now, NIL is a major factor in it.\"\n\nBrownell did confirm he's in talks with the administration about a contract extension. He said he is excited about it and hopes it is something that can get wrapped up quickly, admitting both sides have been busy with lots of other things since the season wrapped in at the end of March.\n\nThe coach also said he's both hopeful and optimistic Chase Hunter will return for another season with the Tigers. Hunter worked out for an NBA team this week and while Brownell said he loves to see him get those opportunities he believes he could build off this year's success and his NCAA tournament performance in a big way.", "source": {"uri": "foxcarolina.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Carolina"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Brownell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Brownell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clemson Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Eight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elite Eight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Coast Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACC_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ACC men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Seminoles_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Seminoles football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://gray-whns-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/I5LEXMKAQZEKXA2N6AJTC5GY24.jpg?auth=17ad33d9b3215ef4c4ed38b4a9de42d9bedb1742c7c5a7384f2ddf8588f18aa1&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553999", "eventUri": "eng-9553999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

He's one of my most special recruits as much anything because he was a top player in the state and stayed home. There'd been some other times I've tried to recruit those guys. Recruited them for two and three years and gotten turned down at the end,\" Brownell recalled. \"PJ decided that this is where he wanted to be.\"\n\n\"Not just that decision but his decision to stay with us for four years. He was a very sought-after player. You know, the transfer window was open and he could've gone again if he wanted to,\" said Brownell. \"I'm just extremely thankful for that.\"\n\nFrom there, Brownell discussed Hall as a person rather than Hall as just a player. He praised him as someone who always took what they gave him and left it all out for their team.\n\n\"I'm thankful for the way he allowed me to coach him. He allowed me to coach him in a way that I thought made him better,\" said Brownell. \"His carefree, caring personality? I mean I don't know if I've ever had a player as good as he is who cared so much about the team and other players. Remarkable young man that way. Parents deserve so much credit for the way they raised him and for the way that he genuinely cares about other folks, our program, and our fanbase.\"\n\n\"I think he had a hard time at times this year because I think he really - he was playing under pressure because he wanted to do something special for Clemson during his time here,\" Brownell noted. \"What's remarkable is his numbers are remarkable considering the injuries and the playing hurt, missing some games. Just, I mean, his stats are unbelievable.\"\n\nHall appeared in 120 games at Clemson, including 92 starts over the last three years. In that time, he averaged 14.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 1.1 blocks while shooting 50.3% overall. That earned him honors as an All-ACC selection several times over during the past three seasons.\n\nAs a senior this year, Hall posted his best numbers with 18.3 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks. Individually, that gave him a spot on the All-ACC First Team. As the leader of this year's team, he helped the Tigers to one of their best records in some time. That included the postseason where Clemson made their second-ever Elite Eight after upsetting No. 3 Baylor and No. 2 Arizona. In that run that came within a game of the Final Four, Hall became a member of the NCAA All-Region Team for the West.\n\nThis all came after Hall, a Spartanburg, South Carolina native, stayed as an in-state talent. He was the No. 50 player, a four-star prospect, and the top recruit in the state coming out of Dorman High School in 2020. As one of the nation's top power forwards in that cycle, he joined the Tigers that were an hour and a half west from home.\n\nHall has meant a ton to Clemson while playing for them over the past few years. Now, the moment to start his professional career, as well as the rest of his life, has come with no one more excited to see it all than Brownell.\n\n\"To watch his name get called will be - I'll be so happy for him because I know how hard he has worked at it and it's something that he has dreamed of for a long time,\" said Brownell. \"The great thing about PJ is that won't define him. He'll be much more about all the other things, remain humble either way, hard-working.\"\n\n\"He's going to have a great life. He'll continue to pour into our program, our people and he'll be an unbelievable ambassador for our university,\" said Brownell. \"It's just a blessing to be able to get to coach a guy like that.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_gillenwater@on3.com", "name": "Sam Gillenwater", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clemson University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Coast Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorman_High_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dorman High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Eight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elite Eight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baylor_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baylor University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartanburg,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spartanburg, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Spartanburg, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/09121650/Untitled-design-42.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553999", "eventUri": "eng-9553999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Never crossed any boundaries. Never did anything you shouldn't do. He just does stuff the right way. That's what this program is built upon.\"\n\nThere is a strong culture in place at Clemson, and Hall said that even if some on the outside looking don't always see it, Brownell has set the program up for future success.\n\n\"His staff does stuff the right way, his players do stuff the right way,\" Hall said. \"He is big on, 'my guys graduate, my guys don't get in trouble.' And that rings true.\"\n\nAfter averaging more that 15 points per game in each of his sophomore and junior seasons, Hall put up more than 18 points per game during a stellar senior campaign that saw him take home All-ACC honors. While most of his damage came in the paint, Hall also displayed an ability to knock down shots from the perimeter.\n\nIt's a collegiate career that Hall, who is out of nearby Spartanburg, is proud of and despite some of the outside criticism of Brownell, the homegrown talent credits much of his development to his head coach.\n\n\"Playing for him was special the past four years,\" Hall said. \"And as I go through these times when we were having success, that's one thing that I like to remind people of. In the tournament, the game plans were insane. The game plans were to a tee. Basically perfection. Even the Alabama game, the game plan was really, really good, they just hit shots.\"\n\n\"I couldn't care less if you like the guy, but incredible coach, incredible guy. Incredible X's and O's guy. Incredible developer. Look at me. Developed me to what I am. Amir (Simms), Hunter (Tyson), Chase (Hunter), all these guys. So, it's been special. I wouldn't change it.

Zackery and Lakhin will be key pieces during the 2024-25 season with at least one more piece to be added to the puzzle.", "source": {"uri": "theclemsoninsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Clemson Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_burnett@theclemsoninsider.com", "name": "Cameron Burnett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_transfer_portal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NCAA transfer portal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Brownell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brad Brownell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Girard_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Girard III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clemson, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clemson, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://theclemsoninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/81/2022/02/CU_FSU_1500.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553999", "eventUri": "eng-9553999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

But he only played in three games for Duke last season, averaging 1.7 points and 1.7 rebounds per contest in five minutes a game.\n\nThe sophomore missed 13 games due to injury in 2023-24 before undergoing right ankle surgery and being ruled out for the remainder of the season, according to Duke. Reeves, a former three-star recruit, was a minimal contributor as a freshman, as well.\n\nIn the recruiting process, the big man was offered by the likes of South Carolina and Georgia Tech before Duke inevitably won out.\n\nWith Reeves' addition, the Tigers only have two scholarships left to give. That number is really one, though, because Brownell expects fifth-year point guard Chase Hunter to return for a sixth season after testing the NBA Draft.\n\nBrownell's expectation on May 8 was the Tigers might use their remaining scholarship for another frontcourt piece.\n\n\"You never know how it's gonna all play out because portal recruiting is not really an exact science,\" Brownell said. \"You're just getting involved with a lot of players, doing your homework, sometimes you get further into it with a guy than somebody else. But you're trying to match guys with the guys you have, with who you might get.\n\n\"I can always change how we do some things to fit my personnel.

The former three-star prospect from Georgia averaged 6.1 points and 3.4 rebounds per game while shooting nearly 60 percent from the field.\n\nClemson head coach Brad Brownell met with the media on Wednesday, and when asked about Godfrey, Brownell didn't care to discuss specific transfer decisions but admitted he was \"a little\" surprised by Godfrey entering the portal.\n\n\"I'm not gonna get into specifics with kids leaving.

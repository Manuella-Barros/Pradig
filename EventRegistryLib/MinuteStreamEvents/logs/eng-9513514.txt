Jeezy and Jeannie Mai's Divorce Is Getting Uglier And We Have Receipts", "body": "Trigger warning: The following story contains descriptions of physical and verbal abuse.\n\nJust when the messy divorce proceedings between rapper Jeezy and his soon-to-be ex-wife Jeannie Mai seemed like they couldn't get any worse, new allegations of abuse and child neglect.\n\nLast week, we told you how the \"Put On\" rapper had filed for primary custody of the child citing his belief that she \"would have more stability.\" He later walked that back and amended his request for both he and Mai to have equal amount. Prior to that, Jeezy alleged that Jeannie was \"gatekeeping\" their now two-year-old daughter Monaco which in turned prompted her to clapped back against those claims and allege that she had concerns for \"reasonable safety\" stemming from alleged unsafely stored guns (presumably owned by Jeezy) that were around while the toddler was present.\n\nNow, according to court documents obtained by The Shade Room on Thursday, Jeannie is alleging several instances of both physical and verbal abuse at the hands of Jeezy. Per the documents, she cites four instances where she was allegedly harmed, the most recent ones taking place at a Ritz Carlton hotel in San Francisco in April 2022 and inside a parked car in Miami in January 2022 weeks after she gave birth.\n\nTSR has more:\n\nJeezy allegedly choked Jeannie from behind as she was ascending the stairs, and he then pushed her down the steps, per the paperwork. The incident caught the attention of the hotel security guard stationed in the lobby. Security allegedly intervened and provided Jeannie protection after she repeatedly stated she \"felt unsafe.\"\n\nAnother incident allegedly occurred three weeks after Jeannie gave birth to her daughter Monaco in January 2002. Reports state that during a conversation inside a parked car on January 18, 2022, in Miami, Records show that Jeezy requested that the driver step outside the vehicle and begin to berate Jeannie. At the time, he hurled insults such as \"You whore!\" and said, \"I can't wait to divorce you when we get back.\" Jeannie was held against her will inside the vehicle. While trying to escape, Jeezy allegedly struck her with a closed fist across her cheekbone and eye. The attack reportedly caused her a subconjunctival hemorrhage.\n\nFollowing the incident later that week, the estranged couple contacted their pastor and therapist for counseling regarding the ongoing domestic violence.\n\nThe next incident allegedly happened later that year at the UNCF 39th annual Atlanta Mayor's Masked Ball in December. After allegedly being gone away from him for two long at the event, an allegedly upset Jeezy made the two of them leave and subsequently and allegedly \"grabbed the neckline of her dress, tearing the dress and causing multiple 2-3 inch scratches across her right breast with his fingernails,\" as she attempted to escape the car they were in. The driver was not present.\n\nThe documents also mention an alleged golf cart accident that the \"\"Seen It All\" rapper allegedly caused due to him being allegedly intoxicated. Texts provided by the former \"The Real\" host show the rapper apologizing and the injuries she suffered.\n\nJeezy has since responded to these new claims, writing in a statement on his personal Instagram on Tuesday: \"The allegations are not only false, but also deeply disturbing, especially coming from someone I loved. This malicious attempt to tarnish my character and disrupt my family is ridiculous. It's disheartening to witness the manipulation and deceit at play and at this time my main concern is being an active father to our daughter as I continue to fight for court mandated joint custody. Rest assured, the truth will prevail through the proper legal channels.\"\n\nAdditionally, per The Jasmine Brand, the \"Trap or Die 3\" artist also provided texts of his own refuting Jeannie's claims that her injuries came from him physically assaulting her but instead were from the golf cart accident she mentioned in her court documents. He also provided pictures of his injuries that were allegedly from the same accident.", "source": {"uri": "theroot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Root"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeezy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeezy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeannie_Mai", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeannie Mai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Verbal abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_On", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Put On"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shade_Room", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Shade Room"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_neglect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child neglect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ritz-Carlton_Hotel_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trap music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_custody", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint custody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_cart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf cart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/8a31edd9127cf1d906af3d1efc46ae2a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513514", "eventUri": "eng-9513514", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2002-01-", "textStart": 1712, "textEnd": 1724}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-01-", "textStart": 1790, "textEnd": 1800}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

The new documents, obtained by Hollywood Unlocked, asks the judge to share custody with his estranged wife, Jeannie Mai, despite not knowing where his youngest child sleeps. Jeezy claims only seeing baby Monaco only more than a handful of times in 2024.\n\nAccording to the petition, the \"Put On\" rapper wants \"equal parenting time.\" He claims that Monaco has not been staying in Georgia, where Jeannie reportedly lives. The docs allege that his two-year-old child has been in three different states so far during the month of April. The embattled father can only assume that Monaco is under the care of Jeannie's mother or brother.\n\nThe filing also claims uncertainty whether or not Jeannie moved away from her Georgia and California residences. More specifically, Jeezy apparently does not have any knowledge of where Jeannie and his daughter are permanently living.\n\n\"More importantly, the Petitioner has no idea when he will be to have any parenting time with his daughter,\" the petition stated in part. \"Clearly, the Respondent has no regard for the bond and affection between the parties' minor child and her father.\"\n\nHowever, later in the documents, Jeezy claims that Jeannie defied their previous agreement and blocked his phone number.\n\nIn his petition, Jeezy also stresses the value of Monaco learning about her Vietnamese and African American roots while her parents' undergo an divorce.\n\nOn April 11, 2024, TMZ reported that Jeezy filed a motion for full custody of his two-year-old. He claimed that Jeannie wasn't take care of their child herself, so Jeezy reportedly requested to allow their daughter to live with him full-time.\n\nMadameNoire previously reported on the messy custody battle at the end of 2023. The estranged couple had an agreement set in place but the trap music pioneer found it to be ineffective.\n\nAt the time, Jeezy's lawyer stated, \"The lack of consistency, continuity, and stability inherently associated with such a haphazard and fluid parenting schedule is stressful to the Child, and it has, as is unfortunately inevitable with all families in transition, created unnecessary tension and confusion regarding not only parenting time but also regarding each parent's role and rights when the Child is in their respective custody.\"", "source": {"uri": "madamenoire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MadameNoire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "atiya_jordan@madamenoire.com", "name": "Atiya Jordan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeezy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeezy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeannie_Mai", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeannie Mai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parenting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MadameNoire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MadameNoire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trap music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnamese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/17137588941086.jpg?w=560&h=320&crop=1&strip=all&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513514", "eventUri": "eng-9513514", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-16", "textStart": 171, "textEnd": 179}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-04-", "textStart": 1689, "textEnd": 1697}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The documents cite between three and four instances of Jeezy allegedly abusing Mai. She additionally expresses concerns over his allegedly excessive alcohol consumption, explosive outbursts, and more.\n\nOne of the instances described in the docs allegedly took place in 2022 at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in San Francisco. She accuses him of choking her as she walked up a staircase, and of later pushing her down the steps. When hotel security allegedly intervened, she says he proceeded to hurl insults at her, calling her a \"f*cking b*tch\" and claiming that he \"can do so much better\" than her.\n\nRead More: Jeezy & Jeannie Mai Custody Battle: Rapper's Ex-Wife Reportedly Limiting Monaco's Time With Him\n\nAnother alleged instance took place in a parked car weeks after Mai gave birth to their daughter Monaco in 2022, according to the documents. Allegedly, Jeezy had asked the driver to exit the vehicle and began to verbally assault her. \"You wh*re!\" he allegedly said, \"I can't wait to divorce you when we get back.\" Despite attempts to leave the vehicle, Jeezy allegedly held Mai there against her will and eventually punched her in the eye. The docs state that Mai suffered a subconjunctival hemorrhage as a result.\n\nAside from these alleged instances, and various others, the docs additionally detail a 2023 incident involving their then one-year-old child. Allegedly, Mai found the infant with Jeezy's Louis Vuitton bag, later checking it and finding the rapper's AK-47 inside. She then removed Monaco from the home.

Moreover, according to court documents, Mai pointed to three alleged incidents in particular in which he physically assaulted her and claimed that he drinks too much alcohol and has explosive outbursts, among other concerns. As for the alleged child neglect, she also claimed that she supposedly found an AK-47 rifle in a Louis Vuitton bag that she found with their then-one-year-old child. Now, according to The Jasmine Brand, the rapper has vehemently denied these accusations.\n\nFurthermore, Jeannie Mai had provided pictures of the alleged injuries that she supposedly sustained as a result of Jeezy's as-of-yet unsubstantiated abusive actions. One of the specific incidents referred to was him allegedly pushing her down a flight of stairs, but he reportedly responded to the court that this specific event never happened and is a complete fabrication. According to court documents, the Atlanta MC is claiming that the injuries that Mai provided alleged photos of in the lawsuit are actually from a golf course incident. Not only that, but he apparently provided photographic and text message evidence of the timeline of the accident, as well as providing an alleged picture of his own injuries as a result of the accident.\n\nRead More: \"Hip-Hop & The White House\" Documentary Narrated By Jeezy Gets Hulu Release Date\n\nAs for what these alleged texts and photos mean for Jeezy, it aims to counter Jeannie Mai's claim that his alleged abuse of her reportedly occurred in April, referring to the specific and alleged stairs incident. These new supposed texts and pictures are from June, which would mean the injuries happened months afterwards if this is actually to be believed. Overall, the only confirmed thing about all of this is that it made the divorce between them all the nastier. There are a lot of unconfirmed and speculative allegations flying around, including how they've allegedly limited each other's time with their child.\n\nMeanwhile, both parties, especially the trap pioneer, have done their part to request privacy amid this contentious back-and-forth. With these new allegations in mind, we can only expect things to get muddier and more combative in the near future. But hopefully we are wrong on that.

The former couple announced they were separating in September 2023.\n\nThe rapper filed for divorce from The Real host in September after two-and-a-half years of marriage. According to the filing, obtained by PEOPLE, Jeezy said the former couple are \"currently living in a bona fide state of separation,\" and that their marriage is \"irretrievably broken\" with \"no hope for reconciliation.\"\n\nIn December, Jeezy accused Mai of acting as a \"gatekeeper\" of their daughter and asked a judge for a hearing to set \"clearly defined\" temporary legal and physical custody rights amid their divorce.\n\nIn the documents obtained by PEOPLE, Jeezy requested that a judge \"address temporary custodial arrangements.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Jeezy requested primary custody of his toddler daughter in documents obtained by PEOPLE. The request superseded the current custody and parenting schedule he and Mai worked out in mediation.\n\nThe rapper claimed that he initially agreed to move to the basement of their shared home amid their separation, but said that Mai has since moved out of their house, taking Monaco with her. In the documents, Jeezy claimed he \"does not know where the minor child actually lives, or what or who is caring for the minor child while\" Mai \"is working.\"\n\nA few days later, Jeezy filed a new request in legal documents obtained by PEOPLE, which stated that he is is seeking to \"share joint legal custody and joint physical custody of the minor child and that the specific parenting time schedule be determined by the Court consistent with the best interest of the minor child.\"\n\nHe added that he has always \"desired that the parties share joint legal custody and joint physical custody of the minor child,\" adding that his position has \"never changed.\"\n\nA representative for both Mai and Jeezy did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeezy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeezy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65th_Annual_Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "65th Annual Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_custody", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child custody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting_plan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parenting plan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_parenting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shared parenting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mediation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toddler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parenting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/sDuT3RMDw8B_cjWYE0Z3xbj-XE0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(724x180:726x182)/jeannie-mai-daughter-042324-tout-7da84a8e02cf4fbe96199160b685b7e4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513514", "eventUri": "eng-9513514", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 19}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The little one even gets a treat for letting it out, making it an accomplishment she actually looks forward to, versus something shameful she shies away from.\n\nFor herself, Mai expressed there's no longer any shame in her game, as having very regular bowel movements is a big part of being healthy.

The host nation put on a dominant performance to book their place in the final four.\n\nEarlier, Bangladesh set the tone with a resounding 114-run victory over Malaysia.The Bangladeshi team's impressive total of 191 for 2 was largely thanks to opener Murshida Khatun's blistering 80 off 59 balls and captain Nigar Sultana's quick-fire 62 from just 37 deliveries.\n\nBangladesh's decision to bat first proved fruitful as Khatun and Dilara Akter, the wicket-keeper, formed a solid 65-run partnership for the first wicket. Akter contributed a valuable 33 runs before Khatun teamed up with Sultana to add another 89 runs for the second wicket, laying the groundwork for an imposing total.\n\nThe Bangladeshi bowlers then took center stage, limiting Malaysia to a mere 77 runs for the loss of 8 wickets in their allotted 20 overs. This dominant performance secured Bangladesh a resounding victory and earned them a well-deserved spot in the semifinal.\n\nThailand struggled with the bat in their final group match, only managing to score 93 for 7 after choosing to bat first.\n\nWicket-keeper batter Nannapat Koncharoenkai top-scored for Thailand with a 53-ball 47.\n\nSri Lanka's off-spinner Kavisha Dilhari was the standout bowler, taking 2 wickets for just 13 runs.\n\nSri Lanka had no trouble chasing down the target, with captain Chamari Athapaththu remaining unbeaten on 49 and Vishmi Gunaratne contributing 39 not out. The Sri Lankan openers made light work of the chase, comfortably leading their team to victory.\n\nThe Thailand bowlers were unable to make any significant impact against the dominant Sri Lankan batting performance.\n\nThe tournament now moves to the semifinal stage, with India, the reigning champions, set to face Bangladesh, while Sri Lanka will take on Pakistan on Friday.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

The Lankan side was asked to chase a paltry score of 94, which they hunted down with their skipper leading the charge unbeaten on 49. Vishmi Gunaratne also returned back not out on 39 as her team won the game in 11.3 overs.\n\nThis means that the four semifinalists of the tournament have been set in stone.

India and Pakistan have qualified from Group A, while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh take the top two spots in Group B. Check the semifinal fixtures.\n\nAll four semifinalists of the Women's Asia Cup 2024 were confirmed on Wednesday when Sri Lanka registered a thumping win over Thailand in the last group game of the tournament.\n\nChamari Athapaththu's Lankan side is the only other team apart from defending champions India to have registered a hat-trick of wins as they eased past their Thai opponents unscathed with 10 wickets in hand in Group B. The Lankan side was asked to chase a paltry score of 94, which they hunted down with their skipper leading the charge unbeaten on 49. Vishmi Gunaratne also returned back not out on 39 as her team won the game in 11.3 overs.\n\nThis means that the four semifinalists of the tournament have been set in stone. India and Pakistan had already qualified from Group A when the Women in Blue made light work of Nepal with an 82-run win.\n\nThe defending champions topped Group A and will meet the second-ranked team of Group B Bangladesh in the first semifinal, while Group A runners-up Pakistan will face the Group B toppers Sri Lanka in the other semifinal. Notably, Bangladesh are the only other team to win the continental showpiece in women's competition apart from India.\n\nBoth the knockout games are lined up on the same day July 26, Friday. The India vs Bangladesh semifinal will take place from 2 PM onwards, while the Pakistan vs Sri Lanka clash will be held later from 7 PM onwards. The final of the tournament is slated to take place on Sunday, July 28.\n\nThailand had an outside chance of reaching the semis. They needed to upset Sri Lanka by a decent margin to pip Bangladesh on NRR and take their second spot. But that could not be as Athapaththu's team was too hot to handle for the minnows.\n\nKavisha Dilhari took two wickets with Achini Kulasuriya, Sugandika Kumari, Priyadharshani and the skipper herself scalping a wicket each. Thailand were restricted to 93/7 in their 20 overs with with wicketkeeper batter Nannapat Koncharoenkai the only one putting up a noteworthy contribution but she took 53 deliveries to make 47.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "varun_malik@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Varun Malik", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Asia_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's Asia Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamari_Athapaththu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chamari Athapaththu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishmi_Gunaratne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vishmi Gunaratne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nannapat_Koncharoenkai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nannapat Koncharoenkai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavisha_Dilhari", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kavisha Dilhari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achini_Kulasuriya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Achini Kulasuriya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugandika_Kumari", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sugandika Kumari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/IWCC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/IWCC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/olympic-12-1721837804.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759515", "eventUri": "eng-9759515", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 1458, "textEnd": 1465}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "textStart": 1683, "textEnd": 1690}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

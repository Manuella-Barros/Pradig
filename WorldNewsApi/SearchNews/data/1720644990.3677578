{"id": 231319950, "title": "The Cavs next coach should be??? You look at the list \u2013 Terry Pluto's Scribbles", "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio \u2013 The Cavs could end up with a good coach whenever they end their search to find someone to replace J.B. Bickerstaff as you read these scribbles. But let\u2019s face it, this is not an exciting group of names. Nor has anyone mentioned in connection to the Cavs even taken a team beyond the first round of the playoffs as a head coach: 1. Denver assistant David Adelman is the latest name to emerge as someone who has interviewed with the Cavs for the head coaching position. He is the son of former long-time NBA coach Rick Adelman. It appears he\u2019s at least the sixth candidate the Cavs have and/or are planning to interview. 2. Here are the others, all are currently assistant coaches: Johnnie Bryant (Knicks), Chris Quinn (Heat), Micah Nori (Timberwolves), James Borrego (Pelicans) and Kenny Atkinson (Warriors). Only Borrego and Atkinson have been NBA head coaches. 3. There could be other candidates. I like former Portland head coach Terry Stotts. I\u2019ve not heard that the Cavs have talked to him. They should. At the moment, Stotts is not with any team. Word of someone interviewing for a job comes out when the Cavs have to ask a team for permission to interview their assistant coach \u2013 as the Cavs did with six names I\u2019ve listed. Stotts is 66. It\u2019s been three years since he was a head coach. If the Cavs want to talk to him \u2013 just pick up the phone and call. 4. A while ago, Cleveland.com\u2019s excellent NBA writer Chris Fedor reported the Cavs planned to interview as many as 10 head coaching candidates. Last week, I reported how an NBA executive told me that some teams talk to multiple candidates not only looking for a head coach right now, but also one down the line. Teams also use this to look at future assistant coach candidates. They pick the brains of candidates about how they\u2019d coach the Cavs. It\u2019s a lot of information gathering, even if some candidates aren\u2019t serious contenders for the job. 5. Another executive mentioned teams will talk to a candidate as a favor to an agent, allowing his client to be associated with a head coaching search. Executives and agents do favors for each other. It\u2019s part of the business. An agent also will say, \u201cLook, just talk to my guy. He might surprise you.\u201d 6. Because the Lakers are the only other team looking for a head coach, the Cavs can take their time. Reports have UConn Coach Dan Hurley and former NBA player JJ Redick as the finalists for the Lakers. It seems the Lakers want Hurley, who won back-to-back NCAA titles but has never been in the NBA. Redick played 15 seasons but has never coached. He is doing the NBA Finals as part of ABC\u2019s broadcasting team with Doris Burke and Mike Breen. 7. Several of the Cavs coaching candidates did talk to the Lakers. One report said former Charlotte coach James Borrego was interviewed twice by the Lakers. The Lakers like big names, and that\u2019s why Hurley could be their guy. He is the hottest college coach. 8. The Lakers have been through six coaches in the 13 seasons since Phil Jackson left in 2011. No coach has lasted more than three years. Two former Cavs head coaches are in the fired by Lakers list: Mike Brown and Byron Scott. Current Cavs assistant Luke Walton also coached the Lakers for three years. Here are three others who passed through L.A. in that span: Mike D\u2019Antoni, Frank Vogel and Darvin Ham. 9. Does this sound confusing? Well, it does to me. That\u2019s not a knock on the Cavs. It\u2019s what happens when a team fires a solid coach such as Bickerstaff and then looks for a new coach when there aren\u2019t any obvious strong candidates. It\u2019s why I kept writing, \u201cIf not Bickerstaff, then who?\u201d even before he was fired. 10. I talked to a few NBA people who really like Atkinson and believe the former Brooklyn head coach could end up with the Cavs job. They praised his work ethic, his ability to put together creative offenses and believe he\u2019d have the respect of the players. He\u2019s currently an assistant for Golden State Coach Steve Kerr. I don\u2019t have a strong opinion about Atkinson. 11. Consider the coaches who were in the NBA\u2019s Final Four. In fact, try to name them before I do. I had to look them up. I knew Rick Carlisle (Indiana) and Joe Mazzulla (Boston). I knew Mazzulla because the Cavs just faced the Celtics in the playoffs. I have always liked Carlisle. This was his 22nd NBA season as a head coach. I forgot Jason Kidd had landed in Dallas. He previously was a head coach in Brooklyn and Milwaukee. The fourth coach? Minnesota\u2019s Chris Finch, who had been an assistant before that. 12. Frank Vogel won the 2020 NBA title with the Lakers. He was fired two years later. He was hired by Phoenix for the 2023-24 season. Vogel made the playoffs, lost in the first round and was fired again. Mike Budenholzer won the 2021 NBA title with Milwaukee. Like Vogel, he was fired after two years. He has now replaced Vogel has the head coach in Phoenix \u2026 don\u2019t ask me to explain any of this. 13. Finally, I\u2019ve received some emails from fans wanting the Cavs to make LeBron James a player/coach and then draft Bronny James to keep him happy. James doesn\u2019t want to be player/coach. Nor is that a good idea. The job is too complicated from the davs when Bill Russell was a player/coach with the Celtics in the 1960s.", "summary": "So far, six current NBA assistants have been mentioned in connection with the Cavs coaching job.", "url": "https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2024/06/the-cavs-next-coach-should-be-you-look-at-the-list-terry-plutos-scribbles.html", "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/YULMPUNHQBGLNO3ZJVSQQ3HPRY.jpg?auth=1474cade03e69121f0d0f435c3b486966669f4717213500688a45ea43448f498&width=1280&quality=90", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:51:04", "author": "Terry Pluto", "authors": ["Terry Pluto"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.092}

The distribution rate for each Fund has therefore increased by 68% since the beginning of 2024 and is the third increase in the distribution rate since the Fund was launched in July 2020.\n\nThe increase in rate will commence with the distribution payable on May 31, 2024, to all shareholders of record as of May 23, 2024 (ex-dividend date May 22, 2024). The Fund intends to maintain the increased Managed Distribution Policy rate for at least the next 12 months unless there is a significant and unforeseen change in market conditions.\n\nPayment details of the new distribution policy for the Fund is reflected in the table below.\n\nThe Fund distributes monthly all or a portion of its net investment income, including current gains, to common shareholders. The Fund relies on exemptive relief from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allows the Fund to distribute long-term capital gains as frequently as monthly in any one taxable year. The distributions for the Fund will be made from net investment income, net realized capital gains and, to any extent necessary, return of capital.\n\nFund Outlook\n\nSince its inception, ASGI has consistently demonstrated robust performance and steadfast commitment to delivering shareholder value. To date, the Fund has disbursed over $5 in dividends, a testament to its strong cash flow and prudent financial management. Moreover, the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Fund has shown growth from its initial offering, reflecting the astute investment strategies employed by our management team and the intrinsic value of our asset portfolio.\n\nAs we look to the future, our confidence in the infrastructure sector is unwavering. The long-term structural drivers shaping the industry-energy transition, digital acceleration, and increasing urbanization-present a fertile landscape for investment. These trends not only underscore the critical role of infrastructure in today's economy but also align with our strategic vision to capture growth and generate sustainable returns for our shareholders.\n\nWe believe that our focused approach to investing in high-quality infrastructure assets, coupled with our proactive asset management and strategic capital allocation, positions us well to continue delivering value and growth.\n\nLooking ahead, we remain committed to leveraging the transformative trends within the infrastructure domain to identify compelling investment opportunities. Our goal is to ensure that the ASGI fund remains at the forefront of capturing the evolving opportunities within the infrastructure sector, thereby enhancing shareholder value, and contributing to the Fund's long-term success.\n\nThe policy is expected to provide a steady and sustainable cash distribution to Fund shareholders that may help reduce the Fund's current discount to NAV. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve these results. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the distributions or the terms of the Fund's policy.\n\nIRS and SEC Distribution Disclosure\n\nUnder U.S. tax rules applicable to the Fund, the amount and character of distributable income for each fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year. However, under Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"), and related Rules, the Fund may be required to indicate to shareholders the source of certain distributions to shareholders.\n\nThe following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distributions for purposes of Section 19 of the 1940 Act and the rules adopted thereunder. The tables have been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles. The tables include estimated amounts and percentages for the current distributions to be paid as well as for the cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date, 10/01/2023 - 4/30/2024 from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital. The estimated compositions of the distributions may vary because the estimated composition may be impacted by future income, expenses and realized gains and losses on securities and currencies.\n\nWhere the estimated amounts above show a portion of the distribution to be a \"Return of Capital,\" it means that Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all the money that you invested in a Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\"\n\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions for the current year will only be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. After the end of each calendar year, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to shareholders for the prior calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\nThe following table provides the Fund's total return performance based on net asset value (NAV) over various time periods compared to the Fund's annualized and cumulative distribution rates.\n\nReturn data is net of all Fund expenses and fees and assumes the reinvestment of all distributions reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nBased on the Fund's NAV as of April 30, 2024.\n\nThe Fund launched within the past 5 years; the performance and distribution rate information presented reflects data from inception (July 29, 2020) through April 30, 2024.\n\nAt the end of each calendar year, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to shareholders, which will state the amount and composition of the Fund's distributions and provide information with respect to their appropriate tax treatment for the prior calendar year. You should not draw any conclusions about any of the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the distributions.\n\nWhile NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.\n\nPursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Fund may distribute any long-term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in Section 19(b) under the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder. Therefore, distributions paid by the Fund during the year may include net income, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains and/or a return of capital. Net income dividends and short-term capital gain dividends, while generally taxable at ordinary income rates, may be eligible, to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the Fund, to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long-term capital gains. Distributions made in any calendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net capital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of undistributed earnings and profits, and then as a return of capital that reduces the adjusted basis in the shares held. To the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held, capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the terms of the distribution policy. The final determination of the source of all distributions will be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\nThe payment of distributions in accordance with the Stable Distribution Plan may result in a decrease in the Fund's net assets. A decrease in the Fund's net assets may cause an increase in the Fund's annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the Fund's market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the Fund's net asset value per share. The Stable Distribution Plan may also negatively affect the Fund's investment activities to the extent that the Fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the Fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold, for the purpose of paying the distribution. The Fund's Board of Trustees has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the Stable Distribution Plan at any time. The amendment, suspension or termination of the Stable Distribution Plan may affect the Fund's market price per share. Investors should consult their tax advisor regarding federal, state, and local tax considerations that may be applicable in their particular circumstances.\n\nThe amounts and sources of distributions for tax reporting purposes will depend on the Fund's investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund is subject to U.S. corporate, tax, and securities laws. Under U.S. tax accounting rules, the amount of distributable income for each fiscal year depends on the dividend and interest income received, the actual exchange rates during the entire year between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the Fund assets are denominated, and on the aggregate gains and losses realized by the Fund during the entire year. Therefore, the exact amount of distributable income for each fiscal year can only be determined as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year, September 30. However, under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, the Fund is required to estimate and disclose the source of each distribution to shareholders. This estimated distribution composition may vary from quarter to quarter because it may be materially impacted by future realized gains and losses on securities and fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which Fund assets are denominated. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\nCircular 230 disclosure: To ensure compliance with requirements imposed by the U.S. Treasury, we inform you that any U.S. tax advice contained in this communication (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding penalties under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein.\n\nIn the United States, abrdn is the marketing name for the following affiliated, registered investment advisers: abrdn Inc., abrdn Investments Limited, abrdn Asia Limited, abrdn Private Equity (Europe) Limited, and abrdn ETFs Advisors LLC.\n\nClosed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges.

These dates apply to the Funds listed below with the exception of the abrdn Australia Equity Fund, Inc. (IAF) and the abrdn Japan Equity Fund, Inc. (JEQ) which will pay on June 28, 2024, to all shareholders of record as of May 23, 2024 (ex-dividend date May 22, 2024).\n\nFor the abrdn Australia Equity Fund, Inc. (\"IAF\") and the abrdn Japan Equity Fund, Inc. (\"JEQ\"), this stock distribution will automatically be paid in newly issued shares of the Fund unless otherwise instructed by the shareholder. Shares of common stock will be issued at the lower of the net asset value (\"NAV\") per share or the market price per share with a floor for the NAV of not less than 95% of the market price. The valuation date for this stock distribution is June 18, 2024. Fractional shares will generally be settled in cash, except for registered shareholders with book entry accounts at Computershare Investor Services who will have whole and fractional shares added to their account.\n\nShareholders may request to be paid their quarterly distributions in cash instead of shares of common stock by providing advance notice to the bank, brokerage or nominee who holds their shares if the shares are in \"street name,\" or by filling out in advance an election card received from Computershare Investor Services if the shares are in registered form. To receive the quarterly distribution payable in June 2024 in cash instead of shares of common stock, the bank, brokerage or nominee who holds the shares must advise the Depository Trust Company as to the full and fractional shares for which they want the distribution paid in cash by June 17, 2024, and written notification for the election of cash by registered shareholders must be received by Computershare Investor Services prior to June 17, 2024.\n\nEach Fund has adopted a distribution policy to provide investors with a stable distribution out of current income, supplemented by realized capital gains and, to the extent necessary, paid-in capital in reliance on an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nUnder applicable U.S. tax rules, the amount and character of distributable income for each Fund's fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year. However, under Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\") and related rules, the Funds may be required to indicate to shareholders the estimated source of certain distributions to shareholders.\n\nThe following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distributions for purposes of Section 19 of the 1940 Act and the rules adopted thereunder. The tables have been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles. The tables include estimated amounts and percentages for the current distributions to be paid as well as for the cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date, from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital. The estimated compositions of the distributions may vary because the estimated composition may be impacted by future income, expenses and realized gains and losses on securities and currencies.\n\nThe Funds' estimated sources of the current distributions to be paid and for its current fiscal year to date are as follows:\n\n** THQ and THW have a 9/30 fiscal year end. IAF and JEQ have a 10/31 fiscal year end.\n\nWhere the estimated amounts above show a portion of the distribution to be a \"Return of Capital,\" it means that Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital.

A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\"\n\nAs of May 9, 2024, after giving effect to this payment, THW estimates it has a net deficit of $11,103,594. A net deficit results when the Fund has net unrealized losses that are in excess of any net realized gains that have not yet been distributed.\n\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions for the current year will only be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations.

The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.\n\nPursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Funds may distribute any long-term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in Section 19(b) under the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder. Therefore, distributions paid by the Funds during the year may include net income, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains and/or a return of capital. Net income dividends and short-term capital gain dividends, while generally taxable at ordinary income rates, may be eligible, to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the Funds, to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long-term capital gains.

The distribution rate for each Fund has therefore increased by 50% since the beginning of 2024.\n\nThe increased rate for both Funds will commence with the distributions payable on June 28, 2024, to all shareholders of record as of May 23, 2024 (ex-dividend date May 22, 2024). The Funds each intend to maintain the increased Managed Distribution Policy for at least the next 12 months unless there is significant and unforeseen change in market conditions.\n\nPayment details of the new distribution policy for each of the Funds are reflected in the table below.\n\nHQL and HQH distribute quarterly all or a portion of its net investment income, including current gains, to common shareholders. Each Fund relies on exemptive relief from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allows the Fund to distribute long-term capital gains as frequently as monthly in any one taxable year. The distributions for each Fund will be made from net investment income, net realized capital gains and, to any extent necessary, return of capital.\n\nPursuant to their existing elective stock distribution policies, HQH and HQL distributions will automatically be paid in newly issued shares of the respective Fund unless otherwise instructed by the shareholder. Shares of common stock will be issued at the lower of the net asset value (\"NAV\") per share or the market price per share with a floor for the NAV of not less than 95% of the market price. The valuation date for this stock distribution is June 18, 2024. Fractional shares will generally be settled in cash, except for registered shareholders with book entry accounts at Computershare Investor Services who will have whole and fractional shares added to their account.\n\nShareholders may request to be paid their quarterly distributions in cash instead of shares of common stock by providing advance notice to the bank, brokerage or nominee who holds their shares if the shares are in \"street name,\" or by filling out in advance an election card received from Computershare Investor Services if the shares are in registered form. To receive the quarterly distribution payable in June 2024 in cash instead of shares of common stock, the bank, brokerage or nominee who holds the shares must advise the Depository Trust Company as to the full and fractional shares for which they want the distribution paid in cash by June 17, 2024, and written notification for the election of cash by registered shareholders must be received by Computershare Investor Services prior to June 17, 2024.\n\nMarket Outlook\n\nIn approving the increase in distribution rates, the Boards of Trustees considered, among other things, each Fund's strong long term positive total return and the Investment Adviser's outlook on the healthcare sector. The Investment Adviser is optimistic about the prospects of healthcare and biotechnology investment in any reasonable timeframe given the underpinning of a strong fundamental technological and demographic backdrop. The US population is aging with individuals spending more on healthcare as they get older. Simultaneously, innovation continues in many areas of medicine as evidenced by the number of new scientific papers published, clinical trials undertaken and novel products addressing unmet medical needs approved by regulatory agencies worldwide. The Investment Advisers believe this combination of factors bodes well for the healthcare sector over the intermediate and long term.\n\nAfter a prolonged period of muted returns in the sector, merger and acquisition activity has picked up, clinical trial successes are happening, and specific novel products are being approved. The phenomenal success and impact of the recently approved GLP-1 product group on obesity and diabetes and an indication of the prospect and potential impact of the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors on human health and wellbeing. Furthermore, the macroeconomic environment appears to us to be directionally improving. Interest rate increases, which had a negative effect on growth related sectors like biotechnology appear to have peaked followed by the prospect of potential rate cuts which we expect to would provide a tailwind to the sector. The Funds are poised to take advantage of these trends.\n\nEach Fund's policy is expected to provide a steady and sustainable cash distribution to Fund shareholders that may help reduce the Fund's current discount to NAV. There is no assurance that a Fund will achieve these results. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about each Fund's investment performance from the amount of the distributions or the terms of the Fund's policy.\n\nIRS and SEC Distribution Disclosure\n\nUnder applicable U.S. tax rules, the amount and character of distributable income for each Fund's fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year. However, under Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\") and related rules, the Funds may be required to indicate to shareholders the estimated source of certain distributions to shareholders.\n\nThe following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distributions for purposes of Section 19 of the 1940 Act and the rules adopted thereunder. The tables have been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles. The tables include estimated amounts and percentages for the current distributions paid this month as well as for the cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date, from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital. The estimated compositions of the distributions may vary because the estimated composition may be impacted by future income, expenses and realized gains and losses on securities and currencies.\n\nThe Funds' estimated sources of the current distribution paid this month and for its current fiscal year to date are as follows:\n\nWhere the estimated amounts above show a portion of the distribution to be a \"Return of Capital,\" it means that Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all the money that you invested in a Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\"\n\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions for the current year will only be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. After the end of each calendar year, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to shareholders for the prior calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\nThe following table provides the Funds' total return performance based on net asset value (NAV) over various time periods compared to the Funds' annualized and cumulative distribution rates.\n\nReturn data is net of all fund expenses and fees and assumes the reinvestment of all distributions reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nBased on the Fund's NAV as of April 30, 2024.\n\nShareholders should not draw any conclusions about a Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's current distributions or from the terms of the distribution policy (the \"Distribution Policy\").\n\nWhile NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.\n\nPursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Funds may distribute any long-term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in Section 19(b) under the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder. Therefore, distributions paid by the Funds during the year may include net income, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains and/or a return of capital. Net income dividends and short-term capital gain dividends, while generally taxable at ordinary income rates, may be eligible, to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the Funds, to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long-term capital gains. Distributions made in any calendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net capital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of undistributed earnings and profits, and then as a return of capital that reduces the adjusted basis in the shares held. To the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held, capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received.\n\nThe payment of distributions in accordance with the Distribution Policy may result in a decrease in a Fund's net assets. A decrease in a Fund's net assets may cause an increase in the Fund's annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the Fund's market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the Fund's net asset value per share. The Distribution Policy may also negatively affect a Fund's investment activities to the extent that the Fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the Fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold, for the purpose of paying the distribution. Each Fund's Board has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the Distribution Policy at any time. The amendment, suspension or termination of the Distribution Policy may affect a Fund's market price per share. Investors should consult their tax advisor regarding federal, state, and local tax considerations that may be applicable in their particular circumstances.\n\nThe amounts and sources of distributions for tax reporting purposes will depend on each Fund's investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. Each Fund is subject to U.S. corporate, tax, and securities laws. Under U.S. tax accounting rules, the amount of distributable income for each fiscal year depends on the dividend and interest income received, the actual exchange rates during the entire year between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the Funds' assets are denominated, and on the aggregate gains and losses realized by the Fund during the entire year. Therefore, the exact amount of distributable income for each fiscal year can only be determined as of the end of each Fund's fiscal year, September 30. However, under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, the Funds are required to estimate and disclose the source of each distribution to shareholders. This estimated distribution composition may vary from distribution to distribution because it may be materially impacted by future realized gains and losses on securities and fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which Funds assets are denominated. Each Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\nCircular 230 disclosure: To ensure compliance with requirements imposed by the U.S. Treasury, we inform you that any U.S. tax advice contained in this communication (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding penalties under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein.\n\nIn the United States, abrdn is the marketing name for the following affiliated, registered investment advisers: abrdn Inc., abrdn Investments Limited, abrdn Asia Limited, abrdn Private Equity (Europe) Limited, and abrdn ETFs Advisors LLC.\n\nClosed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges.

These dates apply to the Funds listed below with the exception of the abrdn Australia Equity Fund, Inc. (IAF) and the abrdn Japan Equity Fund, Inc. (JEQ) which will pay on June 28, 2024, to all shareholders of record as of May 23, 2024 (ex-dividend date May 22, 2024).\n\nAt the end of each calendar year, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to shareholders, which will state the amount and composition of each fund's distributions and provide information with respect to their appropriate tax treatment for the prior calendar year. You should not draw any conclusions about any of these Funds' investment performance from the amount of the distributions.\n\nThe above-noted abrdn U.S. Closed-End Funds (the \"Funds\" or individually the \"Fund\"), today announced that the Funds will pay the distributions noted in the chart above on May 31, 2024, on a per share basis to all shareholders of record as of May 23, 2024 (ex-dividend date May 22, 2024). These dates apply to the Funds listed below with the exception of the abrdn Australia Equity Fund, Inc. (IAF) and the abrdn Japan Equity Fund, Inc. (JEQ) which will pay on June 28, 2024, to all shareholders of record as of May 23, 2024 (ex-dividend date May 22, 2024).\n\nFor the abrdn Australia Equity Fund, Inc. (\"IAF\") and the abrdn Japan Equity Fund, Inc. (\"JEQ\"), this stock distribution will automatically be paid in newly issued shares of the Fund unless otherwise instructed by the shareholder. Shares of common stock will be issued at the lower of the net asset value (\"NAV\") per share or the market price per share with a floor for the NAV of not less than 95% of the market price. The valuation date for this stock distribution is June 18, 2024. Fractional shares will generally be settled in cash, except for registered shareholders with book entry accounts at Computershare Investor Services who will have whole and fractional shares added to their account.\n\nShareholders may request to be paid their quarterly distributions in cash instead of shares of common stock by providing advance notice to the bank, brokerage or nominee who holds their shares if the shares are in \"street name,\" or by filling out in advance an election card received from Computershare Investor Services if the shares are in registered form. To receive the quarterly distribution payable in June 2024 in cash instead of shares of common stock, the bank, brokerage or nominee who holds the shares must advise the Depository Trust Company as to the full and fractional shares for which they want the distribution paid in cash by June 17, 2024, and written notification for the election of cash by registered shareholders must be received by Computershare Investor Services prior to June 17, 2024.\n\nEach Fund has adopted a distribution policy to provide investors with a stable distribution out of current income, supplemented by realized capital gains and, to the extent necessary, paid-in capital in reliance on an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nUnder applicable U.S. tax rules, the amount and character of distributable income for each Fund's fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year. However, under Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\") and related rules, the Funds may be required to indicate to shareholders the estimated source of certain distributions to shareholders.\n\nThe following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distributions for purposes of Section 19 of the 1940 Act and the rules adopted thereunder. The tables have been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles. The tables include estimated amounts and percentages for the current distributions to be paid as well as for the cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date, from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital. The estimated compositions of the distributions may vary because the estimated composition may be impacted by future income, expenses and realized gains and losses on securities and currencies.\n\nThe Funds' estimated sources of the current distributions to be paid and for its current fiscal year to date are as follows:\n\n** THQ and THW have a 9/30 fiscal year end. IAF and JEQ have a 10/31 fiscal year end.\n\nWhere the estimated amounts above show a portion of the distribution to be a \"Return of Capital,\" it means that Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all the money that you invested in a Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\"\n\nAs of May 9, 2024, after giving effect to this payment, THW estimates it has a net deficit of $11,103,594. A net deficit results when the Fund has net unrealized losses that are in excess of any net realized gains that have not yet been distributed.\n\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions for the current year will only be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. After the end of each calendar year, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to shareholders for the prior calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\nThe following table provides the Funds' total return performance based on net asset value (NAV) over various time periods compared to the Funds' annualized and cumulative distribution rates.\n\nReturn data is net of all fund expenses and fees and assumes the reinvestment of all distributions reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nBased on the Fund's NAV as of April 30, 2024.\n\nShareholders should not draw any conclusions about a Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's current distributions or from the terms of the distribution policy (the \"Distribution Policy\").\n\nWhile NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.\n\nPursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Funds may distribute any long-term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in Section 19(b) under the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder. Therefore, distributions paid by the Funds during the year may include net income, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains and/or a return of capital. Net income dividends and short-term capital gain dividends, while generally taxable at ordinary income rates, may be eligible, to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the Funds, to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long-term capital gains. Distributions made in any calendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net capital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of undistributed earnings and profits, and then as a return of capital that reduces the adjusted basis in the shares held. To the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held, capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received.\n\nThe payment of distributions in accordance with the Distribution Policy may result in a decrease in the Fund's net assets. A decrease in the Fund's net assets may cause an increase in the Fund's annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the Fund's market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the Fund's net asset value per share. The Distribution Policy may also negatively affect the Fund's investment activities to the extent that the Fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the Fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold, for the purpose of paying the distribution. Each Fund's Board has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the Distribution Policy at any time.\n\nThe amendment, suspension or termination of the Distribution Policy may affect the Fund's market price per share. Investors should consult their tax advisor regarding federal, state, and local tax considerations that may be applicable in their particular circumstances.\n\nCircular 230 disclosure: To ensure compliance with requirements imposed by the U.S. Treasury, we inform you that any U.S. tax advice contained in this communication (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding penalties under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein.\n\nIn the United States, abrdn is the marketing name for the following affiliated, registered investment advisers: abrdn Inc., abrdn Investments Limited, abrdn Asia Limited, abrdn Private Equity (Europe) Limited, and abrdn ETFs Advisors LLC.\n\nClosed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges.

The July 2024 quarterly distribution will be payable in cash to stockholders of record per the following critical dates:\n\nAs previously announced, the Board of Directors instituted a managed distribution program in accordance with its Section 19(b) exemptive order in November 2015. In adopting the program, the Fund seeks to provide a regular quarterly distribution to its common stockholders which is not dependent on the amount of income earned or capital gains realized by the Fund.\n\nInvestors should not make any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's distributions or the Fund's distribution policy. With each distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income, the Fund will issue a notice to shareholders and an accompanying press release that will provide detailed information regarding the amount and composition of the distribution and other related information. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in the notice to shareholders are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during its full fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell them how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\nThe Fund\n\nSRH Total Return Fund, Inc. is a non-diversified closed-end investment company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol \"STEW\".

In addition, in any monthly period, to maintain its declared per common share distribution amount, each Fund may distribute more or less than its net investment income during the period. In the event a Fund distributes more than its net investment income during any yearly period, such distributions may also include realized gains and/or a return of capital. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce a Fund's net asset value.\n\nIt is estimated that a portion of KTF's May distribution consists of a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a fund's investment performance and should not be confused with yield or income. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about KTF's investment performance from the amount of its monthly distribution. As required by Federal securities laws, KTF will issue a notice to its common shareholders in connection with its monthly distribution that contains information about the amount and estimated sources of the distribution and other related information.

The distribution rate for each Fund has therefore increased by 50% since the beginning of 2024.\n\nThe increased rate for both Funds will commence with the distributions payable on June 28, 2024, to all shareholders of record as of May 23, 2024 (ex-dividend date May 22, 2024). The Funds each intend to maintain the increased Managed Distribution Policy for at least the next 12 months unless there is significant and unforeseen change in market conditions.\n\nPayment details of the new distribution policy for each of the Funds are reflected in the table below.\n\nHQL and HQH distribute quarterly all or a portion of its net investment income, including current gains, to common shareholders. Each Fund relies on exemptive relief from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allows the Fund to distribute long-term capital gains as frequently as monthly in any one taxable year. The distributions for each Fund will be made from net investment income, net realized capital gains and, to any extent necessary, return of capital.\n\nPursuant to their existing elective stock distribution policies, HQH and HQL distributions will automatically be paid in newly issued shares of the respective Fund unless otherwise instructed by the shareholder. Shares of common stock will be issued at the lower of the net asset value (\"NAV\") per share or the market price per share with a floor for the NAV of not less than 95% of the market price. The valuation date for this stock distribution is June 18, 2024. Fractional shares will generally be settled in cash, except for registered shareholders with book entry accounts at Computershare Investor Services who will have whole and fractional shares added to their account.\n\nShareholders may request to be paid their quarterly distributions in cash instead of shares of common stock by providing advance notice to the bank, brokerage or nominee who holds their shares if the shares are in \"street name,\" or by filling out in advance an election card received from Computershare Investor Services if the shares are in registered form. To receive the quarterly distribution payable in June 2024 in cash instead of shares of common stock, the bank, brokerage or nominee who holds the shares must advise the Depository Trust Company as to the full and fractional shares for which they want the distribution paid in cash by June 17, 2024, and written notification for the election of cash by registered shareholders must be received by Computershare Investor Services prior to June 17, 2024.\n\nMarket Outlook\n\nIn approving the increase in distribution rates, the Boards of Trustees considered, among other things, each Fund's strong long term positive total return and the Investment Adviser's outlook on the healthcare sector. The Investment Adviser is optimistic about the prospects of healthcare and biotechnology investment in any reasonable timeframe given the underpinning of a strong fundamental technological and demographic backdrop. The US population is aging with individuals spending more on healthcare as they get older. Simultaneously, innovation continues in many areas of medicine as evidenced by the number of new scientific papers published, clinical trials undertaken and novel products addressing unmet medical needs approved by regulatory agencies worldwide. The Investment Advisers believe this combination of factors bodes well for the healthcare sector over the intermediate and long term.\n\nAfter a prolonged period of muted returns in the sector, merger and acquisition activity has picked up, clinical trial successes are happening, and specific novel products are being approved. The phenomenal success and impact of the recently approved GLP-1 product group on obesity and diabetes and an indication of the prospect and potential impact of the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors on human health and wellbeing. Furthermore, the macroeconomic environment appears to us to be directionally improving. Interest rate increases, which had a negative effect on growth related sectors like biotechnology appear to have peaked followed by the prospect of potential rate cuts which we expect to would provide a tailwind to the sector. The Funds are poised to take advantage of these trends.\n\nEach Fund's policy is expected to provide a steady and sustainable cash distribution to Fund shareholders that may help reduce the Fund's current discount to NAV. There is no assurance that a Fund will achieve these results. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about each Fund's investment performance from the amount of the distributions or the terms of the Fund's policy.\n\nIRS and SEC Distribution Disclosure\n\nUnder applicable U.S. tax rules, the amount and character of distributable income for each Fund's fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year. However, under Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\") and related rules, the Funds may be required to indicate to shareholders the estimated source of certain distributions to shareholders.\n\nThe following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distributions for purposes of Section 19 of the 1940 Act and the rules adopted thereunder. The tables have been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles. The tables include estimated amounts and percentages for the current distributions paid this month as well as for the cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date, from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital. The estimated compositions of the distributions may vary because the estimated composition may be impacted by future income, expenses and realized gains and losses on securities and currencies.\n\nThe Funds' estimated sources of the current distribution paid this month and for its current fiscal year to date are as follows:\n\nWhere the estimated amounts above show a portion of the distribution to be a \"Return of Capital,\" it means that Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all the money that you invested in a Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\"\n\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions for the current year will only be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. After the end of each calendar year, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to shareholders for the prior calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\nThe following table provides the Funds' total return performance based on net asset value (NAV) over various time periods compared to the Funds' annualized and cumulative distribution rates.\n\nReturn data is net of all fund expenses and fees and assumes the reinvestment of all distributions reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nBased on the Fund's NAV as of April 30, 2024.\n\nShareholders should not draw any conclusions about a Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's current distributions or from the terms of the distribution policy (the \"Distribution Policy\").\n\nWhile NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.\n\nPursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Funds may distribute any long-term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in Section 19(b) under the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder. Therefore, distributions paid by the Funds during the year may include net income, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains and/or a return of capital. Net income dividends and short-term capital gain dividends, while generally taxable at ordinary income rates, may be eligible, to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the Funds, to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long-term capital gains. Distributions made in any calendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net capital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of undistributed earnings and profits, and then as a return of capital that reduces the adjusted basis in the shares held. To the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held, capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received.\n\nThe payment of distributions in accordance with the Distribution Policy may result in a decrease in a Fund's net assets. A decrease in a Fund's net assets may cause an increase in the Fund's annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the Fund's market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the Fund's net asset value per share. The Distribution Policy may also negatively affect a Fund's investment activities to the extent that the Fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the Fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold, for the purpose of paying the distribution. Each Fund's Board has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the Distribution Policy at any time. The amendment, suspension or termination of the Distribution Policy may affect a Fund's market price per share. Investors should consult their tax advisor regarding federal, state, and local tax considerations that may be applicable in their particular circumstances.\n\nThe amounts and sources of distributions for tax reporting purposes will depend on each Fund's investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. Each Fund is subject to U.S. corporate, tax, and securities laws. Under U.S. tax accounting rules, the amount of distributable income for each fiscal year depends on the dividend and interest income received, the actual exchange rates during the entire year between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the Funds' assets are denominated, and on the aggregate gains and losses realized by the Fund during the entire year. Therefore, the exact amount of distributable income for each fiscal year can only be determined as of the end of each Fund's fiscal year, September 30. However, under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, the Funds are required to estimate and disclose the source of each distribution to shareholders. This estimated distribution composition may vary from distribution to distribution because it may be materially impacted by future realized gains and losses on securities and fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which Funds assets are denominated. Each Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\nCircular 230 disclosure: To ensure compliance with requirements imposed by the U.S. Treasury, we inform you that any U.S. tax advice contained in this communication (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding penalties under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein.\n\nIn the United States, abrdn is the marketing name for the following affiliated, registered investment advisers: abrdn Inc., abrdn Investments Limited, abrdn Asia Limited, abrdn Private Equity (Europe) Limited, and abrdn ETFs Advisors LLC.\n\nClosed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges.

As of May 8, 2024, this increase would equate to a distribution rate on share price of 13.4%.\n\nNotably, ASGI had previously announced a 25% distribution increase in December 2023, which increased the annualized distribution rate from 7.14% to 9%. The distribution rate for each Fund has therefore increased by 68% since the beginning of 2024 and is the third increase in the distribution rate since the Fund was launched in July 2020.\n\nThe increase in rate will commence with the distribution payable on May 31, 2024, to all shareholders of record as of May 23, 2024 (ex-dividend date May 22, 2024). The Fund intends to maintain the increased Managed Distribution Policy rate for at least the next 12 months unless there is a significant and unforeseen change in market conditions.\n\nPayment details of the new distribution policy for the Fund is reflected in the table below.\n\nThe Fund distributes monthly all or a portion of its net investment income, including current gains, to common shareholders. The Fund relies on exemptive relief from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allows the Fund to distribute long-term capital gains as frequently as monthly in any one taxable year. The distributions for the Fund will be made from net investment income, net realized capital gains and, to any extent necessary, return of capital.\n\nFund Outlook\n\nSince its inception, ASGI has consistently demonstrated robust performance and steadfast commitment to delivering shareholder value. To date, the Fund has disbursed over $5 in dividends, a testament to its strong cash flow and prudent financial management. Moreover, the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Fund has shown growth from its initial offering, reflecting the astute investment strategies employed by our management team and the intrinsic value of our asset portfolio.\n\nAs we look to the future, our confidence in the infrastructure sector is unwavering. The long-term structural drivers shaping the industry-energy transition, digital acceleration, and increasing urbanization-present a fertile landscape for investment. These trends not only underscore the critical role of infrastructure in today's economy but also align with our strategic vision to capture growth and generate sustainable returns for our shareholders.\n\nWe believe that our focused approach to investing in high-quality infrastructure assets, coupled with our proactive asset management and strategic capital allocation, positions us well to continue delivering value and growth.\n\nLooking ahead, we remain committed to leveraging the transformative trends within the infrastructure domain to identify compelling investment opportunities. Our goal is to ensure that the ASGI fund remains at the forefront of capturing the evolving opportunities within the infrastructure sector, thereby enhancing shareholder value, and contributing to the Fund's long-term success.\n\nThe policy is expected to provide a steady and sustainable cash distribution to Fund shareholders that may help reduce the Fund's current discount to NAV. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve these results. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the distributions or the terms of the Fund's policy.\n\nIRS and SEC Distribution Disclosure\n\nUnder U.S. tax rules applicable to the Fund, the amount and character of distributable income for each fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year. However, under Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"), and related Rules, the Fund may be required to indicate to shareholders the source of certain distributions to shareholders.\n\nThe following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distributions for purposes of Section 19 of the 1940 Act and the rules adopted thereunder. The tables have been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles. The tables include estimated amounts and percentages for the current distributions to be paid as well as for the cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date, 10/01/2023 - 4/30/2024 from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital. The estimated compositions of the distributions may vary because the estimated composition may be impacted by future income, expenses and realized gains and losses on securities and currencies.\n\nWhere the estimated amounts above show a portion of the distribution to be a \"Return of Capital,\" it means that Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all the money that you invested in a Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\"\n\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions for the current year will only be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. After the end of each calendar year, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to shareholders for the prior calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\nThe following table provides the Fund's total return performance based on net asset value (NAV) over various time periods compared to the Fund's annualized and cumulative distribution rates.\n\nReturn data is net of all Fund expenses and fees and assumes the reinvestment of all distributions reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nBased on the Fund's NAV as of April 30, 2024.\n\nThe Fund launched within the past 5 years; the performance and distribution rate information presented reflects data from inception (July 29, 2020) through April 30, 2024.\n\nAt the end of each calendar year, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to shareholders, which will state the amount and composition of the Fund's distributions and provide information with respect to their appropriate tax treatment for the prior calendar year. You should not draw any conclusions about any of the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the distributions.\n\nWhile NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.\n\nPursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Fund may distribute any long-term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in Section 19(b) under the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder. Therefore, distributions paid by the Fund during the year may include net income, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains and/or a return of capital. Net income dividends and short-term capital gain dividends, while generally taxable at ordinary income rates, may be eligible, to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the Fund, to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long-term capital gains. Distributions made in any calendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net capital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of undistributed earnings and profits, and then as a return of capital that reduces the adjusted basis in the shares held. To the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held, capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the terms of the distribution policy. The final determination of the source of all distributions will be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\nThe payment of distributions in accordance with the Stable Distribution Plan may result in a decrease in the Fund's net assets. A decrease in the Fund's net assets may cause an increase in the Fund's annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the Fund's market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the Fund's net asset value per share. The Stable Distribution Plan may also negatively affect the Fund's investment activities to the extent that the Fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the Fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold, for the purpose of paying the distribution. The Fund's Board of Trustees has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the Stable Distribution Plan at any time. The amendment, suspension or termination of the Stable Distribution Plan may affect the Fund's market price per share. Investors should consult their tax advisor regarding federal, state, and local tax considerations that may be applicable in their particular circumstances.\n\nThe amounts and sources of distributions for tax reporting purposes will depend on the Fund's investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund is subject to U.S. corporate, tax, and securities laws. Under U.S. tax accounting rules, the amount of distributable income for each fiscal year depends on the dividend and interest income received, the actual exchange rates during the entire year between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the Fund assets are denominated, and on the aggregate gains and losses realized by the Fund during the entire year. Therefore, the exact amount of distributable income for each fiscal year can only be determined as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year, September 30. However, under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, the Fund is required to estimate and disclose the source of each distribution to shareholders. This estimated distribution composition may vary from quarter to quarter because it may be materially impacted by future realized gains and losses on securities and fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which Fund assets are denominated. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\nCircular 230 disclosure: To ensure compliance with requirements imposed by the U.S. Treasury, we inform you that any U.S. tax advice contained in this communication (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding penalties under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein.\n\nIn the United States, abrdn is the marketing name for the following affiliated, registered investment advisers: abrdn Inc., abrdn Investments Limited, abrdn Asia Limited, abrdn Private Equity (Europe) Limited, and abrdn ETFs Advisors LLC.\n\nClosed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges.

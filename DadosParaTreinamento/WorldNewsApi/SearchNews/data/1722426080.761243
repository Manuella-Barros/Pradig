{"id": 243289070, "title": "Report: &#8216;No one&#8217; expects Alex Cora to be back with Red Sox in 2025", "text": "It seems increasingly likely that Alex Cora\u2019s days with the Red Sox are numbered. Questions about the Boston manager\u2019s future have swirled all season, given that he\u2019s coaching out the final year of his deal without an extension. And apparently, among MLB insiders its widely believed Cora will not return to the Red Sox in 2025, according to the New York Post\u2019s Jon Heyman. Heyman gave his midseason awards in the MLB on Friday, tabbing Cora as his third best manager in the American League. Along with that, he noted that \u201cno one thinks he\u2019ll be back in Boston.\u201d Cora has managed one of his better seasons at the helm in Boston, taking a team with low expectations and riddled with injuries back into the AL playoff hunt. Boston got handed a 9-2 loss by the San Diego Padres on Friday, but is still 43-38 on the season and one game out of the final wildcard spot, currently held by the Kansas City Royals. As for Cora\u2019s future, though nothing is set in stone, the veteran bench boss will likely have his share of suitors if he parts ways with the Red Sox. Especially considering the work he\u2019s done in 2024. According to Ken Rosenthal, Boston\u2019s No. 1 rival, the New York Yankees, could be in play to land Cora if they decide to fire Aaron Boone. The Dodgers were also listed by Rosenthal as a team to watch, which would reunite Cora and Mookie Betts in Los Angeles.", "summary": "<p>According to MLB insider Jon Heyman, Boston will be searching for a new manager after this season.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2024/06/28/mlb-rumors-alex-cora-manager-red-sox-reports/\">Report: &#8216;No one&#8217; expects Alex Cora to be back with Red Sox in 2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2024/06/28/mlb-rumors-alex-cora-manager-red-sox-reports/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Red_Sox_White_Sox_Baseball_71658-667f794a95ce4-scaled-e1719630181913-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:13:14", "author": "Colin McCarthy", "authors": ["Colin McCarthy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.367}

We've had a very constructive meeting with the President.\n\n\"We, the Patriots, and I believe you know what the Patriots are. The Patriots are a nonpartisan group of eminent Nigerians, some call it, leaders of thought, who are committed to the unity of our country and good governance of our country under a legitimate people's democratic constitution.\n\n\"So, we came to convey this view that Nigeria needs a people's democratic constitution.\n\n\"Nigeria, as we affirmed to Mr. President, is a pluralistic country. And you all know that pluralistic countries exist all over the world. Those of them that addressed their pluralism by having true federal constitutions have survived. Examples are India and Canada.\n\n\"But those pluralistic countries that failed to address their basic challenge of pluralism through federal constitutions have ended up disintegrating. Examples of that are Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia and here in Africa, Sudan.\"\n\nThe former Commonwealth Secretary-General said countries existed in the case of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia for about 100 years as one country, but they eventually disintegrated because they could not manage their pluralism through truly federal constitutions.\n\nHis words: \"We put some proposals to Mr. President and we urged him to send a President's executive bill to the National Assembly, a bill that will call for two essential measures.\n\n\"One, the convening of a National Constituent Assembly, to be mandated to produce a new draft constitution. We suggested that such National Constituent Assembly should consist of individuals elected by the people on a non-party basis.\n\n\"For example, three individuals per state, per each of the 36 states and one from the Federal Capital Territory, and they should be mandated to produce a new draft constitution. We also suggested that in the bill, the National Assembly should be asked to legislate for a national referendum because, as our laws stand at the moment, we have no provision for a national referendum.\n\n\"We concluded by saying that the Draft Constitution to emerge from the constituent assembly should be subjected to the national referendum in order to give the peoples of Nigeria a chance to determine the new constitution.\"\n\nOn the #EndBadGovernance protest, Anyaoku said the group urged President Tinubu and other tiers of government to dialogue with the leaders of the aggrieved citizens.\n\n\"We advised the President that, in our view, the government at the federal and state levels should dialogue with the leaders of the protests. The government should take the initiative in dialoguing with the leaders of the protests.\n\n\"Secondly, we advised that the law enforcement agencies, namely the police and the army, should avoid using lethal weapons in the management of the protests, so that we do not have casualties, people killed because the law and order enforcement agencies are managing the protests,\" Anyaoku told State House Correspondents.\n\nAmong members of the group were Chief Kanu Agabi, Segun Osoba, Mike Ozekhome, Labaran Maku, Ben Obi, Shehu Sani, Pauline Tallen, Olawale Okunniyi (General Secretary), Annekio

priority of his administration.\n\nHe also said their request for convening of a constituent assembly with a mandate to draft a new constitution will be reviewed.\n\nPresident Tinubu made the declaration when he received members of the group led by Chief Emeka Anyaoku, former Commonwealth Secretary-General, at the State House, Abuja on Friday.\n\nChief Anyaoku, speaking on behalf of The Patriots, appealed to the President to send an executive bill to the National Assembly, proposing two measures:\n\n\"'The convening of a national constituent assembly with the mandate to produce a draft people's democratic constitution.\n\n\"The constituent assembly should be of directly elected individuals, on a non-political basis, from the 36 states of the federation, possibly three individuals per state, and one from the FCT.\n\n\"They should be assisted by seven constitutional lawyers, one drawn from each of the six geo-political zones and the FCT.\n\n\"The deliberations of the constituent assembly should take into full account the 1960/63 constitutions, as well as the recommendations of the 2014 National Conference and indeed of the various national conferences that considered the Nigerian constitutions.\"\n\nChief Anyaoku also said The Patriots requested legislating for a national plebiscite to which the draft constitution emerging from the constituent assembly should be subjected.\n\n\"The draft constitution, produced by the constituent assembly, should be put to a national referendum and if approved, should then be signed by the President as the genuine Nigerian people's constitution,\" he said.\n\nResponding to these requests, the President expressed his respect for The Patriots and their contributions to national discourse.\n\nTinubu said: \"I have listened to you carefully, and this is not a group that I can ignore.\n\n\"This is a group of patriots reflecting the heart and aspirations of society.\n\n\"I thank all of you for being here.\n\n\"I have faced the challenge of this democracy that I inherited from your struggles.\n\n\"I must recognise the fact that these challenges are most required for good governance.\n\n\"We have no other

to referendum and that should lead to constitutional measures that will fit our diversity and governance so that we avoid conflicts and break-ups.\n\n\"I believe in the unity of this country and I want to assure you that whatever is necessary to put happiness and good governance in the hands of all Nigerians is what I would do.\"\n\nPresident Tinubu also noted that the clamour for constitutional reforms is a longstanding issue in national discourse.\n\nHe acknowledged the examples presented by the Patriots on pluralistic countries, such as Canada and India, which have maintained unity by addressing their diversity through their constitutions.\n\nHe added: \"The avoidance of chaos is necessary to build this country and move its aspirations forward for the benefit of all of us.\n\n\"I am currently preoccupied with economic reform.\n\n\"That is my first priority.\n\n\"Once this is in place, as soon as possible, I will look at other options, including constitutional review as recommended by you and other options.\"\n\nPresident Tinubu also used the occasion to pay glowing tribute to the founding Chairman of The Patriots, Chief Rotimi Williams (SAN), and Prof. Ben Nwabueze, who succeeded him.\n\nDescribing both men and other members of The Patriot as strong believers in Nigeria, the President said the question on the minds of many Nigerians is: \"How will Nigeria be governed constitutionally, legitimately without unnecessary aches and pains of its diversity and this needs to be addressed constitutionally, so that we can build a nation that we can proudly hand over a banner without stain to our children.\"\n\nPresident Tinubu told Chief Anyaoku that he would be invited again for a more detailed conversation on the submissions of The Patriot.\n\nHe said: \"As you present this, just believe that it will be reviewed, and I commit myself to the belief that you want a stable and prosperous Nigeria.\"\n\nIn his remarks, Chief Anyaoku said The Patriots organised a well-attended colloquium in March 2024, where it was unanimously agreed that Nigeria needs a new people's constitution.\n\nChief Anyaoku expressed confidence in Tinubu's ability to lead the constitutional transformation, citing his personal record as one of the greatest champions of Nigeria's struggle for democracy.", "source": {"uri": "theeagleonline.com.ng",

The constituent assembly should be of directly elected individuals, on a non-political basis, from the 36 states of the federation, possibly three individuals per state, and one from the FCT.\n\n\"They should be assisted by seven constitutional lawyers, one drawn from each of the six geo-political zones and the FCT. The deliberations of the constituent assembly should take into full account the 1960/63 constitutions, as well as the recommendations of the 2014 National Conference and indeed of the various national conferences that considered the Nigerian constitutions.\"\n\nAnyaoku also said the Patriots requested legislating for a national plebiscite to which the draft constitution emerging from the constituent assembly should be subjected.\n\n\"The draft constitution, produced by the constituent assembly, should be put to a national referendum and if approved, should then be signed by the President as the genuine Nigerian people's constitution,\" he said.\n\nResponding to these requests, the President expressed his respect for The Patriots and their contributions to national discourse.\n\n\"I have listened to you carefully, and this is not a group that I can ignore. This is a group of patriots reflecting the heart and aspirations of society. I thank all of you for being here.\n\n\"I have faced the challenge of this democracy that I inherited from your struggles. I must recognise the fact that these challenges are most required for good governance.\n\n\"We have no other choice, and I believe also that it is most difficult to manage the twist and turns of democratic governance.\n\n\"I want to assure all of you that as I listened to your two major requests on the path to referendum and that should lead to constitutional measures that will fit our diversity and governance so that we avoid conflicts and break-ups.\n\n\"I believe in the unity of this country and I want to assure you that whatever is necessary to put happiness and good governance in the hands of all Nigerians is what I would do,\" the President said.\n\nTinubu also noted that the clamour for constitutional reforms is a longstanding issue in national discourse.\n\nHe acknowledged the examples presented by the Patriots on pluralistic countries, such as Canada and India, which have maintained unity by addressing their diversity through their constitutions.\n\n\"The avoidance of chaos is necessary to build this country and move its aspirations forward for the benefit of all of us.\n\n\"I am currently preoccupied with economic reform. That is my first priority. Once this is in place, as soon as possible, I will look at other options, including constitutional review as recommended by you and other options,\" the President said.\n\nTinubu also used the occasion to pay glowing tribute to the founding chairman of The Patriots, Chief Rotimi Williams, SAN, and Professor Ben Nwabueze, who succeeded him.\n\nDescribing both men and other members of The Patriot as strong believers in Nigeria, the President said the question on the minds of many Nigerians is: \"How will Nigeria be governed constitutionally, legitimately without unnecessary aches and pains of its diversity and this needs to be addressed constitutionally, so that we can build a nation that we can proudly hand over a banner without stain to our children,\" the President said, quoting a line from the second stanza of the National Anthem.\n\nTinubu told Chief Anyaoku that he would be invited again for a more detailed conversation on the submissions of the Patriot.\n\n\"As you present this, just believe that it will be reviewed, and I commit myself to the belief that you want a stable and prosperous Nigeria,\" President Tinubu concluded.\n\nIn his remarks, Chief Anyaoku said The Patriots organized a well-attended colloquium in March 2024, where it was unanimously agreed that Nigeria needs a new people's constitution.\n\nChief Anyaoku expressed confidence in President Tinubu's ability to lead the constitutional transformation, citing his personal record as one of the greatest champions of Nigeria's struggle for democracy.", "source": {"uri": "pmnewsnigeria.com",

The constituent assembly should be of directly elected individuals, on a non-political basis, from the 36 states of the federation, possibly three individuals per state, and one from the FCT.\n\n\"They should be assisted by seven constitutional lawyers, one drawn from each of the six geo-political zones and the FCT. The deliberations of the constituent assembly should take into full account the 1960/63 constitutions, as well as the recommendations of the 2014 National Conference and indeed of the various national conferences that considered the Nigerian constitutions.\"\n\nChief Anyaoku also said the Patriots requested legislating for a national plebiscite to which the draft constitution emerging from the constituent assembly should be subjected.\n\n\"The draft constitution, produced by the constituent assembly, should be put to a national referendum and if approved, should then be signed by the President as the genuine Nigerian people's constitution,\" he said.\n\nResponding to these requests, the President expressed his respect for The Patriots and their contributions to national discourse.\n\n\"I have listened to you carefully, and this is not a group that I can ignore. This is a group of patriots reflecting the heart and aspirations of society. I thank all of you for being here.\n\n\"I have faced the challenge of this democracy that I inherited from your struggles. I must recognise the fact that these challenges are most required for good governance.\n\n\"We have no other choice, and I believe also that it is most difficult to manage the twist and turns of democratic governance.\n\n\"I want to assure all of you that as I listened to your two major requests on the path to referendum and that should lead to constitutional measures that will fit our diversity and governance so that we avoid conflicts and break-ups.\n\n\"I believe in the unity of this country and I want to assure you that whatever is necessary to put happiness and good governance in the hands of all Nigerians is what I would do,\" the President said.\n\nPresident Tinubu also noted that the clamour for constitutional reforms is a longstanding issue in national discourse.\n\nHe acknowledged the examples presented by the Patriots on pluralistic countries, such as Canada and India, which have maintained unity by addressing their diversity through their constitutions.\n\n\"The avoidance of chaos is necessary to build this country and move its aspirations forward for the benefit of all of us.\n\n\"I am currently preoccupied with economic reform. That is my first priority. Once this is in place, as soon as possible, I will look at other options, including constitutional review as recommended by you and other options,\" the President said.\n\nPresident Tinubu also used the occasion to pay glowing tribute to the founding chairman of The Patriots, Chief Rotimi Williams, SAN, and Professor Ben Nwabueze, who succeeded him.\n\nDescribing both men and other members of The Patriot as strong believers in Nigeria, the President said the question on the minds of many Nigerians is: \"How will Nigeria be governed constitutionally, legitimately without unnecessary aches and pains of its diversity and this needs to be addressed constitutionally, so that we can build a nation that we can proudly hand over a banner without stain to our children,\" the President said, quoting a line from the second stanza of the National Anthem.\n\nPresident Tinubu told Chief Anyaoku that he would be invited again for a more detailed conversation on the submissions of the Patriot.\n\n\"As you present this, just believe that it will be reviewed, and I commit myself to the belief that you want a stable and prosperous Nigeria,\" Tinubu concluded.\n\nIn his remarks, Chief Anyaoku said The Patriots organized a well-attended colloquium in March 2024, where it was unanimously agreed that Nigeria needs a new people's constitution.\n\nChief Anyaoku expressed confidence in President Tinubu's ability to lead the constitutional transformation, citing his personal record as one of the greatest champions of Nigeria's struggle for democracy.", "source": {"uri":

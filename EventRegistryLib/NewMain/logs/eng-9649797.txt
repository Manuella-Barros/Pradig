The research team, led by the University of Zurich, examined the meat consumption patterns of more than 20,000 people from 23 countries. The findings could inform strategies for promoting plant-based and cultured meat as viable alternatives to traditional meat consumption.\n\nMen tend to eat meat more frequently than women and people in wealthier countries tend to eat more meat than people in poorer countries. Paradoxically, gender differences in meat consumption are greater in countries with higher levels of gender equality and social and economic development, according to a study led by the University of Zurich (UZH).

Men really do eat more meat than women, study says", "body": "CHICAGO -- Vacationing in Chicago this week from Europe, Jelle den Burger and Nirusa Naguleswaran grabbed a bite at the Dog House Grill: a classic Italian beef sandwich for him, grilled cheese for her.\n\nBoth think the way their genders lined up with their food choices was no coincidence. Women, said Naguleswaran, are simply more likely to ditch meat, and to care about how their diet affects the environment and other people.\n\n\"I don't want to put it in the wrong way, that male people feel attacked,\" said Naguleswaran, of Netherlands, laughing. She said she used to love eating meat, but giving it up for climate reasons was more important to her. \"We just have it in our nature to care about others.\"\n\nNow, scientists can say more confidently than ever that gender and meat-eating preferences are linked. A paper out in Nature Scientific Reports this week shows that the difference is nearly universal across cultures -- and that it's even more pronounced in countries that are more developed.\n\nResearchers already knew men in some countries ate more meat than women did. And they knew that people in wealthier countries ate more meat overall. But the latest findings suggest that when men and women have the social and financial freedom to make choices about their diets, they diverge from each other even more, with men eating more meat and women eating less.\n\nThat's important because about 20% of planet-warming global greenhouse gas emissions come from animal-based food products, according to earlier research from the University of Illinois. The researchers behind the new report think their findings could fine-tune efforts to persuade people to eat less meat and dairy.\n\n\"Anything that one could do to reduce meat consumption in men would have a greater impact, on average, than among women,\" said Christopher Hopwood, a professor of psychology at the University of Zurich and one of the authors of the paper. The work was funded by Mercy for Animals, a nonprofit dedicated to ending animal agriculture. Hopwood said he is not affiliated with the organization and is not an advocate.\n\nThe researchers asked over 28,000 people in 23 countries on four continents how much of various types of food they ate every day, then calculated the average land animal consumption by gender identity in each country. They used the United Nations Human Development Index, which measures health, education and standard of living, to rank how \"developed\" each country was, and also looked at the Global Gender Gap Index, a scale of gender equality published by the World Economic Forum.\n\nThey found that, with three exceptions -- China, India and Indonesia -- gender differences in meat consumption were higher in countries with higher development and gender equality scores.\n\nThe large number and cultural diversity of people surveyed is \"a real strength of this,\" said Daniel Rosenfeld, a social psychologist at UCLA who studies eating behavior and moral psychology and was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study did not answer the question of why men tend to eat more meat, but scientists have some theories. One is that evolutionarily, women may have been hormonally hardwired to avoid meat that could possibly have been contaminated, affecting pregnancy, whereas men may have sought out meat proteins given their history as hunters in some societies.\n\nBut even the idea of men as hunters is intertwined with culture, Rosenfeld said. That's a good example of another theory, which is that societal norms shape gender identity from an early age and thus how people decide to fill their plates.\n\nRosenfeld, who said he stopped eating meat about 10 years ago, said his own experience hanging out in college \"as a guy hanging out with other guy friends\" illustrated the cultural pressure for men to eat meat. \"If they're all eating meats and I decide not to,\" he said, \"it can disrupt the natural flow of social situations.\"\n\nThe same cultural factors that shape gender influence how people respond to new information, said Carolyn Semmler, a professor of psychology at the University of Adelaide in Australia who also studies meat eating and social factors like gender. Semmler was not involved in this study. In some of her past work, she's studied cognitive dissonance around eating meat.\n\nIn those cases, she said women presented with information about poor animal welfare in the livestock industry were more likely to say they would reduce their meat consumption. But men tended to go the other direction, she said.\n\n\"One participant said to me, 'I think you guys are trying to get me to eat less meat, so I'm going to eat more,'\" she said.\n\nSemmler said meat can be important to masculine identity, noting for example the popular notion of men at the grill. And she said presenting eating less meat as a moral cause can be a sensitive issue. Still, she said, people should be aware of how their food choices affect the planet.\n\nBut she and Hopwood acknowledged how difficult it is to change behavior.\n\n\"Men are a tough nut to crack,\" Hopwood said.\n\nJose Lopez, another diner at the Dog House Grill, said he thought men should eat less meat but said that in general he has observed otherwise.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com",

Men really do eat more meat than women, study says. - The Boston Globe", "body": "Now, scientists can say more confidently than ever that gender and meat-eating preferences are linked. A paper out in Nature Scientific Reports this week shows that the difference is nearly universal across cultures -- and that it's even more pronounced in countries that are more developed.\n\nResearchers already knew men in some countries ate more meat than women did. And they knew that people in wealthier countries ate more meat overall. But the latest findings suggest that when men and women have the social and financial freedom to make choices about their diets, they diverge from each other even more, with men eating more meat and women eating less.\n\nThat's important because about 20% of planet-warming global greenhouse gas emissions come from animal-based food products, according to earlier research from the University of Illinois. The researchers behind the new report think their findings could fine-tune efforts to persuade people to eat less meat and dairy.\n\n\"Anything that one could do to reduce meat consumption in men would have a greater impact, on average, than among women,\" said Christopher Hopwood, a professor of psychology at the University of Zurich and one of the authors of the paper. The work was funded by Mercy for Animals, a nonprofit dedicated to ending animal agriculture. Hopwood said he is not affiliated with the organization and is not an advocate.\n\nThe researchers asked over 28,000 people in 23 countries on four continents how much of various types of food they ate every day, then calculated the average land animal consumption by gender identity in each country. They used the United Nations Human Development Index, which measures health, education and standard of living, to rank how \"developed\" each country was, and also looked at the Global Gender Gap Index, a scale of gender equality published by the World Economic Forum.\n\nThey found that, with three exceptions -- China, India and Indonesia -- gender differences in meat consumption were higher in countries with higher development and gender equality scores.\n\nThe large number and cultural diversity of people surveyed is \"a real strength of this,\" said Daniel Rosenfeld, a social psychologist at UCLA who studies eating behavior and moral psychology and was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study did not answer the question of why men tend to eat more meat, but scientists have some theories. One is that evolutionarily, women may have been hormonally hardwired to avoid meat that could possibly have been contaminated, affecting pregnancy, whereas men may have sought out meat proteins given their history as hunters in some societies.\n\nBut even the idea of men as hunters is intertwined with culture, Rosenfeld said. That's a good example of another theory, which is that societal norms shape gender identity from an early age and thus how people decide to fill their plates.\n\nRosenfeld, who said he stopped eating meat about 10 years ago, said his own experience hanging out in college \"as a guy hanging out with other guy friends\" illustrated the cultural pressure for men to eat meat. \"If they're all eating meats and I decide not to,\" he said, \"it can disrupt the natural flow of social situations.\"\n\nThe same cultural factors that shape gender influence how people respond to new information, said Carolyn Semmler, a professor of psychology at the University of Adelaide in Australia who also studies meat eating and social factors like gender. Semmler was not involved in this study. In some of her past work, she's studied cognitive dissonance around eating meat.\n\nIn those cases, she said women presented with information about poor animal welfare in the livestock industry were more likely to say they would reduce their meat consumption. But men tended to go the other direction, she said.\n\n\"One participant said to me, 'I think you guys are trying to get me to eat less meat, so I'm going to eat more,'\" she said.\n\nSemmler said meat can be important to masculine identity, noting for example the popular notion of men at the grill. And she said presenting eating less meat as a moral cause can be a sensitive issue. Still, she said, people should be aware of how their food choices affect the planet.\n\nBut she and Hopwood acknowledged how difficult it is to change behavior.\n\n\"Men are a tough nut to crack,\" Hopwood said.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score":

Researchers believe it's due to men in wealthier, more gender-equal nations having more control over their meal choices -- and choosing meat more often.\n\nThe trend is \"more likely to be driven by more extensive meat consumption among men in developed countries, in which greater wealth creates more opportunities for men to choose meat, than by lower meat consumption among women,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nThe study was led by Christopher Hopwood, a professor of psychology at the University of Zurich, in Switzerland. It was published June 13 in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\nThe researchers started off with one longstanding statistic: Almost everywhere, men tend to eat more meat than women.\n\nBut would that carnivore gender gap close once women made gains in equality with respect to men?\n\nTo find out, Hopwood's team looked at survey data collected in 2021 from almost 21,000 people from 23 countries in North and South America, Europe and Asia.

Men really do eat more meat than women, study says\n\nMELINA WALLING\n\nJune 13, 2024 at 5:02 PM\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- Vacationing in Chicago this week from Europe, Jelle den Burger and Nirusa Naguleswaran grabbed a bite at the Dog House Grill: a classic Italian beef sandwich for him, grilled cheese for her.\n\nBoth think the way their genders lined up with their food choices was no coincidence. Women, said Naguleswaran, are simply more likely to ditch meat, and to care about how their diet affects the environment and other people.\n\n\"I don't want to put it in the wrong way, that male people feel attacked,\" said Naguleswaran, of Netherlands, laughing. She said she used to love eating meat, but giving it up for climate reasons was more important to her. \"We just have it in our nature to care about others.\"\n\nNow, scientists can say more confidently than ever that gender and meat-eating preferences are linked. A paper out in Nature Scientific Reports this week shows that the difference is nearly universal across cultures -- and that it's even more pronounced in countries that are more developed.\n\nResearchers already knew men in some countries ate more meat than women did. And they knew that people in wealthier countries ate more meat overall. But the latest findings suggest that when men and women have the social and financial freedom to make choices about their diets, they diverge from each other even more, with men eating more meat and women eating less.\n\nThat's important because about 20% of planet-warming global greenhouse gas emissions come from animal-based food products, according to earlier research from the University of Illinois. The researchers behind the new report think their findings could fine-tune efforts to persuade people to eat less meat and dairy.\n\n\"Anything that one could do to reduce meat consumption in men would have a greater impact, on average, than among women,\" said Christopher Hopwood, a professor of psychology at the University of Zurich and one of the authors of the paper. The work was funded by Mercy for Animals, a nonprofit dedicated to ending animal agriculture. Hopwood said he is not affiliated with the organization and is not an advocate.\n\nThe researchers asked over 28,000 people in 23 countries on four continents how much of various types of food they ate every day, then calculated the average land animal consumption by gender identity in each country. They used the United Nations Human Development Index, which measures health, education and standard of living, to rank how \"developed\" each country was, and also looked at the Global Gender Gap Index, a scale of gender equality published by the World Economic Forum.\n\nThey found that, with three exceptions -- China, India and Indonesia -- gender differences in meat consumption were higher in countries with higher development and gender equality scores.\n\nThe large number and cultural diversity of people surveyed is \"a real strength of this,\" said Daniel Rosenfeld, a social psychologist at UCLA who studies eating behavior and moral psychology and was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study did not answer the question of why men tend to eat more meat, but scientists have some theories. One is that evolutionarily, women may have been hormonally hardwired to avoid meat that could possibly have been contaminated, affecting pregnancy, whereas men may have sought out meat proteins given their history as hunters in some societies.\n\nBut even the idea of men as hunters is intertwined with culture, Rosenfeld said. That's a good example of another theory, which is that societal norms shape gender identity from an early age and thus how people decide to fill their plates.\n\nRosenfeld, who said he stopped eating meat about 10 years ago, said his own experience hanging out in college \"as a guy hanging out with other guy friends\" illustrated the cultural pressure for men to eat meat. \"If they're all eating meats and I decide not to,\" he said, \"it can disrupt the natural flow of social situations.\"\n\nThe same cultural factors that shape gender influence how people respond to new information, said Carolyn Semmler, a professor of psychology at the University of Adelaide in Australia who also studies meat eating and social factors like gender. Semmler was not involved in this study. In some of her past work, she's studied cognitive dissonance around eating meat.\n\nIn those cases, she said women presented with information about poor animal welfare in the livestock industry were more likely to say they would reduce their meat consumption. But men tended to go the other direction, she said.\n\n\"One participant said to me, 'I think you guys are trying to get me to eat less meat, so I'm going to eat more,'\" she said.\n\nSemmler said meat can be important to masculine identity, noting for example the popular notion of men at the grill. And she said presenting eating less meat as a moral cause can be a sensitive issue. Still, she said, people should be aware of how their food choices affect the planet.\n\nBut she and Hopwood acknowledged how difficult it is to change behavior.\n\n\"Men are a tough nut to crack,\" Hopwood said.\n\nJose Lopez, another diner at the Dog House Grill, said he thought men should eat less meat but said that in general he has observed otherwise.\n\n\"We're carnivores. Men eat like savages,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Melina Walling on X: @MelinaWalling.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Women, said Naguleswaran, are simply more likely to ditch meat, and to care about how their diet affects the environment and other people.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

She said she used to love eating meat, but giving it up for climate reasons was more important to her. \"We just have it in our nature to care about others.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNow, scientists can say more confidently than ever that gender and meat-eating preferences are linked. A paper out in Nature Scientific Reports this week shows that the difference is nearly universal across cultures -- and that it's even more pronounced in countries that are more developed.\n\nResearchers already knew men in some countries ate more meat than women did. And they knew that people in wealthier countries ate more meat overall. But the latest findings suggest that when men and women have the social and financial freedom to make choices about their diets, they diverge from each other even more, with men eating more meat and women eating less.\n\nThat's important because about 20% of planet-warming global greenhouse gas emissions come from animal-based food products, according to earlier research from the University of Illinois. The researchers behind the new report think their findings could fine-tune efforts to persuade people to eat less meat and dairy.\n\n\"Anything that one could do to reduce meat consumption in men would have a greater impact, on average, than among women,\" said Christopher Hopwood, a professor of psychology at the University of Zurich and one of the authors of the paper. The work was funded by Mercy for Animals, a nonprofit dedicated to ending animal agriculture. Hopwood said he is not affiliated with the organization and is not an advocate.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe researchers asked over 28,000 people in 23 countries on four continents how much of various types of food they ate every day, then calculated the average land animal consumption by gender identity in each country. They used the United Nations Human Development Index, which measures health, education and standard of living, to rank how \"developed\" each country was, and also looked at the Global Gender Gap Index, a scale of gender equality published by the World Economic Forum.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThey found that, with three exceptions -- China, India and Indonesia -- gender differences in meat consumption were higher in countries with higher development and gender equality scores.\n\nThe large number and cultural diversity of people surveyed is \"a real strength of this,\" said Daniel Rosenfeld, a social psychologist at UCLA who studies eating behavior and moral psychology and was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study did not answer the question of why men tend to eat more meat, but scientists have some theories. One is that evolutionarily, women may have been hormonally hardwired to avoid meat that could possibly have been contaminated, affecting pregnancy, whereas men may have sought out meat proteins given their history as hunters in some societies.\n\nBut even the idea of men as hunters is intertwined with culture, Rosenfeld said. That's a good example of another theory, which is that societal norms shape gender identity from an early age and thus how people decide to fill their plates.\n\nRosenfeld, who said he stopped eating meat about 10 years ago, said his own experience hanging out in college \"as a guy hanging out with other guy friends\" illustrated the cultural pressure for men to eat meat. \"If they're all eating meats and I decide not to,\" he said, \"it can disrupt the natural flow of social situations.\"\n\nThe same cultural factors that shape gender influence how people respond to new information, said Carolyn Semmler, a professor of psychology at the University of Adelaide in Australia who also studies meat eating and social factors like gender. Semmler was not involved in this study. In some of her past work, she's studied cognitive dissonance around eating meat.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn those cases, she said women presented with information about poor animal welfare in the livestock industry were more likely to say they would reduce their meat consumption. But men tended to go the other direction, she said.\n\n\"One participant said to me, 'I think you guys are trying to get me to eat less meat, so I'm going to eat more,'\" she said.\n\nSemmler said meat can be important to masculine identity, noting for example the popular notion of men at the grill. And she said presenting eating less meat as a moral cause can be a sensitive issue. Still, she said, people should be aware of how their food choices affect the planet.\n\nBut she and Hopwood acknowledged how difficult it is to change behavior.\n\n\"Men are a tough nut to crack,\" Hopwood said.\n\nJose Lopez, another diner at the Dog House Grill, said he thought men should eat less meat but said that in general he has observed otherwise.\n\n\"We're carnivores.

Men Really Do Eat More Meat Than Women, Study Says", "body": "CHICAGO (AP) -- Vacationing in Chicago this week from Europe, Jelle den Burger and Nirusa Naguleswaran grabbed a bite at the Dog House Grill: a classic Italian beef sandwich for him, grilled cheese for her.\n\nBoth think the way their genders lined up with their food choices was no coincidence. Women, said Naguleswaran, are simply more likely to ditch meat, and to care about how their diet affects the environment and other people.\n\n\"I don't want to put it in the wrong way, that male people feel attacked,\" said Naguleswaran, of Netherlands, laughing. She said she used to love eating meat, but giving it up for climate reasons was more important to her. \"We just have it in our nature to care about others.\"\n\nNow, scientists can say more confidently than ever that gender and meat-eating preferences are linked. A paper out in Nature Scientific Reports this week shows that the difference is nearly universal across cultures -- and that it's even more pronounced in countries that are more developed.\n\nResearchers already knew men in some countries ate more meat than women did. And they knew that people in wealthier countries ate more meat overall. But the latest findings suggest that when men and women have the social and financial freedom to make choices about their diets, they diverge from each other even more, with men eating more meat and women eating less.\n\nThat's important because about 20% of planet-warming global greenhouse gas emissions come from animal-based food products, according to earlier research from the University of Illinois. The researchers behind the new report think their findings could fine-tune efforts to persuade people to eat less meat and dairy.\n\n\"Anything that one could do to reduce meat consumption in men would have a greater impact, on average, than among women,\" said Christopher Hopwood, a professor of psychology at the University of Zurich and one of the authors of the paper. The work was funded by Mercy for Animals, a nonprofit dedicated to ending animal agriculture. Hopwood said he is not affiliated with the organization and is not an advocate.\n\nThe researchers asked over 28,000 people in 23 countries on four continents how much of various types of food they ate every day, then calculated the average land animal consumption by gender identity in each country. They used the United Nations Human Development Index, which measures health, education and standard of living, to rank how \"developed\" each country was, and also looked at the Global Gender Gap Index, a scale of gender equality published by the World Economic Forum.\n\nThey found that, with three exceptions -- China, India and Indonesia -- gender differences in meat consumption were higher in countries with higher development and gender equality scores.\n\nThe large number and cultural diversity of people surveyed is \"a real strength of this,\" said Daniel Rosenfeld, a social psychologist at UCLA who studies eating behavior and moral psychology and was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study did not answer the question of why men tend to eat more meat, but scientists have some theories. One is that evolutionarily, women may have been hormonally hardwired to avoid meat that could possibly have been contaminated, affecting pregnancy, whereas men may have sought out meat proteins given their history as hunters in some societies.\n\nBut even the idea of men as hunters is intertwined with culture, Rosenfeld said. That's a good example of another theory, which is that societal norms shape gender identity from an early age and thus how people decide to fill their plates.\n\nRosenfeld, who said he stopped eating meat about 10 years ago, said his own experience hanging out in college \"as a guy hanging out with other guy friends\" illustrated the cultural pressure for men to eat meat. \"If they're all eating meats and I decide not to,\" he said, \"it can disrupt the natural flow of social situations.\"\n\nThe same cultural factors that shape gender influence how people respond to new information, said Carolyn Semmler, a professor of psychology at the University of Adelaide in Australia who also studies meat eating and social factors like gender. Semmler was not involved in this study. In some of her past work, she's studied cognitive dissonance around eating meat.\n\nIn those cases, she said women presented with information about poor animal welfare in the livestock industry were more likely to say they would reduce their meat consumption. But men tended to go the other direction, she said.\n\n\"One participant said to me, 'I think you guys are trying to get me to eat less meat, so I'm going to eat more,'\" she said.\n\nSemmler said meat can be important to masculine identity, noting for example the popular notion of men at the grill. And she said presenting eating less meat as a moral cause can be a sensitive issue. Still, she said, people should be aware of how their food choices affect the planet.\n\nBut she and Hopwood acknowledged how difficult it is to change behavior.\n\n\"Men are a tough nut to crack,\" Hopwood said.\n\nJose Lopez, another diner at the Dog House Grill, said he thought men should eat less meat but said that in general he has observed otherwise.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Researchers believe it's due to men in wealthier, more gender-equal nations having more control over their meal choices -- and choosing meat more often.\n\nThe trend is \"more likely to be driven by more extensive meat consumption among men in developed countries, in which greater wealth creates more opportunities for men to choose meat, than by lower meat consumption among women,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nThe study was led by Christopher Hopwood, a professor of psychology at the University of Zurich, in Switzerland. It was published June 13 in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\nThe researchers started off with one longstanding statistic: Almost everywhere, men tend to eat more meat than women.\n\nBut would that carnivore gender gap close once women made gains in equality with respect to men?\n\nTo find out, Hopwood's team looked at survey data collected in 2021 from almost 21,000 people from 23 countries in North and South America, Europe and Asia. Participants reported their gender and how frequently they ate meat.\n\nAs expected, in most countries (with the exception of China, India and Indonesia), men ate more meat than women. And as average income levels in a country rose, so did the frequency with which both sexes chowed down on meat.\n\nMore from this section Eczema Sufferers in Edgecombe County, What if Your Salt Shaker is Making It Worse?

Dr. Explains\n\nThat makes sense, Hopwood's team said, since meat is much more expensive to produce and buy compared to plant-based fare.\n\nBut the surprising finding arose in regards to gender equality: The gap in meat consumption between men and women widened as the sexes gained parity, the study found.\n\nThe bottom line, according to the researchers, is that men and women in wealthier countries with better gender parity may tend to follow their inclinations to eat more or less meat.\n\nThe trend seems to \"have more to do with men's consumption behavior than women's,\" Hopwood and colleagues noted.\n\nThe study was funded by the nonprofit Mercy for Animals group, which seeks to end animal agriculture. Based on the new findings, Hopwood's team believe that any efforts to lower meat consumption may want to consider gender and gender identity, and \"focus on meat reduction among men.\"\n\nMore

Women, said Naguleswaran, are simply more likely to ditch meat, and to care about how their diet affects the environment and other people.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"I don't want to put it in the wrong way, that male people feel attacked,\" said Naguleswaran, of Netherlands, laughing. She said she used to love eating meat, but giving it up for climate reasons was more important to her. \"We just have it in our nature to care about others.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNow, scientists can say more confidently than ever that gender and meat-eating preferences are linked. A paper out in Nature Scientific Reports this week shows that the difference is nearly universal across cultures -- and that it's even more pronounced in countries that are more developed.\n\nResearchers already knew men in some countries ate more meat than women did. And they knew that people in wealthier countries ate more meat overall. But the latest findings suggest that when men and women have the social and financial freedom to make choices about their diets, they diverge from each other even more, with men eating more meat and women eating less.\n\nThat's important because about 20% of planet-warming global greenhouse gas emissions come from animal-based food products, according to earlier research from the University of Illinois. The researchers behind the new report think their findings could fine-tune efforts to persuade people to eat less meat and dairy.\n\n\"Anything that one could do to reduce meat consumption in men would have a greater impact, on average, than among women,\" said Christopher Hopwood, a professor of psychology at the University of Zurich and one of the authors of the paper. The work drew on surveys funded by Mercy for Animals, a nonprofit dedicated to ending animal agriculture. Hopwood said he is not affiliated with the organization and is not an advocate.\n\nThe researchers asked over 28,000 people in 23 countries on four continents how much of various types of food they ate every day, then calculated the average land animal consumption by gender identity in each country. They used the United Nations Human Development Index, which measures health, education and standard of living, to rank how \"developed\" each country was, and also looked at the Global Gender Gap Index, a scale of gender equality published by the World Economic Forum.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThey found that, with three exceptions -- China, India and Indonesia -- gender differences in meat consumption were higher in countries with higher development and gender equality scores.\n\nThe large number and cultural diversity of people surveyed is \"a real strength of this,\" said Daniel Rosenfeld, a social psychologist at UCLA who studies eating behavior and moral psychology and was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study did not answer the question of why men tend to eat more meat, but scientists have some theories. One is that evolutionarily, women may have been hormonally hardwired to avoid meat that could possibly have been contaminated, affecting pregnancy, whereas men may have sought out meat proteins given their history as hunters in some societies.\n\nBut even the idea of men as hunters is intertwined with culture, Rosenfeld said. That's a good example of another theory, which is that societal norms shape gender identity from an early age and thus how people decide to fill their plates.\n\nRosenfeld, who said he stopped eating meat about 10 years ago, said his own experience hanging out in college \"as a guy hanging out with other guy friends\" illustrated the cultural pressure for men to eat meat. \"If they're all eating meats and I decide not to,\" he said, \"it can disrupt the natural flow of social situations.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe same cultural factors that shape gender influence how people respond to new information, said Carolyn Semmler, a professor of psychology at the University of Adelaide in Australia who also studies meat eating and social factors like gender. Semmler was not involved in this study. In some of her past work, she's studied cognitive dissonance around eating meat.\n\nIn those cases, she said women presented with information about poor animal welfare in the livestock industry were more likely to say they would reduce their meat consumption. But men tended to go the other direction, she said.\n\n\"One participant said to me, 'I think you guys are trying to get me to eat less meat, so I'm going to eat more,'\" she said.\n\nSemmler said meat can be important to masculine identity, noting for example the popular notion of men at the grill. And she said presenting eating less meat as a moral cause can be a sensitive issue. Still, she said, people should be aware of how their food choices affect the planet.\n\nBut she and Hopwood acknowledged how difficult it is to change behavior.\n\n\"Men are a tough nut to crack,\" Hopwood said.\n\nJose Lopez, another diner at the Dog House Grill, said he thought men should eat less meat but said that in general he has observed otherwise.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We're carnivores.

Meat consumption is reliably higher among men than women in North American and European samples, but reasons for this difference remain unclear. Understanding this difference can shed light on how gender interacts with culture and may pave ways to reduce meat consumption and its negative impacts. We used data from 23 countries from four continents to test three competing hypotheses about gender differences in meat consumption.\n\nThe first hypothesis is that gender differences in meat consumption frequency are universal. Universalism is typically tied to arguments related to biological sex differences in dietary needs that operate independent of culture and context. For instance, Fessler argued that women experience hormonally-mediated immunosuppression during menstruation and pregnancy that leads them to avoid meat consumption. Other theorists have speculated about differential evolutionary pressures. For instance, it has been hypothesized that mean prefer meat because they are more likely to behave in a way that risks injury, and the profile of amino acids provided by animal flesh promotes muscle and bone strength that protects against injury. Similarly, evolved social norms in which men tend to be rewarded for being good hunters could have contributed to its being more valued, both in terms of taste and social status, among men.\n\nIndeed, cultural and economic dynamics have played an important role in meat consumption throughout history. In many cultures, meat consumption is linked to masculinity and masculine identity. There is evidence that vegetarian men are viewed as less attractive than omnivorous men in some cultures, demonstrating that cultural differences connect gender norms with masculinity-linked behaviors. Thus, a second hypothesis is that meat consumption frequency is influenced by cultural norms that associate meat consumption with positive traits, such as masculinity and virility for men, and thus would be higher in countries with stronger gender role norms.\n\nThe third hypothesis is less intuitive. Previous research has identified paradoxical gender effects, such that gender differences in certain psychological variables such as personality traits, interests, and self-esteem are actually greater in countries with greater gender equality. Two possible explanations have been offered for this paradoxical gender effect. First, it has been suggested that gender equality, being associated with greater wealth and increased purchasing power, provides opportunities for natural expression of certain behaviors. In this case, gender differences in meat consumption frequency would be greater in countries with greater gender equality, to the extent that there are universal differences in meat consumption preferences across genders.\n\nA second possible explanation involves reference group effects. In countries with higher gender equality, people responding to questions about themselves may be more likely to compare themselves to the general population, whereas in countries with lower gender equality, respondents may be more likely to compare themselves to others of their same gender. This would have the effect of obscuring actual gender differences in less gender-equal countries. Given that the frequency of meat consumption is a more behavioral criterion than those for which paradoxical gender effects have been observed, such as self-reported personality traits, interests, or self-esteem, comparisons of meat consumption rates across cultures should be less prone to reference group effects.\n\nUnderstanding cross-cultural differences in the meat consumption gender gap may provide insights regarding the role of culture in gender differences and test the limits of paradoxical gender effects that have been observed for other psychological variables. It may also provide clues about how to reduce meat consumption globally. If gender differences in meat consumption are universal, strategies designed to reduce meat consumption may vary across genders, but the gender-specificity of such strategies would not depend on culture. Finding that gender differences in meat consumption were stronger in countries with lower gender equality would highlight the role of masculinity and related stereotypes in reducing meat consumption among men. A paradoxical gender effect in which gender differences in meat consumption are higher in more developed countries would suggest that meat consumption is a function of social opportunity and highlight the potential effectiveness of different kinds of strategies in different cultural contexts. We note that gender equality and human development are different in many ways, but they are related empirically and intertwined in terms of our hypotheses. Gender equality is generally afforded by aspects of human development, so to the extent that gender differences in meat consumption are moderated by one of these factors they would likely be moderated by both. However, the use of both indexes allows us to begin to examine the specificity of gender equality relative to human development more generally. At the same time, it must be acknowledged that with the modest number of countries included in this study, a test of the differences in effects between these variables is quite preliminary.\n\nIn summary, the purpose of this study was to use cross-cultural data to examine gender differences in meat consumption frequency. We expected men to consume more meat than women, on average, across all countries, and people in more developed and gender-equal countries to eat more meat. Our primary focus was on testing whether gender differences across countries would (a) not differ across countries, (b) be weaker in countries with higher gender equality and human development, or (c) be stronger in countries with higher gender equality and human development.", "source": {"uri": "nature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nature"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sex differences in humans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculinity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masculinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social norm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paradox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunosuppression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Universalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trait theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amino acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_role", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hypothesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Menstruation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animal welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Academic", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Transition", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Transition", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-62511-3/MediaObjects/41598_2024_62511_Fig1_HTML.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649797", "eventUri": "eng-9649797", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Excessive red meat intake can also lead to fat build-up in the liver, potentially causing strain on the liver in patients with liver conditions and increasing the risk of hepatic coma.\n\nDuring the upcoming Eid al-Adha celebration and the customary sacrifice slaughtering, the consumption of meat, particularly red meat, sees a notable rise, she pointed out in a statement. Kidney patients may become susceptible to higher levels of urea and uric acid in the blood due to excessive meat intake, which can hinder the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid in the urine, ultimately causing a deterioration in kidney function.\n\nThe excessive consumption of meat can contribute to obesity due to its high fat content, resulting in excessive calorie intake and subsequent weight gain, increasing the risk of developing various diseases. Additionally, it may cause indigestion, lethargy, and drowsiness, as excessive meat consumption leads to difficulty in digestion, constipation, bloating, gas, and stomach cramps due to the prolonged digestion process required for meats.\n\nAnother health issue caused by excessive meat consumption is dehydration. This occurs due to elevated uric acid levels, which prompt the kidneys to take up more water to dilute these toxic wastes and produce urine. Dr al-Rifai further emphasised that the negative consequences include a rise in inflammations. Saturated fats found in meat increase inflammation in the body, as meats lack antioxidants that resist inflammation.\n\nExcessive meat consumption is one the factors contributing to the development of cancer. Research indicate that consuming large quantities of red meat may increase the chances of developing colon and rectal cancer. In order to fully enjoy Eid al-Adha and prevent any symptoms or complications, it's crucial to adhere to certain precautions as follows: Consuming meat in moderation and refraining from consuming large quantities in a short period of time. While meat consumption tends to rise during Eid al-Adha, research indicates that the recommended weekly intake of red meat should not exceed 455gm of cooked meat, equivalent to around 65gm per day if consumed daily.\n\nIt's advisable to opt for lean cuts of meat with low fat content, such as shoulder and leg meat. It's important to consider the cooking technique used, as boiling or steaming meat without adding large amounts of oils and fats can minimise the harmful effects of meat.\n\nIncluding all healthy nutrients for a balanced meal such as vegetables and fruits, which are high in fibre, can promote a feeling of fullness. Staying hydrated by drinking two litre of water daily prevents dehydration and aid the body in getting rid of waste and toxins from consuming too much meat.\n\nExercising regularly, such as walking, can help in burning extra calories and preventing weight gain, Dr al-Rifai added.", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uric acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kidney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hepatic encephalopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Adha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eid al-Adha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digestion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nutrient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflammation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethargy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lethargy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigestion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indigestion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weight gain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Meat_and_Seafood", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Meat and Seafood", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Meat", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Meat", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Alcoholic_Beverages", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Alcoholic Beverages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Meat_Substitutes", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Meat Substitutes", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Food", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Food", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gulf-times.com/gulftimes/uploads/images/2024/06/13/thumbs/300x300/188482.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649797", "eventUri": "eng-9649797", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThe twins endorsed Trump, stating that he is a supporter of cryptocurrency and that President Joe Biden has declared war on the crypto space.\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss have stated that they will be voting for the current Republican candidate for president, Donald Trump. Each of the brothers sent 15.47 BTC, or approximately $1 million, to Trump's campaign.\n\nTyler Winklevoss claimed that Trump was \"pro-Bitcoin\" and \"pro-crypto,\" and accused President Biden of launching a war against the crypto industry. He claimed that the Biden administration was using regulatory actions against crypto firms and called it the \"weaponization of the banking system against crypto companies. \"\n\nAlso, Tyler recalled that the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been taking enforcement actions against companies involved in cryptocurrencies during Biden's administration and referred to it as Operation Choke Point 2.0.\n\nDespite the cases that he is still facing in the courts, Trump has not faded from the political stage. In May, he was found guilty on 34 felony charges with a scheduled sentencing hearing for July 11. Nevertheless, he has high poll ratings as for a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidency.\n\nTrump's positive attitude towards cryptocurrencies has brought debate among his supporters and opponents. On the one hand, many people have supported the endorsement of the Winklevoss twins, however, others have raised an eyebrow at Trump's move since he once called Bitcoin a scam in 2021. However, Trump has since embraced the crypto space and dubbed himself the 'Crypto President' in a bid to woo the crypto community.\n\nOn the other hand, President Biden has come under fire for his administration's regulatory policies. There are indications that Biden may also want to take cryptocurrency for his reelection campaign. The changing political environment indicates that cryptocurrency is becoming an essential part of the U.S. political process, and candidates from both parties are interacting with the industry to different extents.\n\nSpeaking at a fundraising event in San Francisco, Trump vowed to put an end to Biden's 'war on crypto' should he win the election.\n\nThis position is in line with the opinion of some international leaders including Nayib Bukele, the President of El Salvador who endorsed Trump's bid.\n\nAlso, Trump has been making efforts to be close to the crypto community and has invited NFT buyers for a dinner, announced that his campaign will be accepting crypto donations, and met with major mining companies. According to Coingape's report, he intends to support the crypto industry, promising all BTC would be mined within the United States.\n\nRead Also: US Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Meets Bitcoin Miners In the US, What's Cooking?", "source": {"uri": "coingape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coingape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelvin_munene_murithi@coingape.com", "name": "Kelvin Munene Murithi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Winklevoss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Winklevoss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declaration of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What's_Cooking?_(British_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What's Cooking?

On June 20, the twins made it clear through a statement on Twitter that they see Trump as the leader who aligns with their vision for cryptocurrency's future in America.\n\nTyler Winklevoss said, \"President Donald J. Trump is the pro-Bitcoin, pro-crypto, and pro-business choice. This isn't even up for debate.\" He blasted those opposing this view as either \"severely misinformed, delusional, or not telling the truth.\"\n\nIn a detailed explanation, Tyler outlined how the Biden Administration has manipulated federal agencies to stifle the crypto industry. Describing it as an \"unprecedented abuse of power,\" he accused the administration of using these agencies to harass and intimidate the industry under the guise of regulation. He referred to the strategy as Operation Choke Point 2.0, where financial institutions receive behind-the-scenes orders to exclude crypto companies.\n\nTyler grimly described the tactics used: \"That's a nice bank you got there. It sure would be a shame if something were to happen to it because you bank some crypto folks.\" This scenario, he claims, forces banks to comply or face severe consequences, including invasive audits and debilitating fines that could cripple their operations.\n\nFurther criticism was directed towards the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which Tyler accuses of deliberately avoiding the creation of new regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. This, he argues, allows the SEC to exploit outdated rules to control and potentially destroy the crypto market.

The country who lost 1-0 to England on Sunday threatened to quit unless officials imposed a strict punishment on Croatia and Albania, after supporters from both countries sang the shocking chant during their clash on Wednesday.\n\nCroatia and Albania played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Hamburg, but the quality of the match was overshadowed by the behaviour of fans from both sides who were heard chanting the call to violence in the stands. All three Balkan nations were part of the former Yugoslav Republic which fell apart in the 1990s, with many Albanians and Croats still harbouring distrust and in some cases hatred towards the Serbs due to a pair of bitter wars that led to hundreds of thousands of deaths. Albania and Serbia share a particularly troubled relationship over Kosovo - a small territory in the Balkans made up primarily of ethnic Albanians whose independence is not recognised by Belgrade.\n\nThe offensive chanting has not gone down well with the authorities in Serbia, with England's Group C rivals threatening to quit the tournament in a move that could have jeopardised the Three Lions' campaign in Europe. The Times though have reported that UEFA have decided to bring disciplinary proceedings against Croatia and Albania, with Serbia now to backtrack on their threat. A UEFA official reportedly said that Serbia had not made any threat to quit the tournament, despite being in contact with the country's FA.\n\nSerbia's second group game against Slovenia got underway at 2pm, with England facing Denmark in the other Group B game at 5pm. If Serbia withdraw from the tournament following their game with Slovenia, then final opponents Denmark would be awarded an automatic 3-0 victory which could leave England sweating as they head into their final matches of the group stages. It would have also put Serbia at risk of being disqualified from Euro 2028. The chanting follows an earlier incident during Serbia's opening match against England in which a Kosovan TV journalist aimed an Albanian 'eagle' sign towards their fans - another move which prompted anger in Belgrade. The journalist in question was immediately banned from the remainder of the tournament for 'misconduct'. But now Serbian authorities are demanding that UEFA also crack down on Croatia and Albania for their fans' behaviour yesterday.\n\n'What happened is scandalous and we will ask UEFA for sanctions, even at the cost of not continuing the competition,' Serbian FA General Secretary Jovan Surbatovic said. 'We are sure that they will be punished, because they have already responded to our appeal to remove the so-called journalist from Albania from the championship. 'We will request UEFA to punish the federations of both selections. We don't want to participate in that, but if UEFA doesn't punish them, we will think about how to proceed.\n\nOn Monday the Serbian Football Association was charged by UEFA after their supporters displayed a banner that 'transmitted a provocative message unfit for a sports event' and for throwing objects inside the stadium. That charge came after the Kosovo Football Federation complained to UEFA about 'Serbian fans displaying political, chauvinistic, and racist messages against Kosovo' during their 1-0 defeat by England. 'We were punished for isolated cases and our fans behaved much better than the others,' Surbatovic said.\n\n'We Serbs are gentlemen and we have an open heart, so I appeal to the fans to remain gentlemen.' If Serbia had withdrew from Group C in protest, it could have had a knock-on affect in terms of England's tournament. A Serbian forfeit would hand their upcoming opponents Denmark a 3-0 victory as per UEFA regulations. The team would also likely receive a hefty fine. Because England has already played Serbia they would not be awarded any extra points, while Denmark would gain three points plus a boost in goal difference.\n\nThe feuding between Serbia, Albania and Croatia is reminiscent of incidents in previous championships. When Serbia faced Albania for the first time as independent nations in a qualifier for Euro 2016, the match descended into chaos. UEFA had banned Albanian fans from attending the fixture in Belgrade in an attempt to prevent any violence, but elected to allow the game to go ahead despite the long-standing political tensions. The tensions exploded anyway when the Albanian flag, accompanied by a map of Kosovo and the word 'autochthonous' - meaning indigenous - was flown above the pitch by a drone during the game. Olsi Rama, the brother of Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, was arrested in the VIP box for allegedly instigating the stunt. 'He was arrested on suspicion that he masterminded and executed the incident in which a flag with a map of greater Albania was flown over the pitch and the terraces, after which the match between Serbia and Albania was abandoned,' Serbian state television said on its official website.\n\nSerbia were eventually awarded a 3-0 victory by UEFA after the game was abandoned, with their FA claiming the team acted with restraint despite being provoked by the 'offensive' banner. UEFA have already charged the Serbian FA with two offences following their defeat by England on Sunday in Gelsenkirchen - namely the throwing of objects and the transmitting of a provocative message 'unfit for a sports event'. The latter is understood to relate to the display of a flag linked to a paramilitary movement that was engaged in ethnic cleansing during the Yugoslav wars. The governing body also launched an investigation into claims monkey noises were aimed at England players during the clash.\n\nAn inspector has been appointed to carry out a disciplinary probe 'regarding alleged discriminatory behaviour' - though a resolution is not expected until after the group stages. That controversy unfolded hours after fans from both teams were involved in a brawl outside a restaurant bar close to the stadium prior to the game. Footage showed how some fans were left bloody after punches and chairs were thrown in the streets. German riot police quickly descended on the scene, detaining some participants and prompting others to flee. Meanwhile, UEFA also directed four charges to the Albania F ootball Federation for incidents during their 2-1 loss to Italy in Dortmund last week. The dying moments of the game were interrupted by a pitch invader, resulting in a charge of 'invading the field of play', while other charges included the 'throwing of objects', 'lighting of fireworks' and 'transmitting a provocative message unfit for a sports event'.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

We do not want to participate in that, but if UEFA does not punish them, we will think how we will proceed,\" he added.\n\nA journalist from Kosovo, Arlind Sadiku, had his media accreditation revoked by UEFA on Wednesday due to allegations that he made a nationalist gesture toward Serbian supporters during their match against England in Gelsenkirchen. A statement issued by UEFA read: \"UEFA can confirm that one journalist has had his accreditation cancelled due to misconduct at the UEFA EURO 2024 match between Serbia and England on 16 June 2024.\"\n\nFollowing the display of a banner that \"transmitted a provocative message unfit for a sports event\" and for throwing objects inside the stadium by their fans, the Serbian Football Association was penalized by UEFA. The development came after the Kosovo Football Federation complained to UEFA about \"Serbian fans displaying political, chauvinistic, and racist messages against Kosovo\" during their 1-0 defeat to England.\n\n\"We were punished for isolated cases and our fans behaved much better than the others,\" Surbatovic said.\n\n\"One fan was punished for racist insults, and we don't want it to be attributed to others.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nSerbia have threatened to QUIT Euro 2024 if Croatia and Albania aren't punished for \"offensive\" chants.\n\nThe Football Association of Serbia (FSS) claim that both sets of fans chanted \"Kill, kill, kill the Serb\" during their 2-2 Group B draw in Hamburg on Wednesday. Tensions between Serbia and both Croatia and Albania from the Balkan war in the 1900s, which saw the break up of the former Yugoslavia and the establishment of Kosovo, which has a population of 1.8million Albanians.\n\nNow the FSS have threatened to withdraw from the tournament ahead of today's clash with Slovenia. FSS general secretary Jovan Surbatovic said: \"What happened is scandalous and we will ask UEFA for sanctions, even if it means not continuing the competition. We are sure they will be punished, because (UEFA) has already responded to our appeal to remove the so-called journalist from Albania from the championship. We will demand that UEFA punish both federations. We do not want to participate in that but, if UEFA does not punish them, we will think how we will proceed.\"\n\nHis \"so-called\" journalist reference is in relation to a Kosovan TV reporter who made the double-headed eagle gesture with crossed hands towards Serbian fans during their opening match against England. The gesture represents the flag of Greater Albania and has been used as a goal celebration against the Serbians before, most notably by Swiss stars Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri - both ethnic Albanians - during the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\n\nThe TV reporter has since been banned from reporting on the Euros for \"misconduct\". The Albanian FA were hit with a \u00a332,000 fine by UEFA for their fans' behaviour during the 2-1 defeat to Italy on Saturday fo throwing objects, setting off fireworks, invading the pitch and \"transmitting a provocative message not fit for a sporting event.\"\n\nSerbia were also sanctioned for their own banner, which stated a historic Serbian claim over Kosova. Seven Serbian fans were also arrested, while an investigation has been opened into alleged racist chanting against England, to which Surbatovic replied: \"We were punished for isolated cases and our fans behaved much better than the others.\n\n\"One fan was punished for racist insults and we don't want it to be attributed to others. We Serbs are gentleman and we have an open heart, so I appeal to the fans to remain gentlemen.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ross_pilcher@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Ross Pilcher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Football Association of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balkan Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albanians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-headed_eagle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-headed eagle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Albania", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Albania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_celebration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal celebration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xherdan_Shaqiri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xherdan Shaqiri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granit_Xhaka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Granit Xhaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article33071852.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS336930482.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667306", "eventUri": "eng-9667306", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

We do not want to participate in that but, if UEFA does not punish them, we will think how we will proceed.\"\n\nHis comment about the \"so-called journalist from Albania\" is a reference to a TV reporter from Kosovo who was seen making the double-headed eagle sign towards Serbian fans during their game against England on Sunday.\n\nThe gesture, which is made with crossed hands, represents the flag of Greater Albania and has been a source of tension between Albanians and Serbs ever since the break-up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. The reporter has been banned from working at the tournament for \"misconduct\".\n\nThe Albanian FA has also already been fined almost \u00a332,000 by UEFA for the poor behaviour of their fans during their opening game against Italy. The governing body punished them for throwing objects onto the pitch, lighting fireworks, a pitch invasion and \"transmitting a provocative message not fit for a sporting event\".\n\nSerbia, however, have also already been sanctioned by UEFA, receiving a fine of just over \u00a312,000 for their fans' behaviour during the game against England in Gelsenkirchen. They, too, were punished for a \"provocative message\", in this case a banner stating Serbia's historic claim over the predominantly Albanian republic of Kosovo.\n\nSeven Serbian fans were also arrested by police after clashing with their England counterparts before that match, which England won 1-0, and an investigation has been opened by UEFA into reports of racist chanting by Serbian supporters during the game.\n\nSurbatovic tried to downplay these incidents in his interview with RTS, saying: \"We were punished for isolated cases and our fans behaved much better than the others.\n\n\"One fan was punished for racist insults and we don't want it to be attributed to others. We Serbs are gentleman and we have an open heart, so I appeal to the fans to remain gentlemen.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_slater@nytimes.com", "name": "Matt Slater", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Football Association of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Serbian_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Serbian sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Albania", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greater Albania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-headed_eagle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-headed eagle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_Yugoslavia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breakup of Yugoslavia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Television_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radio Television of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Albanians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Hand_Clapping", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Hand Clapping", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Futsal", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Futsal", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/06/20073421/GettyImages-2158002669-scaled-e1718883284370.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667306", "eventUri": "eng-9667306", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Jovan Surbatovic, a Serbian soccer exec, revealed on Thursday that he submitted a complaint against both Albania and Croatia. The official accused fans of the two teams of singing offensive songs directed towards Serbia.\n\nAlbania and Croatia faced off on Wednesday in Hamburg in what turned out to be an epic matchup. Croatia netted two second-half goals in as many minutes to take a late lead in the fixture. Albanian midfielder Klaus Gjasula, however, scored a goal deep into added time to shake things up. The epic game eventually ended in a 2-2 draw.\n\nAlthough the match was exciting on the pitch, fans in the stands unfortunately resorted to insulting chants. Both sets of supporters were heard singing songs about murdering Serbians. Surbatovic alleges that the sets of fans chanted \"Kill, kill, kill the Serb\" back and forth to each other.\n\nInterestingly enough, Serbia was charged by UEFA on Monday after some of their fans displayed an offensive banner in their matchup with England the previous day. Select Serbian supporters also threw objects onto the pitch during the game as well.\n\nThe banner in question was reportedly a derogatory message against Kosovo. The two countries have a tense history and Serbia does not currently recognize Kosovo as an independent nation. Serbian fans then sang \"Kosovo is the heart of Serbia\" in Munich on Thursday ahead of their match with Slovenia.\n\nDespite the actions by Serbia, Surbatovic asked that UEFA charges Albania and Croatia. \"First of all, I want to thank our fans for their support in the match against England and I hope we will beat Slovenia,\" said Surbatovic.\n\n\"What happened [in the Albania-Croatia game] is scandalous and we will ask UEFA for sanctions, even if it means not continuing the competition. If UEFA doesn't punish them, we will think about how to proceed.\"\n\n\"We were punished for isolated cases and our fans behaved much better than the others. One fan was punished for racist insults and we don't want it to be attributed to others. We Serbs are gentlemen and we have an open heart.\"\n\nDespite Surbatovic's demands, Serbia looked almost certain to potentially be out of the tournament on Thursday anyway. The Eagles found themselves down 1-0 against Slovenia in Munich thanks to a goal from defender \u017dan Karni\u010dnik. A loss would have essentially put Serbia behind the eight-ball heading into their final match of Group C.\n\nNevertheless, Luka Jovic scored a goal seconds from the final whistle to help Serbia grab a point. The result keeps the Eagles at the bottom of the group. A possible victory in their next game, however, could help them move on to the knockout round.

EPISODE 90: How Manchester United CAN win crunch FA Cup clash EPISODE 89: Why Manchester City aren't the reason the League is boring Play on Apple Spotify Animosity between Serbia, Albania and Croatia explained\n\nSerbia, Albania and Croatia have a reputation for mutual distrust and in some cases hatred due to longstanding ethnic and political grievances.\n\nSerbia and Albania share a tense history, primarily over the issue of Kosovo. This small country used to be an autonomous province within Serbia, but the majority of its population is made up of ethnic Albanians.\n\nAfter the Republic of Yugoslavia broke up in the 1990s, tensions in Kosovo increased and culminated in the Kosovo War in 1998, in which ethnic Serbs and Albanians clashed for a year and a half before NATO intervened. Kosovo later declared independence in 2008, but this was not recognised by Serbia.\n\nThe two nations are still at loggerheads over the issue today.\n\nThe tension between Serbia and Croatia meanwhile stems directly from the 1991-1995 Croatian War of Independence.\n\nCroatia declared independence from Yugoslavia in the summer of 1991 despite resistance from a group of ethnic Serbs, who in turn declared intentions to break away from Croatia.\n\nThis erupted into all-out war, with Serbia's nationalist president Slobodan Milosevic instructing his followers to conduct ruthless killings of Croats, who in turn also conducted atrocities against the Serbs.\n\nMilosevic was later charged with war crimes - but the two countries still harbour distrust towards one another over the brutal killings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA UEFA official reportedly said that Serbia had not made any threat to quit the tournament, despite being in contact with the country's FA.\n\nSerbia's second group game against Slovenia got underway at 2pm, with England facing Denmark in the other Group B game at 5pm.\n\nIf Serbia withdraw from the tournament following their game with Slovenia, then final opponents Denmark would be awarded an automatic 3-0 victory which could leave England sweating as they head into their final matches of the group stages.\n\nIt would have also put Serbia at risk of being disqualified from Euro 2028.\n\nThe chanting follows an earlier incident during Serbia's opening match against England in which a Kosovan TV journalist aimed an Albanian 'eagle' sign towards their fans - another move which prompted anger in Belgrade.\n\nThe journalist in question was immediately banned from the remainder of the tournament for 'misconduct'.\n\nBut now Serbian authorities are demanding that UEFA also crack down on Croatia and Albania for their fans' behaviour yesterday.\n\n'What happened is scandalous and we will ask UEFA for sanctions, even at the cost of not continuing the competition,' Serbian FA General Secretary Jovan Surbatovic said.\n\n'We are sure that they will be punished, because they have already responded to our appeal to remove the so-called journalist from Albania from the championship.\n\n'We will request UEFA to punish the federations of both selections. We don't want to participate in that, but if UEFA doesn't punish them, we will think about how to proceed.\n\nOn Monday the Serbian Football Association was charged by UEFA after their supporters displayed a banner that 'transmitted a provocative message unfit for a sports event' and for throwing objects inside the stadium.\n\nThat charge came after the Kosovo Football Federation complained to UEFA about 'Serbian fans displaying political, chauvinistic, and racist messages against Kosovo' during their 1-0 defeat by England.\n\n'We were punished for isolated cases and our fans behaved much better than the others,' Surbatovic said.\n\n'We Serbs are gentlemen and we have an open heart, so I appeal to the fans to remain gentlemen.'\n\nIf Serbia had withdrew from Group C in protest, it could have had a knock-on affect in terms of England's tournament.\n\nA Serbian forfeit would hand their upcoming opponents Denmark a 3-0 victory as per UEFA regulations. The team would also likely receive a hefty fine.\n\nBecause England has already played Serbia they would not be awarded any extra points, while Denmark would gain three points plus a boost in goal difference.\n\nAlbania forward Bekim Balaj is struck by a chair thrown by a Serbian fan as tensions boiled over during the Euro 2016 qualifying clash\n\nNemanja Gudelj holds the flag while Albania's Bekim Balaj and Andi Lila try to protect it\n\nA masked Serbian supporter runs off with the drone that carried the controversial flag as players watch on in the background\n\nRead More What happens to England's group if Serbia pull out of Euro 2024? UEFA law reveals fate of Group C\n\nThe feuding between Serbia, Albania and Croatia is reminiscent of incidents in previous championships.\n\nWhen Serbia faced Albania for the first time as independent nations in a qualifier for Euro 2016, the match descended into chaos.\n\nUEFA had banned Albanian fans from attending the fixture in Belgrade in an attempt to prevent any violence, but elected to allow the game to go ahead despite the long-standing political tensions.\n\nThe tensions exploded anyway when the Albanian flag, accompanied by a map of Kosovo and the word 'autochthonous' - meaning indigenous - was flown above the pitch by a drone during the game.\n\nOlsi Rama, the brother of Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, was arrested in the VIP box for allegedly instigating the stunt.\n\n'He was arrested on suspicion that he masterminded and executed the incident in which a flag with a map of greater Albania was flown over the pitch and the terraces, after which the match between Serbia and Albania was abandoned,' Serbian state television said on its official website.\n\nSerbia were eventually awarded a 3-0 victory by UEFA after the game was abandoned, with their FA claiming the team acted with restraint despite being provoked by the 'offensive' banner.\n\nUEFA has appointed an inspector to carry out a disciplinary probe 'regarding alleged discriminatory behaviour'\n\nUEFA has already charged the Albanian FA for fan trouble during the European Championship\n\nAn English fan is seen on the ground after being attacked by rivals ahead of the game between Serbia and England\n\nTwo officers grapple with a fan after chasing attackers through the streets of Gelsenkirchen\n\nUEFA have already charged the Serbian FA with two offences following their defeat by England on Sunday in Gelsenkirchen - namely the throwing of objects and the transmitting of a provocative message 'unfit for a sports event'.\n\nThe latter is understood to relate to the display of a flag linked to a paramilitary movement that was engaged in ethnic cleansing during the Yugoslav wars.\n\nThe governing body also launched an investigation into claims monkey noises were aimed at England players during the clash.\n\nAn inspector has been appointed to carry out a disciplinary probe 'regarding alleged discriminatory behaviour' - though a resolution is not expected until after the group stages.\n\nThat controversy unfolded hours after fans from both teams were involved in a brawl outside a restaurant bar close to the stadium prior to the game.\n\nFootage showed how some fans were left bloody after punches and chairs were thrown in the streets.\n\nGerman riot police quickly descended on the scene, detaining some participants and prompting others to flee.\n\nMeanwhile, UEFA also directed four charges to the Albania Football Federation for incidents during their 2-1 loss to Italy in Dortmund last week.\n\nThe dying moments of the game were interrupted by a pitch invader, resulting in a charge of 'invading the field of play', while other charges included the 'throwing of objects', 'lighting of fireworks' and 'transmitting a provocative message unfit for a sports event'.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Volksparkstadion, fans were heard chanting \"kill the Serbs,\" referencing the historical animosity between the nations dating back to the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s and World War II atrocities.\n\nJovan Surbatovic, the general secretary of the Football Association of Serbia, expressed outrage in an interview with state broadcaster RTS.\n\n\"What happened is scandalous, and we will ask UEFA for sanctions, even if it means not continuing the competition,\" Surbatovic stated.\n\nThe incident follows another controversy involving a Kosovan journalist who had their accreditation revoked after making an Albanian eagle gesture towards Serbian fans during their opening match against England.\n\nUEFA has, however, launched an investigation into allegations of racial abuse by Serbian fans towards England's black players and has fined Serbia \u00a312,250 for other infractions, including throwing objects and displaying a provocative banner regarding Kosovo.\n\nAlbania has also faced disciplinary actions, receiving a fine for displaying a map with extended borders during their first match against Italy, which UEFA deemed inappropriate for a sports event.\n\nSuratovic voiced confidence in UEFA's response to the incidents at the Croatia vs. Albania match. \"We are sure that they [the fans] will be punished, because they have already responded to our appeal to remove the so-called journalist from Albania from the championship,\" he said.\n\nSurbatovic also emphasized that Serbia will demand sanctions against the federations of both Croatia and Albania, warning that failure to act might prompt Serbia to reconsider its participation in the tournament.\n\nSerbia's next match is against Slovenia on Thursday, followed by their final group stage game against Denmark on June 25.", "source": {"uri": "withinnigeria.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Within Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adejayan_gbenga_gsong@withinnigeria.com", "name":

It was shown on Saturday during the 2-1 loss against Italy in Dortmund.\n\nA Serbia fans banner included the territory of Kosovo, a former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008, and a slogan, \"No Surrender,\" in the 1-0 loss against England in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nUEFA has also launched an investigation into claims of monkey chants aimed at England players during the clash.\n\nLatest

This understandably has not gone down well with the Serbian FA, who have called on European football's top governing body to take action.\n\nSerbia were also upset when a Kosovan TV journalist aimed an Albanian 'eagle' sign towards their fans during a live broadcast at their opening game against England.\n\nArlind Sadiku, who reports for the television channel Artmotion, has been banned from the remainder of the tournament for 'misconduct'.\n\n'What happened is scandalous and we will ask UEFA for sanctions, even at the cost of not continuing the competition,' Serbian FA General Secretary Jovan Surbatovic said.\n\n'We are sure that they will be punished, because they have already responded to our appeal to remove the so-called journalist from Albania from the championship.\n\n'We will request UEFA to punish the federations of both selections.

One fan was fined for racist abuse and we don't want it to be attributed to others. We Serbs are gentlemen and we have an open heart, so I appeal to the fans to remain gentlemen.'\n\nShould Serbia act on Subatovic's warning, their final group stage game against Denmark would likely be affected.\n\nA withdrawal would hand the Danes a 3-0 victory as per UEFA regulationships, and Serbia would likely receive a hefty fine.\n\nHowever, UEFA could also take further action in what would be an unprecedented move during a major tournament.\n\nAnimosity from Croatians and Albanians towards Serbs has its roots in the break-up of Yugoslavia in 1995.\n\nThe first-ever meeting between Croatia and Serbia in 2013 was branded the 'match of the decade' by the media in both countries and tickets for the clash at the 34,000 stadium sold out within hours.\n\nDespite there being no away fans present in the stadium, 1,500 police officers patrolled the game in a bid to prevent any outburst of nationalism.\n\nSimilarly, when Serbia faced Albania for the first time as independent nations, their Euro 2016 qualifier descended into chaos on the pitch and in the stands - and the arrest of the brother of the Albanian Prime Minister.\n\nUEFA had banned Albania fans from attending the clash in Belgrade but elected to allow the two countries to face each other, despite long-standing political tensions.\n\nAnd when the Albanian flag - accompanied by a map of Kosovo and the message 'autochthonous', meaning indigenous - was flown above the pitch using a remote-operated drone - chaos ensued.\n\nOlsi Rama, the brother of Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, was arrested in the VIP box for allegedly instigating the stunt, confirmed CNN.\n\n'He was arrested on suspicion that he masterminded and executed the incident in which a flag with a map of greater Albania was flown over the pitch and the terraces, after which the match between Serbia and Albania was abandoned,' Serbian state television said on its official website.\n\nSerbia were eventually awarded a 3-0 victory by UEFA after the game was abandoned, with their FA claiming the their team acted with restraint despite being provoked by the 'offensive' flag and were then attacked when they tried to remove it from the field.\n\nIn Surbatovic's statement on Thursday, he also made reference to recent trouble caused by their supporters at the tournament.\n\nUEFA charged the Serbian FA with two offences following their defeat by England on Sunday - the throwing of objects and the transmitting of a provocative message 'unfit for a sports event'.\n\nThe latter is understood to relate to the displaying of a flag linked to a paramilitary movement that was engaged in ethnic cleansing during the Yugoslav wars.\n\nThe governing body also launched an investigation into claims monkey noises were aimed at England players during the clash. An inspector has been appointed to carry out a disciplinary probe 'regarding alleged discriminatory behaviour', though, a resolution is not expected until after the group stages.\n\nMeanwhile, the governing body directed four charges to the Albania Football Federation for incidents during the game in Dortmund, which finished 2-1 to Italy. A pitch invader halted the game in the dying moments of the game and that incident comprises one of the charges.\n\nThe charges were for the 'throwing of objects', 'lighting of fireworks', 'invasion of the field of play', and 'transmitting a provocative message unfit for a sports event'.\n\nIt comes amid rising tensions between fans elsewhere at the European Championship in Germany.\n\nFootball hooliganism has made a shameful return to the Euros. Ahead of England's opening match against Serbia. some British fans are among those thought to be injured after bloody punch-ups sparked by Serbia's arch-rivals Albania attacking Serbs outside a bar in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nRiot police clashed with a mob of supporters as violence made a shameful return to the sport, with police sources telling MailOnline at least six people were arrested.\n\nSerbia's extraordinary threat comes a matter of hours before their second Group C match against Slovenia at the Allianz Arena in Munich.\n\nDragan Stojkovic's will be confident of securing the win that would significantly boost their chances of qualification after pushing England close in their opener.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"},

"Serbia's recent threat to pull out of Euro 2024 will have big implications for England and the other teams in the competition.\n\nThe Balkan side - who lost out to England by 1-0 in their Euro opener last Sunday (16 June) - has today (20 June) threatened to leave the competition.\n\nGeneral Secretary of the Football Association of Serbia, Jovan Surbatovic, claims that during yesterday's (19 June) game against Croatia and Albania, fans chanted derogatory phrase 'kill, kill, kill the Serb' during the 59th minute.\n\n\"First of all, I want to thank our fans for their support in the match against England and I hope we will beat Slovenia,\" he said in a translated statement to RTS.\n\n\"What happened is scandalous and we will ask UEFA for sanctions, even if it means not continuing the competition.\n\n\"We are sure that they will be punished, because they have already responded to our appeal to remove the so-called journalist from Albania from the championship.\"\n\nSerbia are set to face off against Slovenia at 2pm (UK time) today, as other group C teams England and Denmark will play at 5pm.\n\nAccording to UEFA, if a national team decides to pull out during the competition, 'the results of all of its matches are declared null and void, and the points awarded forfeited'.\n\nSerbia will also lose 'all rights to payments from UEFA' and will be set an 'amount of compensation due for financial loss'.\n\nSerbia's withdrawal during the tournament would create significant disruption for UEFA and the group standings would need to be recalculated.\n\nFor the last game of the group, Denmark would be handed an automatic 3-0 victory.\n\nAnd this would leave an uneven number of teams in the competition, potentially requiring a new schedule to be created for the remaining fixtures.\n\nTeams in Serbia's group may also be given extra rest time without the need to play an extra game.\n\nBut because England has already played Serbia, this would not apply to them.\n\nFans who had tickets for Serbia's matches would most likely need to be refunded or reallocated to other matches, but this is yet to be confirmed by UEFA.", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType":

Historical animosity from the Yugoslav Wars has fueled tense relations between Serbia, Croatia, and Albania. Despite condemning other fans, Serbia also faces UEFA fines due to provocative actions by their supporters against England, complicating their stance.\n\nSerbia have threatened to quit EURO 2024 early unless UEFA impose strict punishment on Croatia and Albania following offensive chants during their clash on Wednesday. The two nations played out a dramatic 2-2 draw in Hamburg, but their behaviour has become a major talking point due to offensive chanting, as per reports from Daily Mail.\n\nBoth sets of supporters could be heard shouting 'Kill the Serbs' during their clash. This has not gone down well with the Serbian FA, who have called on European football's top governing body to take action, as political turmoil continues to hold an unsavoury place in the modern game. A statement from Serbian FA spokesperson Jovan Surbatovic read:\n\n\"What happened is scandalous and we will ask UEFA for sanctions, even at the cost of not continuing the competition. We are sure that they will be punished, because they have already responded to our appeal to remove the so-called journalist from Albania from the championship.\n\n\"We will demand from UEFA to punish the federations of both selections. We do not want to participate in that, but if UEFA does not punish them, we will think about how we will proceed.\"\n\nCroatia, Albania, and Serbia are among several nations that share a turbulent history marked by ethnic tensions, territorial disputes, and political conflict, and a blood-blooded past continually makes a reappearance during international meetings.\n\nRelated Every Euro 2024 Team's Best Player\n\nIt's set to be an exciting summer of international football as some of the world's best players try to lead their team to glory.\n\nWhy Albania And Croatia Chanted Against Serbia The animosity stems from the Yugoslav Wars\n\nThe strained relations between Serbia, Albania, and Croatia are deeply rooted in a serpentine history of ethnic tensions, territorial disputes, and political conflicts. The Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, following the breakup of Yugoslavia, significantly heightened the bitterness on display.\n\nCroatia and Serbia fought a brutal war from 1991 to 1995, fueled by Serbia's aggressive nationalism under Slobodan Milosevic and Croatia's desire for independence. This conflict left deep scars, with war crimes exacerbating mutual distrust and resentment that has failed to be forgiven and forgotten over 30 years later.\n\nMeanwhile, Albania's contentious relationship with Serbia centers on the issue of Kosovo. Kosovo, with its majority ethnic Albanian population, declared independence from Serbia in 2008, a move Serbia has staunchly opposed. The Kosovo War during the late-90s, involving NATO intervention, saw severe human rights violations and further entrenched hostilities between Serbs and Albanians.\n\nThis cataclysmic past has imposed an everlasting trauma on Europe's Balkan region, thus also hindering any efforts made by Serbia to heal divisions. Despite occasional diplomatic meetings, the deep-seated historical friction among Serbia, Albania, and Croatia continues to impede harmonious relations, as shown in Wednesday afternoon's trouble.\n\nSerbia Face Punishment Themselves Serbia face UEFA fines because of flags displayed against England\n\nUEFA and host nation Germany have made it clear that any conflict - or acts that might lead to it - will be tolerated during the showpiece event. But while the Serbian FA condemn actions taken by Albanian and Croatian fans, their own supporters have also caused tensions at the tournament.\n\nLast week, UEFA announced it had opened disciplinary proceedings and levied charges of \"throwing objects\" and \"transmitting a provocative message unfit for a sports event\" during Serbia's 1-0 defeat against England in Gelsenkirchen. Serbia has remained an ally of Russia during the latter's war with Ukraine and supporters brandished the red, white and blue flag of the Moscow-run state, as per The Sun.\n\nSome Serbian fans also displayed a land map of their country which included neighbouring Kosovo, long claimed by the Belgrade regime. The flag bore the message \"nema predaje\", which means \"never surrender\" and indicated advocacy for the outdated Serbian ambitions, thus further pouring oil on troubled waters.", "source": {"uri":

However if there is a 'reasoned and well-documented' reason for the team to pull out of the competition, the team will be set an 'amount of compensation due for financial loss'.\n\nIf Serbia quit Euro 2024 it would unleash chaos in Group C\n\nThis isn't the only thing that could unfold due to Serbia's withdrawal as it would leave an uneven number of teams in the competition, potentially requiring a new schedule to be created for the remaining fixtures.\n\nIt would also mean that the teams in Serbia's group would gain an unfair advantage in the competition, as they would inherit extra rest time without the need to play an extra game.\n\nHowever since Southgate's men have already played Serbia, it would not apply to them, meaning it would load the pressure of Southgate's side to not just win their remaining two games but to win them with significant scorelines.\n\nUEFA could also take further action against Serbia however, in what would be an unprecedented move during a major tournament.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Serbian_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Serbian sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football Association of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balkans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/20/13/86365613-0-image-m-39_1718887236457.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667306", "eventUri": "eng-9667306", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1951, "textEnd": 1958}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

We Serbs are gentlemen and open-hearted, so I appeal to the fans to remain gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nUEFA on Wednesday fined the Serbian and Albanian FA \u20ac10,000 ($10,745) in connection with \"provocative messages not fit for a sports event\" by their fans.\n\nEnglish media reported that monkey noises were made in the direction of their players during their match against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday.

Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as an independent state.\n\nThe eagle sign represents the double-headed eagle of Albania's flag and it is a symbol of solidarity for all ethnic Albanians.\n\n\"It's a dangerous precedent. I haven't offended or provoked anyone. I'm just proud of the symbol that represents us,\" the journalist told Swiss newspaper Blick.\n\nThe eagle hand gesture had already caused a huge stir at the 2018 World Cup. Back then, it was shown by Switzerland players Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri, both ethnic Albanian, after their goals in the 2-1 win against Serbia.\n\nAccording to several media, the Serbian football federation reported this new incident to UEFA and demanded consequences. Sadiku pointed out that he had made the gesture in response to anti-Kosovo chants from Serbian supporters.\n\nSerbia rescued a 1-1 draw with Slovenia earlier on Thursday to keep alive their hopes of

And we should leave politics out of it a bit,\" he said.\n\nSerbia are demanding that European soccer's governing body UEFA punishes Croatia and Albania after accusing their fans of hateful chanting during their clash in Hamburg on Wednesday.\n\nJovan Surbatovic, General Secretary of the Football Association of Serbia, said a formal complaint had been submitted, claiming that Croatia and Albania fans chanted \"Kill, kill, kill the Serb\" during the 2-2 draw.\n\nHe even threatened that Serbia, themselves charged by UEFA for incidents during their defeat by England last Saturday, could withdraw from the tournament.\n\nSerbia have been charged by UEFA after their supporters displayed a banner of Serbia's national flag which included Kosovo, its former republic, within its borders. UEFA said it \"transmitted a provocative message unfit for a sports event\".\n\nIndependence for ethnic Albanian-majority Kosovo came on Feb. 17, 2008, a decade after a guerrilla uprising against Serbian rule.\n\nKosovo is recognised by more than 100 countries.\n\nSerbia, however, still formally deems Kosovo to be part of its territory. It accuses Kosovo's central government of trampling on the rights of ethnic Serbs.\n\nOn Wednesday UEFA cancelled the media credentials of a\n\nKosovar journalist\n\nfollowing complaints about a nationalist gesture he made towards Serbia fans during their game against England on Sunday in Gelsenkirchen.\n\n(Reporting by Alexandra Hudson and Michael Kahn; Editing by Ken Ferris and Pritha Sarkar)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balkans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_flag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National flag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guerrilla warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Hand_Clapping", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Hand Clapping", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "wgt": 8}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667306", "eventUri": "eng-9667306", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 17, "textEnd": 24}, {"amb": false, "date": "2008-02-17", "textStart": 1638, "textEnd": 1651}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Nationalist rhetoric, however, undermines these principles, fuelling division and hostility between fans and societies.\n\n'The principles of political neutrality are enshrined in the regulations of international associations such as FIFA and UEFA. The Football Federation of Macedonia will send an official letter to UEFA for this scandalous behaviour.\n\n'We call on Albania's footballer Mirlind Daku to publicly apologise for his behaviour, recognising the damage he has caused.'\n\nChants of 'Kill the Serbs' could be heard from both sets of fans inside the stadium in Hamburg\n\nDaku, 26, came off the bench during the Euro 2024 clash, sparking controversy at full-time\n\nBoth sets of supporters could be heard shouting 'Kill the Serbs' inside the stadium during the match, and Daku's megaphone incident appears only to sparked more derogatory chants from supporters.\n\nSerbia were also upset when a Kosovan TV journalist aimed an Albanian 'eagle' sign towards their fans during a live broadcast at their opening game against England.\n\nArlind Sadiku, who reports for the television channel Artmotion, has been banned from the remainder of the tournament for 'misconduct'.\n\n'What happened is scandalous and we will ask UEFA for sanctions, even at the cost of not continuing the competition,' Serbian FA General Secretary Jovan Surbatovic said.\n\nRead More Serbia threatens to QUIT the Euros, which would spark chaos in England's group, after sick chants\n\n'We are sure that they will be punished, because they have already responded to our appeal to remove the so-called journalist from Albania from the championship.\n\n'We will request UEFA to punish the federations of both selections. We don't want to participate in that, but if UEFA doesn't punish them, we will think about how to proceed.\n\n'We were punished for the cases of fishing and our fans behaved much better than the others. One fan was fined for racist abuse and we don't want it to be attributed to others. We Serbs are gentlemen and we have an open heart, so I appeal to the fans to remain gentlemen.'\n\nAnimosity from Croatians and Albanians towards Serbs has its roots in the break-up of Yugoslavia in 1995.\n\nThe first-ever meeting between Croatia and Serbia in 2013 was branded the 'match of the decade' by the media in both countries and tickets for the clash at the 34,000 stadium sold out within hours.\n\nDespite there being no away fans present in the stadium, 1,500 police officers patrolled the game in a bid to prevent any outburst of nationalism.\n\nSimilarly, when Serbia faced Albania for the first time as independent nations, their Euro 2016 qualifier descended into chaos on the pitch and in the stands - and the arrest of the brother of the Albanian Prime Minister.\n\nThe Serbian FA are angered by the 'scandalous' incident. Pictured: Serbian FA President Dragan Dzajic (middle right) and General Secretary Jovan Surbatovic (right)\n\nAlbania's Bekim Balaj is struck by a chair thrown by a Serbian fan during their match in 2016\n\nUEFA had banned Albania fans from attending the clash in Belgrade but elected to allow the two countries to face each other, despite long-standing political tensions.\n\nAnd when the Albanian flag - accompanied by a map of Kosovo and the message 'autochthonous', meaning indigenous - was flown above the pitch using a remote-operated drone - chaos ensued.", "source": {"uri":

They had previously beaten both Switzerland and France on their way to qualification but pulled out before it began. They would go on to make their debut in 1954.\n\nTurkey withdrew from the same tournament at the same stage, due to it being unlikely they'd make it out of the group stage. Like Scotland, it would have been their first outing on the World Cup stage but they would regroup for 1954 and make their debut then.\n\nThe only team that has pulled out and not gone on to feature in the World Cup since. India were another team that cancelled their trip to Brazil in 1950 after it was claimed they were told they were unable to play barefoot.\n\nHowever, this was untrue and the actual reason was due to disagreements with team selection and a lack of practice in the build-up.\n\nThe final of the four teams to withdraw from the 1950 World Cup. France were much weaker than the footballing powerhouses we know them as today, with the team ranked lower than Scotland at the time.

The Serbian Football Association has lodged a formal complaint, citing discriminatory behavior. UEFA has initiated investigations regarding the incidents.\n\nSerbia are demanding that UEFA punishes Croatia and Albania after accusing their fans of hateful chanting during their Euro 2024 clash in Hamburg on Wednesday. Jovan Surbatovic, General Secretary of the Football Association of Serbia, said a formal complaint had been submitted, claiming that Croatia and Albania fans chanted \"Kill, kill, kill the Serb\" during the 2-2 draw.\n\nHe even threatened that Serbia, themselves charged by UEFA for incidents during their defeat by England last Saturday, could withdraw from the tournament. \"First of all, I want to thank our fans for their support in the match against England and I hope we will beat Slovenia,\" Surbatovic was quoted by Serbia's PTC.\n\n\"What happened is scandalous and we will ask UEFA for sanctions, even if it means not continuing the competition. If UEFA doesn't punish them, we will think about how to proceed.\" On Monday the Serbian Football Association was charged by UEFA after their supporters displayed a banner that \"transmitted a provocative message unfit for a sports event\" and for throwing objects inside the stadium.\n\nThat charge came after the Kosovo Football Federation complained to UEFA about \"Serbian fans displaying political, chauvinistic, and racist messages against Kosovo\" during their 1-0 defeat by England. \"We were punished for isolated cases and our fans behaved much better than the others,\" Surbatovic said.\n\n\"One fan was punished for racist insults and we don't want it to be attributed to others. We Serbs are gentlemen and we have an open heart.\" UEFA later said in a statement it had appointed an Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector to conduct an investigation regarding potential racist and/or discriminatory conduct by supporters during the Croatia v Albania match.\n\nSerbia drew with Slovenia on Thursday in Group C, before which a group of Serbia fans chanted \"Kosovo is the heart of Serbia\" in central Munich's Marienplatz. The Football Federation of Macedonia (FFM) condemned Albania's Mirlind Daku for allegedly directing \"nationalist chants\" against their country following the draw.\n\nDaku was seen holding a megaphone and encouraging fans to chant against Macedonians after the game. \"The principles of political neutrality are enshrined in the regulations of international associations such as FIFA and UEFA. The Football Federation of Macedonia will send an official letter to UEFA for this scandalous behaviour,\" the FFM said.\n\n\"We call on Albania footballer Mirlind Daku to publicly apologise for his behaviour, recognising the damage he has caused. UEFA said it had also opened an investigation into the Daku's alleged inappropriate behaviour.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Football Association of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Federation_of_Macedonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football Federation of Macedonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Federation_of_Kosovo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football Federation of Kosovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirlind_Daku", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mirlind Daku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neutral country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonians_(ethnic_group)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macedonians (ethnic group)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic_Study", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic Study", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/29_05_2024_16_37_59_3315602.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667306", "eventUri": "eng-9667306", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 456620802, "relevance": 2}

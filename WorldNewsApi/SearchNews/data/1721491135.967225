Australia has been reluctant to allow greater investment by China in the critical minerals sector, frustrating Beijing. Earlier this month, Treasurer Jim Chalmers ordered a China-linked investor to divest its stake in a rare earths miner. A polarizing security environment in the Asia-Pacific between Beijing and Washington has driven countries like Australia to try to diversify away from reliance on China for key minerals and metals. Beijing has only recently lifted most of its restrictions on some Australian exports that were imposed when relations hit rock-bottom in 2020. Frank Ha, chief executive of Tianqi Lithium Corp., said his firm expects a level playing field when it comes to foreign investment decisions on critical minerals, according to an interview published in the Australian Financial Review on Monday. Li and Albanese will tour a Tianqi lithium hydroxide plant in Perth on Tuesday morning, the AFR reported.", "summary": "The gulf between Beijing and Canberra over Chinese investment in Australia\u2019s critical minerals industry is expected to take center-stage on the final day of Premier Li Qiang\u2019s visit, when he joins Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the western mining capital of Perth.", "url": "https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/china-australia-critical-mineral-tensions-in-spotlight-as-li-qiang-visits-perth", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/no0617boc.jpg?quality=5&strip=all&w=100&sig=wJiSwmrlU6viRD91fK1YDA", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:07:50", "author": "Bloomberg News", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "CA", "sentiment": -0.149}

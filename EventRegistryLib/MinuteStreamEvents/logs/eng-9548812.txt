The reason: misbehaving foreign tourists.\n\n\"Kawaguchiko is a town built on tourism, and I welcome many visitors, and the town welcomes them too, but there are many things about their manners that are worrying,\" said Michie Motomochi, owner of a cafe serving Japanese sweets \"ohagi,\" near the soon-to-be-blocked photo spot.\n\nMotomochi mentioned littering, crossing the road with busy traffic, ignoring traffic lights, trespassing into private properties. She isn't unhappy though -- 80% of her customers are foreign visitors whose numbers have surged after a pandemic hiatus that kept Japan closed for about two years.\n\nHer neighborhood suddenly became a popular spot about two years ago, apparently after a photo taken in a particular angle showing Mount Fuji in the background, as if sitting atop a local convenience store, became a social media sensation known as \"Mt. Fuji Lawson,\" town officials say.\n\nThe mostly foreign tourists have since crowded the small area, triggering a wave of concerns and complaints from residents about visitors blocking the narrow sidewalk, taking photos on the busy road or walking into neighbors' properties, officials said.\n\nIn Europe, concerns over tourists overcrowding historic cities led Venice last week to launch a pilot program to charge day-trippers a 5-euro ($5.35) entry fee. Authorities hope it will discourage visitors from arriving on peak days and make the city more livable for its dwindling residents.\n\nFujikawaguchiko has tried other methods: signs urging visitors not to run into the road and to use the designated crosswalk in English, Chinese, Thai and Korean, and even hiring a security guard as crowd control. None worked.\n\nThe black mesh net, when completed in mid-May, will be 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) high and 20 meters (65.6 feet) long, and will almost completely block the view of Mount Fuji, officials said.\n\nDozens of tourists gathered Tuesday taking photos even though Mount Fuji was not in sight due to cloudy weather.\n\nAnthony Hok, from France, thought the screen was an overreaction. \"Too big solution for subject not as big, even if tourists are making trouble. Doesn't look right to me,\" he said. The 26-year-old suggested setting up road barriers for safety instead of blocking views for pictures.\n\nBut Helen Pull, a 34-year-old visitor from the U.K., was sympathetic to the local concern. While traveling in Japan in the past few weeks, she has seen tourism \"really ramped up here in Japan from what we've seen.\"\n\n\"I can see why people who live and work here might want to do something about that,\" she said, noting many were taking pictures even when the mountain was not in the view. \"That's the power of the social media.\"\n\nForeign visitors have flocked to Japan since the pandemic border restrictions were lifted, in part due to the weaker yen.\n\nLast year, Japan had more than 25 million visitors, and the number this year is expected to surpass nearly 32 million, a record from 2019, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. And the government wants more tourists.\n\nWhile the booming tourism has helped the industry, it has triggered complaints from residents in popular tourist destinations, such as Kyoto and Kamakura. In Kyoto, a famous geisha district recently decided to close some private-property alleys.\n\nLocals are uncertain about what to do.\n\nMotomochi said she cannot imagine how the black screen can help control the flow of people on the narrow pedestrian walk and the road next to it.\n\nYoshihiko Ogawa, who runs a more than half-century-old rice shop in the Fujikawaguchiko area, said the overcrowding worsened in the past few months, with tourists gathering from around 4-5 a.m. and talking loudly. He sometimes struggles to get his car in and out of garage.\n\n\"We've never thought we'd face a situation like this,\" Ogawa said, adding he is unsure what the solution might be. \"I suppose we all just need to get used to it.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "sunstar.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun.Star Network Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@sunstar.com.ph", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujikawaguchiko", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fujikawaguchiko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mount Fuji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botamochi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botamochi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Litter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_light", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traffic light"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamakura", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamakura"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kamakura"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_National_Tourism_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan National Tourism Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geisha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyoto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kyoto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/sunstar%2F2024-05%2F358137e1-c86f-4eb8-8fd4-67b18a560cc9%2FAP24121262209188.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C1024%2C538&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548812", "eventUri": "eng-9548812", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

The town in Yamanashi prefecture is well known among tourists due to its location at the beginning of one of the most popular hiking trails up Mount Fuji - and, now, for its beautiful views of the mountain.\n\nTourists have flooded into Fujikawaguchiko to take one specific picture - a shot of Mount Fuji behind a Lawson's store, where the mountain's classic elegance contrasts with the store's modern neon signage.\n\nThis photo vantage spot has become so popular that Fujikawaguchiko is now taking a drastic step - erecting a barrier to block the view of the mountain to deter would-be picture-takers.\n\nAlthough Lawson's has not encouraged visitors to take pictures of its store, the company nevertheless issued a statement addressing the issue on May 5.\n\n\"We offer our sincere apologies to local residents, customers of these stores, and others for inciting inconvenience and concern due to the popularization of the Lawson Kawaguchiko Station Branch,\" the statement reads.\n\nAnd while the town of Fujikawaguchiko is already building the eight-foot-tall barrier that will go up behind the store, Lawson's says it will take its own steps to prevent bad tourist behavior by putting up signs in multiple languages that warn visitors against littering, blocking traffic and more.\n\nIn addition, Lawson's says it has considered hiring private security to manage the store and surrounding area.\n\nWhile simply taking a picture may not seem like a life-altering issue, officials recently told CNN the huge increase in tourists - and their attendant bad behavior - has wreaked havoc on tiny Fujikawaguchiko.\n\nDuring peak season, it is common for the town to have three times as many visitors as residents.\n\nMany of the photographers who set up their gear in front of Lawson's leave trash, prevent residents from moving around freely, and stand in the road, which can block traffic and cause accidents, said an unnamed official. Several owners of businesses near the Lawson's went to the city council with complaints.\n\nFujikawaguchiko is one of many places in Japan coping with overtourism. The country fully reopened post-pandemic in late 2022, leading to a surge of rescheduled trips and \"revenge travel.\"\n\nMarch 2024 was Japan's highest tourism month on record, with the country welcoming more than three million travelers. Many of them headed to the same destinations, crowding Kyoto's narrow streets and the walking trails of Mount Fuji.\n\nThe damage to Mount Fuji, called Fuji-san in Japanese, has been so significant that local leaders are pushing for stronger measures to regulate tourism at the UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nIn 2023, a Yamanashi prefectural government official told CNN that overtourism was the single biggest problem on Fuji-san. In addition to the sheer number of additional bodies, he expressed concern about the problems that come along with more visitors, including erosion, litter, increased carbon emissions and environmental damage caused by hikers who go off marked trails.\n\nAnd Lawson's is not the only Japanese tourist destination that has resorted to putting up signs warning visitors of bad behaviors.\n\nIn Kyoto's historic Gion neighborhood, throngs of tourists cramming the tiny alleys in hopes of spotting a geisha on her way to work have caused clashes between visitors and locals. The local Gion council has put up signs and handed out brochures explaining that behaviors like following geisha, taking pictures of them without asking permission and pulling on their kimonos are disrespectful, but \"geisha paparazzi\" continues regardless.\n\nNo one has a perfect answer for how Japan can cope with overtourism.

Visitors have caused issues like littering and unsafe crossing. While some welcome the safety measure, others lament the loss of the iconic view. The barrier aims to maintain order amidst growing overtourism challenges.A small Japanese town has started building a barrier to block the view of Mount Fuji, the country's most iconic sight, in response to complaints about bad behaviour from tourists. Fujikawaguchiko town is erecting panels of mesh netting at a popular photo spot where tourists gather to capture images of the majestic mountain behind a Lawson convenience store.\n\nThe location has gained notoriety among tourists, with photographs taken from a narrow stretch of pavement across a busy road from the Lawson store frequently shared on social media. However, the constant influx of visitors has caused issues such as crossing streets unsafely, ignoring red lights, littering, trespassing, illegally parking, and smoking in non-designated areas.\n\nLocal officials and residents expressed concern about these behaviours, despite the town's welcoming attitude towards visitors. A nearby dentist's office reported that tourists sometimes react aggressively when asked to move their cars, with some throwing lit cigarettes on the ground.\n\nTo address these problems, the town has decided to construct a barrier that will be 2.5 metres (8 feet) high and stretch more than 20 metres long. The barrier aims to discourage tourists from loitering at this specific location, with completion expected by the middle of the month.\n\n(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)\n\nThis action has generated significant attention in Japan and internationally, as Japan faces increasing challenges with overtourism at popular sites like the narrow alleys of Kyoto and trails on Mount Fuji. The barrier has sparked criticism, leading to a flood of calls to the Fujikawaguchiko town hall from people opposing the move, many of whom are non-local residents.\n\n\"It's not that we don't want people to see Mount Fuji,\" a town official told AFP. \"The issue is that there are so many people who are not able to observe basic rules.\"\n\nArea residents and some tourists expressed mixed feelings about the barrier, acknowledging the need for safety and order, while lamenting the loss of a prime view of Mount Fuji. Watanabe, a 60-year-old local resident, remarked, \"We welcome foreigners for the revitalization of the community, but there are so many violations of basic manners.\" She added, \"Having that barrier is very unfortunate, but it might be necessary.\"\n\nWhile some tourists understand the reason behind the barrier, others believe it might not effectively deter visitors. Trinity Robinson, a 29-year-old Australian tourist, said, \"Stop people? I don't think so because when there is a will, there is a way. People will just be on the left or right side of it.\" Robinson suggested that the barrier might make the area even more dangerous as tourists seek ways to get the perfect shot.\n\nAs a potential solution, locals recommend that visitors explore other scenic locations in the area. Ama, a 37-year-old local, said, \"Mount Fuji from here (near the Lawson shop) is fantastic. But there are so many other places around here where you can visit and see beautiful views.\"\n\nThe town's effort to curb bad tourist behaviour with the barrier illustrates the ongoing challenges that popular tourist destinations face as they navigate the delicate balance between welcoming visitors and maintaining public safety and order.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujikawaguchiko", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fujikawaguchiko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mount Fuji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Litter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyoto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kyoto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ama,_Aichi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ama, Aichi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ama, Aichi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Urban_Exploration", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Urban Exploration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-109950903,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-1535874,overlay-etnri/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548812", "eventUri": "eng-9548812", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

It sits on Japan's main island of Honshu, southwest of Tokyo. The community is known for having good spots for taking pictures of Mount Fuji.\n\nBut some locals and business owners feel there are too many misbehaving tourists. In an effort to reduce the number of visitors, city workers have started building a large black screen to block views of Mount Fuji.\n\nMichie Motomochi owns a restaurant that serves Japanese sweets near the soon-to-be-blocked photo spot. She told The Associated Press that while she welcomes visitors to the area, \"there are many things about their manners that are worrying.\"\n\nMotomochi said she has seen visitors crossing the road in busy traffic, leaving waste on streets, ignoring stop lights and trespassing onto private property.\n\nShe noted, however, that about 80 percent of her business is driven by foreign visitors. Tourist numbers have been rising in Japan since restrictions were lifted after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMotomochi said her neighborhood suddenly became a popular spot for visitors about two years ago. That is when a photo taken in the area went viral on the internet. The photo showed Mount Fuji in the background. But it appeared as though the mountain was sitting on top of a local store called Lawson.\n\nTown officials say the photo was widely shared on social media and became known online as \"Mt. Fuji Lawson.\" Since then, foreign tourists have crowded the neighborhood.\n\nThe town has tried other methods to limit bad behaviors by tourists. The town put up signs in several languages urging visitors not to run into the road. It has provided information about crosswalks. And it even hired security guards\n\nThe black screen is expected to be completed in the middle of May. It will stand 2.5 meters high and 20 meters long. Officials say the barrier will almost completely block the view of Mount Fuji.\n\nFrench tourist Anthony Hok told the AP he thinks the screen was an overreaction by city officials. He said the solution seemed \"too big\" for the problem the town was facing. The 26-year-old visitor suggested setting up road barriers for safety instead of blocking views for pictures.\n\nBut Helen Pull, a 34-year-old visitor from Britain, said she understood the local concerns. She said she had seen tourism \"really ramped up\" in the country. \"I can see why people who live and work here might want to do something about that,\" Pull added.\n\nYoshihiko Ogawa runs an old rice shop in the Fujikawaguchiko area. He said overcrowding there had worsened in recent months, with tourists gathering from around 4 or 5 in the morning and talking loudly.

trying to stop the chaos at popular spots", "body": "After fears that tourist numbers would never return to pre-pandemic levels, it may now be a case of too much of a good thing for Japan.\n\nA combination of a weak yen, more affordable airfares, the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions and \"revenge travel\" has led to monthly visitors to Japan hitting a record high.\n\nOver-tourism is now such a problem for one Japanese town it has erected a barrier to block snow-capped views of Mount Fuji, after locals complained about the bad behaviour of selfie-seeking visitors.\n\nSo, what measures have been implemented to curb over-tourism?\n\nOver-tourism happens when so many visitors are attracted to an area that life becomes unpleasant for the locals, despite any economic or other ostensible benefits.\n\nOne of Japan's busiest tourist periods of the year ended on Monday.\n\nGolden Week -- which ran from April 27 to May 5 -- coincided with multiple public holidays and near-perfect spring weather.\n\nTo help deal with all the international tourists in the country during one of Japan's busiest periods, authorities have tried a range of measures.\n\nIn Kamakura, a popular temple city, English-speaking guides have been helping to direct tourists to stop them obstructing busy train stations, according to Nikkei.\n\nKyoto's traditional neighbourhood, Gion, recently banned visitors from its small private alleys.\n\nLocals had complained of snap-happy tourists harassing the city's immaculately attired geisha, who had to remind them it was \"not a theme park\".\n\nAuthorities in Kyoto have also reportedly installed screens at the main train station showing live feeds of tourist areas so visitors can assess crowds and plan their trips better.\n\nMany people visit the small, scenic Japanese town of Fujikawaguchiko in Yamanashi Prefecture, causing chaos on local streets while trying to photograph Mount Fuji.\n\nAuthorities said they had had enough of the excessive number of foreigners littering, ignoring traffic regulations and even climbing on roofs of office buildings in search of the perfect selfie spot.\n\nExasperated town officials eventually blocked the view of Mount Fuji with a 2.5-metre-high black barrier.\n\nHikers using the most popular route to climb Mount Fuji, where the climbing season begins in July, will be charged 2,000 yen ($19.50).\n\nNumbers will be capped.\n\nThe January earthquake in the western prefecture of Ishikawa had minimal impact on 2024 arrivals, according to the Japan National Tourism Organisation (JNTO).\n\nTourist numbers have quickly rebounded, and apart from Australia, Japan has had a large influx of visitors from South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong.\n\nStreet Kart, which offers rides for tourists in Tokyo, Okinawa and Osaka, said most were from Australia, the US, Canada and the UK -- with decent numbers from Europe and Asia.\n\n\"The demand for our activity has risen significantly [this year] in conjunction with the increase of visitors to Japan,\" Ms Ishido told the ABC.\n\nHowever, tourism from China has stayed well below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe JNTO said visitors from China, which had made up nearly a third of all visitors and 40 per cent of tourist spending, were slowly returning.\n\nThe April numbers aren't out yet, but in March, visitors to Japan hit a record high of 3.08 million visitors, according to the JNTO.\n\nThe previous record of 2.99 million was set in July 2019 during a year that Japan welcomed a record 31.9 million visitors.\n\nIt's a stark contrast from the early days of the pandemic, when Tokyo banned spectators from the postponed Olympics in 2021.\n\nTourists have been making the most of Japan's weak yen, which fell to a three-decade low against the US dollar last month.\n\nEven Australia's faltering currency still has buying power in Japan, with one dollar converting to almost 102 yen, up more than 10 per cent from a year ago.\n\nA hearty dinner on Tokyo's famous Ramen Street will set you back around 1,080 yen ($10.60) while a bus ride in Kyoto costs 230 yen ($2.66) -- both cheaper than Australia's capital cities.\n\nOver-tourism has also affected other popular Asian destinations, like Bali and Thailand, with international travel returning to normal after the pandemic.\n\nA new $15 tourism tax was introduced to Bail in February, after a series of incidents involving visitors desecrating holy sites and behaving badly.\n\nIn Thailand's Maya Bay, which was made famous by The Beach, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, a maximum of 375 visitors are allowed at one time.\n\nEven though access had earlier been restricted and it was later closed for three years, an estimated 80 per cent of the coral reefs there died due to over-tourism.\n\nWhile there are plenty of plans to restrict and control tourist numbers, not everyone in Japan is sick of all the foreign visitors.\n\nMs Ishido from Street Kart said there was no such thing as having too many tourists and that everyone was welcome.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"},

The town in Yamanashi prefecture is well known among tourists due to its location at the beginning of one of the most popular hiking trails up Mount Fuji - and, now, for its beautiful views of the mountain.\n\nTourists have flooded into Fujikawaguchiko to take one specific picture - a shot of Mount Fuji behind a Lawson's store, where the mountain's classic elegance contrasts with the store's modern neon signage.\n\nThis photo vantage spot has become so popular that Fujikawaguchiko is now taking a drastic step - erecting a barrier to block the view of the mountain to deter erstwhile picture-takers.\n\nAlthough Lawson's has not encouraged visitors to take pictures of their store, the company nevertheless issued a statement addressing the issue on May 5.\n\n\"We offer our sincere apologies to local residents, customers of these stores, and others for inciting inconvenience and concern due to the popularization of the Lawson Kawaguchiko Station Branch,\" the statement reads.\n\nAnd while the town of Fujikawaguchiko is already building the eight-foot-tall barrier that will go up behind the store, Lawson's says it will take its own steps to prevent bad tourist behavior by putting up signs in multiple languages that warn visitors against littering, blocking traffic and more.\n\nIn addition, Lawson's says it has considered hiring private security to manage the store and surrounding area.\n\nWhile simply taking a picture may not seem like a life-altering issue, officials recently told CNN the huge increase in tourists - and their attendant bad behavior - has wreaked havoc on tiny Fujikawaguchiko.\n\nDuring peak season, it is common for the town to have three times as many visitors as residents.\n\nAnd many of the photographers who set up their gear in front of Lawson's leave trash, prevent residents from moving around freely, and stand in the road, which can block traffic and cause accidents, said an unnamed official. Several owners of businesses near the Lawson's went to the city council with complaints.\n\nFujikawaguchiko is one of many places in Japan coping with overtourism. The country fully reopened post-pandemic in late 2022, leading to a surge of rescheduled trips and \"revenge travel.\"\n\nMarch 2024 was Japan's highest tourism month on record, with the country welcoming more than three million travelers. Many of them headed to the same destinations, crowding Kyoto's narrow streets and the walking trails of Mount Fuji.\n\nThe damage to Mount Fuji, called Fuji-san in Japanese, has been so significant that local leaders are pushing for stronger measures to regulate tourism at the UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nIn 2023, a Yamanashi prefectural government official told CNN that overtourism was the single biggest problem on Fuji-san. In addition to the sheer number of additional bodies, he expressed concern about the problems that come along with more visitors, including erosion, litter, increased carbon emissions and environmental damage caused by hikers who go off marked trails.\n\nAnd Lawson's is not the only Japanese tourist destination that has resorted to putting up signs warning visitors of bad behaviors.\n\nIn Kyoto's historic Gion neighborhood, throngs of tourists cramming the tiny alleys in hopes of spotting a geisha on her way to work have caused clashes between visitors and locals. The local Gion council has put up signs and handed out brochures explaining that behaviors like following geisha, taking pictures of them without asking permission and pulling on their kimonos are disrespectful, but \"geisha paparazzi\" continues regardless.\n\nNo one has a perfect answer for how Japan can cope with overtourism. But Fujikawaguchiko expects to have its picture-blocking barrier in place by the end of the month.\n\nEditor's Note: CNN's Himari Semans contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lilit_marcus@cnn.com", "name": "Lilit Marcus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujikawaguchiko", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fujikawaguchiko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mount Fuji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanashi_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yamanashi Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yamanashi Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaguchiko_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kawaguchiko Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Litter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geisha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyoto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kyoto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourist_attraction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourist attraction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prefectures of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimono", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimono"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hiking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erosion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Retail", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2149632669.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548812", "eventUri": "eng-9548812", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 1133, "textEnd": 1138}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Fuji as a tourist attraction has brought benefits to the area but also trouble to the lives of the residents there. The situation has prompted local governments and companies to implement, however reluctantly, such extreme measures as installing a large black curtain to block the view of the mountain from outside a local convenience store.\n\nCrowds of tourist flocked to Mt. Fuji during the Golden Week holidays from the end of April to early May to catch a glimpse of the iconic mountain that is famous among Japanese and non-Japanese alike.\n\n\"Don't cross the street!\" a guard yelled from the front of the Kawaguchiko-ekimae Lawson convenient store in the town of Fuji-Kawaguchiko in Yamanashi Prefecture on April 29.\n\nThe sidewalk across the street provides a unique view of Mt. Fuji: It looks as if the mountain is perched atop the roof of the convenient store. Groups of non-Japanese tourists were seen weaving themselves between cars to cross the street before holding their smartphones up toward the store and the mountain. There were dozens of them.\n\n\"I make a detour to avoid this place because it'd be horrible if I caused an accident,\" said a worried-looking resident of the town, 83, who often drives through the area. \"It's scary. I don't want to drive here.\"\n\nAccording to the town, the area became a popular tourist spot when an overseas influencer introduced it to the world on social media around the autumn in 2022. The town was happy at first to be home to another tourist attraction. However, the number of people who rushed to the place was so high that the town decided to to hide the view of Mt. Fuji behind a 2.5-meter-tall blackout net, which it hung along a 20-meter stretch of the pavement. The town's tourist department called the decision \"a reluctant decision aimed at ensuring the safety of tourists.\" Work on setting up the curtain started on April 30 and is expected to be completed in late May.\n\nA Polish man in his 20s came to the spot after seeing pictures of it on social media. He said the view of Mt. Fuji atop the building was amazing, but setting up the curtain might have been inevitable, seeing how the place got so overcrowded.\n\nOn May 4, Lawson, Inc. of Tokyo put up a sign in Chinese, Thai and other languages in front of the Kawaguchiko-ekimae store, notifying visitors not to cross the street in front of the store.", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp", "dataType": "news", "title": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mount Fuji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u014dfu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K\u014dfu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "K\u014dfu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Week_(Japan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden Week (Japan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourist_attraction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourist attraction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japanese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weaving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanashi_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yamanashi Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yamanashi Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawson_(store)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawson (store)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chinese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Urban_Exploration", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Urban Exploration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Unicycling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Unicycling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mt-Fuji-curtain-ONLINE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548812", "eventUri": "eng-9548812", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "K\u014dfu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 760, "textEnd": 768}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1925, "textEnd": 1933}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 2226, "textEnd": 2231}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}
